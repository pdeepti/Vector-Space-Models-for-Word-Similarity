but some say the french want to have their cake and eat it . in his victory speech on may 6 , 2007 , sarkozy told thousands of people : " i do n't have the right to disappoint the country . "
but a year on , that 's exactly what the french president has done .
just over one third of the population say they support the new president , compared with some two-thirds 12 months ago .
to begin with , french voters were shocked by his hardly statesman-like behaviour with model carla bruni whom he married just weeks after divorcing his second wife cecilia in october .

in march , french inflation rates reached a 17-year high of 3.2 percent .
in part , this was just bad luck .
the beginning of the president 's term in office also coincided with the onset of the global financial crisis and rocketing oil prices , helping to drive prices up .
the jury also seems to be out over the success of the flurry of reforms that he has introduced .
some analysts have praised his easing of france 's 35-hour week , his reduction of pension benefits and his reforms of the country 's overcrowded and impoverished universities .
" sarkozy had the courage to do what other presidents did n't , " philippe braud , a professor at the sciences po institute in paris , told afp news agency .
" his track record is not to be underestimated even if the french are n't convinced , " he added .

braud also pointed to sarkozy 's achievement in streamlining france 's notoriously complicated labor laws .
the jobless rate has dropped to 7.5 percent , the lowest level in two decades , since he took office .
however , he said the president had announced too many projects at once and then not been able to deliver .
bruno jeanbart , of the opinionway polling institute , is of a similar opinion .
he praised sarkozy 's reform zeal , but also told afp that " there are also many areas he engaged in but in which he was perhaps too optimistic or has not followed through . "
he named these as spending power and the country 's public deficit .
other observers are more critical , saying that he bought the highly symbolic abolition of early pensions for civil servants by making expensive concessions and that rigid labor market structures remain largely untouched despite the shift away from a 35-hour week .
" he took over a country that was feeling insecure and which regarded him as the last chance to solve their structural problems , " said the political scientist dominique moisi .
" he failed to convince the french and offer them security . " a parliamentary report released this month also described as both costly and ineffective one of sarkozy 's flagship reforms , aimed at boosting incomes with a tax break on overtime pay .
the french conservative newspaper le figaro criticizes sarkozy only insofar as he did not make sufficiently clear that the changes would hurt .
" the french approve of the reforms of nicolas sarkozy , but condemn the reformer .

france - which is set to take over the rotating eu presidency in july - is also facing mounting pressure from other european union member states to slash its total public deficit of around 1.2 trillion euros .
he also knows that backing down from his reform program would cost him his remaining credibility .

but some say the french want to have their cake and eat it . in his victory speech on may 6 , 2007 , sarkozy told thousands of people : " i do n't have the right to disappoint the country . "
but a year on , that 's exactly what the french president has done .
just over one third of the population say they support the new president , compared with some two-thirds 12 months ago .
to begin with , french voters were shocked by his hardly statesman-like behaviour with model carla bruni whom he married just weeks after divorcing his second wife cecilia in october .
he gave the impression of a man with his mind on ... well , on other things than the business of government .
beset by economic troubles and questions of style bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : sarkozy 's apparently whirlwind romance with carla bruni attracted negative publicity now the country is getting hit in the pocket and sarkozy is getting the blame .
he had pledged to boost spending power in his election campaign .
instead , it has dropped .
in march , french inflation rates reached a 17-year high of 3.2 percent .
in part , this was just bad luck .
the beginning of the president 's term in office also coincided with the onset of the global financial crisis and rocketing oil prices , helping to drive prices up .
the jury also seems to be out over the success of the flurry of reforms that he has introduced .
some analysts have praised his easing of france 's 35-hour week , his reduction of pension benefits and his reforms of the country 's overcrowded and impoverished universities .
" sarkozy had the courage to do what other presidents did n't , " philippe braud , a professor at the sciences po institute in paris , told afp news agency .
" his track record is not to be underestimated even if the french are n't convinced , " he added .
unemployment levels at historic low bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the president 's reforms sparked strikes among civil servants and railway workers in november .
braud also pointed to sarkozy 's achievement in streamlining france 's notoriously complicated labor laws .
the jobless rate has dropped to 7.5 percent , the lowest level in two decades , since he took office .
however , he said the president had announced too many projects at once and then not been able to deliver .
bruno jeanbart , of the opinionway polling institute , is of a similar opinion .
he praised sarkozy 's reform zeal , but also told afp that " there are also many areas he engaged in but in which he was perhaps too optimistic or has not followed through . "
he named these as spending power and the country 's public deficit .
other observers are more critical , saying that he bought the highly symbolic abolition of early pensions for civil servants by making expensive concessions and that rigid labor market structures remain largely untouched despite the shift away from a 35-hour week .
" he took over a country that was feeling insecure and which regarded him as the last chance to solve their structural problems , " said the political scientist dominique moisi .
" he failed to convince the french and offer them security . " a parliamentary report released this month also described as both costly and ineffective one of sarkozy 's flagship reforms , aimed at boosting incomes with a tax break on overtime pay .
the french conservative newspaper le figaro criticizes sarkozy only insofar as he did not make sufficiently clear that the changes would hurt .
" the french approve of the reforms of nicolas sarkozy , but condemn the reformer .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de media -pipe- 06.05.2008 germany 's market busting tv star raab goes global großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : raab 's desire to win makes him an ideal competitor - and entertainment mogul imported shows have long been a staple of german tv , but the reverse is rarely true .
now a game show created by an unlikely , if ubiquitous , german tv personality is taking foreign markets by storm . can an irreverent former butcher named stefan raab save german entertainment ?
so far , 12 countries have bought the adaptation rights to a german game show called " schlag den raab , " or " beat raab . "
the latest to sign on were croatia and denmark .
a uk version is currently in production and will air this spring .
the foreign title is " beat your host ; " the uk version is called " beat the star . " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : try beating raab at this as the original title implies , the german version involves pitting a selected contestant against 42-year-old stefan raab , a talk-show host and sort-of comedian who is arguably germany ’ s most ubiquitous television personality .
the contestant tries to beat raab in a marathon four- to five-hour competition that encompasses up to 15 varied disciplines , from the physical -lrb- box stacking , ice climbing , -rrb- to the mental -lrb- poker playing , knowledge quiz -rrb- to the silly -lrb- dropping peas into a bottle . -rrb- at stake : a heap of cash . the uk version , produced by a company called itv , will pit contestants against a changing array of stars , and the contest has been shortened to last just over an hour .
the german show was the most successful new start last year , pulling viewer ratings of around 31 percent of those aged 14 to 49 . whether the same ratings dream will come true for itv , as it has for raab 's german production firm brainpool , remains to be seen .
nonetheless , raab has managed to achieve something with this show that has been done only a handful of times in german tv history : crossing over to a broad international audience . the rapid ascent of stefan raab " most successful german tv shows are strongly based on regional identities , " said joan bleicher , professor for media studies at the university of hamburg .
" it just would n't translate to an international audience . " but the success of raab 's latest endeavor is unlikely to surprise anyone who has kept an eye on the german entertainment scene for the past decade . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : beat the raab is one of germany 's most successful tv shows raab 's rise on german television can only be described as meteoric .
as a vj on an german music-video channel viva in 1996 , he set himself apart with his ironic , often rude humor .
his irreverence quickly won him the admiration of germany ’ s youth . in 1999 he became host of a show he created , " tv total , " which still runs four nights a week .
it focuses on ridiculing television while pairing raab as a chat host with entertainers and musicians - often on the a-list - who perform live on his show . derisive humor a hit among youth but unlike most chat-show hosts , whose job descriptions fairly demand neutrality , raab is n't urbane or fawning . bulky and goateed , he looks a little bit like the butcher that he trained to be in his youth .
he is neither handsome nor well dressed , and is mostly found wearing jeans , untucked shirts , sneakers and a self-satisfied grin . raab also does n't shy from unleashing his derisive humor on the stars who take a seat on his couch , " which makes the youth market love him , " says university of hamburg 's bleicher . indeed , his brash and boorish style tends to divide the audience into " love him " and " hate him " camps , with the deciding factor apparently being age .
the fault line falls somewhere around age 30 . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : love him or hate him , there 's no escaping him " raab is very popular with people from 12 to 29 , " bleicher said .
" it 's what the program planners are aiming for . " meanwhile , " older people ca n't stand him , " bleicher asserts .
" they think he is too aggressive , too ironic , unattractive . … he is simply rude . " of insults and lawsuits certainly raab has gotten into some well publicized hot water by ignoring the usual conventions of politesse .
he once famously ridiculed a 16-year-old model named lisa loch -lrb- in german " loch " means " hole " -rrb- saying her name could make her a porno star ; a court made him pay the teenager 70,000 euros -lrb- $ 108,000 -rrb- in damages . in a similar 2004 misstep , he showed a picture of a young turkish mother holding her child ’ s schoolbag , and quipped , " the drug traffickers are getting better and better at disguising themselves . "

now a game show created by an unlikely , if ubiquitous , german tv personality is taking foreign markets by storm . can an irreverent former butcher named stefan raab save german entertainment ?
so far , 12 countries have bought the adaptation rights to a german game show called " schlag den raab , " or " beat raab . "
the latest to sign on were croatia and denmark .
a uk version is currently in production and will air this spring .
the foreign title is " beat your host ; " the uk version is called " beat the star . " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : try beating raab at this as the original title implies , the german version involves pitting a selected contestant against 42-year-old stefan raab , a talk-show host and sort-of comedian who is arguably germany ’ s most ubiquitous television personality .
the contestant tries to beat raab in a marathon four- to five-hour competition that encompasses up to 15 varied disciplines , from the physical -lrb- box stacking , ice climbing , -rrb- to the mental -lrb- poker playing , knowledge quiz -rrb- to the silly -lrb- dropping peas into a bottle . -rrb- at stake : a heap of cash . the uk version , produced by a company called itv , will pit contestants against a changing array of stars , and the contest has been shortened to last just over an hour .
the german show was the most successful new start last year , pulling viewer ratings of around 31 percent of those aged 14 to 49 . whether the same ratings dream will come true for itv , as it has for raab 's german production firm brainpool , remains to be seen .
nonetheless , raab has managed to achieve something with this show that has been done only a handful of times in german tv history : crossing over to a broad international audience . the rapid ascent of stefan raab " most successful german tv shows are strongly based on regional identities , " said joan bleicher , professor for media studies at the university of hamburg .
" it just would n't translate to an international audience . " but the success of raab 's latest endeavor is unlikely to surprise anyone who has kept an eye on the german entertainment scene for the past decade . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : beat the raab is one of germany 's most successful tv shows raab 's rise on german television can only be described as meteoric .
as a vj on an german music-video channel viva in 1996 , he set himself apart with his ironic , often rude humor .
his irreverence quickly won him the admiration of germany ’ s youth . in 1999 he became host of a show he created , " tv total , " which still runs four nights a week .
it focuses on ridiculing television while pairing raab as a chat host with entertainers and musicians - often on the a-list - who perform live on his show . derisive humor a hit among youth but unlike most chat-show hosts , whose job descriptions fairly demand neutrality , raab is n't urbane or fawning . bulky and goateed , he looks a little bit like the butcher that he trained to be in his youth .
he is neither handsome nor well dressed , and is mostly found wearing jeans , untucked shirts , sneakers and a self-satisfied grin . raab also does n't shy from unleashing his derisive humor on the stars who take a seat on his couch , " which makes the youth market love him , " says university of hamburg 's bleicher . indeed , his brash and boorish style tends to divide the audience into " love him " and " hate him " camps , with the deciding factor apparently being age .
the fault line falls somewhere around age 30 . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : love him or hate him , there 's no escaping him " raab is very popular with people from 12 to 29 , " bleicher said .
" it 's what the program planners are aiming for . " meanwhile , " older people ca n't stand him , " bleicher asserts .
" they think he is too aggressive , too ironic , unattractive . … he is simply rude . " of insults and lawsuits certainly raab has gotten into some well publicized hot water by ignoring the usual conventions of politesse .
he once famously ridiculed a 16-year-old model named lisa loch -lrb- in german " loch " means " hole " -rrb- saying her name could make her a porno star ; a court made him pay the teenager 70,000 euros -lrb- $ 108,000 -rrb- in damages . in a similar 2004 misstep , he showed a picture of a young turkish mother holding her child ’ s schoolbag , and quipped , " the drug traffickers are getting better and better at disguising themselves .

now a game show created by an unlikely , if ubiquitous , german tv personality is taking foreign markets by storm . can an irreverent former butcher named stefan raab save german entertainment ?
so far , 12 countries have bought the adaptation rights to a german game show called " schlag den raab , " or " beat raab . "
the latest to sign on were croatia and denmark .
a uk version is currently in production and will air this spring .
the foreign title is " beat your host ; " the uk version is called " beat the star . " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : try beating raab at this as the original title implies , the german version involves pitting a selected contestant against 42-year-old stefan raab , a talk-show host and sort-of comedian who is arguably germany ’ s most ubiquitous television personality .
the contestant tries to beat raab in a marathon four- to five-hour competition that encompasses up to 15 varied disciplines , from the physical -lrb- box stacking , ice climbing , -rrb- to the mental -lrb- poker playing , knowledge quiz -rrb- to the silly -lrb- dropping peas into a bottle . -rrb- at stake : a heap of cash . the uk version , produced by a company called itv , will pit contestants against a changing array of stars , and the contest has been shortened to last just over an hour .
the german show was the most successful new start last year , pulling viewer ratings of around 31 percent of those aged 14 to 49 . whether the same ratings dream will come true for itv , as it has for raab 's german production firm brainpool , remains to be seen .
nonetheless , raab has managed to achieve something with this show that has been done only a handful of times in german tv history : crossing over to a broad international audience . the rapid ascent of stefan raab " most successful german tv shows are strongly based on regional identities , " said joan bleicher , professor for media studies at the university of hamburg .
" it just would n't translate to an international audience . " but the success of raab 's latest endeavor is unlikely to surprise anyone who has kept an eye on the german entertainment scene for the past decade . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : beat the raab is one of germany 's most successful tv shows raab 's rise on german television can only be described as meteoric .
as a vj on an german music-video channel viva in 1996 , he set himself apart with his ironic , often rude humor .
his irreverence quickly won him the admiration of germany ’ s youth . in 1999 he became host of a show he created , " tv total , " which still runs four nights a week .
it focuses on ridiculing television while pairing raab as a chat host with entertainers and musicians - often on the a-list - who perform live on his show . derisive humor a hit among youth but unlike most chat-show hosts , whose job descriptions fairly demand neutrality , raab is n't urbane or fawning . bulky and goateed , he looks a little bit like the butcher that he trained to be in his youth .
he is neither handsome nor well dressed , and is mostly found wearing jeans , untucked shirts , sneakers and a self-satisfied grin . raab also does n't shy from unleashing his derisive humor on the stars who take a seat on his couch , " which makes the youth market love him , " says university of hamburg 's bleicher . indeed , his brash and boorish style tends to divide the audience into " love him " and " hate him " camps , with the deciding factor apparently being age .
the fault line falls somewhere around age 30 . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : love him or hate him , there 's no escaping him " raab is very popular with people from 12 to 29 , " bleicher said .

" we 're prepared to move us navy assets to help find those who 've lost their lives , to help find the missing , to help stabilize the situation .

germany 's foreign ministry announced in berlin on monday , may 5 , that it would channel the pledged funds through german aid organizations .
the aid is intended to provide emergency accommodation , drinking water , household utensils and mosquito nets .

" we 're prepared to move us navy assets to help find those who 've lost their lives , to help find the missing , to help stabilize the situation .

however , the inclusion of some inductees with nazi connections stirred debate . the ambitious project , " a permanent celebration of our country 's greatest athletes , " according to the head of the german sport aid foundation , ann kathrin linsenhoff , will initially contain the names of 40 of germany 's sporting heroes , with potentially three to be added to the roll call every year .
the first sportsmen and women to enter the hall of fame , officially opened by president horst koehler and minister of the interior wolfgang schaeuble , were chosen by a 25-strong jury headed by schaeuble , which considered the nature of their sporting achievement , the legacy and impact of the person , their personal attributes and whether they were a good role model for future sports stars .

the first sportsmen and women to enter the hall of fame , officially opened by president horst koehler and minister of the interior wolfgang schaeuble , were chosen by a 25-strong jury headed by schaeuble , which considered the nature of their sporting achievement , the legacy and impact of the person , their personal attributes and whether they were a good role model for future sports stars .

one of its aims is to stop the far-right infiltrating sports ' clubs . " i 'm against nazis because they do n't appear to have learned anything from german history , " explains the german captain and chelsea midfielder in a 10-second soundbite on the web site netz-gegen-nazis -lrb- network against nazis -rrb- .
tv presenter marietta slomka and talk show host maybrit illner are among the other high-profile germans featured online . the interactive internet platform , launched by the german weekly newspaper die zeit on monday , may 5 , is at the heart of the project .
it contains extensive information about the subject - including up-to-date news reports about right-wing extremism - , a forum where users can seek advice and swap facts and links to advice centers and support groups .
" we 're aiming to create a nationwide forum where people who encounter far-right ideas in their day-to-day lives can give each other advice , " said giovanni di lorenzo , the newspaper 's editor-in-chief .
together we are strong bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : germany captain michael ballack is one of the campaign 's figureheads the weekly newspaper has joined forces with a number of other partners to forge the anti-far-right alliance .
the sporting organizations involved include the german olympic sports confederation -lrb- dosb -rrb- , the german soccer federation -lrb- dfb -rrb- and the german soccer league -lrb- dfl -rrb- .
media partners include the german broadcaster zdf and online portals , schuelervz , studivz and meinvz .
the involvement of the sporting bodies reflects rising concern about far-right parties using the cover of leisure activities to spread their ideas among young people , in particular .
" right-wing extremism poses a great threat to an association like the german soccer federation because of its clubs ' grass-roots and volunteer-based structures , " said the head of the dfb , theo zwanziger .
not just football tactics , but lessons for life bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : german soccer has already been involved in a number of anti-racist initiatives he added that the point of the network against nazis was to inform and to encourage civil courage .
" as well as teaching the one-two and the bicycle kick , we have to communicate the message that it is worthwhile living in a democratic state , " said zwanziger .
but it is not only the budding players who are being targeted ; he also mentioned special training sessions for coaches .
a number of high profile events will be taking place in games in both german football leagues on tuesday , may 6 , and wednesday , to publicize the initiative .
an ad featuring ballack 's soundbite will also be shown in all stadiums .
the dfb has also announced that the national squad would also be helping to spread this message in upcoming games against serbia and belarus . it did not reveal any further details .
ingo weiss , head of the german olympic sports confederation , said that it was about turning the 27 million or so dosb members into " vigilant lions " so that the horrors of the nazi era could never be repeated .
german integration minister maria boehmer welcomed the project .
in a statement she said that media and sport carried a particular responsibility in the fight against right-wing extremism and xenophobia because of their ability to reach a wide audience . dw staff -lrb- jg -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

but one thing is apparent : the regime is unwilling to delay its planned referendum on the constitution , says dw 's tobias grote-beverborg . once again myanmar , formerly known as burma , is making headlines .
but not due to the referendum on the constitution which is meant to decide the country 's political future and is scheduled for saturday , may 10 .
instead , the country ruled by a military dictatorship is in the news because of the natural disaster , whose full effect remains unknown . cyclone nargis left behind a massive swathe of destruction in the country 's south , above all .
at least 15,000 people have been killed , according to official figures , while hundreds of thousands of people have been made homeless and are in need of food , water and medication .
the people are in such desperate straits that even the hard-hearted military regime must recognize that it ca n't cope with the catastrophe without foreign aid . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : tobias grote-beverborg it 's still unclear under what conditions the regime is accepting the aid .
it is , however , clear that the cyclone has upset the dictatorship 's plans .
the planned referendum on the constitution was meant to ensure a continuation of military rule and it was supposed to be passed in the manner typical of a dictatorship , tacitly and closed off from the rest of the world .
in the limelight but now the eyes of the world are on burma and foreign aid workers may end up as unwelcome election observers .
the junta hopes to avoid that by holding the vote as soon as possible - that is , keeping it on saturday .
it 's only allowing postponement of the vote in the regions hardest hit by the cyclone .
the junta has once more shown how cynically calculating it is , seeing as in terms of logistics alone , the dimensions of the catastrophe make an orderly referendum impossible . how long the regime can keep this farce going also depends on the conditions under which aid - and aid workers - is allowed into the country .
the military leaders may of course hope they can rely on their neighbors ; india and china have already promised comprehensive aid measures .
and neither will meddle in burma 's " internal affairs , " just as they have n't in the past .
hopes of an aceh scenario however , as the number of victims increases and the need for aid for the survivors becomes ever more urgent , the junta can not afford to reject further aid from abroad .
the huge contingent of foreign aid workers who became a presence in aceh , indonesia , after the tsunami catastrophe nearly four years ago led to an end to the bloody civil war there .
parallels to the situation in myanmar come to mind . discontent is already growing among the burmese due to the military 's apparent failings .
for one , people were n't warned sufficiently or far enough in advance about the extent of the approaching cyclone .
and now , national aid measures are moving sluggishly . the referendum desperately needs to be postponed .
one can only hope the referendum on the constitution takes place at a later date with international observers and that there will be truly free and fair elections in myanmar .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de asia -pipe- 06.05.2008 india ’ s women ’ s reservation bill in limbo großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : women in india : waiting for a voice the indian government has succeeded in introducing in parliament a controversial legislation guaranteeing a third of its seats for women .
the long-delayed women 's reservation bill was tabled in the rajya sabha or upper house of parliament amid dramatic scenes and protests by mps belonging to some parties . the bill ensures one in three mps will be a woman but there is still a long way to go before this becomes law as the lack of consensus among india ’ s parliamentarians has ensured that the legislation remains in cold storage .
agitated members from the samajwadi party tried to snatch the bill copy from law minister h r bhardwaj tuesday but congress members intervened and formed a human chain thus allowing the controversial bill to be introduced .
soon after it was presented in the rajya sabha or upper house of parliament amid high drama , the left parties that prop up the ruling united progressive alliance , were happy that the first hurdle for initiating the bill had been taken .
support from the left brinda karat , a leftist mp from the rajya sabha said that the standing committee should clear it within a specific timeframe and send it back to parliament .
“ there were scenes , there was opposition but it should not conceal the reality that there is a vast majority in favour of the bill .
that is what we have been saying .
we are very happy that the government has taken the first step to crossing the first hurdle to the bill .

soon after it was presented in the rajya sabha or upper house of parliament amid high drama , the left parties that prop up the ruling united progressive alliance , were happy that the first hurdle for initiating the bill had been taken .
support from the left brinda karat , a leftist mp from the rajya sabha said that the standing committee should clear it within a specific timeframe and send it back to parliament .
“ there were scenes , there was opposition but it should not conceal the reality that there is a vast majority in favour of the bill .
that is what we have been saying .
we are very happy that the government has taken the first step to crossing the first hurdle to the bill .
and what we also want now is that the standing committee should finalise the bill in the shortest possible time . ”
the bill was first introduced in 1996 , by former prime minister deve gowda but his government could never muster political support for its passage .
the national democratic alliance government too tried during its tenure but failed to find enough support among the political parties .
even among the upa constituents today , there is no consensus and an attempt by prime minister manmohan singh to arrive at an agreement has proved futile .
calls for separate reservations some of the political groups blocking the bill have demanded separate reservations for women from muslim and dalit or low-caste communities .
abu azmi of the samajwadi party who tried to snatch the bill copy says his party will oppose the introduction of the bill unless weaker sections are included . “ we are opposing the bill .
in what manner they have brought the bill ?
we are opposing it .
and we will continue to do so till where ?
until we get reservation for ladies dalit , obcs and muslims ” so the step towards gender justice , howsoever tentative and lacking any real support in the ruling coalition , might take quite a while .
political columnist monobina gupta explains , “ it will take a lot of courage and political will to restore the gender imbalance which is now evident in parliament .
at present barring two parties all others – centrist , leftist and rightist are publicly supporting the bill on the floor of parliament .
but in private all of them are scared that the male members and parties dominated by men , they would some time or the other lose their seats to women if 33 per cent reservation comes into effect . ”

the long-delayed women 's reservation bill was tabled in the rajya sabha or upper house of parliament amid dramatic scenes and protests by mps belonging to some parties . the bill ensures one in three mps will be a woman but there is still a long way to go before this becomes law as the lack of consensus among india ’ s parliamentarians has ensured that the legislation remains in cold storage .
agitated members from the samajwadi party tried to snatch the bill copy from law minister h r bhardwaj tuesday but congress members intervened and formed a human chain thus allowing the controversial bill to be introduced .
soon after it was presented in the rajya sabha or upper house of parliament amid high drama , the left parties that prop up the ruling united progressive alliance , were happy that the first hurdle for initiating the bill had been taken .

“ there were scenes , there was opposition but it should not conceal the reality that there is a vast majority in favour of the bill .
that is what we have been saying .
we are very happy that the government has taken the first step to crossing the first hurdle to the bill .

in what manner they have brought the bill ?
we are opposing it .

political columnist monobina gupta explains , “ it will take a lot of courage and political will to restore the gender imbalance which is now evident in parliament .
at present barring two parties all others – centrist , leftist and rightist are publicly supporting the bill on the floor of parliament .

the long-delayed women 's reservation bill was tabled in the rajya sabha or upper house of parliament amid dramatic scenes and protests by mps belonging to some parties . the bill ensures one in three mps will be a woman but there is still a long way to go before this becomes law as the lack of consensus among india ’ s parliamentarians has ensured that the legislation remains in cold storage .
agitated members from the samajwadi party tried to snatch the bill copy from law minister h r bhardwaj tuesday but congress members intervened and formed a human chain thus allowing the controversial bill to be introduced .
soon after it was presented in the rajya sabha or upper house of parliament amid high drama , the left parties that prop up the ruling united progressive alliance , were happy that the first hurdle for initiating the bill had been taken .
support from the left brinda karat , a leftist mp from the rajya sabha said that the standing committee should clear it within a specific timeframe and send it back to parliament .
“ there were scenes , there was opposition but it should not conceal the reality that there is a vast majority in favour of the bill .
that is what we have been saying .
we are very happy that the government has taken the first step to crossing the first hurdle to the bill .
and what we also want now is that the standing committee should finalise the bill in the shortest possible time . ”
the bill was first introduced in 1996 , by former prime minister deve gowda but his government could never muster political support for its passage .
the national democratic alliance government too tried during its tenure but failed to find enough support among the political parties .
even among the upa constituents today , there is no consensus and an attempt by prime minister manmohan singh to arrive at an agreement has proved futile .
calls for separate reservations some of the political groups blocking the bill have demanded separate reservations for women from muslim and dalit or low-caste communities .
abu azmi of the samajwadi party who tried to snatch the bill copy says his party will oppose the introduction of the bill unless weaker sections are included . “ we are opposing the bill .
in what manner they have brought the bill ?
we are opposing it .
and we will continue to do so till where ?
until we get reservation for ladies dalit , obcs and muslims ” so the step towards gender justice , howsoever tentative and lacking any real support in the ruling coalition , might take quite a while .
political columnist monobina gupta explains , “ it will take a lot of courage and political will to restore the gender imbalance which is now evident in parliament .
at present barring two parties all others – centrist , leftist and rightist are publicly supporting the bill on the floor of parliament .

but some say the french want to have their cake and eat it . in his victory speech on may 6 , 2007 , sarkozy told thousands of people : " i do n't have the right to disappoint the country . "
but a year on , that 's exactly what the french president has done .
just over one third of the population say they support the new president , compared with some two-thirds 12 months ago .
to begin with , french voters were shocked by his hardly statesman-like behaviour with model carla bruni whom he married just weeks after divorcing his second wife cecilia in october .
he gave the impression of a man with his mind on ... well , on other things than the business of government .
beset by economic troubles and questions of style bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : sarkozy 's apparently whirlwind romance with carla bruni attracted negative publicity now the country is getting hit in the pocket and sarkozy is getting the blame .
he had pledged to boost spending power in his election campaign .
instead , it has dropped .
in march , french inflation rates reached a 17-year high of 3.2 percent .
in part , this was just bad luck .
the beginning of the president 's term in office also coincided with the onset of the global financial crisis and rocketing oil prices , helping to drive prices up .
the jury also seems to be out over the success of the flurry of reforms that he has introduced .
some analysts have praised his easing of france 's 35-hour week , his reduction of pension benefits and his reforms of the country 's overcrowded and impoverished universities .
" sarkozy had the courage to do what other presidents did n't , " philippe braud , a professor at the sciences po institute in paris , told afp news agency .
" his track record is not to be underestimated even if the french are n't convinced , " he added .
unemployment levels at historic low bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the president 's reforms sparked strikes among civil servants and railway workers in november .
braud also pointed to sarkozy 's achievement in streamlining france 's notoriously complicated labor laws .
the jobless rate has dropped to 7.5 percent , the lowest level in two decades , since he took office .
however , he said the president had announced too many projects at once and then not been able to deliver .
bruno jeanbart , of the opinionway polling institute , is of a similar opinion .
he praised sarkozy 's reform zeal , but also told afp that " there are also many areas he engaged in but in which he was perhaps too optimistic or has not followed through . "
he named these as spending power and the country 's public deficit .
other observers are more critical , saying that he bought the highly symbolic abolition of early pensions for civil servants by making expensive concessions and that rigid labor market structures remain largely untouched despite the shift away from a 35-hour week .
" he took over a country that was feeling insecure and which regarded him as the last chance to solve their structural problems , " said the political scientist dominique moisi .
" he failed to convince the french and offer them security . " a parliamentary report released this month also described as both costly and ineffective one of sarkozy 's flagship reforms , aimed at boosting incomes with a tax break on overtime pay .
the french conservative newspaper le figaro criticizes sarkozy only insofar as he did not make sufficiently clear that the changes would hurt .
" the french approve of the reforms of nicolas sarkozy , but condemn the reformer .
they 're a bit like a child that pushes away the helping hand because it does n't like the bitter taste of the medicine , " it wrote .
sarkozy admits some of the problems are his fault bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : critics have also accused sarkozy of compromising france 's human rights profile for business contracts the french president is trying to regain the population 's confidence .
just a few days ago he confessed in a tv interview : " i have made mistakes . "
and sarkozy has learned something from them , cutting out , for example , his public strutting with carla .
but apart from tackling style issues , his options are limited .
there is no money to kickstart the floundering economy .
in january , he confessed that he could not do much to help because the state " coffers were empty . "
france - which is set to take over the rotating eu presidency in july - is also facing mounting pressure from other european union member states to slash its total public deficit of around 1.2 trillion euros .
he also knows that backing down from his reform program would cost him his remaining credibility .
" i am completely aware of the dissatisfaction , but i know where i want to take things , " said sarkozy .
the honeymoon may be over , but sarkozy is hoping to persuade the electorate of the merits of a long-term relationship .
he is asking them to be patient .
" the important ' rendezvous ' will come at the end of my five years in office , " said sarkozy . dw staff -lrb- jg -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

however , the inclusion of some inductees with nazi connections stirred debate . the ambitious project , " a permanent celebration of our country 's greatest athletes , " according to the head of the german sport aid foundation , ann kathrin linsenhoff , will initially contain the names of 40 of germany 's sporting heroes , with potentially three to be added to the roll call every year .
the first sportsmen and women to enter the hall of fame , officially opened by president horst koehler and minister of the interior wolfgang schaeuble , were chosen by a 25-strong jury headed by schaeuble , which considered the nature of their sporting achievement , the legacy and impact of the person , their personal attributes and whether they were a good role model for future sports stars .
initial inductee list dominated by west german males the jury was presented with a list of 150 potential inductees which had been compiled by the german olympic sports alliance , the federation of german sports journalists and the german sport aid federation .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : former showjumper hans guenter winkler with his portrait the final list of 40 , which includes the likes of boxing legend max schmeling , soccer ambassador franz beckenbauer and tennis idol gottfried von cramm , features 32 posthumous inductees .
most of the 40 are male , the exceptions being germany 's first wimbledon tennis tournament winner cilly aussem , ski idol rosi mittermaier , a double olympic champion in 1976 , and track and field athlete ingrid mickler-becker .
there is only one sports star from the former east germany in the initial batch : four-time olympic swimming champion roland matthes .
given the gdr 's well-publicized doping program in sports , the jury appears to have erred on the side of caution in the initial round of inductions .
idols with nazi links cause unease however , the jury has not managed to completely avoid controversy .
the induction of five former members of the national socialist party has already caused some heated debate as to whether those associated with the nazis should be honored and has led to some calling the new project the " hall of shame . "
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : sport aid founder neckermann had nazi links cyclist gustav kilian , athlete rudolf harbig , former german olympic president willi daume and the founder of the german sport aid foundation , josef neckermann , as well as sepp herberger , coach of the 1954 world cup winning soccer team , " the wonders of bern , " all had connections to the third reich during world war ii .
" we do not see the hall of fame as being tarnished by this , " ann kathrin linsenhoff told reporters .
" in fact it is the opposite .
this is useful in the processing of our past through sport .
to exclude those who had connections with the national socialists would be an act of arrogance by a generation which has had the luck to grow up in a democracy .

one of its aims is to stop the far-right infiltrating sports ' clubs . " i 'm against nazis because they do n't appear to have learned anything from german history , " explains the german captain and chelsea midfielder in a 10-second soundbite on the web site netz-gegen-nazis -lrb- network against nazis -rrb- .
tv presenter marietta slomka and talk show host maybrit illner are among the other high-profile germans featured online . the interactive internet platform , launched by the german weekly newspaper die zeit on monday , may 5 , is at the heart of the project .
it contains extensive information about the subject - including up-to-date news reports about right-wing extremism - , a forum where users can seek advice and swap facts and links to advice centers and support groups .
" we 're aiming to create a nationwide forum where people who encounter far-right ideas in their day-to-day lives can give each other advice , " said giovanni di lorenzo , the newspaper 's editor-in-chief .
together we are strong bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : germany captain michael ballack is one of the campaign 's figureheads the weekly newspaper has joined forces with a number of other partners to forge the anti-far-right alliance .
the sporting organizations involved include the german olympic sports confederation -lrb- dosb -rrb- , the german soccer federation -lrb- dfb -rrb- and the german soccer league -lrb- dfl -rrb- .
media partners include the german broadcaster zdf and online portals , schuelervz , studivz and meinvz .
the involvement of the sporting bodies reflects rising concern about far-right parties using the cover of leisure activities to spread their ideas among young people , in particular .
" right-wing extremism poses a great threat to an association like the german soccer federation because of its clubs ' grass-roots and volunteer-based structures , " said the head of the dfb , theo zwanziger .
not just football tactics , but lessons for life bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : german soccer has already been involved in a number of anti-racist initiatives he added that the point of the network against nazis was to inform and to encourage civil courage .
" as well as teaching the one-two and the bicycle kick , we have to communicate the message that it is worthwhile living in a democratic state , " said zwanziger .
but it is not only the budding players who are being targeted ; he also mentioned special training sessions for coaches .
a number of high profile events will be taking place in games in both german football leagues on tuesday , may 6 , and wednesday , to publicize the initiative .
an ad featuring ballack 's soundbite will also be shown in all stadiums .
the dfb has also announced that the national squad would also be helping to spread this message in upcoming games against serbia and belarus . it did not reveal any further details .
ingo weiss , head of the german olympic sports confederation , said that it was about turning the 27 million or so dosb members into " vigilant lions " so that the horrors of the nazi era could never be repeated .
german integration minister maria boehmer welcomed the project .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de politics -pipe- 06.05.2008 one year on , hopes in french president plummet großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : sarkozy 's approval ratings could be better a year after his election win , french president nicolas sarkozy 's ratings have nosedived amid irritation at his flamboyant lifestyle and economic woes .
but some say the french want to have their cake and eat it . in his victory speech on may 6 , 2007 , sarkozy told thousands of people : " i do n't have the right to disappoint the country . "
but a year on , that 's exactly what the french president has done .
just over one third of the population say they support the new president , compared with some two-thirds 12 months ago .
to begin with , french voters were shocked by his hardly statesman-like behaviour with model carla bruni whom he married just weeks after divorcing his second wife cecilia in october .
he gave the impression of a man with his mind on ... well , on other things than the business of government .
beset by economic troubles and questions of style bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : sarkozy 's apparently whirlwind romance with carla bruni attracted negative publicity now the country is getting hit in the pocket and sarkozy is getting the blame .
he had pledged to boost spending power in his election campaign .
instead , it has dropped .
in march , french inflation rates reached a 17-year high of 3.2 percent .
in part , this was just bad luck .
the beginning of the president 's term in office also coincided with the onset of the global financial crisis and rocketing oil prices , helping to drive prices up .
the jury also seems to be out over the success of the flurry of reforms that he has introduced .
some analysts have praised his easing of france 's 35-hour week , his reduction of pension benefits and his reforms of the country 's overcrowded and impoverished universities .
" sarkozy had the courage to do what other presidents did n't , " philippe braud , a professor at the sciences po institute in paris , told afp news agency .
" his track record is not to be underestimated even if the french are n't convinced , " he added .
unemployment levels at historic low bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the president 's reforms sparked strikes among civil servants and railway workers in november .
braud also pointed to sarkozy 's achievement in streamlining france 's notoriously complicated labor laws .
the jobless rate has dropped to 7.5 percent , the lowest level in two decades , since he took office .
however , he said the president had announced too many projects at once and then not been able to deliver .
bruno jeanbart , of the opinionway polling institute , is of a similar opinion .
he praised sarkozy 's reform zeal , but also told afp that " there are also many areas he engaged in but in which he was perhaps too optimistic or has not followed through . "
he named these as spending power and the country 's public deficit .
other observers are more critical , saying that he bought the highly symbolic abolition of early pensions for civil servants by making expensive concessions and that rigid labor market structures remain largely untouched despite the shift away from a 35-hour week .
" he took over a country that was feeling insecure and which regarded him as the last chance to solve their structural problems , " said the political scientist dominique moisi .
" he failed to convince the french and offer them security . " a parliamentary report released this month also described as both costly and ineffective one of sarkozy 's flagship reforms , aimed at boosting incomes with a tax break on overtime pay .
the french conservative newspaper le figaro criticizes sarkozy only insofar as he did not make sufficiently clear that the changes would hurt .
" the french approve of the reforms of nicolas sarkozy , but condemn the reformer .
they 're a bit like a child that pushes away the helping hand because it does n't like the bitter taste of the medicine , " it wrote .
sarkozy admits some of the problems are his fault bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : critics have also accused sarkozy of compromising france 's human rights profile for business contracts the french president is trying to regain the population 's confidence .
just a few days ago he confessed in a tv interview : " i have made mistakes . "
and sarkozy has learned something from them , cutting out , for example , his public strutting with carla .
but apart from tackling style issues , his options are limited .
there is no money to kickstart the floundering economy .
in january , he confessed that he could not do much to help because the state " coffers were empty . "
france - which is set to take over the rotating eu presidency in july - is also facing mounting pressure from other european union member states to slash its total public deficit of around 1.2 trillion euros .
he also knows that backing down from his reform program would cost him his remaining credibility .
" i am completely aware of the dissatisfaction , but i know where i want to take things , " said sarkozy .
the honeymoon may be over , but sarkozy is hoping to persuade the electorate of the merits of a long-term relationship .
he is asking them to be patient .
" the important ' rendezvous ' will come at the end of my five years in office , " said sarkozy . dw staff -lrb- jg -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

but not due to the referendum on the constitution which is meant to decide the country 's political future and is scheduled for saturday , may 10 .
instead , the country ruled by a military dictatorship is in the news because of the natural disaster , whose full effect remains unknown . cyclone nargis left behind a massive swathe of destruction in the country 's south , above all .
at least 15,000 people have been killed , according to official figures , while hundreds of thousands of people have been made homeless and are in need of food , water and medication .
the people are in such desperate straits that even the hard-hearted military regime must recognize that it ca n't cope with the catastrophe without foreign aid . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : tobias grote-beverborg it 's still unclear under what conditions the regime is accepting the aid .

the united nations , which is also preparing to fly in supplies , say several hundreds of thousands of burmese have been left homeless .
some villages have been almost totally eradicated and vast rice-growing areas wiped out .
the former capital rangoon , the country 's largest city , has been left without water and electricity .
germany 's foreign ministry announced in berlin on monday , may 5 , that it would channel the pledged funds through german aid organizations .
the aid is intended to provide emergency accommodation , drinking water , household utensils and mosquito nets .
foreign minister frank-walter steinmeier expressed his condolences to the families of those who had died .
he also appealed to the military government to launch an effective assistance operation and to cooperate with international aid organizations . the british government pledged 5 million pounds -lsb- 6.3 million euros , $ 9.8 million -rsb- in aid for victims of the cyclone that has struck burma , the international development department said . international development secretary douglas alexander said the money would be channelled through the united nations and was the " the largest single effort of any member state of the united nations so far " . earlier , prime minister gordon brown said : " i want to pledge on behalf of the british government that we will work with the whole international community to make sure that the food aid and the other support that is necessary is available to the people of burma .

" the united states has made an initial aid contribution , but we want to do a lot more , " bush said as he signed a law giving burma democracy icon and junta foe aung san suu kyi the top civilian award the us congress can bestow . " we 're prepared to move us navy assets to help find those who 've lost their lives , to help find the missing , to help stabilize the situation .
but in order to do so , the military junta must allow our disaster assessment teams into the country , " said the president . bush spokeswoman dana perino said that washington was worried because the junta had yet to answer a us visa request for an eight-person disaster aid response team -lsb- dart -rsb- whose mission would be to assess burma 's aid needs eu calls for aid to go straight to the needy bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the eu 's foreign policy experts urge burma to open up the european union echoed the calls for the burmese authorities to " make every effort to cooperate " with relief organisations after burma said aid teams would have to meet its conditions . " every effort must be made to make sure that assistance is delivered directly to the people most affected by disaster , " the eu 's slovenia presidency said in a statement . " the eu hopes that , in the interest of the population suffering from the emergency , the authorities will make every effort to cooperate with the international relief organizations , " it added . a burmese minister said tuesday that foreign aid teams wanting to come to the military-ruled nation after the devastating cyclone would have to negotiate with the regime to be granted access . but european commission spokesman amadeu altafaj told journalists in brussels : " the burmese authorities of course have to be cooperative , " referring to myanmar by its old name of burma . on monday , the european commission released an initial two million euros -lsb- $ 3 million -rsb- in emergency aid for victims of the weekend cyclone . military junta stalls after initial acceptance bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the burmese government have been accused of failing to issue timely weather warnings the scale of the disaster caused by cyclone nargis initially prompted a rare acceptance of external aid from the country 's diplomatically isolated government , which rejected such offers of help after the 2004 indian ocean tsunami .
" this shows how grave it is in the burmese government 's mind , " said tim costello , the head of aid agency world vision in australia , adding that his and other aid organizations had been given permission to fly people to burma , " which is pretty unprecedented . "
however , the un said on tuesday , may 6 , that it is still waiting for burma to approve visas for disaster relief workers to go in and assess the situation .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de media -pipe- 06.05.2008 germany 's market busting tv star raab goes global großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : raab 's desire to win makes him an ideal competitor - and entertainment mogul imported shows have long been a staple of german tv , but the reverse is rarely true .
now a game show created by an unlikely , if ubiquitous , german tv personality is taking foreign markets by storm . can an irreverent former butcher named stefan raab save german entertainment ?
so far , 12 countries have bought the adaptation rights to a german game show called " schlag den raab , " or " beat raab . "
the latest to sign on were croatia and denmark .
a uk version is currently in production and will air this spring .
the foreign title is " beat your host ; " the uk version is called " beat the star . " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : try beating raab at this as the original title implies , the german version involves pitting a selected contestant against 42-year-old stefan raab , a talk-show host and sort-of comedian who is arguably germany ’ s most ubiquitous television personality .
the contestant tries to beat raab in a marathon four- to five-hour competition that encompasses up to 15 varied disciplines , from the physical -lrb- box stacking , ice climbing , -rrb- to the mental -lrb- poker playing , knowledge quiz -rrb- to the silly -lrb- dropping peas into a bottle . -rrb- at stake : a heap of cash . the uk version , produced by a company called itv , will pit contestants against a changing array of stars , and the contest has been shortened to last just over an hour .
the german show was the most successful new start last year , pulling viewer ratings of around 31 percent of those aged 14 to 49 . whether the same ratings dream will come true for itv , as it has for raab 's german production firm brainpool , remains to be seen .
nonetheless , raab has managed to achieve something with this show that has been done only a handful of times in german tv history : crossing over to a broad international audience . the rapid ascent of stefan raab " most successful german tv shows are strongly based on regional identities , " said joan bleicher , professor for media studies at the university of hamburg .
" it just would n't translate to an international audience . " but the success of raab 's latest endeavor is unlikely to surprise anyone who has kept an eye on the german entertainment scene for the past decade . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : beat the raab is one of germany 's most successful tv shows raab 's rise on german television can only be described as meteoric .
as a vj on an german music-video channel viva in 1996 , he set himself apart with his ironic , often rude humor .
his irreverence quickly won him the admiration of germany ’ s youth . in 1999 he became host of a show he created , " tv total , " which still runs four nights a week .
it focuses on ridiculing television while pairing raab as a chat host with entertainers and musicians - often on the a-list - who perform live on his show . derisive humor a hit among youth but unlike most chat-show hosts , whose job descriptions fairly demand neutrality , raab is n't urbane or fawning . bulky and goateed , he looks a little bit like the butcher that he trained to be in his youth .
he is neither handsome nor well dressed , and is mostly found wearing jeans , untucked shirts , sneakers and a self-satisfied grin . raab also does n't shy from unleashing his derisive humor on the stars who take a seat on his couch , " which makes the youth market love him , " says university of hamburg 's bleicher . indeed , his brash and boorish style tends to divide the audience into " love him " and " hate him " camps , with the deciding factor apparently being age .
the fault line falls somewhere around age 30 . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : love him or hate him , there 's no escaping him " raab is very popular with people from 12 to 29 , " bleicher said .
" it 's what the program planners are aiming for . " meanwhile , " older people ca n't stand him , " bleicher asserts .
" they think he is too aggressive , too ironic , unattractive . … he is simply rude . " of insults and lawsuits certainly raab has gotten into some well publicized hot water by ignoring the usual conventions of politesse .
he once famously ridiculed a 16-year-old model named lisa loch -lrb- in german " loch " means " hole " -rrb- saying her name could make her a porno star ; a court made him pay the teenager 70,000 euros -lrb- $ 108,000 -rrb- in damages . in a similar 2004 misstep , he showed a picture of a young turkish mother holding her child ’ s schoolbag , and quipped , " the drug traffickers are getting better and better at disguising themselves . "
that joke cost him 20,000 euros . the legal troubles seem to have had their effect , and in recent years raab has n't landed in court .
or perhaps he has just been too busy building a major entertainment empire to think up anything actionable . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the winner takes it all ...
in addition to " tv total " - which regularly sees raab paired and poking fun at celebrities on the caliber of elton john , jackie chan , eminem , kylie minogue , ben stiller , and will smith - raab 's broadcaster , the private channel pro7 , has given him free rein to create a series of entertainment " events . " quick ride in a slippery wok these usually land in prime-time slots , and run the gamut from the wacky -lrb- an annual sports event called the " wok world championship , " in which celebrities take a bobsled run while seated in an enormous cooking wok , -rrb- to the iconoclastic -lrb- a takeoff on germany ’ s version of the " american idol " show with the tongue-in-cheek name " ssdsdss , " or " stefan seeks the superstar who can sing what he or she wants " -rrb- ; the unlikely -lrb- the " bundesvision song contest , " pitting unknown bands from germany 's 16 federal states , -rrb- to the over-the-top -lrb- a project in the works called " autoball , " which involves an arena , two cars and a giant soccer ball . -rrb- moreover , raab is respected for his musical talent ; he is a self-taught musician with his own record label , which he uses to produce and promote the talent that he discovers in his contests and features on his talk show .
he was also deeply involved in the eurovision song contest , where he has been both a contestant and a promoter , and has written and cut a few hit novelty songs . a closed culture system ? if raab sounds like a one man entertainment band , or an apolitical silvio berlusconi , it 's because he is .
and like him or hate him , most people admire his ability to take the pulse of german pop culture and turn it into a sackful of euros , if nothing else . it leads to a not infrequent use of the word " genius . " in an awed 2007 article on raab in respected german newspaper die zeit , pro7 executive jobst benthues said that what raab does is " big entertaiment .
he is a genius of thinking of things first , and we give him the freedom to try things out . his successes validate our trust . " media historian bleicher agrees . " he is a genius at selling himself and his ideas , and combining several aspects of the media economy , " bleicher says .
" he combines diverse formats , like a big media conglomerate .
but he is just one person . " jennifer abramsohn send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

the united nations , which is also preparing to fly in supplies , say several hundreds of thousands of burmese have been left homeless .
some villages have been almost totally eradicated and vast rice-growing areas wiped out .
the former capital rangoon , the country 's largest city , has been left without water and electricity .
germany 's foreign ministry announced in berlin on monday , may 5 , that it would channel the pledged funds through german aid organizations .
the aid is intended to provide emergency accommodation , drinking water , household utensils and mosquito nets .
foreign minister frank-walter steinmeier expressed his condolences to the families of those who had died .
he also appealed to the military government to launch an effective assistance operation and to cooperate with international aid organizations . the british government pledged 5 million pounds -lsb- 6.3 million euros , $ 9.8 million -rsb- in aid for victims of the cyclone that has struck burma , the international development department said . international development secretary douglas alexander said the money would be channelled through the united nations and was the " the largest single effort of any member state of the united nations so far " . earlier , prime minister gordon brown said : " i want to pledge on behalf of the british government that we will work with the whole international community to make sure that the food aid and the other support that is necessary is available to the people of burma . " us calls for authorities to allow aid meanwhile , us president george w. bush implored burma 's ruling junta to accept us disaster relief . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : bush urged the burmese authorities to accept help " our message is , to the military rulers : ' let the united states come to help you , help the people , " ' bush said , as myanmar 's government set unspecified conditions for foreign relief groups to enter the storm-battered country . the us embassy has offered 250,000 dollars in emergency aid in response to tropical cyclone nargis , but the white house said a disaster-relief team hoped to go in to assess the impoverished and secretive nation 's needs while two us navy ships loaded with water and other supplies were nearby , ready to help . " the united states has made an initial aid contribution , but we want to do a lot more , " bush said as he signed a law giving burma democracy icon and junta foe aung san suu kyi the top civilian award the us congress can bestow . " we 're prepared to move us navy assets to help find those who 've lost their lives , to help find the missing , to help stabilize the situation .
but in order to do so , the military junta must allow our disaster assessment teams into the country , " said the president . bush spokeswoman dana perino said that washington was worried because the junta had yet to answer a us visa request for an eight-person disaster aid response team -lsb- dart -rsb- whose mission would be to assess burma 's aid needs eu calls for aid to go straight to the needy bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the eu 's foreign policy experts urge burma to open up the european union echoed the calls for the burmese authorities to " make every effort to cooperate " with relief organisations after burma said aid teams would have to meet its conditions . " every effort must be made to make sure that assistance is delivered directly to the people most affected by disaster , " the eu 's slovenia presidency said in a statement . " the eu hopes that , in the interest of the population suffering from the emergency , the authorities will make every effort to cooperate with the international relief organizations , " it added . a burmese minister said tuesday that foreign aid teams wanting to come to the military-ruled nation after the devastating cyclone would have to negotiate with the regime to be granted access . but european commission spokesman amadeu altafaj told journalists in brussels : " the burmese authorities of course have to be cooperative , " referring to myanmar by its old name of burma . on monday , the european commission released an initial two million euros -lsb- $ 3 million -rsb- in emergency aid for victims of the weekend cyclone . military junta stalls after initial acceptance bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the burmese government have been accused of failing to issue timely weather warnings the scale of the disaster caused by cyclone nargis initially prompted a rare acceptance of external aid from the country 's diplomatically isolated government , which rejected such offers of help after the 2004 indian ocean tsunami .
" this shows how grave it is in the burmese government 's mind , " said tim costello , the head of aid agency world vision in australia , adding that his and other aid organizations had been given permission to fly people to burma , " which is pretty unprecedented . "
however , the un said on tuesday , may 6 , that it is still waiting for burma to approve visas for disaster relief workers to go in and assess the situation .

however , the inclusion of some inductees with nazi connections stirred debate . the ambitious project , " a permanent celebration of our country 's greatest athletes , " according to the head of the german sport aid foundation , ann kathrin linsenhoff , will initially contain the names of 40 of germany 's sporting heroes , with potentially three to be added to the roll call every year .
the first sportsmen and women to enter the hall of fame , officially opened by president horst koehler and minister of the interior wolfgang schaeuble , were chosen by a 25-strong jury headed by schaeuble , which considered the nature of their sporting achievement , the legacy and impact of the person , their personal attributes and whether they were a good role model for future sports stars .
initial inductee list dominated by west german males the jury was presented with a list of 150 potential inductees which had been compiled by the german olympic sports alliance , the federation of german sports journalists and the german sport aid federation .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : former showjumper hans guenter winkler with his portrait the final list of 40 , which includes the likes of boxing legend max schmeling , soccer ambassador franz beckenbauer and tennis idol gottfried von cramm , features 32 posthumous inductees .
most of the 40 are male , the exceptions being germany 's first wimbledon tennis tournament winner cilly aussem , ski idol rosi mittermaier , a double olympic champion in 1976 , and track and field athlete ingrid mickler-becker .
there is only one sports star from the former east germany in the initial batch : four-time olympic swimming champion roland matthes .
given the gdr 's well-publicized doping program in sports , the jury appears to have erred on the side of caution in the initial round of inductions .
idols with nazi links cause unease however , the jury has not managed to completely avoid controversy .
the induction of five former members of the national socialist party has already caused some heated debate as to whether those associated with the nazis should be honored and has led to some calling the new project the " hall of shame . "
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : sport aid founder neckermann had nazi links cyclist gustav kilian , athlete rudolf harbig , former german olympic president willi daume and the founder of the german sport aid foundation , josef neckermann , as well as sepp herberger , coach of the 1954 world cup winning soccer team , " the wonders of bern , " all had connections to the third reich during world war ii .
" we do not see the hall of fame as being tarnished by this , " ann kathrin linsenhoff told reporters .
" in fact it is the opposite .
this is useful in the processing of our past through sport .
to exclude those who had connections with the national socialists would be an act of arrogance by a generation which has had the luck to grow up in a democracy .

one of its aims is to stop the far-right infiltrating sports ' clubs . " i 'm against nazis because they do n't appear to have learned anything from german history , " explains the german captain and chelsea midfielder in a 10-second soundbite on the web site netz-gegen-nazis -lrb- network against nazis -rrb- .
tv presenter marietta slomka and talk show host maybrit illner are among the other high-profile germans featured online . the interactive internet platform , launched by the german weekly newspaper die zeit on monday , may 5 , is at the heart of the project .
it contains extensive information about the subject - including up-to-date news reports about right-wing extremism - , a forum where users can seek advice and swap facts and links to advice centers and support groups .
" we 're aiming to create a nationwide forum where people who encounter far-right ideas in their day-to-day lives can give each other advice , " said giovanni di lorenzo , the newspaper 's editor-in-chief .
together we are strong bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : germany captain michael ballack is one of the campaign 's figureheads the weekly newspaper has joined forces with a number of other partners to forge the anti-far-right alliance .
the sporting organizations involved include the german olympic sports confederation -lrb- dosb -rrb- , the german soccer federation -lrb- dfb -rrb- and the german soccer league -lrb- dfl -rrb- .
media partners include the german broadcaster zdf and online portals , schuelervz , studivz and meinvz .
the involvement of the sporting bodies reflects rising concern about far-right parties using the cover of leisure activities to spread their ideas among young people , in particular .
" right-wing extremism poses a great threat to an association like the german soccer federation because of its clubs ' grass-roots and volunteer-based structures , " said the head of the dfb , theo zwanziger .
not just football tactics , but lessons for life bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : german soccer has already been involved in a number of anti-racist initiatives he added that the point of the network against nazis was to inform and to encourage civil courage .
" as well as teaching the one-two and the bicycle kick , we have to communicate the message that it is worthwhile living in a democratic state , " said zwanziger .
but it is not only the budding players who are being targeted ; he also mentioned special training sessions for coaches .
a number of high profile events will be taking place in games in both german football leagues on tuesday , may 6 , and wednesday , to publicize the initiative .
an ad featuring ballack 's soundbite will also be shown in all stadiums .
the dfb has also announced that the national squad would also be helping to spread this message in upcoming games against serbia and belarus . it did not reveal any further details .
ingo weiss , head of the german olympic sports confederation , said that it was about turning the 27 million or so dosb members into " vigilant lions " so that the horrors of the nazi era could never be repeated .
german integration minister maria boehmer welcomed the project .
in a statement she said that media and sport carried a particular responsibility in the fight against right-wing extremism and xenophobia because of their ability to reach a wide audience . dw staff -lrb- jg -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?
dw-world.de proposed ban on right-wing npd loses steam germany 's interior minister said it 's " high time " the social democrats abandon their push for a ban of the right-wing npd .
the chancellor said right-wing extremism should be " nipped in the bud " but a ban was unlikely .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de media -pipe- 06.05.2008 germany 's market busting tv star raab goes global großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : raab 's desire to win makes him an ideal competitor - and entertainment mogul imported shows have long been a staple of german tv , but the reverse is rarely true .
now a game show created by an unlikely , if ubiquitous , german tv personality is taking foreign markets by storm . can an irreverent former butcher named stefan raab save german entertainment ?
so far , 12 countries have bought the adaptation rights to a german game show called " schlag den raab , " or " beat raab . "
the latest to sign on were croatia and denmark .
a uk version is currently in production and will air this spring .
the foreign title is " beat your host ; " the uk version is called " beat the star . " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : try beating raab at this as the original title implies , the german version involves pitting a selected contestant against 42-year-old stefan raab , a talk-show host and sort-of comedian who is arguably germany ’ s most ubiquitous television personality .
the contestant tries to beat raab in a marathon four- to five-hour competition that encompasses up to 15 varied disciplines , from the physical -lrb- box stacking , ice climbing , -rrb- to the mental -lrb- poker playing , knowledge quiz -rrb- to the silly -lrb- dropping peas into a bottle . -rrb- at stake : a heap of cash . the uk version , produced by a company called itv , will pit contestants against a changing array of stars , and the contest has been shortened to last just over an hour .
the german show was the most successful new start last year , pulling viewer ratings of around 31 percent of those aged 14 to 49 . whether the same ratings dream will come true for itv , as it has for raab 's german production firm brainpool , remains to be seen .
nonetheless , raab has managed to achieve something with this show that has been done only a handful of times in german tv history : crossing over to a broad international audience . the rapid ascent of stefan raab " most successful german tv shows are strongly based on regional identities , " said joan bleicher , professor for media studies at the university of hamburg .
" it just would n't translate to an international audience . " but the success of raab 's latest endeavor is unlikely to surprise anyone who has kept an eye on the german entertainment scene for the past decade . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : beat the raab is one of germany 's most successful tv shows raab 's rise on german television can only be described as meteoric .
as a vj on an german music-video channel viva in 1996 , he set himself apart with his ironic , often rude humor .
his irreverence quickly won him the admiration of germany ’ s youth . in 1999 he became host of a show he created , " tv total , " which still runs four nights a week .
it focuses on ridiculing television while pairing raab as a chat host with entertainers and musicians - often on the a-list - who perform live on his show . derisive humor a hit among youth but unlike most chat-show hosts , whose job descriptions fairly demand neutrality , raab is n't urbane or fawning . bulky and goateed , he looks a little bit like the butcher that he trained to be in his youth .
he is neither handsome nor well dressed , and is mostly found wearing jeans , untucked shirts , sneakers and a self-satisfied grin . raab also does n't shy from unleashing his derisive humor on the stars who take a seat on his couch , " which makes the youth market love him , " says university of hamburg 's bleicher . indeed , his brash and boorish style tends to divide the audience into " love him " and " hate him " camps , with the deciding factor apparently being age .
the fault line falls somewhere around age 30 . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : love him or hate him , there 's no escaping him " raab is very popular with people from 12 to 29 , " bleicher said .
" it 's what the program planners are aiming for . " meanwhile , " older people ca n't stand him , " bleicher asserts .
" they think he is too aggressive , too ironic , unattractive . … he is simply rude . " of insults and lawsuits certainly raab has gotten into some well publicized hot water by ignoring the usual conventions of politesse .
he once famously ridiculed a 16-year-old model named lisa loch -lrb- in german " loch " means " hole " -rrb- saying her name could make her a porno star ; a court made him pay the teenager 70,000 euros -lrb- $ 108,000 -rrb- in damages . in a similar 2004 misstep , he showed a picture of a young turkish mother holding her child ’ s schoolbag , and quipped , " the drug traffickers are getting better and better at disguising themselves . "
that joke cost him 20,000 euros . the legal troubles seem to have had their effect , and in recent years raab has n't landed in court .
or perhaps he has just been too busy building a major entertainment empire to think up anything actionable . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the winner takes it all ...
in addition to " tv total " - which regularly sees raab paired and poking fun at celebrities on the caliber of elton john , jackie chan , eminem , kylie minogue , ben stiller , and will smith - raab 's broadcaster , the private channel pro7 , has given him free rein to create a series of entertainment " events .

he was also deeply involved in the eurovision song contest , where he has been both a contestant and a promoter , and has written and cut a few hit novelty songs . a closed culture system ? if raab sounds like a one man entertainment band , or an apolitical silvio berlusconi , it 's because he is .
and like him or hate him , most people admire his ability to take the pulse of german pop culture and turn it into a sackful of euros , if nothing else . it leads to a not infrequent use of the word " genius .

however , the inclusion of some inductees with nazi connections stirred debate . the ambitious project , " a permanent celebration of our country 's greatest athletes , " according to the head of the german sport aid foundation , ann kathrin linsenhoff , will initially contain the names of 40 of germany 's sporting heroes , with potentially three to be added to the roll call every year .
the first sportsmen and women to enter the hall of fame , officially opened by president horst koehler and minister of the interior wolfgang schaeuble , were chosen by a 25-strong jury headed by schaeuble , which considered the nature of their sporting achievement , the legacy and impact of the person , their personal attributes and whether they were a good role model for future sports stars .
initial inductee list dominated by west german males the jury was presented with a list of 150 potential inductees which had been compiled by the german olympic sports alliance , the federation of german sports journalists and the german sport aid federation .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : former showjumper hans guenter winkler with his portrait the final list of 40 , which includes the likes of boxing legend max schmeling , soccer ambassador franz beckenbauer and tennis idol gottfried von cramm , features 32 posthumous inductees .
most of the 40 are male , the exceptions being germany 's first wimbledon tennis tournament winner cilly aussem , ski idol rosi mittermaier , a double olympic champion in 1976 , and track and field athlete ingrid mickler-becker .
there is only one sports star from the former east germany in the initial batch : four-time olympic swimming champion roland matthes .
given the gdr 's well-publicized doping program in sports , the jury appears to have erred on the side of caution in the initial round of inductions .
idols with nazi links cause unease however , the jury has not managed to completely avoid controversy .
the induction of five former members of the national socialist party has already caused some heated debate as to whether those associated with the nazis should be honored and has led to some calling the new project the " hall of shame . "

" we do not see the hall of fame as being tarnished by this , " ann kathrin linsenhoff told reporters .
" in fact it is the opposite .
this is useful in the processing of our past through sport .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de opinion -pipe- 06.05.2008 opinion : burma 's dictatorship in the hot seat großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the full extent of the disaster caused by cyclone nargis in burma remains unclear .
but one thing is apparent : the regime is unwilling to delay its planned referendum on the constitution , says dw 's tobias grote-beverborg . once again myanmar , formerly known as burma , is making headlines .
but not due to the referendum on the constitution which is meant to decide the country 's political future and is scheduled for saturday , may 10 .
instead , the country ruled by a military dictatorship is in the news because of the natural disaster , whose full effect remains unknown . cyclone nargis left behind a massive swathe of destruction in the country 's south , above all .
at least 15,000 people have been killed , according to official figures , while hundreds of thousands of people have been made homeless and are in need of food , water and medication .
the people are in such desperate straits that even the hard-hearted military regime must recognize that it ca n't cope with the catastrophe without foreign aid . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : tobias grote-beverborg it 's still unclear under what conditions the regime is accepting the aid .
it is , however , clear that the cyclone has upset the dictatorship 's plans .
the planned referendum on the constitution was meant to ensure a continuation of military rule and it was supposed to be passed in the manner typical of a dictatorship , tacitly and closed off from the rest of the world .
in the limelight but now the eyes of the world are on burma and foreign aid workers may end up as unwelcome election observers .
the junta hopes to avoid that by holding the vote as soon as possible - that is , keeping it on saturday .
it 's only allowing postponement of the vote in the regions hardest hit by the cyclone .
the junta has once more shown how cynically calculating it is , seeing as in terms of logistics alone , the dimensions of the catastrophe make an orderly referendum impossible . how long the regime can keep this farce going also depends on the conditions under which aid - and aid workers - is allowed into the country .
the military leaders may of course hope they can rely on their neighbors ; india and china have already promised comprehensive aid measures .
and neither will meddle in burma 's " internal affairs , " just as they have n't in the past .
hopes of an aceh scenario however , as the number of victims increases and the need for aid for the survivors becomes ever more urgent , the junta can not afford to reject further aid from abroad .
the huge contingent of foreign aid workers who became a presence in aceh , indonesia , after the tsunami catastrophe nearly four years ago led to an end to the bloody civil war there .
parallels to the situation in myanmar come to mind . discontent is already growing among the burmese due to the military 's apparent failings .
for one , people were n't warned sufficiently or far enough in advance about the extent of the approaching cyclone .
and now , national aid measures are moving sluggishly . the referendum desperately needs to be postponed .
one can only hope the referendum on the constitution takes place at a later date with international observers and that there will be truly free and fair elections in myanmar .
if that were the case , the catastrophe - however cynical this may sound - would also have done good . tobias grote-beverborg is the managing editor of asia programs at deutsche welle -lrb- ncy -rrb- . send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de politics -pipe- 06.05.2008 one year on , hopes in french president plummet großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : sarkozy 's approval ratings could be better a year after his election win , french president nicolas sarkozy 's ratings have nosedived amid irritation at his flamboyant lifestyle and economic woes .
but some say the french want to have their cake and eat it . in his victory speech on may 6 , 2007 , sarkozy told thousands of people : " i do n't have the right to disappoint the country . "
but a year on , that 's exactly what the french president has done .
just over one third of the population say they support the new president , compared with some two-thirds 12 months ago .
to begin with , french voters were shocked by his hardly statesman-like behaviour with model carla bruni whom he married just weeks after divorcing his second wife cecilia in october .
he gave the impression of a man with his mind on ... well , on other things than the business of government .
beset by economic troubles and questions of style bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : sarkozy 's apparently whirlwind romance with carla bruni attracted negative publicity now the country is getting hit in the pocket and sarkozy is getting the blame .
he had pledged to boost spending power in his election campaign .
instead , it has dropped .
in march , french inflation rates reached a 17-year high of 3.2 percent .
in part , this was just bad luck .
the beginning of the president 's term in office also coincided with the onset of the global financial crisis and rocketing oil prices , helping to drive prices up .
the jury also seems to be out over the success of the flurry of reforms that he has introduced .
some analysts have praised his easing of france 's 35-hour week , his reduction of pension benefits and his reforms of the country 's overcrowded and impoverished universities .
" sarkozy had the courage to do what other presidents did n't , " philippe braud , a professor at the sciences po institute in paris , told afp news agency .
" his track record is not to be underestimated even if the french are n't convinced , " he added .
unemployment levels at historic low bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the president 's reforms sparked strikes among civil servants and railway workers in november .
braud also pointed to sarkozy 's achievement in streamlining france 's notoriously complicated labor laws .
the jobless rate has dropped to 7.5 percent , the lowest level in two decades , since he took office .
however , he said the president had announced too many projects at once and then not been able to deliver .
bruno jeanbart , of the opinionway polling institute , is of a similar opinion .
he praised sarkozy 's reform zeal , but also told afp that " there are also many areas he engaged in but in which he was perhaps too optimistic or has not followed through . "
he named these as spending power and the country 's public deficit .
other observers are more critical , saying that he bought the highly symbolic abolition of early pensions for civil servants by making expensive concessions and that rigid labor market structures remain largely untouched despite the shift away from a 35-hour week .
" he took over a country that was feeling insecure and which regarded him as the last chance to solve their structural problems , " said the political scientist dominique moisi .
" he failed to convince the french and offer them security . " a parliamentary report released this month also described as both costly and ineffective one of sarkozy 's flagship reforms , aimed at boosting incomes with a tax break on overtime pay .
the french conservative newspaper le figaro criticizes sarkozy only insofar as he did not make sufficiently clear that the changes would hurt .
" the french approve of the reforms of nicolas sarkozy , but condemn the reformer .
they 're a bit like a child that pushes away the helping hand because it does n't like the bitter taste of the medicine , " it wrote .
sarkozy admits some of the problems are his fault bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : critics have also accused sarkozy of compromising france 's human rights profile for business contracts the french president is trying to regain the population 's confidence .
just a few days ago he confessed in a tv interview : " i have made mistakes . "
and sarkozy has learned something from them , cutting out , for example , his public strutting with carla .
but apart from tackling style issues , his options are limited .
there is no money to kickstart the floundering economy .
in january , he confessed that he could not do much to help because the state " coffers were empty . "
france - which is set to take over the rotating eu presidency in july - is also facing mounting pressure from other european union member states to slash its total public deficit of around 1.2 trillion euros .
he also knows that backing down from his reform program would cost him his remaining credibility .
" i am completely aware of the dissatisfaction , but i know where i want to take things , " said sarkozy .
the honeymoon may be over , but sarkozy is hoping to persuade the electorate of the merits of a long-term relationship .
he is asking them to be patient .
" the important ' rendezvous ' will come at the end of my five years in office , " said sarkozy . dw staff -lrb- jg -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

one of its aims is to stop the far-right infiltrating sports ' clubs . " i 'm against nazis because they do n't appear to have learned anything from german history , " explains the german captain and chelsea midfielder in a 10-second soundbite on the web site netz-gegen-nazis -lrb- network against nazis -rrb- .
tv presenter marietta slomka and talk show host maybrit illner are among the other high-profile germans featured online . the interactive internet platform , launched by the german weekly newspaper die zeit on monday , may 5 , is at the heart of the project .
it contains extensive information about the subject - including up-to-date news reports about right-wing extremism - , a forum where users can seek advice and swap facts and links to advice centers and support groups .
" we 're aiming to create a nationwide forum where people who encounter far-right ideas in their day-to-day lives can give each other advice , " said giovanni di lorenzo , the newspaper 's editor-in-chief .
together we are strong bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : germany captain michael ballack is one of the campaign 's figureheads the weekly newspaper has joined forces with a number of other partners to forge the anti-far-right alliance .
the sporting organizations involved include the german olympic sports confederation -lrb- dosb -rrb- , the german soccer federation -lrb- dfb -rrb- and the german soccer league -lrb- dfl -rrb- .
media partners include the german broadcaster zdf and online portals , schuelervz , studivz and meinvz .
the involvement of the sporting bodies reflects rising concern about far-right parties using the cover of leisure activities to spread their ideas among young people , in particular .
" right-wing extremism poses a great threat to an association like the german soccer federation because of its clubs ' grass-roots and volunteer-based structures , " said the head of the dfb , theo zwanziger .
not just football tactics , but lessons for life bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : german soccer has already been involved in a number of anti-racist initiatives he added that the point of the network against nazis was to inform and to encourage civil courage .
" as well as teaching the one-two and the bicycle kick , we have to communicate the message that it is worthwhile living in a democratic state , " said zwanziger .
but it is not only the budding players who are being targeted ; he also mentioned special training sessions for coaches .
a number of high profile events will be taking place in games in both german football leagues on tuesday , may 6 , and wednesday , to publicize the initiative .
an ad featuring ballack 's soundbite will also be shown in all stadiums .
the dfb has also announced that the national squad would also be helping to spread this message in upcoming games against serbia and belarus . it did not reveal any further details .
ingo weiss , head of the german olympic sports confederation , said that it was about turning the 27 million or so dosb members into " vigilant lions " so that the horrors of the nazi era could never be repeated .
german integration minister maria boehmer welcomed the project .
in a statement she said that media and sport carried a particular responsibility in the fight against right-wing extremism and xenophobia because of their ability to reach a wide audience . dw staff -lrb- jg -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

the united nations , which is also preparing to fly in supplies , say several hundreds of thousands of burmese have been left homeless .
some villages have been almost totally eradicated and vast rice-growing areas wiped out .
the former capital rangoon , the country 's largest city , has been left without water and electricity .
germany 's foreign ministry announced in berlin on monday , may 5 , that it would channel the pledged funds through german aid organizations .
the aid is intended to provide emergency accommodation , drinking water , household utensils and mosquito nets .
foreign minister frank-walter steinmeier expressed his condolences to the families of those who had died .
he also appealed to the military government to launch an effective assistance operation and to cooperate with international aid organizations . the british government pledged 5 million pounds -lsb- 6.3 million euros , $ 9.8 million -rsb- in aid for victims of the cyclone that has struck burma , the international development department said . international development secretary douglas alexander said the money would be channelled through the united nations and was the " the largest single effort of any member state of the united nations so far " . earlier , prime minister gordon brown said : " i want to pledge on behalf of the british government that we will work with the whole international community to make sure that the food aid and the other support that is necessary is available to the people of burma . " us calls for authorities to allow aid meanwhile , us president george w. bush implored burma 's ruling junta to accept us disaster relief . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : bush urged the burmese authorities to accept help " our message is , to the military rulers : ' let the united states come to help you , help the people , " ' bush said , as myanmar 's government set unspecified conditions for foreign relief groups to enter the storm-battered country . the us embassy has offered 250,000 dollars in emergency aid in response to tropical cyclone nargis , but the white house said a disaster-relief team hoped to go in to assess the impoverished and secretive nation 's needs while two us navy ships loaded with water and other supplies were nearby , ready to help . " the united states has made an initial aid contribution , but we want to do a lot more , " bush said as he signed a law giving burma democracy icon and junta foe aung san suu kyi the top civilian award the us congress can bestow . " we 're prepared to move us navy assets to help find those who 've lost their lives , to help find the missing , to help stabilize the situation .
but in order to do so , the military junta must allow our disaster assessment teams into the country , " said the president . bush spokeswoman dana perino said that washington was worried because the junta had yet to answer a us visa request for an eight-person disaster aid response team -lsb- dart -rsb- whose mission would be to assess burma 's aid needs eu calls for aid to go straight to the needy bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the eu 's foreign policy experts urge burma to open up the european union echoed the calls for the burmese authorities to " make every effort to cooperate " with relief organisations after burma said aid teams would have to meet its conditions . " every effort must be made to make sure that assistance is delivered directly to the people most affected by disaster , " the eu 's slovenia presidency said in a statement . " the eu hopes that , in the interest of the population suffering from the emergency , the authorities will make every effort to cooperate with the international relief organizations , " it added . a burmese minister said tuesday that foreign aid teams wanting to come to the military-ruled nation after the devastating cyclone would have to negotiate with the regime to be granted access . but european commission spokesman amadeu altafaj told journalists in brussels : " the burmese authorities of course have to be cooperative , " referring to myanmar by its old name of burma . on monday , the european commission released an initial two million euros -lsb- $ 3 million -rsb- in emergency aid for victims of the weekend cyclone . military junta stalls after initial acceptance bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the burmese government have been accused of failing to issue timely weather warnings the scale of the disaster caused by cyclone nargis initially prompted a rare acceptance of external aid from the country 's diplomatically isolated government , which rejected such offers of help after the 2004 indian ocean tsunami .
" this shows how grave it is in the burmese government 's mind , " said tim costello , the head of aid agency world vision in australia , adding that his and other aid organizations had been given permission to fly people to burma , " which is pretty unprecedented . "
however , the un said on tuesday , may 6 , that it is still waiting for burma to approve visas for disaster relief workers to go in and assess the situation .

the long-delayed women 's reservation bill was tabled in the rajya sabha or upper house of parliament amid dramatic scenes and protests by mps belonging to some parties . the bill ensures one in three mps will be a woman but there is still a long way to go before this becomes law as the lack of consensus among india ’ s parliamentarians has ensured that the legislation remains in cold storage .
agitated members from the samajwadi party tried to snatch the bill copy from law minister h r bhardwaj tuesday but congress members intervened and formed a human chain thus allowing the controversial bill to be introduced .
soon after it was presented in the rajya sabha or upper house of parliament amid high drama , the left parties that prop up the ruling united progressive alliance , were happy that the first hurdle for initiating the bill had been taken .
support from the left brinda karat , a leftist mp from the rajya sabha said that the standing committee should clear it within a specific timeframe and send it back to parliament .
“ there were scenes , there was opposition but it should not conceal the reality that there is a vast majority in favour of the bill .
that is what we have been saying .
we are very happy that the government has taken the first step to crossing the first hurdle to the bill .
and what we also want now is that the standing committee should finalise the bill in the shortest possible time . ”
the bill was first introduced in 1996 , by former prime minister deve gowda but his government could never muster political support for its passage .
the national democratic alliance government too tried during its tenure but failed to find enough support among the political parties .
even among the upa constituents today , there is no consensus and an attempt by prime minister manmohan singh to arrive at an agreement has proved futile .
calls for separate reservations some of the political groups blocking the bill have demanded separate reservations for women from muslim and dalit or low-caste communities .
abu azmi of the samajwadi party who tried to snatch the bill copy says his party will oppose the introduction of the bill unless weaker sections are included . “ we are opposing the bill .
in what manner they have brought the bill ?
we are opposing it .
and we will continue to do so till where ?
until we get reservation for ladies dalit , obcs and muslims ” so the step towards gender justice , howsoever tentative and lacking any real support in the ruling coalition , might take quite a while .
political columnist monobina gupta explains , “ it will take a lot of courage and political will to restore the gender imbalance which is now evident in parliament .
at present barring two parties all others – centrist , leftist and rightist are publicly supporting the bill on the floor of parliament .
but in private all of them are scared that the male members and parties dominated by men , they would some time or the other lose their seats to women if 33 per cent reservation comes into effect . ”

the long-delayed women 's reservation bill was tabled in the rajya sabha or upper house of parliament amid dramatic scenes and protests by mps belonging to some parties . the bill ensures one in three mps will be a woman but there is still a long way to go before this becomes law as the lack of consensus among india ’ s parliamentarians has ensured that the legislation remains in cold storage .
agitated members from the samajwadi party tried to snatch the bill copy from law minister h r bhardwaj tuesday but congress members intervened and formed a human chain thus allowing the controversial bill to be introduced .
soon after it was presented in the rajya sabha or upper house of parliament amid high drama , the left parties that prop up the ruling united progressive alliance , were happy that the first hurdle for initiating the bill had been taken .
support from the left brinda karat , a leftist mp from the rajya sabha said that the standing committee should clear it within a specific timeframe and send it back to parliament .
“ there were scenes , there was opposition but it should not conceal the reality that there is a vast majority in favour of the bill .
that is what we have been saying .
we are very happy that the government has taken the first step to crossing the first hurdle to the bill .
and what we also want now is that the standing committee should finalise the bill in the shortest possible time . ”
the bill was first introduced in 1996 , by former prime minister deve gowda but his government could never muster political support for its passage .
the national democratic alliance government too tried during its tenure but failed to find enough support among the political parties .
even among the upa constituents today , there is no consensus and an attempt by prime minister manmohan singh to arrive at an agreement has proved futile .
calls for separate reservations some of the political groups blocking the bill have demanded separate reservations for women from muslim and dalit or low-caste communities .
abu azmi of the samajwadi party who tried to snatch the bill copy says his party will oppose the introduction of the bill unless weaker sections are included . “ we are opposing the bill .
in what manner they have brought the bill ?
we are opposing it .
and we will continue to do so till where ?
until we get reservation for ladies dalit , obcs and muslims ” so the step towards gender justice , howsoever tentative and lacking any real support in the ruling coalition , might take quite a while .
political columnist monobina gupta explains , “ it will take a lot of courage and political will to restore the gender imbalance which is now evident in parliament .
at present barring two parties all others – centrist , leftist and rightist are publicly supporting the bill on the floor of parliament .
but in private all of them are scared that the male members and parties dominated by men , they would some time or the other lose their seats to women if 33 per cent reservation comes into effect . ”

but some say the french want to have their cake and eat it . in his victory speech on may 6 , 2007 , sarkozy told thousands of people : " i do n't have the right to disappoint the country . "
but a year on , that 's exactly what the french president has done .
just over one third of the population say they support the new president , compared with some two-thirds 12 months ago .
to begin with , french voters were shocked by his hardly statesman-like behaviour with model carla bruni whom he married just weeks after divorcing his second wife cecilia in october .
he gave the impression of a man with his mind on ... well , on other things than the business of government .
beset by economic troubles and questions of style bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : sarkozy 's apparently whirlwind romance with carla bruni attracted negative publicity now the country is getting hit in the pocket and sarkozy is getting the blame .
he had pledged to boost spending power in his election campaign .

in march , french inflation rates reached a 17-year high of 3.2 percent .
in part , this was just bad luck .
the beginning of the president 's term in office also coincided with the onset of the global financial crisis and rocketing oil prices , helping to drive prices up .
the jury also seems to be out over the success of the flurry of reforms that he has introduced .
some analysts have praised his easing of france 's 35-hour week , his reduction of pension benefits and his reforms of the country 's overcrowded and impoverished universities .
" sarkozy had the courage to do what other presidents did n't , " philippe braud , a professor at the sciences po institute in paris , told afp news agency .
" his track record is not to be underestimated even if the french are n't convinced , " he added .
unemployment levels at historic low bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the president 's reforms sparked strikes among civil servants and railway workers in november .
braud also pointed to sarkozy 's achievement in streamlining france 's notoriously complicated labor laws .
the jobless rate has dropped to 7.5 percent , the lowest level in two decades , since he took office .
however , he said the president had announced too many projects at once and then not been able to deliver .
bruno jeanbart , of the opinionway polling institute , is of a similar opinion .
he praised sarkozy 's reform zeal , but also told afp that " there are also many areas he engaged in but in which he was perhaps too optimistic or has not followed through . "
he named these as spending power and the country 's public deficit .
other observers are more critical , saying that he bought the highly symbolic abolition of early pensions for civil servants by making expensive concessions and that rigid labor market structures remain largely untouched despite the shift away from a 35-hour week .
" he took over a country that was feeling insecure and which regarded him as the last chance to solve their structural problems , " said the political scientist dominique moisi .
" he failed to convince the french and offer them security . " a parliamentary report released this month also described as both costly and ineffective one of sarkozy 's flagship reforms , aimed at boosting incomes with a tax break on overtime pay .
the french conservative newspaper le figaro criticizes sarkozy only insofar as he did not make sufficiently clear that the changes would hurt .
" the french approve of the reforms of nicolas sarkozy , but condemn the reformer .

france - which is set to take over the rotating eu presidency in july - is also facing mounting pressure from other european union member states to slash its total public deficit of around 1.2 trillion euros .
he also knows that backing down from his reform program would cost him his remaining credibility .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de politics -pipe- 06.05.2008 one year on , hopes in french president plummet großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : sarkozy 's approval ratings could be better a year after his election win , french president nicolas sarkozy 's ratings have nosedived amid irritation at his flamboyant lifestyle and economic woes .
but some say the french want to have their cake and eat it . in his victory speech on may 6 , 2007 , sarkozy told thousands of people : " i do n't have the right to disappoint the country . "
but a year on , that 's exactly what the french president has done .
just over one third of the population say they support the new president , compared with some two-thirds 12 months ago .
to begin with , french voters were shocked by his hardly statesman-like behaviour with model carla bruni whom he married just weeks after divorcing his second wife cecilia in october .
he gave the impression of a man with his mind on ... well , on other things than the business of government .
beset by economic troubles and questions of style bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : sarkozy 's apparently whirlwind romance with carla bruni attracted negative publicity now the country is getting hit in the pocket and sarkozy is getting the blame .
he had pledged to boost spending power in his election campaign .
instead , it has dropped .
in march , french inflation rates reached a 17-year high of 3.2 percent .
in part , this was just bad luck .
the beginning of the president 's term in office also coincided with the onset of the global financial crisis and rocketing oil prices , helping to drive prices up .
the jury also seems to be out over the success of the flurry of reforms that he has introduced .
some analysts have praised his easing of france 's 35-hour week , his reduction of pension benefits and his reforms of the country 's overcrowded and impoverished universities .
" sarkozy had the courage to do what other presidents did n't , " philippe braud , a professor at the sciences po institute in paris , told afp news agency .
" his track record is not to be underestimated even if the french are n't convinced , " he added .
unemployment levels at historic low bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the president 's reforms sparked strikes among civil servants and railway workers in november .
braud also pointed to sarkozy 's achievement in streamlining france 's notoriously complicated labor laws .
the jobless rate has dropped to 7.5 percent , the lowest level in two decades , since he took office .
however , he said the president had announced too many projects at once and then not been able to deliver .
bruno jeanbart , of the opinionway polling institute , is of a similar opinion .
he praised sarkozy 's reform zeal , but also told afp that " there are also many areas he engaged in but in which he was perhaps too optimistic or has not followed through . "
he named these as spending power and the country 's public deficit .
other observers are more critical , saying that he bought the highly symbolic abolition of early pensions for civil servants by making expensive concessions and that rigid labor market structures remain largely untouched despite the shift away from a 35-hour week .
" he took over a country that was feeling insecure and which regarded him as the last chance to solve their structural problems , " said the political scientist dominique moisi .
" he failed to convince the french and offer them security . " a parliamentary report released this month also described as both costly and ineffective one of sarkozy 's flagship reforms , aimed at boosting incomes with a tax break on overtime pay .
the french conservative newspaper le figaro criticizes sarkozy only insofar as he did not make sufficiently clear that the changes would hurt .
" the french approve of the reforms of nicolas sarkozy , but condemn the reformer .
they 're a bit like a child that pushes away the helping hand because it does n't like the bitter taste of the medicine , " it wrote .
sarkozy admits some of the problems are his fault bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : critics have also accused sarkozy of compromising france 's human rights profile for business contracts the french president is trying to regain the population 's confidence .
just a few days ago he confessed in a tv interview : " i have made mistakes . "
and sarkozy has learned something from them , cutting out , for example , his public strutting with carla .
but apart from tackling style issues , his options are limited .
there is no money to kickstart the floundering economy .
in january , he confessed that he could not do much to help because the state " coffers were empty . "
france - which is set to take over the rotating eu presidency in july - is also facing mounting pressure from other european union member states to slash its total public deficit of around 1.2 trillion euros .
he also knows that backing down from his reform program would cost him his remaining credibility .
" i am completely aware of the dissatisfaction , but i know where i want to take things , " said sarkozy .
the honeymoon may be over , but sarkozy is hoping to persuade the electorate of the merits of a long-term relationship .
he is asking them to be patient .
" the important ' rendezvous ' will come at the end of my five years in office , " said sarkozy . dw staff -lrb- jg -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

but one thing is apparent : the regime is unwilling to delay its planned referendum on the constitution , says dw 's tobias grote-beverborg . once again myanmar , formerly known as burma , is making headlines .
but not due to the referendum on the constitution which is meant to decide the country 's political future and is scheduled for saturday , may 10 .
instead , the country ruled by a military dictatorship is in the news because of the natural disaster , whose full effect remains unknown . cyclone nargis left behind a massive swathe of destruction in the country 's south , above all .
at least 15,000 people have been killed , according to official figures , while hundreds of thousands of people have been made homeless and are in need of food , water and medication .
the people are in such desperate straits that even the hard-hearted military regime must recognize that it ca n't cope with the catastrophe without foreign aid . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : tobias grote-beverborg it 's still unclear under what conditions the regime is accepting the aid .
it is , however , clear that the cyclone has upset the dictatorship 's plans .
the planned referendum on the constitution was meant to ensure a continuation of military rule and it was supposed to be passed in the manner typical of a dictatorship , tacitly and closed off from the rest of the world .
in the limelight but now the eyes of the world are on burma and foreign aid workers may end up as unwelcome election observers .
the junta hopes to avoid that by holding the vote as soon as possible - that is , keeping it on saturday .
it 's only allowing postponement of the vote in the regions hardest hit by the cyclone .
the junta has once more shown how cynically calculating it is , seeing as in terms of logistics alone , the dimensions of the catastrophe make an orderly referendum impossible . how long the regime can keep this farce going also depends on the conditions under which aid - and aid workers - is allowed into the country .
the military leaders may of course hope they can rely on their neighbors ; india and china have already promised comprehensive aid measures .
and neither will meddle in burma 's " internal affairs , " just as they have n't in the past .
hopes of an aceh scenario however , as the number of victims increases and the need for aid for the survivors becomes ever more urgent , the junta can not afford to reject further aid from abroad .
the huge contingent of foreign aid workers who became a presence in aceh , indonesia , after the tsunami catastrophe nearly four years ago led to an end to the bloody civil war there .
parallels to the situation in myanmar come to mind . discontent is already growing among the burmese due to the military 's apparent failings .
for one , people were n't warned sufficiently or far enough in advance about the extent of the approaching cyclone .
and now , national aid measures are moving sluggishly . the referendum desperately needs to be postponed .
one can only hope the referendum on the constitution takes place at a later date with international observers and that there will be truly free and fair elections in myanmar .
if that were the case , the catastrophe - however cynical this may sound - would also have done good . tobias grote-beverborg is the managing editor of asia programs at deutsche welle -lrb- ncy -rrb- . send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

one of its aims is to stop the far-right infiltrating sports ' clubs . " i 'm against nazis because they do n't appear to have learned anything from german history , " explains the german captain and chelsea midfielder in a 10-second soundbite on the web site netz-gegen-nazis -lrb- network against nazis -rrb- .
tv presenter marietta slomka and talk show host maybrit illner are among the other high-profile germans featured online . the interactive internet platform , launched by the german weekly newspaper die zeit on monday , may 5 , is at the heart of the project .
it contains extensive information about the subject - including up-to-date news reports about right-wing extremism - , a forum where users can seek advice and swap facts and links to advice centers and support groups .
" we 're aiming to create a nationwide forum where people who encounter far-right ideas in their day-to-day lives can give each other advice , " said giovanni di lorenzo , the newspaper 's editor-in-chief .
together we are strong bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : germany captain michael ballack is one of the campaign 's figureheads the weekly newspaper has joined forces with a number of other partners to forge the anti-far-right alliance .
the sporting organizations involved include the german olympic sports confederation -lrb- dosb -rrb- , the german soccer federation -lrb- dfb -rrb- and the german soccer league -lrb- dfl -rrb- .
media partners include the german broadcaster zdf and online portals , schuelervz , studivz and meinvz .
the involvement of the sporting bodies reflects rising concern about far-right parties using the cover of leisure activities to spread their ideas among young people , in particular .
" right-wing extremism poses a great threat to an association like the german soccer federation because of its clubs ' grass-roots and volunteer-based structures , " said the head of the dfb , theo zwanziger .
not just football tactics , but lessons for life bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : german soccer has already been involved in a number of anti-racist initiatives he added that the point of the network against nazis was to inform and to encourage civil courage .
" as well as teaching the one-two and the bicycle kick , we have to communicate the message that it is worthwhile living in a democratic state , " said zwanziger .
but it is not only the budding players who are being targeted ; he also mentioned special training sessions for coaches .
a number of high profile events will be taking place in games in both german football leagues on tuesday , may 6 , and wednesday , to publicize the initiative .
an ad featuring ballack 's soundbite will also be shown in all stadiums .
the dfb has also announced that the national squad would also be helping to spread this message in upcoming games against serbia and belarus . it did not reveal any further details .
ingo weiss , head of the german olympic sports confederation , said that it was about turning the 27 million or so dosb members into " vigilant lions " so that the horrors of the nazi era could never be repeated .
german integration minister maria boehmer welcomed the project .
in a statement she said that media and sport carried a particular responsibility in the fight against right-wing extremism and xenophobia because of their ability to reach a wide audience . dw staff -lrb- jg -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

however , the inclusion of some inductees with nazi connections stirred debate . the ambitious project , " a permanent celebration of our country 's greatest athletes , " according to the head of the german sport aid foundation , ann kathrin linsenhoff , will initially contain the names of 40 of germany 's sporting heroes , with potentially three to be added to the roll call every year .
the first sportsmen and women to enter the hall of fame , officially opened by president horst koehler and minister of the interior wolfgang schaeuble , were chosen by a 25-strong jury headed by schaeuble , which considered the nature of their sporting achievement , the legacy and impact of the person , their personal attributes and whether they were a good role model for future sports stars .
initial inductee list dominated by west german males the jury was presented with a list of 150 potential inductees which had been compiled by the german olympic sports alliance , the federation of german sports journalists and the german sport aid federation .

most of the 40 are male , the exceptions being germany 's first wimbledon tennis tournament winner cilly aussem , ski idol rosi mittermaier , a double olympic champion in 1976 , and track and field athlete ingrid mickler-becker .
there is only one sports star from the former east germany in the initial batch : four-time olympic swimming champion roland matthes .
given the gdr 's well-publicized doping program in sports , the jury appears to have erred on the side of caution in the initial round of inductions .
idols with nazi links cause unease however , the jury has not managed to completely avoid controversy .
the induction of five former members of the national socialist party has already caused some heated debate as to whether those associated with the nazis should be honored and has led to some calling the new project the " hall of shame . "

some villages have been almost totally eradicated and vast rice-growing areas wiped out .
the former capital rangoon , the country 's largest city , has been left without water and electricity .
germany 's foreign ministry announced in berlin on monday , may 5 , that it would channel the pledged funds through german aid organizations .
the aid is intended to provide emergency accommodation , drinking water , household utensils and mosquito nets .
foreign minister frank-walter steinmeier expressed his condolences to the families of those who had died .

" we 're prepared to move us navy assets to help find those who 've lost their lives , to help find the missing , to help stabilize the situation .
but in order to do so , the military junta must allow our disaster assessment teams into the country , " said the president . bush spokeswoman dana perino said that washington was worried because the junta had yet to answer a us visa request for an eight-person disaster aid response team -lsb- dart -rsb- whose mission would be to assess burma 's aid needs eu calls for aid to go straight to the needy bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the eu 's foreign policy experts urge burma to open up the european union echoed the calls for the burmese authorities to " make every effort to cooperate " with relief organisations after burma said aid teams would have to meet its conditions .

" the eu hopes that , in the interest of the population suffering from the emergency , the authorities will make every effort to cooperate with the international relief organizations , " it added . a burmese minister said tuesday that foreign aid teams wanting to come to the military-ruled nation after the devastating cyclone would have to negotiate with the regime to be granted access . but european commission spokesman amadeu altafaj told journalists in brussels : " the burmese authorities of course have to be cooperative , " referring to myanmar by its old name of burma . on monday , the european commission released an initial two million euros -lsb- $ 3 million -rsb- in emergency aid for victims of the weekend cyclone . military junta stalls after initial acceptance bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the burmese government have been accused of failing to issue timely weather warnings the scale of the disaster caused by cyclone nargis initially prompted a rare acceptance of external aid from the country 's diplomatically isolated government , which rejected such offers of help after the 2004 indian ocean tsunami .

now a game show created by an unlikely , if ubiquitous , german tv personality is taking foreign markets by storm . can an irreverent former butcher named stefan raab save german entertainment ?
so far , 12 countries have bought the adaptation rights to a german game show called " schlag den raab , " or " beat raab . "
the latest to sign on were croatia and denmark .
a uk version is currently in production and will air this spring .
the foreign title is " beat your host ; " the uk version is called " beat the star . " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : try beating raab at this as the original title implies , the german version involves pitting a selected contestant against 42-year-old stefan raab , a talk-show host and sort-of comedian who is arguably germany ’ s most ubiquitous television personality .
the contestant tries to beat raab in a marathon four- to five-hour competition that encompasses up to 15 varied disciplines , from the physical -lrb- box stacking , ice climbing , -rrb- to the mental -lrb- poker playing , knowledge quiz -rrb- to the silly -lrb- dropping peas into a bottle . -rrb- at stake : a heap of cash . the uk version , produced by a company called itv , will pit contestants against a changing array of stars , and the contest has been shortened to last just over an hour .
the german show was the most successful new start last year , pulling viewer ratings of around 31 percent of those aged 14 to 49 . whether the same ratings dream will come true for itv , as it has for raab 's german production firm brainpool , remains to be seen .
nonetheless , raab has managed to achieve something with this show that has been done only a handful of times in german tv history : crossing over to a broad international audience . the rapid ascent of stefan raab " most successful german tv shows are strongly based on regional identities , " said joan bleicher , professor for media studies at the university of hamburg .
" it just would n't translate to an international audience . " but the success of raab 's latest endeavor is unlikely to surprise anyone who has kept an eye on the german entertainment scene for the past decade . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : beat the raab is one of germany 's most successful tv shows raab 's rise on german television can only be described as meteoric .
as a vj on an german music-video channel viva in 1996 , he set himself apart with his ironic , often rude humor .
his irreverence quickly won him the admiration of germany ’ s youth . in 1999 he became host of a show he created , " tv total , " which still runs four nights a week .
it focuses on ridiculing television while pairing raab as a chat host with entertainers and musicians - often on the a-list - who perform live on his show . derisive humor a hit among youth but unlike most chat-show hosts , whose job descriptions fairly demand neutrality , raab is n't urbane or fawning . bulky and goateed , he looks a little bit like the butcher that he trained to be in his youth .
he is neither handsome nor well dressed , and is mostly found wearing jeans , untucked shirts , sneakers and a self-satisfied grin . raab also does n't shy from unleashing his derisive humor on the stars who take a seat on his couch , " which makes the youth market love him , " says university of hamburg 's bleicher . indeed , his brash and boorish style tends to divide the audience into " love him " and " hate him " camps , with the deciding factor apparently being age .
the fault line falls somewhere around age 30 . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : love him or hate him , there 's no escaping him " raab is very popular with people from 12 to 29 , " bleicher said .
" it 's what the program planners are aiming for . " meanwhile , " older people ca n't stand him , " bleicher asserts .
" they think he is too aggressive , too ironic , unattractive . … he is simply rude . " of insults and lawsuits certainly raab has gotten into some well publicized hot water by ignoring the usual conventions of politesse .
he once famously ridiculed a 16-year-old model named lisa loch -lrb- in german " loch " means " hole " -rrb- saying her name could make her a porno star ; a court made him pay the teenager 70,000 euros -lrb- $ 108,000 -rrb- in damages . in a similar 2004 misstep , he showed a picture of a young turkish mother holding her child ’ s schoolbag , and quipped , " the drug traffickers are getting better and better at disguising themselves . "
that joke cost him 20,000 euros . the legal troubles seem to have had their effect , and in recent years raab has n't landed in court .
or perhaps he has just been too busy building a major entertainment empire to think up anything actionable . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the winner takes it all ...
in addition to " tv total " - which regularly sees raab paired and poking fun at celebrities on the caliber of elton john , jackie chan , eminem , kylie minogue , ben stiller , and will smith - raab 's broadcaster , the private channel pro7 , has given him free rein to create a series of entertainment " events . " quick ride in a slippery wok these usually land in prime-time slots , and run the gamut from the wacky -lrb- an annual sports event called the " wok world championship , " in which celebrities take a bobsled run while seated in an enormous cooking wok , -rrb- to the iconoclastic -lrb- a takeoff on germany ’ s version of the " american idol " show with the tongue-in-cheek name " ssdsdss , " or " stefan seeks the superstar who can sing what he or she wants " -rrb- ; the unlikely -lrb- the " bundesvision song contest , " pitting unknown bands from germany 's 16 federal states , -rrb- to the over-the-top -lrb- a project in the works called " autoball , " which involves an arena , two cars and a giant soccer ball . -rrb- moreover , raab is respected for his musical talent ; he is a self-taught musician with his own record label , which he uses to produce and promote the talent that he discovers in his contests and features on his talk show .
he was also deeply involved in the eurovision song contest , where he has been both a contestant and a promoter , and has written and cut a few hit novelty songs . a closed culture system ? if raab sounds like a one man entertainment band , or an apolitical silvio berlusconi , it 's because he is .
and like him or hate him , most people admire his ability to take the pulse of german pop culture and turn it into a sackful of euros , if nothing else . it leads to a not infrequent use of the word " genius . " in an awed 2007 article on raab in respected german newspaper die zeit , pro7 executive jobst benthues said that what raab does is " big entertaiment .
he is a genius of thinking of things first , and we give him the freedom to try things out . his successes validate our trust . " media historian bleicher agrees . " he is a genius at selling himself and his ideas , and combining several aspects of the media economy , " bleicher says .
" he combines diverse formats , like a big media conglomerate .
but he is just one person . " jennifer abramsohn send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

his irreverence quickly won him the admiration of germany ’ s youth . in 1999 he became host of a show he created , " tv total , " which still runs four nights a week .
it focuses on ridiculing television while pairing raab as a chat host with entertainers and musicians - often on the a-list - who perform live on his show . derisive humor a hit among youth but unlike most chat-show hosts , whose job descriptions fairly demand neutrality , raab is n't urbane or fawning . bulky and goateed , he looks a little bit like the butcher that he trained to be in his youth .
he is neither handsome nor well dressed , and is mostly found wearing jeans , untucked shirts , sneakers and a self-satisfied grin . raab also does n't shy from unleashing his derisive humor on the stars who take a seat on his couch , " which makes the youth market love him , " says university of hamburg 's bleicher . indeed , his brash and boorish style tends to divide the audience into " love him " and " hate him " camps , with the deciding factor apparently being age .

he once famously ridiculed a 16-year-old model named lisa loch -lrb- in german " loch " means " hole " -rrb- saying her name could make her a porno star ; a court made him pay the teenager 70,000 euros -lrb- $ 108,000 -rrb- in damages . in a similar 2004 misstep , he showed a picture of a young turkish mother holding her child ’ s schoolbag , and quipped , " the drug traffickers are getting better and better at disguising themselves .

now a game show created by an unlikely , if ubiquitous , german tv personality is taking foreign markets by storm . can an irreverent former butcher named stefan raab save german entertainment ?
so far , 12 countries have bought the adaptation rights to a german game show called " schlag den raab , " or " beat raab . "
the latest to sign on were croatia and denmark .
a uk version is currently in production and will air this spring .
the foreign title is " beat your host ; " the uk version is called " beat the star . " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : try beating raab at this as the original title implies , the german version involves pitting a selected contestant against 42-year-old stefan raab , a talk-show host and sort-of comedian who is arguably germany ’ s most ubiquitous television personality .
the contestant tries to beat raab in a marathon four- to five-hour competition that encompasses up to 15 varied disciplines , from the physical -lrb- box stacking , ice climbing , -rrb- to the mental -lrb- poker playing , knowledge quiz -rrb- to the silly -lrb- dropping peas into a bottle . -rrb- at stake : a heap of cash . the uk version , produced by a company called itv , will pit contestants against a changing array of stars , and the contest has been shortened to last just over an hour .
the german show was the most successful new start last year , pulling viewer ratings of around 31 percent of those aged 14 to 49 . whether the same ratings dream will come true for itv , as it has for raab 's german production firm brainpool , remains to be seen .
nonetheless , raab has managed to achieve something with this show that has been done only a handful of times in german tv history : crossing over to a broad international audience . the rapid ascent of stefan raab " most successful german tv shows are strongly based on regional identities , " said joan bleicher , professor for media studies at the university of hamburg .

the german show was the most successful new start last year , pulling viewer ratings of around 31 percent of those aged 14 to 49 . whether the same ratings dream will come true for itv , as it has for raab 's german production firm brainpool , remains to be seen .
nonetheless , raab has managed to achieve something with this show that has been done only a handful of times in german tv history : crossing over to a broad international audience . the rapid ascent of stefan raab " most successful german tv shows are strongly based on regional identities , " said joan bleicher , professor for media studies at the university of hamburg .
" it just would n't translate to an international audience . " but the success of raab 's latest endeavor is unlikely to surprise anyone who has kept an eye on the german entertainment scene for the past decade . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : beat the raab is one of germany 's most successful tv shows raab 's rise on german television can only be described as meteoric .
as a vj on an german music-video channel viva in 1996 , he set himself apart with his ironic , often rude humor .
his irreverence quickly won him the admiration of germany ’ s youth . in 1999 he became host of a show he created , " tv total , " which still runs four nights a week .
it focuses on ridiculing television while pairing raab as a chat host with entertainers and musicians - often on the a-list - who perform live on his show . derisive humor a hit among youth but unlike most chat-show hosts , whose job descriptions fairly demand neutrality , raab is n't urbane or fawning . bulky and goateed , he looks a little bit like the butcher that he trained to be in his youth .
he is neither handsome nor well dressed , and is mostly found wearing jeans , untucked shirts , sneakers and a self-satisfied grin . raab also does n't shy from unleashing his derisive humor on the stars who take a seat on his couch , " which makes the youth market love him , " says university of hamburg 's bleicher . indeed , his brash and boorish style tends to divide the audience into " love him " and " hate him " camps , with the deciding factor apparently being age .
the fault line falls somewhere around age 30 . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : love him or hate him , there 's no escaping him " raab is very popular with people from 12 to 29 , " bleicher said .
" it 's what the program planners are aiming for . " meanwhile , " older people ca n't stand him , " bleicher asserts .
" they think he is too aggressive , too ironic , unattractive . … he is simply rude . " of insults and lawsuits certainly raab has gotten into some well publicized hot water by ignoring the usual conventions of politesse .
he once famously ridiculed a 16-year-old model named lisa loch -lrb- in german " loch " means " hole " -rrb- saying her name could make her a porno star ; a court made him pay the teenager 70,000 euros -lrb- $ 108,000 -rrb- in damages . in a similar 2004 misstep , he showed a picture of a young turkish mother holding her child ’ s schoolbag , and quipped , " the drug traffickers are getting better and better at disguising themselves . "
that joke cost him 20,000 euros . the legal troubles seem to have had their effect , and in recent years raab has n't landed in court .
or perhaps he has just been too busy building a major entertainment empire to think up anything actionable . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the winner takes it all ...
in addition to " tv total " - which regularly sees raab paired and poking fun at celebrities on the caliber of elton john , jackie chan , eminem , kylie minogue , ben stiller , and will smith - raab 's broadcaster , the private channel pro7 , has given him free rein to create a series of entertainment " events . " quick ride in a slippery wok these usually land in prime-time slots , and run the gamut from the wacky -lrb- an annual sports event called the " wok world championship , " in which celebrities take a bobsled run while seated in an enormous cooking wok , -rrb- to the iconoclastic -lrb- a takeoff on germany ’ s version of the " american idol " show with the tongue-in-cheek name " ssdsdss , " or " stefan seeks the superstar who can sing what he or she wants " -rrb- ; the unlikely -lrb- the " bundesvision song contest , " pitting unknown bands from germany 's 16 federal states , -rrb- to the over-the-top -lrb- a project in the works called " autoball , " which involves an arena , two cars and a giant soccer ball . -rrb- moreover , raab is respected for his musical talent ; he is a self-taught musician with his own record label , which he uses to produce and promote the talent that he discovers in his contests and features on his talk show .
he was also deeply involved in the eurovision song contest , where he has been both a contestant and a promoter , and has written and cut a few hit novelty songs . a closed culture system ? if raab sounds like a one man entertainment band , or an apolitical silvio berlusconi , it 's because he is .
and like him or hate him , most people admire his ability to take the pulse of german pop culture and turn it into a sackful of euros , if nothing else . it leads to a not infrequent use of the word " genius . " in an awed 2007 article on raab in respected german newspaper die zeit , pro7 executive jobst benthues said that what raab does is " big entertaiment .
he is a genius of thinking of things first , and we give him the freedom to try things out . his successes validate our trust . " media historian bleicher agrees . " he is a genius at selling himself and his ideas , and combining several aspects of the media economy , " bleicher says .
" he combines diverse formats , like a big media conglomerate .

however , the inclusion of some inductees with nazi connections stirred debate . the ambitious project , " a permanent celebration of our country 's greatest athletes , " according to the head of the german sport aid foundation , ann kathrin linsenhoff , will initially contain the names of 40 of germany 's sporting heroes , with potentially three to be added to the roll call every year .
the first sportsmen and women to enter the hall of fame , officially opened by president horst koehler and minister of the interior wolfgang schaeuble , were chosen by a 25-strong jury headed by schaeuble , which considered the nature of their sporting achievement , the legacy and impact of the person , their personal attributes and whether they were a good role model for future sports stars .
initial inductee list dominated by west german males the jury was presented with a list of 150 potential inductees which had been compiled by the german olympic sports alliance , the federation of german sports journalists and the german sport aid federation .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : former showjumper hans guenter winkler with his portrait the final list of 40 , which includes the likes of boxing legend max schmeling , soccer ambassador franz beckenbauer and tennis idol gottfried von cramm , features 32 posthumous inductees .
most of the 40 are male , the exceptions being germany 's first wimbledon tennis tournament winner cilly aussem , ski idol rosi mittermaier , a double olympic champion in 1976 , and track and field athlete ingrid mickler-becker .
there is only one sports star from the former east germany in the initial batch : four-time olympic swimming champion roland matthes .
given the gdr 's well-publicized doping program in sports , the jury appears to have erred on the side of caution in the initial round of inductions .
idols with nazi links cause unease however , the jury has not managed to completely avoid controversy .
the induction of five former members of the national socialist party has already caused some heated debate as to whether those associated with the nazis should be honored and has led to some calling the new project the " hall of shame . "
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : sport aid founder neckermann had nazi links cyclist gustav kilian , athlete rudolf harbig , former german olympic president willi daume and the founder of the german sport aid foundation , josef neckermann , as well as sepp herberger , coach of the 1954 world cup winning soccer team , " the wonders of bern , " all had connections to the third reich during world war ii .
" we do not see the hall of fame as being tarnished by this , " ann kathrin linsenhoff told reporters .
" in fact it is the opposite .
this is useful in the processing of our past through sport .
to exclude those who had connections with the national socialists would be an act of arrogance by a generation which has had the luck to grow up in a democracy .

however , the inclusion of some inductees with nazi connections stirred debate . the ambitious project , " a permanent celebration of our country 's greatest athletes , " according to the head of the german sport aid foundation , ann kathrin linsenhoff , will initially contain the names of 40 of germany 's sporting heroes , with potentially three to be added to the roll call every year .
the first sportsmen and women to enter the hall of fame , officially opened by president horst koehler and minister of the interior wolfgang schaeuble , were chosen by a 25-strong jury headed by schaeuble , which considered the nature of their sporting achievement , the legacy and impact of the person , their personal attributes and whether they were a good role model for future sports stars .

however , the inclusion of some inductees with nazi connections stirred debate . the ambitious project , " a permanent celebration of our country 's greatest athletes , " according to the head of the german sport aid foundation , ann kathrin linsenhoff , will initially contain the names of 40 of germany 's sporting heroes , with potentially three to be added to the roll call every year .
the first sportsmen and women to enter the hall of fame , officially opened by president horst koehler and minister of the interior wolfgang schaeuble , were chosen by a 25-strong jury headed by schaeuble , which considered the nature of their sporting achievement , the legacy and impact of the person , their personal attributes and whether they were a good role model for future sports stars .
initial inductee list dominated by west german males the jury was presented with a list of 150 potential inductees which had been compiled by the german olympic sports alliance , the federation of german sports journalists and the german sport aid federation .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : former showjumper hans guenter winkler with his portrait the final list of 40 , which includes the likes of boxing legend max schmeling , soccer ambassador franz beckenbauer and tennis idol gottfried von cramm , features 32 posthumous inductees .
most of the 40 are male , the exceptions being germany 's first wimbledon tennis tournament winner cilly aussem , ski idol rosi mittermaier , a double olympic champion in 1976 , and track and field athlete ingrid mickler-becker .
there is only one sports star from the former east germany in the initial batch : four-time olympic swimming champion roland matthes .
given the gdr 's well-publicized doping program in sports , the jury appears to have erred on the side of caution in the initial round of inductions .
idols with nazi links cause unease however , the jury has not managed to completely avoid controversy .
the induction of five former members of the national socialist party has already caused some heated debate as to whether those associated with the nazis should be honored and has led to some calling the new project the " hall of shame . "
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : sport aid founder neckermann had nazi links cyclist gustav kilian , athlete rudolf harbig , former german olympic president willi daume and the founder of the german sport aid foundation , josef neckermann , as well as sepp herberger , coach of the 1954 world cup winning soccer team , " the wonders of bern , " all had connections to the third reich during world war ii .
" we do not see the hall of fame as being tarnished by this , " ann kathrin linsenhoff told reporters .
" in fact it is the opposite .
this is useful in the processing of our past through sport .
to exclude those who had connections with the national socialists would be an act of arrogance by a generation which has had the luck to grow up in a democracy .

the foreign title is " beat your host ; " the uk version is called " beat the star . " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : try beating raab at this as the original title implies , the german version involves pitting a selected contestant against 42-year-old stefan raab , a talk-show host and sort-of comedian who is arguably germany ’ s most ubiquitous television personality .
the contestant tries to beat raab in a marathon four- to five-hour competition that encompasses up to 15 varied disciplines , from the physical -lrb- box stacking , ice climbing , -rrb- to the mental -lrb- poker playing , knowledge quiz -rrb- to the silly -lrb- dropping peas into a bottle . -rrb- at stake : a heap of cash . the uk version , produced by a company called itv , will pit contestants against a changing array of stars , and the contest has been shortened to last just over an hour .
the german show was the most successful new start last year , pulling viewer ratings of around 31 percent of those aged 14 to 49 . whether the same ratings dream will come true for itv , as it has for raab 's german production firm brainpool , remains to be seen .
nonetheless , raab has managed to achieve something with this show that has been done only a handful of times in german tv history : crossing over to a broad international audience . the rapid ascent of stefan raab " most successful german tv shows are strongly based on regional identities , " said joan bleicher , professor for media studies at the university of hamburg .
" it just would n't translate to an international audience . " but the success of raab 's latest endeavor is unlikely to surprise anyone who has kept an eye on the german entertainment scene for the past decade . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : beat the raab is one of germany 's most successful tv shows raab 's rise on german television can only be described as meteoric .
as a vj on an german music-video channel viva in 1996 , he set himself apart with his ironic , often rude humor .
his irreverence quickly won him the admiration of germany ’ s youth . in 1999 he became host of a show he created , " tv total , " which still runs four nights a week .
it focuses on ridiculing television while pairing raab as a chat host with entertainers and musicians - often on the a-list - who perform live on his show . derisive humor a hit among youth but unlike most chat-show hosts , whose job descriptions fairly demand neutrality , raab is n't urbane or fawning . bulky and goateed , he looks a little bit like the butcher that he trained to be in his youth .
he is neither handsome nor well dressed , and is mostly found wearing jeans , untucked shirts , sneakers and a self-satisfied grin . raab also does n't shy from unleashing his derisive humor on the stars who take a seat on his couch , " which makes the youth market love him , " says university of hamburg 's bleicher . indeed , his brash and boorish style tends to divide the audience into " love him " and " hate him " camps , with the deciding factor apparently being age .
the fault line falls somewhere around age 30 . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : love him or hate him , there 's no escaping him " raab is very popular with people from 12 to 29 , " bleicher said .
" it 's what the program planners are aiming for . " meanwhile , " older people ca n't stand him , " bleicher asserts .
" they think he is too aggressive , too ironic , unattractive . … he is simply rude . " of insults and lawsuits certainly raab has gotten into some well publicized hot water by ignoring the usual conventions of politesse .
he once famously ridiculed a 16-year-old model named lisa loch -lrb- in german " loch " means " hole " -rrb- saying her name could make her a porno star ; a court made him pay the teenager 70,000 euros -lrb- $ 108,000 -rrb- in damages . in a similar 2004 misstep , he showed a picture of a young turkish mother holding her child ’ s schoolbag , and quipped , " the drug traffickers are getting better and better at disguising themselves . "
that joke cost him 20,000 euros . the legal troubles seem to have had their effect , and in recent years raab has n't landed in court .
or perhaps he has just been too busy building a major entertainment empire to think up anything actionable . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the winner takes it all ...
in addition to " tv total " - which regularly sees raab paired and poking fun at celebrities on the caliber of elton john , jackie chan , eminem , kylie minogue , ben stiller , and will smith - raab 's broadcaster , the private channel pro7 , has given him free rein to create a series of entertainment " events . " quick ride in a slippery wok these usually land in prime-time slots , and run the gamut from the wacky -lrb- an annual sports event called the " wok world championship , " in which celebrities take a bobsled run while seated in an enormous cooking wok , -rrb- to the iconoclastic -lrb- a takeoff on germany ’ s version of the " american idol " show with the tongue-in-cheek name " ssdsdss , " or " stefan seeks the superstar who can sing what he or she wants " -rrb- ; the unlikely -lrb- the " bundesvision song contest , " pitting unknown bands from germany 's 16 federal states , -rrb- to the over-the-top -lrb- a project in the works called " autoball , " which involves an arena , two cars and a giant soccer ball . -rrb- moreover , raab is respected for his musical talent ; he is a self-taught musician with his own record label , which he uses to produce and promote the talent that he discovers in his contests and features on his talk show .
he was also deeply involved in the eurovision song contest , where he has been both a contestant and a promoter , and has written and cut a few hit novelty songs . a closed culture system ? if raab sounds like a one man entertainment band , or an apolitical silvio berlusconi , it 's because he is .
and like him or hate him , most people admire his ability to take the pulse of german pop culture and turn it into a sackful of euros , if nothing else . it leads to a not infrequent use of the word " genius . " in an awed 2007 article on raab in respected german newspaper die zeit , pro7 executive jobst benthues said that what raab does is " big entertaiment .
he is a genius of thinking of things first , and we give him the freedom to try things out . his successes validate our trust . " media historian bleicher agrees . " he is a genius at selling himself and his ideas , and combining several aspects of the media economy , " bleicher says .
" he combines diverse formats , like a big media conglomerate .
but he is just one person . " jennifer abramsohn send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de opinion -pipe- 06.05.2008 opinion : burma 's dictatorship in the hot seat großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the full extent of the disaster caused by cyclone nargis in burma remains unclear .
but one thing is apparent : the regime is unwilling to delay its planned referendum on the constitution , says dw 's tobias grote-beverborg . once again myanmar , formerly known as burma , is making headlines .
but not due to the referendum on the constitution which is meant to decide the country 's political future and is scheduled for saturday , may 10 .
instead , the country ruled by a military dictatorship is in the news because of the natural disaster , whose full effect remains unknown . cyclone nargis left behind a massive swathe of destruction in the country 's south , above all .
at least 15,000 people have been killed , according to official figures , while hundreds of thousands of people have been made homeless and are in need of food , water and medication .
the people are in such desperate straits that even the hard-hearted military regime must recognize that it ca n't cope with the catastrophe without foreign aid . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : tobias grote-beverborg it 's still unclear under what conditions the regime is accepting the aid .
it is , however , clear that the cyclone has upset the dictatorship 's plans .
the planned referendum on the constitution was meant to ensure a continuation of military rule and it was supposed to be passed in the manner typical of a dictatorship , tacitly and closed off from the rest of the world .
in the limelight but now the eyes of the world are on burma and foreign aid workers may end up as unwelcome election observers .
the junta hopes to avoid that by holding the vote as soon as possible - that is , keeping it on saturday .
it 's only allowing postponement of the vote in the regions hardest hit by the cyclone .
the junta has once more shown how cynically calculating it is , seeing as in terms of logistics alone , the dimensions of the catastrophe make an orderly referendum impossible . how long the regime can keep this farce going also depends on the conditions under which aid - and aid workers - is allowed into the country .
the military leaders may of course hope they can rely on their neighbors ; india and china have already promised comprehensive aid measures .
and neither will meddle in burma 's " internal affairs , " just as they have n't in the past .
hopes of an aceh scenario however , as the number of victims increases and the need for aid for the survivors becomes ever more urgent , the junta can not afford to reject further aid from abroad .
the huge contingent of foreign aid workers who became a presence in aceh , indonesia , after the tsunami catastrophe nearly four years ago led to an end to the bloody civil war there .
parallels to the situation in myanmar come to mind . discontent is already growing among the burmese due to the military 's apparent failings .
for one , people were n't warned sufficiently or far enough in advance about the extent of the approaching cyclone .
and now , national aid measures are moving sluggishly . the referendum desperately needs to be postponed .
one can only hope the referendum on the constitution takes place at a later date with international observers and that there will be truly free and fair elections in myanmar .
if that were the case , the catastrophe - however cynical this may sound - would also have done good . tobias grote-beverborg is the managing editor of asia programs at deutsche welle -lrb- ncy -rrb- . send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

but one thing is apparent : the regime is unwilling to delay its planned referendum on the constitution , says dw 's tobias grote-beverborg . once again myanmar , formerly known as burma , is making headlines .
but not due to the referendum on the constitution which is meant to decide the country 's political future and is scheduled for saturday , may 10 .
instead , the country ruled by a military dictatorship is in the news because of the natural disaster , whose full effect remains unknown . cyclone nargis left behind a massive swathe of destruction in the country 's south , above all .
at least 15,000 people have been killed , according to official figures , while hundreds of thousands of people have been made homeless and are in need of food , water and medication .
the people are in such desperate straits that even the hard-hearted military regime must recognize that it ca n't cope with the catastrophe without foreign aid . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : tobias grote-beverborg it 's still unclear under what conditions the regime is accepting the aid .
it is , however , clear that the cyclone has upset the dictatorship 's plans .
the planned referendum on the constitution was meant to ensure a continuation of military rule and it was supposed to be passed in the manner typical of a dictatorship , tacitly and closed off from the rest of the world .
in the limelight but now the eyes of the world are on burma and foreign aid workers may end up as unwelcome election observers .
the junta hopes to avoid that by holding the vote as soon as possible - that is , keeping it on saturday .
it 's only allowing postponement of the vote in the regions hardest hit by the cyclone .
the junta has once more shown how cynically calculating it is , seeing as in terms of logistics alone , the dimensions of the catastrophe make an orderly referendum impossible . how long the regime can keep this farce going also depends on the conditions under which aid - and aid workers - is allowed into the country .
the military leaders may of course hope they can rely on their neighbors ; india and china have already promised comprehensive aid measures .
and neither will meddle in burma 's " internal affairs , " just as they have n't in the past .
hopes of an aceh scenario however , as the number of victims increases and the need for aid for the survivors becomes ever more urgent , the junta can not afford to reject further aid from abroad .
the huge contingent of foreign aid workers who became a presence in aceh , indonesia , after the tsunami catastrophe nearly four years ago led to an end to the bloody civil war there .
parallels to the situation in myanmar come to mind . discontent is already growing among the burmese due to the military 's apparent failings .
for one , people were n't warned sufficiently or far enough in advance about the extent of the approaching cyclone .
and now , national aid measures are moving sluggishly . the referendum desperately needs to be postponed .
one can only hope the referendum on the constitution takes place at a later date with international observers and that there will be truly free and fair elections in myanmar .
if that were the case , the catastrophe - however cynical this may sound - would also have done good . tobias grote-beverborg is the managing editor of asia programs at deutsche welle -lrb- ncy -rrb- . send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

but one thing is apparent : the regime is unwilling to delay its planned referendum on the constitution , says dw 's tobias grote-beverborg . once again myanmar , formerly known as burma , is making headlines .
but not due to the referendum on the constitution which is meant to decide the country 's political future and is scheduled for saturday , may 10 .
instead , the country ruled by a military dictatorship is in the news because of the natural disaster , whose full effect remains unknown . cyclone nargis left behind a massive swathe of destruction in the country 's south , above all .
at least 15,000 people have been killed , according to official figures , while hundreds of thousands of people have been made homeless and are in need of food , water and medication .
the people are in such desperate straits that even the hard-hearted military regime must recognize that it ca n't cope with the catastrophe without foreign aid . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : tobias grote-beverborg it 's still unclear under what conditions the regime is accepting the aid .
it is , however , clear that the cyclone has upset the dictatorship 's plans .
the planned referendum on the constitution was meant to ensure a continuation of military rule and it was supposed to be passed in the manner typical of a dictatorship , tacitly and closed off from the rest of the world .
in the limelight but now the eyes of the world are on burma and foreign aid workers may end up as unwelcome election observers .
the junta hopes to avoid that by holding the vote as soon as possible - that is , keeping it on saturday .
it 's only allowing postponement of the vote in the regions hardest hit by the cyclone .
the junta has once more shown how cynically calculating it is , seeing as in terms of logistics alone , the dimensions of the catastrophe make an orderly referendum impossible . how long the regime can keep this farce going also depends on the conditions under which aid - and aid workers - is allowed into the country .
the military leaders may of course hope they can rely on their neighbors ; india and china have already promised comprehensive aid measures .
and neither will meddle in burma 's " internal affairs , " just as they have n't in the past .
hopes of an aceh scenario however , as the number of victims increases and the need for aid for the survivors becomes ever more urgent , the junta can not afford to reject further aid from abroad .
the huge contingent of foreign aid workers who became a presence in aceh , indonesia , after the tsunami catastrophe nearly four years ago led to an end to the bloody civil war there .
parallels to the situation in myanmar come to mind . discontent is already growing among the burmese due to the military 's apparent failings .
for one , people were n't warned sufficiently or far enough in advance about the extent of the approaching cyclone .
and now , national aid measures are moving sluggishly . the referendum desperately needs to be postponed .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de media -pipe- 06.05.2008 germany 's market busting tv star raab goes global großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : raab 's desire to win makes him an ideal competitor - and entertainment mogul imported shows have long been a staple of german tv , but the reverse is rarely true .
now a game show created by an unlikely , if ubiquitous , german tv personality is taking foreign markets by storm . can an irreverent former butcher named stefan raab save german entertainment ?
so far , 12 countries have bought the adaptation rights to a german game show called " schlag den raab , " or " beat raab . "
the latest to sign on were croatia and denmark .
a uk version is currently in production and will air this spring .
the foreign title is " beat your host ; " the uk version is called " beat the star . " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : try beating raab at this as the original title implies , the german version involves pitting a selected contestant against 42-year-old stefan raab , a talk-show host and sort-of comedian who is arguably germany ’ s most ubiquitous television personality .
the contestant tries to beat raab in a marathon four- to five-hour competition that encompasses up to 15 varied disciplines , from the physical -lrb- box stacking , ice climbing , -rrb- to the mental -lrb- poker playing , knowledge quiz -rrb- to the silly -lrb- dropping peas into a bottle . -rrb- at stake : a heap of cash . the uk version , produced by a company called itv , will pit contestants against a changing array of stars , and the contest has been shortened to last just over an hour .
the german show was the most successful new start last year , pulling viewer ratings of around 31 percent of those aged 14 to 49 . whether the same ratings dream will come true for itv , as it has for raab 's german production firm brainpool , remains to be seen .
nonetheless , raab has managed to achieve something with this show that has been done only a handful of times in german tv history : crossing over to a broad international audience . the rapid ascent of stefan raab " most successful german tv shows are strongly based on regional identities , " said joan bleicher , professor for media studies at the university of hamburg .
" it just would n't translate to an international audience . " but the success of raab 's latest endeavor is unlikely to surprise anyone who has kept an eye on the german entertainment scene for the past decade . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : beat the raab is one of germany 's most successful tv shows raab 's rise on german television can only be described as meteoric .
as a vj on an german music-video channel viva in 1996 , he set himself apart with his ironic , often rude humor .
his irreverence quickly won him the admiration of germany ’ s youth . in 1999 he became host of a show he created , " tv total , " which still runs four nights a week .
it focuses on ridiculing television while pairing raab as a chat host with entertainers and musicians - often on the a-list - who perform live on his show . derisive humor a hit among youth but unlike most chat-show hosts , whose job descriptions fairly demand neutrality , raab is n't urbane or fawning . bulky and goateed , he looks a little bit like the butcher that he trained to be in his youth .
he is neither handsome nor well dressed , and is mostly found wearing jeans , untucked shirts , sneakers and a self-satisfied grin . raab also does n't shy from unleashing his derisive humor on the stars who take a seat on his couch , " which makes the youth market love him , " says university of hamburg 's bleicher . indeed , his brash and boorish style tends to divide the audience into " love him " and " hate him " camps , with the deciding factor apparently being age .
the fault line falls somewhere around age 30 . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : love him or hate him , there 's no escaping him " raab is very popular with people from 12 to 29 , " bleicher said .
" it 's what the program planners are aiming for . " meanwhile , " older people ca n't stand him , " bleicher asserts .
" they think he is too aggressive , too ironic , unattractive . … he is simply rude . " of insults and lawsuits certainly raab has gotten into some well publicized hot water by ignoring the usual conventions of politesse .
he once famously ridiculed a 16-year-old model named lisa loch -lrb- in german " loch " means " hole " -rrb- saying her name could make her a porno star ; a court made him pay the teenager 70,000 euros -lrb- $ 108,000 -rrb- in damages . in a similar 2004 misstep , he showed a picture of a young turkish mother holding her child ’ s schoolbag , and quipped , " the drug traffickers are getting better and better at disguising themselves . "
that joke cost him 20,000 euros . the legal troubles seem to have had their effect , and in recent years raab has n't landed in court .
or perhaps he has just been too busy building a major entertainment empire to think up anything actionable . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the winner takes it all ...
in addition to " tv total " - which regularly sees raab paired and poking fun at celebrities on the caliber of elton john , jackie chan , eminem , kylie minogue , ben stiller , and will smith - raab 's broadcaster , the private channel pro7 , has given him free rein to create a series of entertainment " events . " quick ride in a slippery wok these usually land in prime-time slots , and run the gamut from the wacky -lrb- an annual sports event called the " wok world championship , " in which celebrities take a bobsled run while seated in an enormous cooking wok , -rrb- to the iconoclastic -lrb- a takeoff on germany ’ s version of the " american idol " show with the tongue-in-cheek name " ssdsdss , " or " stefan seeks the superstar who can sing what he or she wants " -rrb- ; the unlikely -lrb- the " bundesvision song contest , " pitting unknown bands from germany 's 16 federal states , -rrb- to the over-the-top -lrb- a project in the works called " autoball , " which involves an arena , two cars and a giant soccer ball . -rrb- moreover , raab is respected for his musical talent ; he is a self-taught musician with his own record label , which he uses to produce and promote the talent that he discovers in his contests and features on his talk show .
he was also deeply involved in the eurovision song contest , where he has been both a contestant and a promoter , and has written and cut a few hit novelty songs . a closed culture system ? if raab sounds like a one man entertainment band , or an apolitical silvio berlusconi , it 's because he is .
and like him or hate him , most people admire his ability to take the pulse of german pop culture and turn it into a sackful of euros , if nothing else . it leads to a not infrequent use of the word " genius . " in an awed 2007 article on raab in respected german newspaper die zeit , pro7 executive jobst benthues said that what raab does is " big entertaiment .
he is a genius of thinking of things first , and we give him the freedom to try things out . his successes validate our trust . " media historian bleicher agrees . " he is a genius at selling himself and his ideas , and combining several aspects of the media economy , " bleicher says .
" he combines diverse formats , like a big media conglomerate .
but he is just one person . " jennifer abramsohn send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de media -pipe- 06.05.2008 germany 's market busting tv star raab goes global großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : raab 's desire to win makes him an ideal competitor - and entertainment mogul imported shows have long been a staple of german tv , but the reverse is rarely true .
now a game show created by an unlikely , if ubiquitous , german tv personality is taking foreign markets by storm . can an irreverent former butcher named stefan raab save german entertainment ?
so far , 12 countries have bought the adaptation rights to a german game show called " schlag den raab , " or " beat raab . "
the latest to sign on were croatia and denmark .
a uk version is currently in production and will air this spring .
the foreign title is " beat your host ; " the uk version is called " beat the star . " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : try beating raab at this as the original title implies , the german version involves pitting a selected contestant against 42-year-old stefan raab , a talk-show host and sort-of comedian who is arguably germany ’ s most ubiquitous television personality .
the contestant tries to beat raab in a marathon four- to five-hour competition that encompasses up to 15 varied disciplines , from the physical -lrb- box stacking , ice climbing , -rrb- to the mental -lrb- poker playing , knowledge quiz -rrb- to the silly -lrb- dropping peas into a bottle . -rrb- at stake : a heap of cash . the uk version , produced by a company called itv , will pit contestants against a changing array of stars , and the contest has been shortened to last just over an hour .
the german show was the most successful new start last year , pulling viewer ratings of around 31 percent of those aged 14 to 49 . whether the same ratings dream will come true for itv , as it has for raab 's german production firm brainpool , remains to be seen .
nonetheless , raab has managed to achieve something with this show that has been done only a handful of times in german tv history : crossing over to a broad international audience . the rapid ascent of stefan raab " most successful german tv shows are strongly based on regional identities , " said joan bleicher , professor for media studies at the university of hamburg .
" it just would n't translate to an international audience . " but the success of raab 's latest endeavor is unlikely to surprise anyone who has kept an eye on the german entertainment scene for the past decade . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : beat the raab is one of germany 's most successful tv shows raab 's rise on german television can only be described as meteoric .
as a vj on an german music-video channel viva in 1996 , he set himself apart with his ironic , often rude humor .
his irreverence quickly won him the admiration of germany ’ s youth . in 1999 he became host of a show he created , " tv total , " which still runs four nights a week .
it focuses on ridiculing television while pairing raab as a chat host with entertainers and musicians - often on the a-list - who perform live on his show . derisive humor a hit among youth but unlike most chat-show hosts , whose job descriptions fairly demand neutrality , raab is n't urbane or fawning . bulky and goateed , he looks a little bit like the butcher that he trained to be in his youth .
he is neither handsome nor well dressed , and is mostly found wearing jeans , untucked shirts , sneakers and a self-satisfied grin . raab also does n't shy from unleashing his derisive humor on the stars who take a seat on his couch , " which makes the youth market love him , " says university of hamburg 's bleicher . indeed , his brash and boorish style tends to divide the audience into " love him " and " hate him " camps , with the deciding factor apparently being age .
the fault line falls somewhere around age 30 . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : love him or hate him , there 's no escaping him " raab is very popular with people from 12 to 29 , " bleicher said .
" it 's what the program planners are aiming for . " meanwhile , " older people ca n't stand him , " bleicher asserts .
" they think he is too aggressive , too ironic , unattractive . … he is simply rude . " of insults and lawsuits certainly raab has gotten into some well publicized hot water by ignoring the usual conventions of politesse .
he once famously ridiculed a 16-year-old model named lisa loch -lrb- in german " loch " means " hole " -rrb- saying her name could make her a porno star ; a court made him pay the teenager 70,000 euros -lrb- $ 108,000 -rrb- in damages . in a similar 2004 misstep , he showed a picture of a young turkish mother holding her child ’ s schoolbag , and quipped , " the drug traffickers are getting better and better at disguising themselves . "
that joke cost him 20,000 euros . the legal troubles seem to have had their effect , and in recent years raab has n't landed in court .
or perhaps he has just been too busy building a major entertainment empire to think up anything actionable . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the winner takes it all ...
in addition to " tv total " - which regularly sees raab paired and poking fun at celebrities on the caliber of elton john , jackie chan , eminem , kylie minogue , ben stiller , and will smith - raab 's broadcaster , the private channel pro7 , has given him free rein to create a series of entertainment " events . " quick ride in a slippery wok these usually land in prime-time slots , and run the gamut from the wacky -lrb- an annual sports event called the " wok world championship , " in which celebrities take a bobsled run while seated in an enormous cooking wok , -rrb- to the iconoclastic -lrb- a takeoff on germany ’ s version of the " american idol " show with the tongue-in-cheek name " ssdsdss , " or " stefan seeks the superstar who can sing what he or she wants " -rrb- ; the unlikely -lrb- the " bundesvision song contest , " pitting unknown bands from germany 's 16 federal states , -rrb- to the over-the-top -lrb- a project in the works called " autoball , " which involves an arena , two cars and a giant soccer ball . -rrb- moreover , raab is respected for his musical talent ; he is a self-taught musician with his own record label , which he uses to produce and promote the talent that he discovers in his contests and features on his talk show .
he was also deeply involved in the eurovision song contest , where he has been both a contestant and a promoter , and has written and cut a few hit novelty songs . a closed culture system ? if raab sounds like a one man entertainment band , or an apolitical silvio berlusconi , it 's because he is .
and like him or hate him , most people admire his ability to take the pulse of german pop culture and turn it into a sackful of euros , if nothing else . it leads to a not infrequent use of the word " genius . " in an awed 2007 article on raab in respected german newspaper die zeit , pro7 executive jobst benthues said that what raab does is " big entertaiment .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de media -pipe- 06.05.2008 germany 's market busting tv star raab goes global großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : raab 's desire to win makes him an ideal competitor - and entertainment mogul imported shows have long been a staple of german tv , but the reverse is rarely true .
now a game show created by an unlikely , if ubiquitous , german tv personality is taking foreign markets by storm . can an irreverent former butcher named stefan raab save german entertainment ?
so far , 12 countries have bought the adaptation rights to a german game show called " schlag den raab , " or " beat raab . "
the latest to sign on were croatia and denmark .
a uk version is currently in production and will air this spring .
the foreign title is " beat your host ; " the uk version is called " beat the star . " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : try beating raab at this as the original title implies , the german version involves pitting a selected contestant against 42-year-old stefan raab , a talk-show host and sort-of comedian who is arguably germany ’ s most ubiquitous television personality .
the contestant tries to beat raab in a marathon four- to five-hour competition that encompasses up to 15 varied disciplines , from the physical -lrb- box stacking , ice climbing , -rrb- to the mental -lrb- poker playing , knowledge quiz -rrb- to the silly -lrb- dropping peas into a bottle . -rrb- at stake : a heap of cash . the uk version , produced by a company called itv , will pit contestants against a changing array of stars , and the contest has been shortened to last just over an hour .
the german show was the most successful new start last year , pulling viewer ratings of around 31 percent of those aged 14 to 49 . whether the same ratings dream will come true for itv , as it has for raab 's german production firm brainpool , remains to be seen .
nonetheless , raab has managed to achieve something with this show that has been done only a handful of times in german tv history : crossing over to a broad international audience . the rapid ascent of stefan raab " most successful german tv shows are strongly based on regional identities , " said joan bleicher , professor for media studies at the university of hamburg .
" it just would n't translate to an international audience . " but the success of raab 's latest endeavor is unlikely to surprise anyone who has kept an eye on the german entertainment scene for the past decade . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : beat the raab is one of germany 's most successful tv shows raab 's rise on german television can only be described as meteoric .
as a vj on an german music-video channel viva in 1996 , he set himself apart with his ironic , often rude humor .
his irreverence quickly won him the admiration of germany ’ s youth . in 1999 he became host of a show he created , " tv total , " which still runs four nights a week .
it focuses on ridiculing television while pairing raab as a chat host with entertainers and musicians - often on the a-list - who perform live on his show . derisive humor a hit among youth but unlike most chat-show hosts , whose job descriptions fairly demand neutrality , raab is n't urbane or fawning . bulky and goateed , he looks a little bit like the butcher that he trained to be in his youth .
he is neither handsome nor well dressed , and is mostly found wearing jeans , untucked shirts , sneakers and a self-satisfied grin . raab also does n't shy from unleashing his derisive humor on the stars who take a seat on his couch , " which makes the youth market love him , " says university of hamburg 's bleicher . indeed , his brash and boorish style tends to divide the audience into " love him " and " hate him " camps , with the deciding factor apparently being age .
the fault line falls somewhere around age 30 . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : love him or hate him , there 's no escaping him " raab is very popular with people from 12 to 29 , " bleicher said .
" it 's what the program planners are aiming for . " meanwhile , " older people ca n't stand him , " bleicher asserts .
" they think he is too aggressive , too ironic , unattractive . … he is simply rude . " of insults and lawsuits certainly raab has gotten into some well publicized hot water by ignoring the usual conventions of politesse .
he once famously ridiculed a 16-year-old model named lisa loch -lrb- in german " loch " means " hole " -rrb- saying her name could make her a porno star ; a court made him pay the teenager 70,000 euros -lrb- $ 108,000 -rrb- in damages . in a similar 2004 misstep , he showed a picture of a young turkish mother holding her child ’ s schoolbag , and quipped , " the drug traffickers are getting better and better at disguising themselves . "
that joke cost him 20,000 euros . the legal troubles seem to have had their effect , and in recent years raab has n't landed in court .
or perhaps he has just been too busy building a major entertainment empire to think up anything actionable . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the winner takes it all ...
in addition to " tv total " - which regularly sees raab paired and poking fun at celebrities on the caliber of elton john , jackie chan , eminem , kylie minogue , ben stiller , and will smith - raab 's broadcaster , the private channel pro7 , has given him free rein to create a series of entertainment " events . " quick ride in a slippery wok these usually land in prime-time slots , and run the gamut from the wacky -lrb- an annual sports event called the " wok world championship , " in which celebrities take a bobsled run while seated in an enormous cooking wok , -rrb- to the iconoclastic -lrb- a takeoff on germany ’ s version of the " american idol " show with the tongue-in-cheek name " ssdsdss , " or " stefan seeks the superstar who can sing what he or she wants " -rrb- ; the unlikely -lrb- the " bundesvision song contest , " pitting unknown bands from germany 's 16 federal states , -rrb- to the over-the-top -lrb- a project in the works called " autoball , " which involves an arena , two cars and a giant soccer ball . -rrb- moreover , raab is respected for his musical talent ; he is a self-taught musician with his own record label , which he uses to produce and promote the talent that he discovers in his contests and features on his talk show .
he was also deeply involved in the eurovision song contest , where he has been both a contestant and a promoter , and has written and cut a few hit novelty songs . a closed culture system ? if raab sounds like a one man entertainment band , or an apolitical silvio berlusconi , it 's because he is .
and like him or hate him , most people admire his ability to take the pulse of german pop culture and turn it into a sackful of euros , if nothing else . it leads to a not infrequent use of the word " genius . " in an awed 2007 article on raab in respected german newspaper die zeit , pro7 executive jobst benthues said that what raab does is " big entertaiment .
he is a genius of thinking of things first , and we give him the freedom to try things out . his successes validate our trust . " media historian bleicher agrees . " he is a genius at selling himself and his ideas , and combining several aspects of the media economy , " bleicher says .
" he combines diverse formats , like a big media conglomerate .
but he is just one person . " jennifer abramsohn send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

one of its aims is to stop the far-right infiltrating sports ' clubs . " i 'm against nazis because they do n't appear to have learned anything from german history , " explains the german captain and chelsea midfielder in a 10-second soundbite on the web site netz-gegen-nazis -lrb- network against nazis -rrb- .
tv presenter marietta slomka and talk show host maybrit illner are among the other high-profile germans featured online . the interactive internet platform , launched by the german weekly newspaper die zeit on monday , may 5 , is at the heart of the project .
it contains extensive information about the subject - including up-to-date news reports about right-wing extremism - , a forum where users can seek advice and swap facts and links to advice centers and support groups .
" we 're aiming to create a nationwide forum where people who encounter far-right ideas in their day-to-day lives can give each other advice , " said giovanni di lorenzo , the newspaper 's editor-in-chief .
together we are strong bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : germany captain michael ballack is one of the campaign 's figureheads the weekly newspaper has joined forces with a number of other partners to forge the anti-far-right alliance .
the sporting organizations involved include the german olympic sports confederation -lrb- dosb -rrb- , the german soccer federation -lrb- dfb -rrb- and the german soccer league -lrb- dfl -rrb- .
media partners include the german broadcaster zdf and online portals , schuelervz , studivz and meinvz .
the involvement of the sporting bodies reflects rising concern about far-right parties using the cover of leisure activities to spread their ideas among young people , in particular .
" right-wing extremism poses a great threat to an association like the german soccer federation because of its clubs ' grass-roots and volunteer-based structures , " said the head of the dfb , theo zwanziger .
not just football tactics , but lessons for life bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : german soccer has already been involved in a number of anti-racist initiatives he added that the point of the network against nazis was to inform and to encourage civil courage .
" as well as teaching the one-two and the bicycle kick , we have to communicate the message that it is worthwhile living in a democratic state , " said zwanziger .
but it is not only the budding players who are being targeted ; he also mentioned special training sessions for coaches .
a number of high profile events will be taking place in games in both german football leagues on tuesday , may 6 , and wednesday , to publicize the initiative .
an ad featuring ballack 's soundbite will also be shown in all stadiums .
the dfb has also announced that the national squad would also be helping to spread this message in upcoming games against serbia and belarus . it did not reveal any further details .
ingo weiss , head of the german olympic sports confederation , said that it was about turning the 27 million or so dosb members into " vigilant lions " so that the horrors of the nazi era could never be repeated .

however , the inclusion of some inductees with nazi connections stirred debate . the ambitious project , " a permanent celebration of our country 's greatest athletes , " according to the head of the german sport aid foundation , ann kathrin linsenhoff , will initially contain the names of 40 of germany 's sporting heroes , with potentially three to be added to the roll call every year .
the first sportsmen and women to enter the hall of fame , officially opened by president horst koehler and minister of the interior wolfgang schaeuble , were chosen by a 25-strong jury headed by schaeuble , which considered the nature of their sporting achievement , the legacy and impact of the person , their personal attributes and whether they were a good role model for future sports stars .
initial inductee list dominated by west german males the jury was presented with a list of 150 potential inductees which had been compiled by the german olympic sports alliance , the federation of german sports journalists and the german sport aid federation .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : former showjumper hans guenter winkler with his portrait the final list of 40 , which includes the likes of boxing legend max schmeling , soccer ambassador franz beckenbauer and tennis idol gottfried von cramm , features 32 posthumous inductees .
most of the 40 are male , the exceptions being germany 's first wimbledon tennis tournament winner cilly aussem , ski idol rosi mittermaier , a double olympic champion in 1976 , and track and field athlete ingrid mickler-becker .
there is only one sports star from the former east germany in the initial batch : four-time olympic swimming champion roland matthes .
given the gdr 's well-publicized doping program in sports , the jury appears to have erred on the side of caution in the initial round of inductions .
idols with nazi links cause unease however , the jury has not managed to completely avoid controversy .
the induction of five former members of the national socialist party has already caused some heated debate as to whether those associated with the nazis should be honored and has led to some calling the new project the " hall of shame . "
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : sport aid founder neckermann had nazi links cyclist gustav kilian , athlete rudolf harbig , former german olympic president willi daume and the founder of the german sport aid foundation , josef neckermann , as well as sepp herberger , coach of the 1954 world cup winning soccer team , " the wonders of bern , " all had connections to the third reich during world war ii .
" we do not see the hall of fame as being tarnished by this , " ann kathrin linsenhoff told reporters .
" in fact it is the opposite .
this is useful in the processing of our past through sport .
to exclude those who had connections with the national socialists would be an act of arrogance by a generation which has had the luck to grow up in a democracy .

the long-delayed women 's reservation bill was tabled in the rajya sabha or upper house of parliament amid dramatic scenes and protests by mps belonging to some parties . the bill ensures one in three mps will be a woman but there is still a long way to go before this becomes law as the lack of consensus among india ’ s parliamentarians has ensured that the legislation remains in cold storage .

the long-delayed women 's reservation bill was tabled in the rajya sabha or upper house of parliament amid dramatic scenes and protests by mps belonging to some parties . the bill ensures one in three mps will be a woman but there is still a long way to go before this becomes law as the lack of consensus among india ’ s parliamentarians has ensured that the legislation remains in cold storage .
agitated members from the samajwadi party tried to snatch the bill copy from law minister h r bhardwaj tuesday but congress members intervened and formed a human chain thus allowing the controversial bill to be introduced .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de politics -pipe- 06.05.2008 one year on , hopes in french president plummet großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : sarkozy 's approval ratings could be better a year after his election win , french president nicolas sarkozy 's ratings have nosedived amid irritation at his flamboyant lifestyle and economic woes .
but some say the french want to have their cake and eat it . in his victory speech on may 6 , 2007 , sarkozy told thousands of people : " i do n't have the right to disappoint the country . "
but a year on , that 's exactly what the french president has done .
just over one third of the population say they support the new president , compared with some two-thirds 12 months ago .
to begin with , french voters were shocked by his hardly statesman-like behaviour with model carla bruni whom he married just weeks after divorcing his second wife cecilia in october .
he gave the impression of a man with his mind on ... well , on other things than the business of government .
beset by economic troubles and questions of style bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : sarkozy 's apparently whirlwind romance with carla bruni attracted negative publicity now the country is getting hit in the pocket and sarkozy is getting the blame .
he had pledged to boost spending power in his election campaign .
instead , it has dropped .
in march , french inflation rates reached a 17-year high of 3.2 percent .
in part , this was just bad luck .
the beginning of the president 's term in office also coincided with the onset of the global financial crisis and rocketing oil prices , helping to drive prices up .
the jury also seems to be out over the success of the flurry of reforms that he has introduced .
some analysts have praised his easing of france 's 35-hour week , his reduction of pension benefits and his reforms of the country 's overcrowded and impoverished universities .
" sarkozy had the courage to do what other presidents did n't , " philippe braud , a professor at the sciences po institute in paris , told afp news agency .
" his track record is not to be underestimated even if the french are n't convinced , " he added .
unemployment levels at historic low bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the president 's reforms sparked strikes among civil servants and railway workers in november .
braud also pointed to sarkozy 's achievement in streamlining france 's notoriously complicated labor laws .
the jobless rate has dropped to 7.5 percent , the lowest level in two decades , since he took office .
however , he said the president had announced too many projects at once and then not been able to deliver .
bruno jeanbart , of the opinionway polling institute , is of a similar opinion .
he praised sarkozy 's reform zeal , but also told afp that " there are also many areas he engaged in but in which he was perhaps too optimistic or has not followed through . "
he named these as spending power and the country 's public deficit .

but some say the french want to have their cake and eat it . in his victory speech on may 6 , 2007 , sarkozy told thousands of people : " i do n't have the right to disappoint the country . "
but a year on , that 's exactly what the french president has done .
just over one third of the population say they support the new president , compared with some two-thirds 12 months ago .
to begin with , french voters were shocked by his hardly statesman-like behaviour with model carla bruni whom he married just weeks after divorcing his second wife cecilia in october .
he gave the impression of a man with his mind on ... well , on other things than the business of government .
beset by economic troubles and questions of style bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : sarkozy 's apparently whirlwind romance with carla bruni attracted negative publicity now the country is getting hit in the pocket and sarkozy is getting the blame .
he had pledged to boost spending power in his election campaign .
instead , it has dropped .
in march , french inflation rates reached a 17-year high of 3.2 percent .
in part , this was just bad luck .
the beginning of the president 's term in office also coincided with the onset of the global financial crisis and rocketing oil prices , helping to drive prices up .
the jury also seems to be out over the success of the flurry of reforms that he has introduced .
some analysts have praised his easing of france 's 35-hour week , his reduction of pension benefits and his reforms of the country 's overcrowded and impoverished universities .
" sarkozy had the courage to do what other presidents did n't , " philippe braud , a professor at the sciences po institute in paris , told afp news agency .
" his track record is not to be underestimated even if the french are n't convinced , " he added .
unemployment levels at historic low bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the president 's reforms sparked strikes among civil servants and railway workers in november .
braud also pointed to sarkozy 's achievement in streamlining france 's notoriously complicated labor laws .
the jobless rate has dropped to 7.5 percent , the lowest level in two decades , since he took office .
however , he said the president had announced too many projects at once and then not been able to deliver .
bruno jeanbart , of the opinionway polling institute , is of a similar opinion .
he praised sarkozy 's reform zeal , but also told afp that " there are also many areas he engaged in but in which he was perhaps too optimistic or has not followed through . "
he named these as spending power and the country 's public deficit .
other observers are more critical , saying that he bought the highly symbolic abolition of early pensions for civil servants by making expensive concessions and that rigid labor market structures remain largely untouched despite the shift away from a 35-hour week .
" he took over a country that was feeling insecure and which regarded him as the last chance to solve their structural problems , " said the political scientist dominique moisi .
" he failed to convince the french and offer them security . " a parliamentary report released this month also described as both costly and ineffective one of sarkozy 's flagship reforms , aimed at boosting incomes with a tax break on overtime pay .
the french conservative newspaper le figaro criticizes sarkozy only insofar as he did not make sufficiently clear that the changes would hurt .
" the french approve of the reforms of nicolas sarkozy , but condemn the reformer .
they 're a bit like a child that pushes away the helping hand because it does n't like the bitter taste of the medicine , " it wrote .
sarkozy admits some of the problems are his fault bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : critics have also accused sarkozy of compromising france 's human rights profile for business contracts the french president is trying to regain the population 's confidence .
just a few days ago he confessed in a tv interview : " i have made mistakes . "
and sarkozy has learned something from them , cutting out , for example , his public strutting with carla .
but apart from tackling style issues , his options are limited .
there is no money to kickstart the floundering economy .
in january , he confessed that he could not do much to help because the state " coffers were empty . "
france - which is set to take over the rotating eu presidency in july - is also facing mounting pressure from other european union member states to slash its total public deficit of around 1.2 trillion euros .
he also knows that backing down from his reform program would cost him his remaining credibility .
" i am completely aware of the dissatisfaction , but i know where i want to take things , " said sarkozy .
the honeymoon may be over , but sarkozy is hoping to persuade the electorate of the merits of a long-term relationship .
he is asking them to be patient .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de media -pipe- 06.05.2008 germany 's market busting tv star raab goes global großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : raab 's desire to win makes him an ideal competitor - and entertainment mogul imported shows have long been a staple of german tv , but the reverse is rarely true .
now a game show created by an unlikely , if ubiquitous , german tv personality is taking foreign markets by storm . can an irreverent former butcher named stefan raab save german entertainment ?
so far , 12 countries have bought the adaptation rights to a german game show called " schlag den raab , " or " beat raab . "
the latest to sign on were croatia and denmark .
a uk version is currently in production and will air this spring .
the foreign title is " beat your host ; " the uk version is called " beat the star . " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : try beating raab at this as the original title implies , the german version involves pitting a selected contestant against 42-year-old stefan raab , a talk-show host and sort-of comedian who is arguably germany ’ s most ubiquitous television personality .
the contestant tries to beat raab in a marathon four- to five-hour competition that encompasses up to 15 varied disciplines , from the physical -lrb- box stacking , ice climbing , -rrb- to the mental -lrb- poker playing , knowledge quiz -rrb- to the silly -lrb- dropping peas into a bottle . -rrb- at stake : a heap of cash . the uk version , produced by a company called itv , will pit contestants against a changing array of stars , and the contest has been shortened to last just over an hour .
the german show was the most successful new start last year , pulling viewer ratings of around 31 percent of those aged 14 to 49 . whether the same ratings dream will come true for itv , as it has for raab 's german production firm brainpool , remains to be seen .
nonetheless , raab has managed to achieve something with this show that has been done only a handful of times in german tv history : crossing over to a broad international audience . the rapid ascent of stefan raab " most successful german tv shows are strongly based on regional identities , " said joan bleicher , professor for media studies at the university of hamburg .
" it just would n't translate to an international audience . " but the success of raab 's latest endeavor is unlikely to surprise anyone who has kept an eye on the german entertainment scene for the past decade . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : beat the raab is one of germany 's most successful tv shows raab 's rise on german television can only be described as meteoric .
as a vj on an german music-video channel viva in 1996 , he set himself apart with his ironic , often rude humor .
his irreverence quickly won him the admiration of germany ’ s youth . in 1999 he became host of a show he created , " tv total , " which still runs four nights a week .
it focuses on ridiculing television while pairing raab as a chat host with entertainers and musicians - often on the a-list - who perform live on his show . derisive humor a hit among youth but unlike most chat-show hosts , whose job descriptions fairly demand neutrality , raab is n't urbane or fawning . bulky and goateed , he looks a little bit like the butcher that he trained to be in his youth .
he is neither handsome nor well dressed , and is mostly found wearing jeans , untucked shirts , sneakers and a self-satisfied grin . raab also does n't shy from unleashing his derisive humor on the stars who take a seat on his couch , " which makes the youth market love him , " says university of hamburg 's bleicher . indeed , his brash and boorish style tends to divide the audience into " love him " and " hate him " camps , with the deciding factor apparently being age .
the fault line falls somewhere around age 30 . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : love him or hate him , there 's no escaping him " raab is very popular with people from 12 to 29 , " bleicher said .
" it 's what the program planners are aiming for . " meanwhile , " older people ca n't stand him , " bleicher asserts .
" they think he is too aggressive , too ironic , unattractive . … he is simply rude . " of insults and lawsuits certainly raab has gotten into some well publicized hot water by ignoring the usual conventions of politesse .
he once famously ridiculed a 16-year-old model named lisa loch -lrb- in german " loch " means " hole " -rrb- saying her name could make her a porno star ; a court made him pay the teenager 70,000 euros -lrb- $ 108,000 -rrb- in damages . in a similar 2004 misstep , he showed a picture of a young turkish mother holding her child ’ s schoolbag , and quipped , " the drug traffickers are getting better and better at disguising themselves . "
that joke cost him 20,000 euros . the legal troubles seem to have had their effect , and in recent years raab has n't landed in court .
or perhaps he has just been too busy building a major entertainment empire to think up anything actionable . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the winner takes it all ...
in addition to " tv total " - which regularly sees raab paired and poking fun at celebrities on the caliber of elton john , jackie chan , eminem , kylie minogue , ben stiller , and will smith - raab 's broadcaster , the private channel pro7 , has given him free rein to create a series of entertainment " events . " quick ride in a slippery wok these usually land in prime-time slots , and run the gamut from the wacky -lrb- an annual sports event called the " wok world championship , " in which celebrities take a bobsled run while seated in an enormous cooking wok , -rrb- to the iconoclastic -lrb- a takeoff on germany ’ s version of the " american idol " show with the tongue-in-cheek name " ssdsdss , " or " stefan seeks the superstar who can sing what he or she wants " -rrb- ; the unlikely -lrb- the " bundesvision song contest , " pitting unknown bands from germany 's 16 federal states , -rrb- to the over-the-top -lrb- a project in the works called " autoball , " which involves an arena , two cars and a giant soccer ball . -rrb- moreover , raab is respected for his musical talent ; he is a self-taught musician with his own record label , which he uses to produce and promote the talent that he discovers in his contests and features on his talk show .
he was also deeply involved in the eurovision song contest , where he has been both a contestant and a promoter , and has written and cut a few hit novelty songs . a closed culture system ? if raab sounds like a one man entertainment band , or an apolitical silvio berlusconi , it 's because he is .
and like him or hate him , most people admire his ability to take the pulse of german pop culture and turn it into a sackful of euros , if nothing else . it leads to a not infrequent use of the word " genius . " in an awed 2007 article on raab in respected german newspaper die zeit , pro7 executive jobst benthues said that what raab does is " big entertaiment .
he is a genius of thinking of things first , and we give him the freedom to try things out . his successes validate our trust . " media historian bleicher agrees . " he is a genius at selling himself and his ideas , and combining several aspects of the media economy , " bleicher says .
" he combines diverse formats , like a big media conglomerate .
but he is just one person . " jennifer abramsohn send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

some villages have been almost totally eradicated and vast rice-growing areas wiped out .
the former capital rangoon , the country 's largest city , has been left without water and electricity .
germany 's foreign ministry announced in berlin on monday , may 5 , that it would channel the pledged funds through german aid organizations .
the aid is intended to provide emergency accommodation , drinking water , household utensils and mosquito nets .
foreign minister frank-walter steinmeier expressed his condolences to the families of those who had died .
he also appealed to the military government to launch an effective assistance operation and to cooperate with international aid organizations . the british government pledged 5 million pounds -lsb- 6.3 million euros , $ 9.8 million -rsb- in aid for victims of the cyclone that has struck burma , the international development department said . international development secretary douglas alexander said the money would be channelled through the united nations and was the " the largest single effort of any member state of the united nations so far " . earlier , prime minister gordon brown said : " i want to pledge on behalf of the british government that we will work with the whole international community to make sure that the food aid and the other support that is necessary is available to the people of burma .

" we 're prepared to move us navy assets to help find those who 've lost their lives , to help find the missing , to help stabilize the situation .
but in order to do so , the military junta must allow our disaster assessment teams into the country , " said the president . bush spokeswoman dana perino said that washington was worried because the junta had yet to answer a us visa request for an eight-person disaster aid response team -lsb- dart -rsb- whose mission would be to assess burma 's aid needs eu calls for aid to go straight to the needy bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the eu 's foreign policy experts urge burma to open up the european union echoed the calls for the burmese authorities to " make every effort to cooperate " with relief organisations after burma said aid teams would have to meet its conditions .

now a game show created by an unlikely , if ubiquitous , german tv personality is taking foreign markets by storm . can an irreverent former butcher named stefan raab save german entertainment ?
so far , 12 countries have bought the adaptation rights to a german game show called " schlag den raab , " or " beat raab . "
the latest to sign on were croatia and denmark .
a uk version is currently in production and will air this spring .
the foreign title is " beat your host ; " the uk version is called " beat the star . " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : try beating raab at this as the original title implies , the german version involves pitting a selected contestant against 42-year-old stefan raab , a talk-show host and sort-of comedian who is arguably germany ’ s most ubiquitous television personality .
the contestant tries to beat raab in a marathon four- to five-hour competition that encompasses up to 15 varied disciplines , from the physical -lrb- box stacking , ice climbing , -rrb- to the mental -lrb- poker playing , knowledge quiz -rrb- to the silly -lrb- dropping peas into a bottle . -rrb- at stake : a heap of cash . the uk version , produced by a company called itv , will pit contestants against a changing array of stars , and the contest has been shortened to last just over an hour .
the german show was the most successful new start last year , pulling viewer ratings of around 31 percent of those aged 14 to 49 . whether the same ratings dream will come true for itv , as it has for raab 's german production firm brainpool , remains to be seen .
nonetheless , raab has managed to achieve something with this show that has been done only a handful of times in german tv history : crossing over to a broad international audience . the rapid ascent of stefan raab " most successful german tv shows are strongly based on regional identities , " said joan bleicher , professor for media studies at the university of hamburg .
" it just would n't translate to an international audience . " but the success of raab 's latest endeavor is unlikely to surprise anyone who has kept an eye on the german entertainment scene for the past decade . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : beat the raab is one of germany 's most successful tv shows raab 's rise on german television can only be described as meteoric .
as a vj on an german music-video channel viva in 1996 , he set himself apart with his ironic , often rude humor .
his irreverence quickly won him the admiration of germany ’ s youth . in 1999 he became host of a show he created , " tv total , " which still runs four nights a week .
it focuses on ridiculing television while pairing raab as a chat host with entertainers and musicians - often on the a-list - who perform live on his show . derisive humor a hit among youth but unlike most chat-show hosts , whose job descriptions fairly demand neutrality , raab is n't urbane or fawning . bulky and goateed , he looks a little bit like the butcher that he trained to be in his youth .
he is neither handsome nor well dressed , and is mostly found wearing jeans , untucked shirts , sneakers and a self-satisfied grin . raab also does n't shy from unleashing his derisive humor on the stars who take a seat on his couch , " which makes the youth market love him , " says university of hamburg 's bleicher . indeed , his brash and boorish style tends to divide the audience into " love him " and " hate him " camps , with the deciding factor apparently being age .
the fault line falls somewhere around age 30 . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : love him or hate him , there 's no escaping him " raab is very popular with people from 12 to 29 , " bleicher said .
" it 's what the program planners are aiming for . " meanwhile , " older people ca n't stand him , " bleicher asserts .
" they think he is too aggressive , too ironic , unattractive . … he is simply rude . " of insults and lawsuits certainly raab has gotten into some well publicized hot water by ignoring the usual conventions of politesse .
he once famously ridiculed a 16-year-old model named lisa loch -lrb- in german " loch " means " hole " -rrb- saying her name could make her a porno star ; a court made him pay the teenager 70,000 euros -lrb- $ 108,000 -rrb- in damages . in a similar 2004 misstep , he showed a picture of a young turkish mother holding her child ’ s schoolbag , and quipped , " the drug traffickers are getting better and better at disguising themselves . "
that joke cost him 20,000 euros . the legal troubles seem to have had their effect , and in recent years raab has n't landed in court .
or perhaps he has just been too busy building a major entertainment empire to think up anything actionable . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the winner takes it all ...
in addition to " tv total " - which regularly sees raab paired and poking fun at celebrities on the caliber of elton john , jackie chan , eminem , kylie minogue , ben stiller , and will smith - raab 's broadcaster , the private channel pro7 , has given him free rein to create a series of entertainment " events .

he was also deeply involved in the eurovision song contest , where he has been both a contestant and a promoter , and has written and cut a few hit novelty songs . a closed culture system ? if raab sounds like a one man entertainment band , or an apolitical silvio berlusconi , it 's because he is .
and like him or hate him , most people admire his ability to take the pulse of german pop culture and turn it into a sackful of euros , if nothing else . it leads to a not infrequent use of the word " genius . " in an awed 2007 article on raab in respected german newspaper die zeit , pro7 executive jobst benthues said that what raab does is " big entertaiment .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de media -pipe- 06.05.2008 germany 's market busting tv star raab goes global großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : raab 's desire to win makes him an ideal competitor - and entertainment mogul imported shows have long been a staple of german tv , but the reverse is rarely true .
now a game show created by an unlikely , if ubiquitous , german tv personality is taking foreign markets by storm . can an irreverent former butcher named stefan raab save german entertainment ?
so far , 12 countries have bought the adaptation rights to a german game show called " schlag den raab , " or " beat raab . "
the latest to sign on were croatia and denmark .
a uk version is currently in production and will air this spring .
the foreign title is " beat your host ; " the uk version is called " beat the star . " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : try beating raab at this as the original title implies , the german version involves pitting a selected contestant against 42-year-old stefan raab , a talk-show host and sort-of comedian who is arguably germany ’ s most ubiquitous television personality .
the contestant tries to beat raab in a marathon four- to five-hour competition that encompasses up to 15 varied disciplines , from the physical -lrb- box stacking , ice climbing , -rrb- to the mental -lrb- poker playing , knowledge quiz -rrb- to the silly -lrb- dropping peas into a bottle . -rrb- at stake : a heap of cash . the uk version , produced by a company called itv , will pit contestants against a changing array of stars , and the contest has been shortened to last just over an hour .
the german show was the most successful new start last year , pulling viewer ratings of around 31 percent of those aged 14 to 49 . whether the same ratings dream will come true for itv , as it has for raab 's german production firm brainpool , remains to be seen .
nonetheless , raab has managed to achieve something with this show that has been done only a handful of times in german tv history : crossing over to a broad international audience . the rapid ascent of stefan raab " most successful german tv shows are strongly based on regional identities , " said joan bleicher , professor for media studies at the university of hamburg .
" it just would n't translate to an international audience . " but the success of raab 's latest endeavor is unlikely to surprise anyone who has kept an eye on the german entertainment scene for the past decade . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : beat the raab is one of germany 's most successful tv shows raab 's rise on german television can only be described as meteoric .
as a vj on an german music-video channel viva in 1996 , he set himself apart with his ironic , often rude humor .
his irreverence quickly won him the admiration of germany ’ s youth . in 1999 he became host of a show he created , " tv total , " which still runs four nights a week .
it focuses on ridiculing television while pairing raab as a chat host with entertainers and musicians - often on the a-list - who perform live on his show . derisive humor a hit among youth but unlike most chat-show hosts , whose job descriptions fairly demand neutrality , raab is n't urbane or fawning . bulky and goateed , he looks a little bit like the butcher that he trained to be in his youth .
he is neither handsome nor well dressed , and is mostly found wearing jeans , untucked shirts , sneakers and a self-satisfied grin . raab also does n't shy from unleashing his derisive humor on the stars who take a seat on his couch , " which makes the youth market love him , " says university of hamburg 's bleicher . indeed , his brash and boorish style tends to divide the audience into " love him " and " hate him " camps , with the deciding factor apparently being age .
the fault line falls somewhere around age 30 . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : love him or hate him , there 's no escaping him " raab is very popular with people from 12 to 29 , " bleicher said .
" it 's what the program planners are aiming for . " meanwhile , " older people ca n't stand him , " bleicher asserts .
" they think he is too aggressive , too ironic , unattractive . … he is simply rude . " of insults and lawsuits certainly raab has gotten into some well publicized hot water by ignoring the usual conventions of politesse .
he once famously ridiculed a 16-year-old model named lisa loch -lrb- in german " loch " means " hole " -rrb- saying her name could make her a porno star ; a court made him pay the teenager 70,000 euros -lrb- $ 108,000 -rrb- in damages . in a similar 2004 misstep , he showed a picture of a young turkish mother holding her child ’ s schoolbag , and quipped , " the drug traffickers are getting better and better at disguising themselves . "
that joke cost him 20,000 euros . the legal troubles seem to have had their effect , and in recent years raab has n't landed in court .
or perhaps he has just been too busy building a major entertainment empire to think up anything actionable . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the winner takes it all ...
in addition to " tv total " - which regularly sees raab paired and poking fun at celebrities on the caliber of elton john , jackie chan , eminem , kylie minogue , ben stiller , and will smith - raab 's broadcaster , the private channel pro7 , has given him free rein to create a series of entertainment " events . " quick ride in a slippery wok these usually land in prime-time slots , and run the gamut from the wacky -lrb- an annual sports event called the " wok world championship , " in which celebrities take a bobsled run while seated in an enormous cooking wok , -rrb- to the iconoclastic -lrb- a takeoff on germany ’ s version of the " american idol " show with the tongue-in-cheek name " ssdsdss , " or " stefan seeks the superstar who can sing what he or she wants " -rrb- ; the unlikely -lrb- the " bundesvision song contest , " pitting unknown bands from germany 's 16 federal states , -rrb- to the over-the-top -lrb- a project in the works called " autoball , " which involves an arena , two cars and a giant soccer ball . -rrb- moreover , raab is respected for his musical talent ; he is a self-taught musician with his own record label , which he uses to produce and promote the talent that he discovers in his contests and features on his talk show .
he was also deeply involved in the eurovision song contest , where he has been both a contestant and a promoter , and has written and cut a few hit novelty songs . a closed culture system ? if raab sounds like a one man entertainment band , or an apolitical silvio berlusconi , it 's because he is .
and like him or hate him , most people admire his ability to take the pulse of german pop culture and turn it into a sackful of euros , if nothing else . it leads to a not infrequent use of the word " genius .

but some say the french want to have their cake and eat it . in his victory speech on may 6 , 2007 , sarkozy told thousands of people : " i do n't have the right to disappoint the country . "
but a year on , that 's exactly what the french president has done .
just over one third of the population say they support the new president , compared with some two-thirds 12 months ago .
to begin with , french voters were shocked by his hardly statesman-like behaviour with model carla bruni whom he married just weeks after divorcing his second wife cecilia in october .
he gave the impression of a man with his mind on ... well , on other things than the business of government .
beset by economic troubles and questions of style bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : sarkozy 's apparently whirlwind romance with carla bruni attracted negative publicity now the country is getting hit in the pocket and sarkozy is getting the blame .
he had pledged to boost spending power in his election campaign .
instead , it has dropped .
in march , french inflation rates reached a 17-year high of 3.2 percent .
in part , this was just bad luck .
the beginning of the president 's term in office also coincided with the onset of the global financial crisis and rocketing oil prices , helping to drive prices up .
the jury also seems to be out over the success of the flurry of reforms that he has introduced .
some analysts have praised his easing of france 's 35-hour week , his reduction of pension benefits and his reforms of the country 's overcrowded and impoverished universities .
" sarkozy had the courage to do what other presidents did n't , " philippe braud , a professor at the sciences po institute in paris , told afp news agency .
" his track record is not to be underestimated even if the french are n't convinced , " he added .
unemployment levels at historic low bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the president 's reforms sparked strikes among civil servants and railway workers in november .
braud also pointed to sarkozy 's achievement in streamlining france 's notoriously complicated labor laws .
the jobless rate has dropped to 7.5 percent , the lowest level in two decades , since he took office .
however , he said the president had announced too many projects at once and then not been able to deliver .
bruno jeanbart , of the opinionway polling institute , is of a similar opinion .
he praised sarkozy 's reform zeal , but also told afp that " there are also many areas he engaged in but in which he was perhaps too optimistic or has not followed through . "
he named these as spending power and the country 's public deficit .
other observers are more critical , saying that he bought the highly symbolic abolition of early pensions for civil servants by making expensive concessions and that rigid labor market structures remain largely untouched despite the shift away from a 35-hour week .
" he took over a country that was feeling insecure and which regarded him as the last chance to solve their structural problems , " said the political scientist dominique moisi .
" he failed to convince the french and offer them security . " a parliamentary report released this month also described as both costly and ineffective one of sarkozy 's flagship reforms , aimed at boosting incomes with a tax break on overtime pay .
the french conservative newspaper le figaro criticizes sarkozy only insofar as he did not make sufficiently clear that the changes would hurt .
" the french approve of the reforms of nicolas sarkozy , but condemn the reformer .
they 're a bit like a child that pushes away the helping hand because it does n't like the bitter taste of the medicine , " it wrote .
sarkozy admits some of the problems are his fault bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : critics have also accused sarkozy of compromising france 's human rights profile for business contracts the french president is trying to regain the population 's confidence .

and sarkozy has learned something from them , cutting out , for example , his public strutting with carla .
but apart from tackling style issues , his options are limited .
there is no money to kickstart the floundering economy .
in january , he confessed that he could not do much to help because the state " coffers were empty . "
france - which is set to take over the rotating eu presidency in july - is also facing mounting pressure from other european union member states to slash its total public deficit of around 1.2 trillion euros .
he also knows that backing down from his reform program would cost him his remaining credibility .
" i am completely aware of the dissatisfaction , but i know where i want to take things , " said sarkozy .

the united nations , which is also preparing to fly in supplies , say several hundreds of thousands of burmese have been left homeless .
some villages have been almost totally eradicated and vast rice-growing areas wiped out .
the former capital rangoon , the country 's largest city , has been left without water and electricity .
germany 's foreign ministry announced in berlin on monday , may 5 , that it would channel the pledged funds through german aid organizations .
the aid is intended to provide emergency accommodation , drinking water , household utensils and mosquito nets .
foreign minister frank-walter steinmeier expressed his condolences to the families of those who had died .
he also appealed to the military government to launch an effective assistance operation and to cooperate with international aid organizations . the british government pledged 5 million pounds -lsb- 6.3 million euros , $ 9.8 million -rsb- in aid for victims of the cyclone that has struck burma , the international development department said . international development secretary douglas alexander said the money would be channelled through the united nations and was the " the largest single effort of any member state of the united nations so far " . earlier , prime minister gordon brown said : " i want to pledge on behalf of the british government that we will work with the whole international community to make sure that the food aid and the other support that is necessary is available to the people of burma .

" the united states has made an initial aid contribution , but we want to do a lot more , " bush said as he signed a law giving burma democracy icon and junta foe aung san suu kyi the top civilian award the us congress can bestow . " we 're prepared to move us navy assets to help find those who 've lost their lives , to help find the missing , to help stabilize the situation .
but in order to do so , the military junta must allow our disaster assessment teams into the country , " said the president . bush spokeswoman dana perino said that washington was worried because the junta had yet to answer a us visa request for an eight-person disaster aid response team -lsb- dart -rsb- whose mission would be to assess burma 's aid needs eu calls for aid to go straight to the needy bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the eu 's foreign policy experts urge burma to open up the european union echoed the calls for the burmese authorities to " make every effort to cooperate " with relief organisations after burma said aid teams would have to meet its conditions .

" the eu hopes that , in the interest of the population suffering from the emergency , the authorities will make every effort to cooperate with the international relief organizations , " it added . a burmese minister said tuesday that foreign aid teams wanting to come to the military-ruled nation after the devastating cyclone would have to negotiate with the regime to be granted access . but european commission spokesman amadeu altafaj told journalists in brussels : " the burmese authorities of course have to be cooperative , " referring to myanmar by its old name of burma . on monday , the european commission released an initial two million euros -lsb- $ 3 million -rsb- in emergency aid for victims of the weekend cyclone . military junta stalls after initial acceptance bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the burmese government have been accused of failing to issue timely weather warnings the scale of the disaster caused by cyclone nargis initially prompted a rare acceptance of external aid from the country 's diplomatically isolated government , which rejected such offers of help after the 2004 indian ocean tsunami .
" this shows how grave it is in the burmese government 's mind , " said tim costello , the head of aid agency world vision in australia , adding that his and other aid organizations had been given permission to fly people to burma , " which is pretty unprecedented . "

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de media -pipe- 06.05.2008 germany 's market busting tv star raab goes global großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : raab 's desire to win makes him an ideal competitor - and entertainment mogul imported shows have long been a staple of german tv , but the reverse is rarely true .
now a game show created by an unlikely , if ubiquitous , german tv personality is taking foreign markets by storm . can an irreverent former butcher named stefan raab save german entertainment ?
so far , 12 countries have bought the adaptation rights to a german game show called " schlag den raab , " or " beat raab . "
the latest to sign on were croatia and denmark .
a uk version is currently in production and will air this spring .
the foreign title is " beat your host ; " the uk version is called " beat the star . " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : try beating raab at this as the original title implies , the german version involves pitting a selected contestant against 42-year-old stefan raab , a talk-show host and sort-of comedian who is arguably germany ’ s most ubiquitous television personality .
the contestant tries to beat raab in a marathon four- to five-hour competition that encompasses up to 15 varied disciplines , from the physical -lrb- box stacking , ice climbing , -rrb- to the mental -lrb- poker playing , knowledge quiz -rrb- to the silly -lrb- dropping peas into a bottle . -rrb- at stake : a heap of cash . the uk version , produced by a company called itv , will pit contestants against a changing array of stars , and the contest has been shortened to last just over an hour .
the german show was the most successful new start last year , pulling viewer ratings of around 31 percent of those aged 14 to 49 . whether the same ratings dream will come true for itv , as it has for raab 's german production firm brainpool , remains to be seen .
nonetheless , raab has managed to achieve something with this show that has been done only a handful of times in german tv history : crossing over to a broad international audience . the rapid ascent of stefan raab " most successful german tv shows are strongly based on regional identities , " said joan bleicher , professor for media studies at the university of hamburg .
" it just would n't translate to an international audience . " but the success of raab 's latest endeavor is unlikely to surprise anyone who has kept an eye on the german entertainment scene for the past decade . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : beat the raab is one of germany 's most successful tv shows raab 's rise on german television can only be described as meteoric .
as a vj on an german music-video channel viva in 1996 , he set himself apart with his ironic , often rude humor .
his irreverence quickly won him the admiration of germany ’ s youth . in 1999 he became host of a show he created , " tv total , " which still runs four nights a week .
it focuses on ridiculing television while pairing raab as a chat host with entertainers and musicians - often on the a-list - who perform live on his show . derisive humor a hit among youth but unlike most chat-show hosts , whose job descriptions fairly demand neutrality , raab is n't urbane or fawning . bulky and goateed , he looks a little bit like the butcher that he trained to be in his youth .
he is neither handsome nor well dressed , and is mostly found wearing jeans , untucked shirts , sneakers and a self-satisfied grin . raab also does n't shy from unleashing his derisive humor on the stars who take a seat on his couch , " which makes the youth market love him , " says university of hamburg 's bleicher . indeed , his brash and boorish style tends to divide the audience into " love him " and " hate him " camps , with the deciding factor apparently being age .
the fault line falls somewhere around age 30 . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : love him or hate him , there 's no escaping him " raab is very popular with people from 12 to 29 , " bleicher said .
" it 's what the program planners are aiming for . " meanwhile , " older people ca n't stand him , " bleicher asserts .
" they think he is too aggressive , too ironic , unattractive . … he is simply rude . " of insults and lawsuits certainly raab has gotten into some well publicized hot water by ignoring the usual conventions of politesse .
he once famously ridiculed a 16-year-old model named lisa loch -lrb- in german " loch " means " hole " -rrb- saying her name could make her a porno star ; a court made him pay the teenager 70,000 euros -lrb- $ 108,000 -rrb- in damages . in a similar 2004 misstep , he showed a picture of a young turkish mother holding her child ’ s schoolbag , and quipped , " the drug traffickers are getting better and better at disguising themselves . "
that joke cost him 20,000 euros . the legal troubles seem to have had their effect , and in recent years raab has n't landed in court .
or perhaps he has just been too busy building a major entertainment empire to think up anything actionable . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the winner takes it all ...
in addition to " tv total " - which regularly sees raab paired and poking fun at celebrities on the caliber of elton john , jackie chan , eminem , kylie minogue , ben stiller , and will smith - raab 's broadcaster , the private channel pro7 , has given him free rein to create a series of entertainment " events . " quick ride in a slippery wok these usually land in prime-time slots , and run the gamut from the wacky -lrb- an annual sports event called the " wok world championship , " in which celebrities take a bobsled run while seated in an enormous cooking wok , -rrb- to the iconoclastic -lrb- a takeoff on germany ’ s version of the " american idol " show with the tongue-in-cheek name " ssdsdss , " or " stefan seeks the superstar who can sing what he or she wants " -rrb- ; the unlikely -lrb- the " bundesvision song contest , " pitting unknown bands from germany 's 16 federal states , -rrb- to the over-the-top -lrb- a project in the works called " autoball , " which involves an arena , two cars and a giant soccer ball . -rrb- moreover , raab is respected for his musical talent ; he is a self-taught musician with his own record label , which he uses to produce and promote the talent that he discovers in his contests and features on his talk show .
he was also deeply involved in the eurovision song contest , where he has been both a contestant and a promoter , and has written and cut a few hit novelty songs . a closed culture system ? if raab sounds like a one man entertainment band , or an apolitical silvio berlusconi , it 's because he is .
and like him or hate him , most people admire his ability to take the pulse of german pop culture and turn it into a sackful of euros , if nothing else . it leads to a not infrequent use of the word " genius . " in an awed 2007 article on raab in respected german newspaper die zeit , pro7 executive jobst benthues said that what raab does is " big entertaiment .
he is a genius of thinking of things first , and we give him the freedom to try things out . his successes validate our trust . " media historian bleicher agrees . " he is a genius at selling himself and his ideas , and combining several aspects of the media economy , " bleicher says .
" he combines diverse formats , like a big media conglomerate .
but he is just one person . " jennifer abramsohn send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

one of its aims is to stop the far-right infiltrating sports ' clubs . " i 'm against nazis because they do n't appear to have learned anything from german history , " explains the german captain and chelsea midfielder in a 10-second soundbite on the web site netz-gegen-nazis -lrb- network against nazis -rrb- .
tv presenter marietta slomka and talk show host maybrit illner are among the other high-profile germans featured online . the interactive internet platform , launched by the german weekly newspaper die zeit on monday , may 5 , is at the heart of the project .
it contains extensive information about the subject - including up-to-date news reports about right-wing extremism - , a forum where users can seek advice and swap facts and links to advice centers and support groups .
" we 're aiming to create a nationwide forum where people who encounter far-right ideas in their day-to-day lives can give each other advice , " said giovanni di lorenzo , the newspaper 's editor-in-chief .
together we are strong bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : germany captain michael ballack is one of the campaign 's figureheads the weekly newspaper has joined forces with a number of other partners to forge the anti-far-right alliance .
the sporting organizations involved include the german olympic sports confederation -lrb- dosb -rrb- , the german soccer federation -lrb- dfb -rrb- and the german soccer league -lrb- dfl -rrb- .
media partners include the german broadcaster zdf and online portals , schuelervz , studivz and meinvz .
the involvement of the sporting bodies reflects rising concern about far-right parties using the cover of leisure activities to spread their ideas among young people , in particular .
" right-wing extremism poses a great threat to an association like the german soccer federation because of its clubs ' grass-roots and volunteer-based structures , " said the head of the dfb , theo zwanziger .
not just football tactics , but lessons for life bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : german soccer has already been involved in a number of anti-racist initiatives he added that the point of the network against nazis was to inform and to encourage civil courage .
" as well as teaching the one-two and the bicycle kick , we have to communicate the message that it is worthwhile living in a democratic state , " said zwanziger .
but it is not only the budding players who are being targeted ; he also mentioned special training sessions for coaches .
a number of high profile events will be taking place in games in both german football leagues on tuesday , may 6 , and wednesday , to publicize the initiative .
an ad featuring ballack 's soundbite will also be shown in all stadiums .
the dfb has also announced that the national squad would also be helping to spread this message in upcoming games against serbia and belarus . it did not reveal any further details .
ingo weiss , head of the german olympic sports confederation , said that it was about turning the 27 million or so dosb members into " vigilant lions " so that the horrors of the nazi era could never be repeated .
german integration minister maria boehmer welcomed the project .
in a statement she said that media and sport carried a particular responsibility in the fight against right-wing extremism and xenophobia because of their ability to reach a wide audience . dw staff -lrb- jg -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

now a game show created by an unlikely , if ubiquitous , german tv personality is taking foreign markets by storm . can an irreverent former butcher named stefan raab save german entertainment ?
so far , 12 countries have bought the adaptation rights to a german game show called " schlag den raab , " or " beat raab . "
the latest to sign on were croatia and denmark .
a uk version is currently in production and will air this spring .
the foreign title is " beat your host ; " the uk version is called " beat the star . " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : try beating raab at this as the original title implies , the german version involves pitting a selected contestant against 42-year-old stefan raab , a talk-show host and sort-of comedian who is arguably germany ’ s most ubiquitous television personality .
the contestant tries to beat raab in a marathon four- to five-hour competition that encompasses up to 15 varied disciplines , from the physical -lrb- box stacking , ice climbing , -rrb- to the mental -lrb- poker playing , knowledge quiz -rrb- to the silly -lrb- dropping peas into a bottle . -rrb- at stake : a heap of cash . the uk version , produced by a company called itv , will pit contestants against a changing array of stars , and the contest has been shortened to last just over an hour .
the german show was the most successful new start last year , pulling viewer ratings of around 31 percent of those aged 14 to 49 . whether the same ratings dream will come true for itv , as it has for raab 's german production firm brainpool , remains to be seen .
nonetheless , raab has managed to achieve something with this show that has been done only a handful of times in german tv history : crossing over to a broad international audience . the rapid ascent of stefan raab " most successful german tv shows are strongly based on regional identities , " said joan bleicher , professor for media studies at the university of hamburg .
" it just would n't translate to an international audience . " but the success of raab 's latest endeavor is unlikely to surprise anyone who has kept an eye on the german entertainment scene for the past decade . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : beat the raab is one of germany 's most successful tv shows raab 's rise on german television can only be described as meteoric .
as a vj on an german music-video channel viva in 1996 , he set himself apart with his ironic , often rude humor .
his irreverence quickly won him the admiration of germany ’ s youth . in 1999 he became host of a show he created , " tv total , " which still runs four nights a week .
it focuses on ridiculing television while pairing raab as a chat host with entertainers and musicians - often on the a-list - who perform live on his show . derisive humor a hit among youth but unlike most chat-show hosts , whose job descriptions fairly demand neutrality , raab is n't urbane or fawning . bulky and goateed , he looks a little bit like the butcher that he trained to be in his youth .
he is neither handsome nor well dressed , and is mostly found wearing jeans , untucked shirts , sneakers and a self-satisfied grin . raab also does n't shy from unleashing his derisive humor on the stars who take a seat on his couch , " which makes the youth market love him , " says university of hamburg 's bleicher . indeed , his brash and boorish style tends to divide the audience into " love him " and " hate him " camps , with the deciding factor apparently being age .
the fault line falls somewhere around age 30 . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : love him or hate him , there 's no escaping him " raab is very popular with people from 12 to 29 , " bleicher said .
" it 's what the program planners are aiming for . " meanwhile , " older people ca n't stand him , " bleicher asserts .
" they think he is too aggressive , too ironic , unattractive . … he is simply rude . " of insults and lawsuits certainly raab has gotten into some well publicized hot water by ignoring the usual conventions of politesse .
he once famously ridiculed a 16-year-old model named lisa loch -lrb- in german " loch " means " hole " -rrb- saying her name could make her a porno star ; a court made him pay the teenager 70,000 euros -lrb- $ 108,000 -rrb- in damages . in a similar 2004 misstep , he showed a picture of a young turkish mother holding her child ’ s schoolbag , and quipped , " the drug traffickers are getting better and better at disguising themselves . "
that joke cost him 20,000 euros . the legal troubles seem to have had their effect , and in recent years raab has n't landed in court .
or perhaps he has just been too busy building a major entertainment empire to think up anything actionable . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the winner takes it all ...
in addition to " tv total " - which regularly sees raab paired and poking fun at celebrities on the caliber of elton john , jackie chan , eminem , kylie minogue , ben stiller , and will smith - raab 's broadcaster , the private channel pro7 , has given him free rein to create a series of entertainment " events .

he was also deeply involved in the eurovision song contest , where he has been both a contestant and a promoter , and has written and cut a few hit novelty songs . a closed culture system ? if raab sounds like a one man entertainment band , or an apolitical silvio berlusconi , it 's because he is .
and like him or hate him , most people admire his ability to take the pulse of german pop culture and turn it into a sackful of euros , if nothing else . it leads to a not infrequent use of the word " genius . " in an awed 2007 article on raab in respected german newspaper die zeit , pro7 executive jobst benthues said that what raab does is " big entertaiment .

now a game show created by an unlikely , if ubiquitous , german tv personality is taking foreign markets by storm . can an irreverent former butcher named stefan raab save german entertainment ?
so far , 12 countries have bought the adaptation rights to a german game show called " schlag den raab , " or " beat raab . "
the latest to sign on were croatia and denmark .
a uk version is currently in production and will air this spring .
the foreign title is " beat your host ; " the uk version is called " beat the star . " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : try beating raab at this as the original title implies , the german version involves pitting a selected contestant against 42-year-old stefan raab , a talk-show host and sort-of comedian who is arguably germany ’ s most ubiquitous television personality .
the contestant tries to beat raab in a marathon four- to five-hour competition that encompasses up to 15 varied disciplines , from the physical -lrb- box stacking , ice climbing , -rrb- to the mental -lrb- poker playing , knowledge quiz -rrb- to the silly -lrb- dropping peas into a bottle . -rrb- at stake : a heap of cash . the uk version , produced by a company called itv , will pit contestants against a changing array of stars , and the contest has been shortened to last just over an hour .
the german show was the most successful new start last year , pulling viewer ratings of around 31 percent of those aged 14 to 49 . whether the same ratings dream will come true for itv , as it has for raab 's german production firm brainpool , remains to be seen .
nonetheless , raab has managed to achieve something with this show that has been done only a handful of times in german tv history : crossing over to a broad international audience . the rapid ascent of stefan raab " most successful german tv shows are strongly based on regional identities , " said joan bleicher , professor for media studies at the university of hamburg .
" it just would n't translate to an international audience . " but the success of raab 's latest endeavor is unlikely to surprise anyone who has kept an eye on the german entertainment scene for the past decade . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : beat the raab is one of germany 's most successful tv shows raab 's rise on german television can only be described as meteoric .
as a vj on an german music-video channel viva in 1996 , he set himself apart with his ironic , often rude humor .
his irreverence quickly won him the admiration of germany ’ s youth . in 1999 he became host of a show he created , " tv total , " which still runs four nights a week .
it focuses on ridiculing television while pairing raab as a chat host with entertainers and musicians - often on the a-list - who perform live on his show . derisive humor a hit among youth but unlike most chat-show hosts , whose job descriptions fairly demand neutrality , raab is n't urbane or fawning . bulky and goateed , he looks a little bit like the butcher that he trained to be in his youth .
he is neither handsome nor well dressed , and is mostly found wearing jeans , untucked shirts , sneakers and a self-satisfied grin . raab also does n't shy from unleashing his derisive humor on the stars who take a seat on his couch , " which makes the youth market love him , " says university of hamburg 's bleicher . indeed , his brash and boorish style tends to divide the audience into " love him " and " hate him " camps , with the deciding factor apparently being age .
the fault line falls somewhere around age 30 . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : love him or hate him , there 's no escaping him " raab is very popular with people from 12 to 29 , " bleicher said .
" it 's what the program planners are aiming for . " meanwhile , " older people ca n't stand him , " bleicher asserts .
" they think he is too aggressive , too ironic , unattractive . … he is simply rude . " of insults and lawsuits certainly raab has gotten into some well publicized hot water by ignoring the usual conventions of politesse .
he once famously ridiculed a 16-year-old model named lisa loch -lrb- in german " loch " means " hole " -rrb- saying her name could make her a porno star ; a court made him pay the teenager 70,000 euros -lrb- $ 108,000 -rrb- in damages . in a similar 2004 misstep , he showed a picture of a young turkish mother holding her child ’ s schoolbag , and quipped , " the drug traffickers are getting better and better at disguising themselves . "
that joke cost him 20,000 euros . the legal troubles seem to have had their effect , and in recent years raab has n't landed in court .
or perhaps he has just been too busy building a major entertainment empire to think up anything actionable . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the winner takes it all ...
in addition to " tv total " - which regularly sees raab paired and poking fun at celebrities on the caliber of elton john , jackie chan , eminem , kylie minogue , ben stiller , and will smith - raab 's broadcaster , the private channel pro7 , has given him free rein to create a series of entertainment " events .

he was also deeply involved in the eurovision song contest , where he has been both a contestant and a promoter , and has written and cut a few hit novelty songs . a closed culture system ? if raab sounds like a one man entertainment band , or an apolitical silvio berlusconi , it 's because he is .
and like him or hate him , most people admire his ability to take the pulse of german pop culture and turn it into a sackful of euros , if nothing else . it leads to a not infrequent use of the word " genius . " in an awed 2007 article on raab in respected german newspaper die zeit , pro7 executive jobst benthues said that what raab does is " big entertaiment .

however , the inclusion of some inductees with nazi connections stirred debate . the ambitious project , " a permanent celebration of our country 's greatest athletes , " according to the head of the german sport aid foundation , ann kathrin linsenhoff , will initially contain the names of 40 of germany 's sporting heroes , with potentially three to be added to the roll call every year .
the first sportsmen and women to enter the hall of fame , officially opened by president horst koehler and minister of the interior wolfgang schaeuble , were chosen by a 25-strong jury headed by schaeuble , which considered the nature of their sporting achievement , the legacy and impact of the person , their personal attributes and whether they were a good role model for future sports stars .
initial inductee list dominated by west german males the jury was presented with a list of 150 potential inductees which had been compiled by the german olympic sports alliance , the federation of german sports journalists and the german sport aid federation .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : former showjumper hans guenter winkler with his portrait the final list of 40 , which includes the likes of boxing legend max schmeling , soccer ambassador franz beckenbauer and tennis idol gottfried von cramm , features 32 posthumous inductees .
most of the 40 are male , the exceptions being germany 's first wimbledon tennis tournament winner cilly aussem , ski idol rosi mittermaier , a double olympic champion in 1976 , and track and field athlete ingrid mickler-becker .
there is only one sports star from the former east germany in the initial batch : four-time olympic swimming champion roland matthes .
given the gdr 's well-publicized doping program in sports , the jury appears to have erred on the side of caution in the initial round of inductions .
idols with nazi links cause unease however , the jury has not managed to completely avoid controversy .
the induction of five former members of the national socialist party has already caused some heated debate as to whether those associated with the nazis should be honored and has led to some calling the new project the " hall of shame . "
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : sport aid founder neckermann had nazi links cyclist gustav kilian , athlete rudolf harbig , former german olympic president willi daume and the founder of the german sport aid foundation , josef neckermann , as well as sepp herberger , coach of the 1954 world cup winning soccer team , " the wonders of bern , " all had connections to the third reich during world war ii .
" we do not see the hall of fame as being tarnished by this , " ann kathrin linsenhoff told reporters .
" in fact it is the opposite .
this is useful in the processing of our past through sport .
to exclude those who had connections with the national socialists would be an act of arrogance by a generation which has had the luck to grow up in a democracy .

but some say the french want to have their cake and eat it . in his victory speech on may 6 , 2007 , sarkozy told thousands of people : " i do n't have the right to disappoint the country . "
but a year on , that 's exactly what the french president has done .
just over one third of the population say they support the new president , compared with some two-thirds 12 months ago .
to begin with , french voters were shocked by his hardly statesman-like behaviour with model carla bruni whom he married just weeks after divorcing his second wife cecilia in october .
he gave the impression of a man with his mind on ... well , on other things than the business of government .
beset by economic troubles and questions of style bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : sarkozy 's apparently whirlwind romance with carla bruni attracted negative publicity now the country is getting hit in the pocket and sarkozy is getting the blame .
he had pledged to boost spending power in his election campaign .
instead , it has dropped .
in march , french inflation rates reached a 17-year high of 3.2 percent .
in part , this was just bad luck .
the beginning of the president 's term in office also coincided with the onset of the global financial crisis and rocketing oil prices , helping to drive prices up .
the jury also seems to be out over the success of the flurry of reforms that he has introduced .
some analysts have praised his easing of france 's 35-hour week , his reduction of pension benefits and his reforms of the country 's overcrowded and impoverished universities .
" sarkozy had the courage to do what other presidents did n't , " philippe braud , a professor at the sciences po institute in paris , told afp news agency .
" his track record is not to be underestimated even if the french are n't convinced , " he added .
unemployment levels at historic low bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the president 's reforms sparked strikes among civil servants and railway workers in november .
braud also pointed to sarkozy 's achievement in streamlining france 's notoriously complicated labor laws .
the jobless rate has dropped to 7.5 percent , the lowest level in two decades , since he took office .
however , he said the president had announced too many projects at once and then not been able to deliver .
bruno jeanbart , of the opinionway polling institute , is of a similar opinion .
he praised sarkozy 's reform zeal , but also told afp that " there are also many areas he engaged in but in which he was perhaps too optimistic or has not followed through . "
he named these as spending power and the country 's public deficit .
other observers are more critical , saying that he bought the highly symbolic abolition of early pensions for civil servants by making expensive concessions and that rigid labor market structures remain largely untouched despite the shift away from a 35-hour week .
" he took over a country that was feeling insecure and which regarded him as the last chance to solve their structural problems , " said the political scientist dominique moisi .
" he failed to convince the french and offer them security . " a parliamentary report released this month also described as both costly and ineffective one of sarkozy 's flagship reforms , aimed at boosting incomes with a tax break on overtime pay .
the french conservative newspaper le figaro criticizes sarkozy only insofar as he did not make sufficiently clear that the changes would hurt .
" the french approve of the reforms of nicolas sarkozy , but condemn the reformer .
they 're a bit like a child that pushes away the helping hand because it does n't like the bitter taste of the medicine , " it wrote .
sarkozy admits some of the problems are his fault bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : critics have also accused sarkozy of compromising france 's human rights profile for business contracts the french president is trying to regain the population 's confidence .
just a few days ago he confessed in a tv interview : " i have made mistakes . "
and sarkozy has learned something from them , cutting out , for example , his public strutting with carla .
but apart from tackling style issues , his options are limited .
there is no money to kickstart the floundering economy .
in january , he confessed that he could not do much to help because the state " coffers were empty . "
france - which is set to take over the rotating eu presidency in july - is also facing mounting pressure from other european union member states to slash its total public deficit of around 1.2 trillion euros .
he also knows that backing down from his reform program would cost him his remaining credibility .
" i am completely aware of the dissatisfaction , but i know where i want to take things , " said sarkozy .
the honeymoon may be over , but sarkozy is hoping to persuade the electorate of the merits of a long-term relationship .

one of its aims is to stop the far-right infiltrating sports ' clubs . " i 'm against nazis because they do n't appear to have learned anything from german history , " explains the german captain and chelsea midfielder in a 10-second soundbite on the web site netz-gegen-nazis -lrb- network against nazis -rrb- .
tv presenter marietta slomka and talk show host maybrit illner are among the other high-profile germans featured online . the interactive internet platform , launched by the german weekly newspaper die zeit on monday , may 5 , is at the heart of the project .
it contains extensive information about the subject - including up-to-date news reports about right-wing extremism - , a forum where users can seek advice and swap facts and links to advice centers and support groups .
" we 're aiming to create a nationwide forum where people who encounter far-right ideas in their day-to-day lives can give each other advice , " said giovanni di lorenzo , the newspaper 's editor-in-chief .
together we are strong bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : germany captain michael ballack is one of the campaign 's figureheads the weekly newspaper has joined forces with a number of other partners to forge the anti-far-right alliance .
the sporting organizations involved include the german olympic sports confederation -lrb- dosb -rrb- , the german soccer federation -lrb- dfb -rrb- and the german soccer league -lrb- dfl -rrb- .
media partners include the german broadcaster zdf and online portals , schuelervz , studivz and meinvz .
the involvement of the sporting bodies reflects rising concern about far-right parties using the cover of leisure activities to spread their ideas among young people , in particular .
" right-wing extremism poses a great threat to an association like the german soccer federation because of its clubs ' grass-roots and volunteer-based structures , " said the head of the dfb , theo zwanziger .
not just football tactics , but lessons for life bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : german soccer has already been involved in a number of anti-racist initiatives he added that the point of the network against nazis was to inform and to encourage civil courage .
" as well as teaching the one-two and the bicycle kick , we have to communicate the message that it is worthwhile living in a democratic state , " said zwanziger .
but it is not only the budding players who are being targeted ; he also mentioned special training sessions for coaches .
a number of high profile events will be taking place in games in both german football leagues on tuesday , may 6 , and wednesday , to publicize the initiative .
an ad featuring ballack 's soundbite will also be shown in all stadiums .
the dfb has also announced that the national squad would also be helping to spread this message in upcoming games against serbia and belarus . it did not reveal any further details .
ingo weiss , head of the german olympic sports confederation , said that it was about turning the 27 million or so dosb members into " vigilant lions " so that the horrors of the nazi era could never be repeated .
german integration minister maria boehmer welcomed the project .
in a statement she said that media and sport carried a particular responsibility in the fight against right-wing extremism and xenophobia because of their ability to reach a wide audience . dw staff -lrb- jg -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

but one thing is apparent : the regime is unwilling to delay its planned referendum on the constitution , says dw 's tobias grote-beverborg . once again myanmar , formerly known as burma , is making headlines .
but not due to the referendum on the constitution which is meant to decide the country 's political future and is scheduled for saturday , may 10 .
instead , the country ruled by a military dictatorship is in the news because of the natural disaster , whose full effect remains unknown . cyclone nargis left behind a massive swathe of destruction in the country 's south , above all .
at least 15,000 people have been killed , according to official figures , while hundreds of thousands of people have been made homeless and are in need of food , water and medication .
the people are in such desperate straits that even the hard-hearted military regime must recognize that it ca n't cope with the catastrophe without foreign aid . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : tobias grote-beverborg it 's still unclear under what conditions the regime is accepting the aid .
it is , however , clear that the cyclone has upset the dictatorship 's plans .
the planned referendum on the constitution was meant to ensure a continuation of military rule and it was supposed to be passed in the manner typical of a dictatorship , tacitly and closed off from the rest of the world .
in the limelight but now the eyes of the world are on burma and foreign aid workers may end up as unwelcome election observers .
the junta hopes to avoid that by holding the vote as soon as possible - that is , keeping it on saturday .
it 's only allowing postponement of the vote in the regions hardest hit by the cyclone .
the junta has once more shown how cynically calculating it is , seeing as in terms of logistics alone , the dimensions of the catastrophe make an orderly referendum impossible . how long the regime can keep this farce going also depends on the conditions under which aid - and aid workers - is allowed into the country .
the military leaders may of course hope they can rely on their neighbors ; india and china have already promised comprehensive aid measures .
and neither will meddle in burma 's " internal affairs , " just as they have n't in the past .
hopes of an aceh scenario however , as the number of victims increases and the need for aid for the survivors becomes ever more urgent , the junta can not afford to reject further aid from abroad .
the huge contingent of foreign aid workers who became a presence in aceh , indonesia , after the tsunami catastrophe nearly four years ago led to an end to the bloody civil war there .
parallels to the situation in myanmar come to mind . discontent is already growing among the burmese due to the military 's apparent failings .
for one , people were n't warned sufficiently or far enough in advance about the extent of the approaching cyclone .
and now , national aid measures are moving sluggishly . the referendum desperately needs to be postponed .
one can only hope the referendum on the constitution takes place at a later date with international observers and that there will be truly free and fair elections in myanmar .

but one thing is apparent : the regime is unwilling to delay its planned referendum on the constitution , says dw 's tobias grote-beverborg . once again myanmar , formerly known as burma , is making headlines .
but not due to the referendum on the constitution which is meant to decide the country 's political future and is scheduled for saturday , may 10 .
instead , the country ruled by a military dictatorship is in the news because of the natural disaster , whose full effect remains unknown . cyclone nargis left behind a massive swathe of destruction in the country 's south , above all .
at least 15,000 people have been killed , according to official figures , while hundreds of thousands of people have been made homeless and are in need of food , water and medication .
the people are in such desperate straits that even the hard-hearted military regime must recognize that it ca n't cope with the catastrophe without foreign aid . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : tobias grote-beverborg it 's still unclear under what conditions the regime is accepting the aid .
it is , however , clear that the cyclone has upset the dictatorship 's plans .
the planned referendum on the constitution was meant to ensure a continuation of military rule and it was supposed to be passed in the manner typical of a dictatorship , tacitly and closed off from the rest of the world .
in the limelight but now the eyes of the world are on burma and foreign aid workers may end up as unwelcome election observers .
the junta hopes to avoid that by holding the vote as soon as possible - that is , keeping it on saturday .
it 's only allowing postponement of the vote in the regions hardest hit by the cyclone .
the junta has once more shown how cynically calculating it is , seeing as in terms of logistics alone , the dimensions of the catastrophe make an orderly referendum impossible . how long the regime can keep this farce going also depends on the conditions under which aid - and aid workers - is allowed into the country .
the military leaders may of course hope they can rely on their neighbors ; india and china have already promised comprehensive aid measures .
and neither will meddle in burma 's " internal affairs , " just as they have n't in the past .
hopes of an aceh scenario however , as the number of victims increases and the need for aid for the survivors becomes ever more urgent , the junta can not afford to reject further aid from abroad .
the huge contingent of foreign aid workers who became a presence in aceh , indonesia , after the tsunami catastrophe nearly four years ago led to an end to the bloody civil war there .
parallels to the situation in myanmar come to mind . discontent is already growing among the burmese due to the military 's apparent failings .
for one , people were n't warned sufficiently or far enough in advance about the extent of the approaching cyclone .
and now , national aid measures are moving sluggishly . the referendum desperately needs to be postponed .
one can only hope the referendum on the constitution takes place at a later date with international observers and that there will be truly free and fair elections in myanmar .

germany 's foreign ministry announced in berlin on monday , may 5 , that it would channel the pledged funds through german aid organizations .
the aid is intended to provide emergency accommodation , drinking water , household utensils and mosquito nets .
foreign minister frank-walter steinmeier expressed his condolences to the families of those who had died .

" we 're prepared to move us navy assets to help find those who 've lost their lives , to help find the missing , to help stabilize the situation .
but in order to do so , the military junta must allow our disaster assessment teams into the country , " said the president . bush spokeswoman dana perino said that washington was worried because the junta had yet to answer a us visa request for an eight-person disaster aid response team -lsb- dart -rsb- whose mission would be to assess burma 's aid needs eu calls for aid to go straight to the needy bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the eu 's foreign policy experts urge burma to open up the european union echoed the calls for the burmese authorities to " make every effort to cooperate " with relief organisations after burma said aid teams would have to meet its conditions .

however , the inclusion of some inductees with nazi connections stirred debate . the ambitious project , " a permanent celebration of our country 's greatest athletes , " according to the head of the german sport aid foundation , ann kathrin linsenhoff , will initially contain the names of 40 of germany 's sporting heroes , with potentially three to be added to the roll call every year .
the first sportsmen and women to enter the hall of fame , officially opened by president horst koehler and minister of the interior wolfgang schaeuble , were chosen by a 25-strong jury headed by schaeuble , which considered the nature of their sporting achievement , the legacy and impact of the person , their personal attributes and whether they were a good role model for future sports stars .
initial inductee list dominated by west german males the jury was presented with a list of 150 potential inductees which had been compiled by the german olympic sports alliance , the federation of german sports journalists and the german sport aid federation .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : former showjumper hans guenter winkler with his portrait the final list of 40 , which includes the likes of boxing legend max schmeling , soccer ambassador franz beckenbauer and tennis idol gottfried von cramm , features 32 posthumous inductees .
most of the 40 are male , the exceptions being germany 's first wimbledon tennis tournament winner cilly aussem , ski idol rosi mittermaier , a double olympic champion in 1976 , and track and field athlete ingrid mickler-becker .
there is only one sports star from the former east germany in the initial batch : four-time olympic swimming champion roland matthes .
given the gdr 's well-publicized doping program in sports , the jury appears to have erred on the side of caution in the initial round of inductions .
idols with nazi links cause unease however , the jury has not managed to completely avoid controversy .
the induction of five former members of the national socialist party has already caused some heated debate as to whether those associated with the nazis should be honored and has led to some calling the new project the " hall of shame . "
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : sport aid founder neckermann had nazi links cyclist gustav kilian , athlete rudolf harbig , former german olympic president willi daume and the founder of the german sport aid foundation , josef neckermann , as well as sepp herberger , coach of the 1954 world cup winning soccer team , " the wonders of bern , " all had connections to the third reich during world war ii .
" we do not see the hall of fame as being tarnished by this , " ann kathrin linsenhoff told reporters .
" in fact it is the opposite .
this is useful in the processing of our past through sport .
to exclude those who had connections with the national socialists would be an act of arrogance by a generation which has had the luck to grow up in a democracy .

one of its aims is to stop the far-right infiltrating sports ' clubs . " i 'm against nazis because they do n't appear to have learned anything from german history , " explains the german captain and chelsea midfielder in a 10-second soundbite on the web site netz-gegen-nazis -lrb- network against nazis -rrb- .
tv presenter marietta slomka and talk show host maybrit illner are among the other high-profile germans featured online . the interactive internet platform , launched by the german weekly newspaper die zeit on monday , may 5 , is at the heart of the project .
it contains extensive information about the subject - including up-to-date news reports about right-wing extremism - , a forum where users can seek advice and swap facts and links to advice centers and support groups .
" we 're aiming to create a nationwide forum where people who encounter far-right ideas in their day-to-day lives can give each other advice , " said giovanni di lorenzo , the newspaper 's editor-in-chief .
together we are strong bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : germany captain michael ballack is one of the campaign 's figureheads the weekly newspaper has joined forces with a number of other partners to forge the anti-far-right alliance .
the sporting organizations involved include the german olympic sports confederation -lrb- dosb -rrb- , the german soccer federation -lrb- dfb -rrb- and the german soccer league -lrb- dfl -rrb- .
media partners include the german broadcaster zdf and online portals , schuelervz , studivz and meinvz .
the involvement of the sporting bodies reflects rising concern about far-right parties using the cover of leisure activities to spread their ideas among young people , in particular .
" right-wing extremism poses a great threat to an association like the german soccer federation because of its clubs ' grass-roots and volunteer-based structures , " said the head of the dfb , theo zwanziger .
not just football tactics , but lessons for life bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : german soccer has already been involved in a number of anti-racist initiatives he added that the point of the network against nazis was to inform and to encourage civil courage .
" as well as teaching the one-two and the bicycle kick , we have to communicate the message that it is worthwhile living in a democratic state , " said zwanziger .
but it is not only the budding players who are being targeted ; he also mentioned special training sessions for coaches .
a number of high profile events will be taking place in games in both german football leagues on tuesday , may 6 , and wednesday , to publicize the initiative .
an ad featuring ballack 's soundbite will also be shown in all stadiums .
the dfb has also announced that the national squad would also be helping to spread this message in upcoming games against serbia and belarus . it did not reveal any further details .
ingo weiss , head of the german olympic sports confederation , said that it was about turning the 27 million or so dosb members into " vigilant lions " so that the horrors of the nazi era could never be repeated .
german integration minister maria boehmer welcomed the project .
in a statement she said that media and sport carried a particular responsibility in the fight against right-wing extremism and xenophobia because of their ability to reach a wide audience . dw staff -lrb- jg -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de sports -pipe- 06.05.2008 germany 's sporting hall of fame opens with controversy großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : ex-soccer star uwe seeler and former skier rosi mittermaier at the hall of fame opening germany 's new sporting hall of fame was offically opened at the german history museum in berlin on tuesday , may 6 .
however , the inclusion of some inductees with nazi connections stirred debate . the ambitious project , " a permanent celebration of our country 's greatest athletes , " according to the head of the german sport aid foundation , ann kathrin linsenhoff , will initially contain the names of 40 of germany 's sporting heroes , with potentially three to be added to the roll call every year .
the first sportsmen and women to enter the hall of fame , officially opened by president horst koehler and minister of the interior wolfgang schaeuble , were chosen by a 25-strong jury headed by schaeuble , which considered the nature of their sporting achievement , the legacy and impact of the person , their personal attributes and whether they were a good role model for future sports stars .
initial inductee list dominated by west german males the jury was presented with a list of 150 potential inductees which had been compiled by the german olympic sports alliance , the federation of german sports journalists and the german sport aid federation .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : former showjumper hans guenter winkler with his portrait the final list of 40 , which includes the likes of boxing legend max schmeling , soccer ambassador franz beckenbauer and tennis idol gottfried von cramm , features 32 posthumous inductees .
most of the 40 are male , the exceptions being germany 's first wimbledon tennis tournament winner cilly aussem , ski idol rosi mittermaier , a double olympic champion in 1976 , and track and field athlete ingrid mickler-becker .
there is only one sports star from the former east germany in the initial batch : four-time olympic swimming champion roland matthes .
given the gdr 's well-publicized doping program in sports , the jury appears to have erred on the side of caution in the initial round of inductions .
idols with nazi links cause unease however , the jury has not managed to completely avoid controversy .
the induction of five former members of the national socialist party has already caused some heated debate as to whether those associated with the nazis should be honored and has led to some calling the new project the " hall of shame . "
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : sport aid founder neckermann had nazi links cyclist gustav kilian , athlete rudolf harbig , former german olympic president willi daume and the founder of the german sport aid foundation , josef neckermann , as well as sepp herberger , coach of the 1954 world cup winning soccer team , " the wonders of bern , " all had connections to the third reich during world war ii .
" we do not see the hall of fame as being tarnished by this , " ann kathrin linsenhoff told reporters .
" in fact it is the opposite .
this is useful in the processing of our past through sport .
to exclude those who had connections with the national socialists would be an act of arrogance by a generation which has had the luck to grow up in a democracy .

but one thing is apparent : the regime is unwilling to delay its planned referendum on the constitution , says dw 's tobias grote-beverborg . once again myanmar , formerly known as burma , is making headlines .
but not due to the referendum on the constitution which is meant to decide the country 's political future and is scheduled for saturday , may 10 .
instead , the country ruled by a military dictatorship is in the news because of the natural disaster , whose full effect remains unknown . cyclone nargis left behind a massive swathe of destruction in the country 's south , above all .
at least 15,000 people have been killed , according to official figures , while hundreds of thousands of people have been made homeless and are in need of food , water and medication .
the people are in such desperate straits that even the hard-hearted military regime must recognize that it ca n't cope with the catastrophe without foreign aid . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : tobias grote-beverborg it 's still unclear under what conditions the regime is accepting the aid .
it is , however , clear that the cyclone has upset the dictatorship 's plans .
the planned referendum on the constitution was meant to ensure a continuation of military rule and it was supposed to be passed in the manner typical of a dictatorship , tacitly and closed off from the rest of the world .
in the limelight but now the eyes of the world are on burma and foreign aid workers may end up as unwelcome election observers .
the junta hopes to avoid that by holding the vote as soon as possible - that is , keeping it on saturday .
it 's only allowing postponement of the vote in the regions hardest hit by the cyclone .
the junta has once more shown how cynically calculating it is , seeing as in terms of logistics alone , the dimensions of the catastrophe make an orderly referendum impossible . how long the regime can keep this farce going also depends on the conditions under which aid - and aid workers - is allowed into the country .
the military leaders may of course hope they can rely on their neighbors ; india and china have already promised comprehensive aid measures .
and neither will meddle in burma 's " internal affairs , " just as they have n't in the past .
hopes of an aceh scenario however , as the number of victims increases and the need for aid for the survivors becomes ever more urgent , the junta can not afford to reject further aid from abroad .
the huge contingent of foreign aid workers who became a presence in aceh , indonesia , after the tsunami catastrophe nearly four years ago led to an end to the bloody civil war there .
parallels to the situation in myanmar come to mind . discontent is already growing among the burmese due to the military 's apparent failings .
for one , people were n't warned sufficiently or far enough in advance about the extent of the approaching cyclone .
and now , national aid measures are moving sluggishly . the referendum desperately needs to be postponed .
one can only hope the referendum on the constitution takes place at a later date with international observers and that there will be truly free and fair elections in myanmar .
if that were the case , the catastrophe - however cynical this may sound - would also have done good . tobias grote-beverborg is the managing editor of asia programs at deutsche welle -lrb- ncy -rrb- . send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

but one thing is apparent : the regime is unwilling to delay its planned referendum on the constitution , says dw 's tobias grote-beverborg . once again myanmar , formerly known as burma , is making headlines .
but not due to the referendum on the constitution which is meant to decide the country 's political future and is scheduled for saturday , may 10 .
instead , the country ruled by a military dictatorship is in the news because of the natural disaster , whose full effect remains unknown . cyclone nargis left behind a massive swathe of destruction in the country 's south , above all .
at least 15,000 people have been killed , according to official figures , while hundreds of thousands of people have been made homeless and are in need of food , water and medication .
the people are in such desperate straits that even the hard-hearted military regime must recognize that it ca n't cope with the catastrophe without foreign aid . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : tobias grote-beverborg it 's still unclear under what conditions the regime is accepting the aid .
it is , however , clear that the cyclone has upset the dictatorship 's plans .
the planned referendum on the constitution was meant to ensure a continuation of military rule and it was supposed to be passed in the manner typical of a dictatorship , tacitly and closed off from the rest of the world .
in the limelight but now the eyes of the world are on burma and foreign aid workers may end up as unwelcome election observers .
the junta hopes to avoid that by holding the vote as soon as possible - that is , keeping it on saturday .
it 's only allowing postponement of the vote in the regions hardest hit by the cyclone .
the junta has once more shown how cynically calculating it is , seeing as in terms of logistics alone , the dimensions of the catastrophe make an orderly referendum impossible . how long the regime can keep this farce going also depends on the conditions under which aid - and aid workers - is allowed into the country .
the military leaders may of course hope they can rely on their neighbors ; india and china have already promised comprehensive aid measures .
and neither will meddle in burma 's " internal affairs , " just as they have n't in the past .
hopes of an aceh scenario however , as the number of victims increases and the need for aid for the survivors becomes ever more urgent , the junta can not afford to reject further aid from abroad .
the huge contingent of foreign aid workers who became a presence in aceh , indonesia , after the tsunami catastrophe nearly four years ago led to an end to the bloody civil war there .
parallels to the situation in myanmar come to mind . discontent is already growing among the burmese due to the military 's apparent failings .
for one , people were n't warned sufficiently or far enough in advance about the extent of the approaching cyclone .
and now , national aid measures are moving sluggishly . the referendum desperately needs to be postponed .
one can only hope the referendum on the constitution takes place at a later date with international observers and that there will be truly free and fair elections in myanmar .
if that were the case , the catastrophe - however cynical this may sound - would also have done good . tobias grote-beverborg is the managing editor of asia programs at deutsche welle -lrb- ncy -rrb- . send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

it is , however , clear that the cyclone has upset the dictatorship 's plans .
the planned referendum on the constitution was meant to ensure a continuation of military rule and it was supposed to be passed in the manner typical of a dictatorship , tacitly and closed off from the rest of the world .
in the limelight but now the eyes of the world are on burma and foreign aid workers may end up as unwelcome election observers .
the junta hopes to avoid that by holding the vote as soon as possible - that is , keeping it on saturday .
it 's only allowing postponement of the vote in the regions hardest hit by the cyclone .
the junta has once more shown how cynically calculating it is , seeing as in terms of logistics alone , the dimensions of the catastrophe make an orderly referendum impossible . how long the regime can keep this farce going also depends on the conditions under which aid - and aid workers - is allowed into the country .
the military leaders may of course hope they can rely on their neighbors ; india and china have already promised comprehensive aid measures .
and neither will meddle in burma 's " internal affairs , " just as they have n't in the past .
hopes of an aceh scenario however , as the number of victims increases and the need for aid for the survivors becomes ever more urgent , the junta can not afford to reject further aid from abroad .
the huge contingent of foreign aid workers who became a presence in aceh , indonesia , after the tsunami catastrophe nearly four years ago led to an end to the bloody civil war there .
parallels to the situation in myanmar come to mind . discontent is already growing among the burmese due to the military 's apparent failings .
for one , people were n't warned sufficiently or far enough in advance about the extent of the approaching cyclone .
and now , national aid measures are moving sluggishly . the referendum desperately needs to be postponed .

however , the inclusion of some inductees with nazi connections stirred debate . the ambitious project , " a permanent celebration of our country 's greatest athletes , " according to the head of the german sport aid foundation , ann kathrin linsenhoff , will initially contain the names of 40 of germany 's sporting heroes , with potentially three to be added to the roll call every year .
the first sportsmen and women to enter the hall of fame , officially opened by president horst koehler and minister of the interior wolfgang schaeuble , were chosen by a 25-strong jury headed by schaeuble , which considered the nature of their sporting achievement , the legacy and impact of the person , their personal attributes and whether they were a good role model for future sports stars .
initial inductee list dominated by west german males the jury was presented with a list of 150 potential inductees which had been compiled by the german olympic sports alliance , the federation of german sports journalists and the german sport aid federation .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : former showjumper hans guenter winkler with his portrait the final list of 40 , which includes the likes of boxing legend max schmeling , soccer ambassador franz beckenbauer and tennis idol gottfried von cramm , features 32 posthumous inductees .
most of the 40 are male , the exceptions being germany 's first wimbledon tennis tournament winner cilly aussem , ski idol rosi mittermaier , a double olympic champion in 1976 , and track and field athlete ingrid mickler-becker .
there is only one sports star from the former east germany in the initial batch : four-time olympic swimming champion roland matthes .
given the gdr 's well-publicized doping program in sports , the jury appears to have erred on the side of caution in the initial round of inductions .
idols with nazi links cause unease however , the jury has not managed to completely avoid controversy .
the induction of five former members of the national socialist party has already caused some heated debate as to whether those associated with the nazis should be honored and has led to some calling the new project the " hall of shame . "
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : sport aid founder neckermann had nazi links cyclist gustav kilian , athlete rudolf harbig , former german olympic president willi daume and the founder of the german sport aid foundation , josef neckermann , as well as sepp herberger , coach of the 1954 world cup winning soccer team , " the wonders of bern , " all had connections to the third reich during world war ii .
" we do not see the hall of fame as being tarnished by this , " ann kathrin linsenhoff told reporters .
" in fact it is the opposite .
this is useful in the processing of our past through sport .
to exclude those who had connections with the national socialists would be an act of arrogance by a generation which has had the luck to grow up in a democracy .

however , the inclusion of some inductees with nazi connections stirred debate . the ambitious project , " a permanent celebration of our country 's greatest athletes , " according to the head of the german sport aid foundation , ann kathrin linsenhoff , will initially contain the names of 40 of germany 's sporting heroes , with potentially three to be added to the roll call every year .
the first sportsmen and women to enter the hall of fame , officially opened by president horst koehler and minister of the interior wolfgang schaeuble , were chosen by a 25-strong jury headed by schaeuble , which considered the nature of their sporting achievement , the legacy and impact of the person , their personal attributes and whether they were a good role model for future sports stars .
initial inductee list dominated by west german males the jury was presented with a list of 150 potential inductees which had been compiled by the german olympic sports alliance , the federation of german sports journalists and the german sport aid federation .

given the gdr 's well-publicized doping program in sports , the jury appears to have erred on the side of caution in the initial round of inductions .
idols with nazi links cause unease however , the jury has not managed to completely avoid controversy .
the induction of five former members of the national socialist party has already caused some heated debate as to whether those associated with the nazis should be honored and has led to some calling the new project the " hall of shame . "

the national childbirth trust wants all uk bottles clearly labelled , but the government says they are safe to use .

the national childbirth trust wants bottles containing bpa to be clearly labelled .
belinda phipps , the charity 's chief executive , said the lack of awareness was " concerning " .
" as a first step , it is important that bottles and other items that might reach a baby 's mouth are labelled in a standard and easy-to-understand way .

the charity advised parents not to pour boiling water directly into a bottle , as this could cause more of the chemical to be released .

the international police agency is launching the worldwide appeal because two years of investigations have failed to identify the man .
pictures showing the man sexually abusing at least three boys were found on the internet , police say .
last year , images of another suspected paedophile , unscrambled after they were distorted , quickly led to an arrest .
" the law enforcement community around the world has done all it can to find this man who clearly presents a danger to young children , and we are now asking the public to help identify this predator and protect other potential victims from abuse , " said interpol secretary general , ronald noble , in a statement .
police first became aware of the suspect two years ago from photos of him found on the computer hard-drive of a man arrested in norway and later convicted on paedophilia-related charges , the associated press reports .
the six pictures released by interpol show a white man , aged about 50 , with thinning grey hair .
it says it has images of the man abusing boys of between approximately six and 10 years old , which it believes were taken in south east asia in 2000 and 2001 .
" there are at least three child victims that are in the images , but it could be more , " said kristin kvigne , of the agency 's people-trafficking division .
' mr swirl ' last october interpol released pictures of a suspected paedophile who became known as mr swirl because his face had originally been disguised on the internet using a digital technique .
computer technology was used to unscramble the face of the man , who had been seen in dozens of images of abuse .
a 32-year-old canadian ex-teacher , christopher neil , was soon arrested , and is due to go on trial in thailand in june .
he denies charges of abusing a nine-year-old boy .
in the present case , the man has not attempted to disguise his identity in the photos .
ms kvigne said interpol had carefully weighed the decision to release the pictures , given the risk that an innocent person might be wrongly identified .
she urged people to contact the police if they recognise the man , and not to take any action on their own .

eyewitnesses , some of whom wished to remain anonymous , contacted the bbc via the news website .
send us your comments elderly resident of rangoon : i have n't seen anything like this in my whole life .
ex-swedish government minister jens orback , who was in rangoon when the cyclone struck : even in our hotel we could n't move because of glass falling .
we could see trees which must have been standing 100 years falling down .
for the first 10 to 12 hours there was no help from the authorities .
there were no policemen and no military on the streets but people were privately out there with their handsaws chopping the trees .
resident of laputta township , irrawaddy : in laputta , 75-80 % of the town has been destroyed .
most of the houses have the roofs blown out and smashed .
houses in the residential districts just remain as the skeleton structures .
out of town , 16 villages along the coast have been virtual wiped out .
they say nobody is helping .
resident of hlaing thar yar , near rangoon : not a single house has escaped the storm .
some houses just totally collapsed .
the local authorities are giving shelter to people in the religious centres .
there are now very few buses going into the city and the ones that are running have put up their prices fivefold .
also , the price of corrugated iron to replace our roofs and even nails has skyrocketed .
woman in rangoon : i do n't want to say much but the monks are doing all the clearing up .
i 've seen about 200 monks in kemmedine township , and the same number in sanchaung township , clearing the fallen trees and leading work parties .

it 's difficult to travel , everything has become so expensive .
i think the main water supply has dried up .
even if we use our own pumps we ca n't get any water out of the mains .
we ca n't even take a shower .
amit singh , who was in rangoon a day after the cyclone struck : there was water all over in the outskirts , and even inside the city , huge trees had just fallen on the road , windows were smashed .
we saw houses without any roofs , there were electricity poles all across the road .

ex-swedish government minister jens orback , who was in rangoon when the cyclone struck : even in our hotel we could n't move because of glass falling .

work on another development - a 30-storey residential and retail building called city spires - was also due to begin this summer but modus say it is now not a priority and is under review .

" there may be things they can do on site .

it said contracts had already been exchanged with debenhams , marks and spencer , new look , boots , river island , jjb , pizza express and nandos , which account for 60 % of lettable floor space at the development .
" modus believes that despite the banking sectors ' current liquidity issues , the combination of friars walk 's competitive rental base , newport 's excellent regional access and modus ' track record on delivery mean that the scheme will be delivered as programmed in 2010 , " it said .

lindsay fosyter , director of mind cymru , said the success of the positive choices project would depend on working in partnership with other key agencies .
barbara wilding from the big lottery fund said the projects would have a " significant impact " on the lives of people who suffer from mental health problems in wales .
homeless people " our funding will make an important strategic contribution to developing mental health services across the country , by helping people with mental health problems and supporting projects that try to overcome the barriers that they face , " she said .
" one in four of us is likely to experience mental health problems at some point during our lives so it is important to recognise the issue . "
a project helping people with mental health problems receive tailored educational courses in north wales and powys has also received just under £ 1m from the big lottery fund .
homeless people in newport are also set to benefit from a grant of over £ 300,000 to a charity which aims to provide them with therapeutic help .
and a grant of almost £ 800,000 will enable the eating disorders association to better support people in wales affected by eating disorders .

however there was controversy in march when after a meeting with the queen in belfast , irish president mary mcaleese appeared to link a visit to the ni assembly assuming responsibility for policing and the courts .
unionists , who insist the political climate is not yet right for the devolution of policing and justice powers from westminster to stormont , criticised mrs mcaleese .

since he announced his intention to quit early last month , the taoiseach has been saying his many goodbyes , the highlight of which was his address to both houses of the us congress last week when mr ahern memorably told his audience : " ireland is at peace " .
on tuesday , he met northern ireland 's first minister ian paisley , who will also soon quit the political stage , on the " green , grassy slopes of the boyne " .
twelve months ago in the middle of the republic 's general election , and just after the return of devolution and the political institutions to northern ireland , the two men met at the same site .
they opened the visitors ' centre , just in time for the 1690 battle of the boyne commemorations on the twelfth of july .
despite only getting to know each other in recent weeks , it was noticeable that the taoiseach singled out ian paisley for special praise in his last dáil speech for the dup leader 's role in the latter part of the peace process .
tribute the two leaders , who seem to genuinely like each other , took the opportunity to pay tribute to each other for their role in normalising relations on the island .
ian paisley and bertie ahern pictured last year at the battle of the boyne site but it was also the day that bertie ahern stood down as taoiseach by returning his seal of office to president mcaleese at áras an uachtaráin , her home in dublin 's phoenix park .
his successor as both fianna fáil leader and taoiseach , brian cowen , takes over on wednesday and already speculation is mounting about how he will change his cabinet .
most people expect a limited cabinet reshuffle with the major changes to come next year after the local and european elections .
mr cowen has warned people not to pay any attention to what they read in the papers , saying it is all speculation and only he knows what 's in his mind .
but few would be surprised if cavan-monaghan td brendan smith made it to the cabinet as a full member ; brian lenihan , the justice minister , became tánaiste or deputy prime minister ; if either micheál martin or dermot ahern became finance minister and donegal 's mary coughlan became either minister for foreign affairs or enterprise , trade and employment minister .
no honeymoon mr cowen is not expected to have much of a political honeymoon .
his first electoral test is just weeks away with the referendum on the lisbon treaty that reforms the european union .
brian cowen will be in the thick of it from the beginning all the main political parties with the exception of sinn fein are urging a yes vote , but the polls show growing support for those opposed , especially in the farming community .
ireland is the only country holding a referendum on the issue , so a defeat would have wider consequences than the fate of mr cowen 's reputation and all this is happening against a background of economic uncertainty , falling property prices , rising mortgages and worries about whether the famed celtic tiger , the booming economy of recent years , still prowls the country 's shores .
the taoiseach-elect has already signalled that he believes in major reforms for the irish public sector to make it more relevant to a modern economy .
but past experience shows talk of reform and the reality of reform , in the face of trade union opposition , are often very different .
and brian cowen will , indeed , have to be a biffo , a big intelligent fellow from offaly , to deliver on that .
but that 's all for another day .
tuesday is bertie 's day , his last hurrah as taoiseach .

on tuesday , he met northern ireland 's first minister ian paisley , who will also soon quit the political stage , on the " green , grassy slopes of the boyne " .
twelve months ago in the middle of the republic 's general election , and just after the return of devolution and the political institutions to northern ireland , the two men met at the same site .
they opened the visitors ' centre , just in time for the 1690 battle of the boyne commemorations on the twelfth of july .
despite only getting to know each other in recent weeks , it was noticeable that the taoiseach singled out ian paisley for special praise in his last dáil speech for the dup leader 's role in the latter part of the peace process .
tribute the two leaders , who seem to genuinely like each other , took the opportunity to pay tribute to each other for their role in normalising relations on the island .
ian paisley and bertie ahern pictured last year at the battle of the boyne site but it was also the day that bertie ahern stood down as taoiseach by returning his seal of office to president mcaleese at áras an uachtaráin , her home in dublin 's phoenix park .
his successor as both fianna fáil leader and taoiseach , brian cowen , takes over on wednesday and already speculation is mounting about how he will change his cabinet .
most people expect a limited cabinet reshuffle with the major changes to come next year after the local and european elections .
mr cowen has warned people not to pay any attention to what they read in the papers , saying it is all speculation and only he knows what 's in his mind .
but few would be surprised if cavan-monaghan td brendan smith made it to the cabinet as a full member ; brian lenihan , the justice minister , became tánaiste or deputy prime minister ; if either micheál martin or dermot ahern became finance minister and donegal 's mary coughlan became either minister for foreign affairs or enterprise , trade and employment minister .
no honeymoon mr cowen is not expected to have much of a political honeymoon .
his first electoral test is just weeks away with the referendum on the lisbon treaty that reforms the european union .
brian cowen will be in the thick of it from the beginning all the main political parties with the exception of sinn fein are urging a yes vote , but the polls show growing support for those opposed , especially in the farming community .
ireland is the only country holding a referendum on the issue , so a defeat would have wider consequences than the fate of mr cowen 's reputation and all this is happening against a background of economic uncertainty , falling property prices , rising mortgages and worries about whether the famed celtic tiger , the booming economy of recent years , still prowls the country 's shores .
the taoiseach-elect has already signalled that he believes in major reforms for the irish public sector to make it more relevant to a modern economy .
but past experience shows talk of reform and the reality of reform , in the face of trade union opposition , are often very different .
and brian cowen will , indeed , have to be a biffo , a big intelligent fellow from offaly , to deliver on that .
but that 's all for another day .
tuesday is bertie 's day , his last hurrah as taoiseach .

since he announced his intention to quit early last month , the taoiseach has been saying his many goodbyes , the highlight of which was his address to both houses of the us congress last week when mr ahern memorably told his audience : " ireland is at peace " .
on tuesday , he met northern ireland 's first minister ian paisley , who will also soon quit the political stage , on the " green , grassy slopes of the boyne " .
twelve months ago in the middle of the republic 's general election , and just after the return of devolution and the political institutions to northern ireland , the two men met at the same site .
they opened the visitors ' centre , just in time for the 1690 battle of the boyne commemorations on the twelfth of july .
despite only getting to know each other in recent weeks , it was noticeable that the taoiseach singled out ian paisley for special praise in his last dáil speech for the dup leader 's role in the latter part of the peace process .
tribute the two leaders , who seem to genuinely like each other , took the opportunity to pay tribute to each other for their role in normalising relations on the island .
ian paisley and bertie ahern pictured last year at the battle of the boyne site but it was also the day that bertie ahern stood down as taoiseach by returning his seal of office to president mcaleese at áras an uachtaráin , her home in dublin 's phoenix park .
his successor as both fianna fáil leader and taoiseach , brian cowen , takes over on wednesday and already speculation is mounting about how he will change his cabinet .
most people expect a limited cabinet reshuffle with the major changes to come next year after the local and european elections .
mr cowen has warned people not to pay any attention to what they read in the papers , saying it is all speculation and only he knows what 's in his mind .
but few would be surprised if cavan-monaghan td brendan smith made it to the cabinet as a full member ; brian lenihan , the justice minister , became tánaiste or deputy prime minister ; if either micheál martin or dermot ahern became finance minister and donegal 's mary coughlan became either minister for foreign affairs or enterprise , trade and employment minister .
no honeymoon mr cowen is not expected to have much of a political honeymoon .
his first electoral test is just weeks away with the referendum on the lisbon treaty that reforms the european union .
brian cowen will be in the thick of it from the beginning all the main political parties with the exception of sinn fein are urging a yes vote , but the polls show growing support for those opposed , especially in the farming community .
ireland is the only country holding a referendum on the issue , so a defeat would have wider consequences than the fate of mr cowen 's reputation and all this is happening against a background of economic uncertainty , falling property prices , rising mortgages and worries about whether the famed celtic tiger , the booming economy of recent years , still prowls the country 's shores .
the taoiseach-elect has already signalled that he believes in major reforms for the irish public sector to make it more relevant to a modern economy .
but past experience shows talk of reform and the reality of reform , in the face of trade union opposition , are often very different .
and brian cowen will , indeed , have to be a biffo , a big intelligent fellow from offaly , to deliver on that .
but that 's all for another day .
tuesday is bertie 's day , his last hurrah as taoiseach .

the bank also unveiled losses for the first quarter of 2008 of 11.5bn swiss francs -lrb- $ 11bn ; £ 5.5bn -rrb- .
ubs said it expected current " tough trading conditions " to remain , forcing the group to " actively " cut costs .
the job losses - 7 % of the workforce - will go by mid-2009 through redundancy , redeployment or natural wastage .
the investment banking division will see 2,600 jobs lost , with most going through redundancy , the company said .
no further information about where the jobs would be cut was given .
high-risk investments " the first quarter has demonstrated that we can address tough challenges on our own and with the support of our shareholders " marcel rohner , ubs chief executive ubs has so far reported write-downs of $ 37bn -lrb- £ 18.5bn -rrb- , more than any other leading bank .
in a report to shareholders last month , the bank admitted its growth strategy had been too ambitious and lacked sufficient risk control .
that plan had led to a substantial exposure in its investment banking arm to much riskier assets , including investments linked to the us sub-prime market , whose value plummeted when the housing slowdown and credit crunch took hold .
ubs said on tuesday it had substantially reduced the level of risk in its investment portfolio since the third quarter of 2007 .
" we can see tangible effects as a result of our initial responses to the losses , " said chief executive marcel rohner in a statement .
" while our exposure is still subject to swings in market conditions , we see market demand for these securities returning in certain areas and at the current level of valuations . "
exposure to us sub-prime residential mortgages has decreased by about 60 % , the company said .
mr rohner said he did not think the bank 's problems meant it had to seek a merger with another company .
" the first quarter has demonstrated that we can address tough challenges on our own and with the support of our shareholders , " he said .

the bank also unveiled losses for the first quarter of 2008 of 11.5bn swiss francs -lrb- $ 11bn ; £ 5.5bn -rrb- .
ubs said it expected current " tough trading conditions " to remain , forcing the group to " actively " cut costs .
the job losses - 7 % of the workforce - will go by mid-2009 through redundancy , redeployment or natural wastage .
the investment banking division will see 2,600 jobs lost , with most going through redundancy , the company said .
no further information about where the jobs would be cut was given .
high-risk investments the first quarter has demonstrated that we can address tough challenges on our own and with the support of our shareholders marcel rohner , ubs chief executive ubs has so far reported write-downs of $ 37bn -lrb- £ 18.5bn -rrb- , more than any other leading bank .
in a report to shareholders last month , the bank admitted its growth strategy had been too ambitious and lacked sufficient risk control .
that plan had led to a substantial exposure in its investment banking arm to much riskier assets , including investments linked to the us sub-prime market , whose value plummeted when the housing slowdown and credit crunch took hold .
ubs said on tuesday it had substantially reduced the level of risk in its investment portfolio since the third quarter of 2007 .
" we can see tangible effects as a result of our initial responses to the losses , " said chief executive marcel rohner in a statement .
" while our exposure is still subject to swings in market conditions , we see market demand for these securities returning in certain areas and at the current level of valuations . "
exposure to us sub-prime residential mortgages has decreased by about 60 % , the company said .
mr rohner said he did not think the bank 's problems meant it had to seek a merger with another company .
" the first quarter has demonstrated that we can address tough challenges on our own and with the support of our shareholders , " he said .
