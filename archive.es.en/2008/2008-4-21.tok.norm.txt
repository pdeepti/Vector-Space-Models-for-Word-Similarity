program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de turkey -pipe- 21.04.2008 eu plans new accession negotiations with turkey at critical time großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : turkey is facing domestic trials at a time when the eu is looking for progress on reforms turkey , facing the most critical phase of its eu accession negotiations , has been told that two new policy chapters will be opened in june .
however , eu officials warn that there is still a long road ahead for ankara . austrian foreign minister ursala plassnik pledged on monday , april 21 , to keep european union membership negotiations with turkey open , but stressed that austria 's position was that the result of the talks would not necessarily mean that turkey will join the union . speaking at a joint press conference in ankara with her turkish counterpart ali babacan , plassnik said it was important that accession talks continue and that the door is not shut on turkey but that the talks would not necessarily lead to full membership . " our goal is to have turkey as a stable modern dynamic , successful partner , as close a partner of the european union as is imaginable , " plassnik said .
" we are aware that for the turkish side , the one and only exclusive goal is membership in the european union .
i have been trying to enlarge the scope of imagination on that specific point ...
i could imagine a tailor-made turkey-european union community . " babacan repeated that turkey 's aim was full membership and refused to be drawn on alternatives .
he stressed that any decision on turkish membership would occur in the future and that continued people-to- people ties would result in public opinion in europe supporting turkish membership . " the membership decision will not be made on yesterday 's turkey or today 's turkey , but on the turkey of the future , " babacan said . turkey facing domestic tests as eu watches closely bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : turkey 's constitutional court is hearing the closure case on the issue of the potential closure by the turkish constitutional court of the ruling justice and development party -lrb- akp -rrb- for allegedly becoming a focus of anti-secular activities , a topic that has led to criticism from the european union of the turkish legal system , plassnik said the eu should not act as an international police officer .
it was up to turkey to debate the role of secularism in society . babacan refused to speculate on what might happen if his party is closed , saying that he believed turkey would find a solution . " this year our country will go through other tests but i believe our country will pass these tests , " he said . the two foreign ministers said they had agreed to enhance cooperation against terrorism with plassnik making it clear that austria considered the separatist kurdish workers ' party -lrb- pkk -rrb- a terrorist organization . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : austria 's foreign minister ursula plassnik " we are fighting against terrorism with the same determination as others , " plassnik said in response to a question that austria had last year allowed a senior pkk member to flee to iraq .
" i regret that in the turkish media there was a wrong impression concerning austria 's determination to fight terrorism , including the pkk . " turkish media condemned austria 's actions last year when it allegedly allowed riza altun , a senior pkk representative in europe , to escape to iraq despite the fact he was wanted by turkish authorities .
the actions of the austrian government in allowing altun to go free were also condemned by the turkish foreign ministry . rehn warns of akp closure case impact plassnik 's visit coincided with the publication of an interview given by the eu 's enlargement commissioner olli rehn in which he announced that the eu was planning to open two new chapters in turkey 's accession negotiations in june . however , he added that ankara was facing a more critical phase than at any time since its negotiations to join the european union began three years ago . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : rehn hopes turkey will emerge stronger from its trials rehn said in an interview with the german daily die welt that the closure case against the akp was adding extra pressure on ankara at a time when its progress on necessary reforms was also faltering . rehn predicted turkey could emerge with its democratic institutions strengthened once the closure case was resolved , provided that all sides showed willingness to compromise and the necessary reforms were pushed through . delays on both sides hinders turkey 's progress rehn said he also expected turkey to become a member of eu within 10 to 15 years should it continue reforms decisively , according to a separate report from turkey 's anatolian news agency . " we expect freedom of expression for all , " rehn said .
" we expect that the rights of women and minorities are protected . " the eu has been particularly critical of strict laws governing the offence of " insulting turkishness , " under which writers have been prosecuted in the past . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : journalists like ocak isik yurtcu have been jailed in turkey in addition to turkey sticking to its reform course , the enlargement commissioner added that the eu should also play its part by standing by its commitments on turkish accession .
regarding slow progress on the accession process , which began in 2005 , rehn said six of 35 policy chapters in the process had been opened and a further two - business law and intellectual property - would be opened in june . the eu suspended negotiations in eight chapters because of turkey 's refusal to open its ports to greek cypriot vessels . further chapters , including energy , would be opened under the french eu presidency in the second half of the year , rehn said . turkey angered by talk of privileged partnership the french eu presidency may prove to be another critical phase for turkey 's hopes . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : merkel and sarkozy both advocate privileged partnership french president nicolas sarkozy , together with german chancellor angela merkel , has suggested turkey should accept a privileged partnership with the eu and not full eu membership . this stance has angered prime minister tayyip erdogan who has said that his country would settle for nothing less than full membership of the european union . " turkey can not accept any alternative which is going to rule out full membership of the eu , " erdogan said earlier this month .
" an enlargement that is going to embrace turkey is not going to undermine the eu , is not going to weaken the eu . " at the nato summit in bucharest this month , sarkozy attempted conciliation by telling turkish president abdullah gul that france did not oppose the opening of negotiations chapters with turkey and that there would be special attention paid to the negotiations during the french eu presidency to strengthen turkey 's integration into the eu . dw staff / dpa -lrb- nda -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

however , eu officials warn that there is still a long road ahead for ankara . austrian foreign minister ursala plassnik pledged on monday , april 21 , to keep european union membership negotiations with turkey open , but stressed that austria 's position was that the result of the talks would not necessarily mean that turkey will join the union . speaking at a joint press conference in ankara with her turkish counterpart ali babacan , plassnik said it was important that accession talks continue and that the door is not shut on turkey but that the talks would not necessarily lead to full membership . " our goal is to have turkey as a stable modern dynamic , successful partner , as close a partner of the european union as is imaginable , " plassnik said .
" we are aware that for the turkish side , the one and only exclusive goal is membership in the european union .
i have been trying to enlarge the scope of imagination on that specific point ...
i could imagine a tailor-made turkey-european union community . " babacan repeated that turkey 's aim was full membership and refused to be drawn on alternatives .
he stressed that any decision on turkish membership would occur in the future and that continued people-to- people ties would result in public opinion in europe supporting turkish membership . " the membership decision will not be made on yesterday 's turkey or today 's turkey , but on the turkey of the future , " babacan said . turkey facing domestic tests as eu watches closely bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : turkey 's constitutional court is hearing the closure case on the issue of the potential closure by the turkish constitutional court of the ruling justice and development party -lrb- akp -rrb- for allegedly becoming a focus of anti-secular activities , a topic that has led to criticism from the european union of the turkish legal system , plassnik said the eu should not act as an international police officer .
it was up to turkey to debate the role of secularism in society . babacan refused to speculate on what might happen if his party is closed , saying that he believed turkey would find a solution . " this year our country will go through other tests but i believe our country will pass these tests , " he said . the two foreign ministers said they had agreed to enhance cooperation against terrorism with plassnik making it clear that austria considered the separatist kurdish workers ' party -lrb- pkk -rrb- a terrorist organization . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : austria 's foreign minister ursula plassnik " we are fighting against terrorism with the same determination as others , " plassnik said in response to a question that austria had last year allowed a senior pkk member to flee to iraq .
" i regret that in the turkish media there was a wrong impression concerning austria 's determination to fight terrorism , including the pkk . " turkish media condemned austria 's actions last year when it allegedly allowed riza altun , a senior pkk representative in europe , to escape to iraq despite the fact he was wanted by turkish authorities .
the actions of the austrian government in allowing altun to go free were also condemned by the turkish foreign ministry . rehn warns of akp closure case impact plassnik 's visit coincided with the publication of an interview given by the eu 's enlargement commissioner olli rehn in which he announced that the eu was planning to open two new chapters in turkey 's accession negotiations in june . however , he added that ankara was facing a more critical phase than at any time since its negotiations to join the european union began three years ago . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : rehn hopes turkey will emerge stronger from its trials rehn said in an interview with the german daily die welt that the closure case against the akp was adding extra pressure on ankara at a time when its progress on necessary reforms was also faltering . rehn predicted turkey could emerge with its democratic institutions strengthened once the closure case was resolved , provided that all sides showed willingness to compromise and the necessary reforms were pushed through . delays on both sides hinders turkey 's progress rehn said he also expected turkey to become a member of eu within 10 to 15 years should it continue reforms decisively , according to a separate report from turkey 's anatolian news agency . " we expect freedom of expression for all , " rehn said .
" we expect that the rights of women and minorities are protected . " the eu has been particularly critical of strict laws governing the offence of " insulting turkishness , " under which writers have been prosecuted in the past . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : journalists like ocak isik yurtcu have been jailed in turkey in addition to turkey sticking to its reform course , the enlargement commissioner added that the eu should also play its part by standing by its commitments on turkish accession .
regarding slow progress on the accession process , which began in 2005 , rehn said six of 35 policy chapters in the process had been opened and a further two - business law and intellectual property - would be opened in june . the eu suspended negotiations in eight chapters because of turkey 's refusal to open its ports to greek cypriot vessels . further chapters , including energy , would be opened under the french eu presidency in the second half of the year , rehn said . turkey angered by talk of privileged partnership the french eu presidency may prove to be another critical phase for turkey 's hopes . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : merkel and sarkozy both advocate privileged partnership french president nicolas sarkozy , together with german chancellor angela merkel , has suggested turkey should accept a privileged partnership with the eu and not full eu membership . this stance has angered prime minister tayyip erdogan who has said that his country would settle for nothing less than full membership of the european union . " turkey can not accept any alternative which is going to rule out full membership of the eu , " erdogan said earlier this month .
" an enlargement that is going to embrace turkey is not going to undermine the eu , is not going to weaken the eu . " at the nato summit in bucharest this month , sarkozy attempted conciliation by telling turkish president abdullah gul that france did not oppose the opening of negotiations chapters with turkey and that there would be special attention paid to the negotiations during the french eu presidency to strengthen turkey 's integration into the eu . dw staff / dpa -lrb- nda -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

the actions of the austrian government in allowing altun to go free were also condemned by the turkish foreign ministry . rehn warns of akp closure case impact plassnik 's visit coincided with the publication of an interview given by the eu 's enlargement commissioner olli rehn in which he announced that the eu was planning to open two new chapters in turkey 's accession negotiations in june . however , he added that ankara was facing a more critical phase than at any time since its negotiations to join the european union began three years ago . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : rehn hopes turkey will emerge stronger from its trials rehn said in an interview with the german daily die welt that the closure case against the akp was adding extra pressure on ankara at a time when its progress on necessary reforms was also faltering . rehn predicted turkey could emerge with its democratic institutions strengthened once the closure case was resolved , provided that all sides showed willingness to compromise and the necessary reforms were pushed through . delays on both sides hinders turkey 's progress rehn said he also expected turkey to become a member of eu within 10 to 15 years should it continue reforms decisively , according to a separate report from turkey 's anatolian news agency .

however , eu officials warn that there is still a long road ahead for ankara . austrian foreign minister ursala plassnik pledged on monday , april 21 , to keep european union membership negotiations with turkey open , but stressed that austria 's position was that the result of the talks would not necessarily mean that turkey will join the union . speaking at a joint press conference in ankara with her turkish counterpart ali babacan , plassnik said it was important that accession talks continue and that the door is not shut on turkey but that the talks would not necessarily lead to full membership . " our goal is to have turkey as a stable modern dynamic , successful partner , as close a partner of the european union as is imaginable , " plassnik said .
" we are aware that for the turkish side , the one and only exclusive goal is membership in the european union .
i have been trying to enlarge the scope of imagination on that specific point ...
i could imagine a tailor-made turkey-european union community . " babacan repeated that turkey 's aim was full membership and refused to be drawn on alternatives .
he stressed that any decision on turkish membership would occur in the future and that continued people-to- people ties would result in public opinion in europe supporting turkish membership . " the membership decision will not be made on yesterday 's turkey or today 's turkey , but on the turkey of the future , " babacan said . turkey facing domestic tests as eu watches closely bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : turkey 's constitutional court is hearing the closure case on the issue of the potential closure by the turkish constitutional court of the ruling justice and development party -lrb- akp -rrb- for allegedly becoming a focus of anti-secular activities , a topic that has led to criticism from the european union of the turkish legal system , plassnik said the eu should not act as an international police officer .
it was up to turkey to debate the role of secularism in society . babacan refused to speculate on what might happen if his party is closed , saying that he believed turkey would find a solution . " this year our country will go through other tests but i believe our country will pass these tests , " he said . the two foreign ministers said they had agreed to enhance cooperation against terrorism with plassnik making it clear that austria considered the separatist kurdish workers ' party -lrb- pkk -rrb- a terrorist organization . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : austria 's foreign minister ursula plassnik " we are fighting against terrorism with the same determination as others , " plassnik said in response to a question that austria had last year allowed a senior pkk member to flee to iraq .
" i regret that in the turkish media there was a wrong impression concerning austria 's determination to fight terrorism , including the pkk . " turkish media condemned austria 's actions last year when it allegedly allowed riza altun , a senior pkk representative in europe , to escape to iraq despite the fact he was wanted by turkish authorities .

" we have to stand behind our decision , " steinmeier said , adding that western capitals have engaged in discussions with beijing for decades over the human rights abuses in china and the tibetan independence movement . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : steinmeier : " we have to stand behind our decision " steinmeier said he sees his job as being to deflate tensions between tibet and the chinese government , a conflict that has unleashed protests worldwide and especially in cities along the route of the olympic torch relay . steinmeier urges a broad view this job is made easier by the fact that china is eager to make the olympic games a success , steinmeier said . " we have to continue trying to convince the chinese , " he said .
" i 've been on the phone three times with the chinese foreign minister and urged him not to use force " when dealing with protesters . steinmeier said the near daily aggravation of the situation is " not acceptable , " but also called for western governments to remain aware of the sea-change taking place in chinese society . " in a very short time , the country has brought 300 million people from bitter poverty to a humble prosperity , " he said .
" great parts of the developing world look to china with interest and sympathy . " french president nicolas sarkozy appeared to be backpedaling on his hard line , as anti-french sentiment is mushrooming in beijing .
the chinese have begun boycotts of carrefour and held numerous demonstrations over the weekend outside the french retail giant 's stores in china . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : sarkozy is not eager to harm relations with china sarkozy , who previously has urged the chinese government to open talks with the dalai lama and has suggested he might boycott the olympic opening ceremonies in beijing on aug .
8 , decided to send former prime minister jean-pierre raffarin and the presidential foreign affairs advisor , jean-david levitte , to china to calm bilateral tensions . raffarin is scheduled to travel to beijing on wednesday to meet with chinese premier wen jiabao .
he will be carrying a message from sarkozy addressed to the chinese leadership . personal apology from le president in an effort to calm chinese anger over the protest-plagued progress of the olympic flame through france , sarkozy sent a note to disabled female athlete jin jing , who had tried to defend the flame during its run through paris . " i wish to tell you that i was shocked by the attacks you were subjected to on april 7 in paris , " sarkozy wrote .
the letter was delivered to her monday in shanghai by french senate president christian poncelet . " it is understandable that the chinese people were hurt , and i firmly condemn -lsb- those acts -rsb- , " the french president wrote . jin jing , a 27-year-old para-olympics fencer who lost her leg to cancer as a child , became a heroine in china after pictures were flashed around the world showing her protecting the torch from pro-tibetan demonstrators from her wheelchair . the torch was extinguished at least twice during its relay in paris , and the relay itself was cut short because of the numerous anti-chinese incidents along its route . counter-demonstrations in europe meanwhile , chinese in china and in europe have begun staging counter-demonstrations , protesting what they say is a misleading depiction of china in the media and biased media coverage of the torch relay . on saturday , april 19 , several thousand chinese rallied in paris , britain and berlin , supporting the beijing olympics . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the torch relay met protest in paris around 3,000 pro-chinese activists demonstrated in the central potsdamer platz area of berlin , gripping banners with messages like " media = untruths , " and " china olympia , one world , one dream . " on the same day in paris , nearly 4,000 chinese students and other expatriates gathered in the place de la republique , according to police estimates .
they wore t-shirts with the slogan " one china , one family , " and waved signs criticizing the western media . " we 're demonstrating against the disinformation in the french and western media , to promote the olympic games and to construct a bridge between the french and chinese people - and not a wall as the media do , " one of the rally 's spokesmen , thierry liu , told the afp news service . more than 1,000 people , mainly students , also gathered outside the bbc 's offices in manchester , north-west england , while around 300 staged a demonstration outside the houses of parliament in london . the european commission on monday said people were free to show their displeasure with the west 's reaction to demonstrations in tibet and media coverage of the run-up to the 2008 olympics . " all points of view can be expressed but of course all of this has to remain very peaceful , " european commission spokesman johannes laitenberger told reporters in brussels . dw staff -lrb- jen -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

there has been widespread media criticism of businesses , which have made job cuts or relocated their plants abroad to cut costs despite rising profits . speaking at the opening of the hanover industrial trade fair on sunday , april 19 , she praised the " cohesive power " of the social market economy , which many see as helping to bring about the country 's economic miracle after world war ii . managers urged to lead by example bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : german engineering firm siemens is one of the firms hit by corruption scandals juergen thumann , head of the bdi , the federation of german industries , said the behavior of business people also played a role in determining whether people would support this social model in the future .

“ forced to be cruel ” will open on june 2 , 2008 , at 4 p.m. at the world conference center in bonn and features 80 emotionally-charged photos .
this is the first time that this selection of photos will be on display , with other shows in new york and tokyo following this fall .
the participating , internationally-renown photographers include : lynsey addario , who documented child soldiers in sudan , martin adler -lrb- columbia -rrb- , riccardo gangale , cedric gerbehaye , roger lemoyne -lrb- congo -rrb- , tim hetherington -lrb- liberia -rrb- , peter mantello -lrb- burma -rrb- , q. sakamaki -lrb- afghanistan -rrb- , dominic sansoni -lrb- sri lanka -rrb- and ami vitale -lrb- nepal -rrb- .

they are being recruited for regular armed forces and rebel groups and forced into combat .

according to the statute of the criminal court , those who send children under the age of 15 into combat can be charged as a war criminal .

“ forced to be cruel ” will open on june 2 , 2008 , at 4 p.m. at the world conference center in bonn and features 80 emotionally-charged photos .
this is the first time that this selection of photos will be on display , with other shows in new york and tokyo following this fall .
the participating , internationally-renown photographers include : lynsey addario , who documented child soldiers in sudan , martin adler -lrb- columbia -rrb- , riccardo gangale , cedric gerbehaye , roger lemoyne -lrb- congo -rrb- , tim hetherington -lrb- liberia -rrb- , peter mantello -lrb- burma -rrb- , q. sakamaki -lrb- afghanistan -rrb- , dominic sansoni -lrb- sri lanka -rrb- and ami vitale -lrb- nepal -rrb- .

they are being recruited for regular armed forces and rebel groups and forced into combat .
in many conflicts , child soldiers are a constant component of the military infrastructure .

equally important is the international criminal court in den haag .
according to the statute of the criminal court , those who send children under the age of 15 into combat can be charged as a war criminal .

" that shows that even they see the case as problematic . " similar citations for bnd in 2006 germany saw a scandal involving the bnd spying on journalists back in 2006 .
at the time , a report emerged from the parliamentary committee acknowledging that intelligence agents had illegally spied on journalists to expose their sources . a 180-page parliamentary report released at the time showed that measures taken by the bnd against german reporters in an effort to shut off leaks violated the law . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : koelbl had contacts to high-ranking officials " regarding the accusations in the press that the federal intelligence agency ... illegally spied on journalists in order to expose their sources , it is to be ascertained that such observations did take place ... these measures were predominantly illegal , " the 2006 report read . bnd agents picked through the journalists ' rubbish and traced their research , the report stated .
while none of the reporters was bugged , agents used other measures against them to try to uncover their sources , including stealing a box of his papers that one journalist had thrown away and tracing another 's research in the federal archive . as a result , germany 's ranking dropped on a ranking list of press freedom complied by the independent journalism advocacy group reporters without borders . dw staff -lrb- jen -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

" i can tell you on behalf of the european union - all the countries of the european union - that we will continue to be working with the government , working with the people of afghanistan for the long haul , " solana said after meeting with afghan president hamid karzai and other senior ministry officials in the fortified presidential palace in kabul on monday , april 21 .
" we , the people in europe , will continue to be helping the people of afghanistan to get what they deserve , the stability , prosperity and peace , " he added .
a renewed commitment bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : solana praised the on-going efforts in afghanistan solana jetted into the capital for a day-long trip which , he said in remarks published in a kabul daily monday , came at an important time of " renewed commitment by the international community " to struggling afghanistan .
following his arrival , solana paid a visit to the headquarters of the eu police mission in afghanistan -lrb- eupol -rrb- and met with police officials .
since june of last year , some 230 eupol officials have been training the upper echelons of the afghan security forces .
eupol is also assisting other western training missions and is now spreading its operations to cover the whole country .
solana praised the progress that afghanistan has made in the past several years since the fall of the taliban , saying " tremendous efforts have been done in education .
the tremendous effort ... done in health is something that we take into great consideration . "
europe is the second largest contributor after the united states to military and development efforts in afghanistan since the 2001 fall of the extremist taliban regime , and president karzai praised the european union as " among the best supporters of afghanistan . "
high hopes for paris donors ' conference bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : karzai thanked the eu and hoped for continued help during their discussions , solana and karzai discussed a number of other issues including security , governance , and rule of law in afghanistan , as well as the international preparation for the afghan donors ' conference in paris in june .
" this is the moment to reflect on what we , the international community , can do , working in conjunction with our afghan partners , to enhance our efforts , " he said of the up-coming conference .
afghanistan is hoping the donors ' meeting in paris will secure $ 50 billion -lrb- 30 billion euros -rrb- in aid to implement a five-year development plan , finance minister anwar-ul haq ahadi said monday .
the plan , called the national development strategy -lrb- ands -rrb- , was presented to donors at an " aid effectiveness " conference in kabul at the same time as solana 's meeting .
based on a year of wide-ranging consultations , it will be assessed by the world bank and international monetary fund , ahadi told reporters after the meeting .
the finalized strategy would become the basis of requests from donors at the june conference , he said .
" for this strategy , the afghan government has asked the world for $ 50 billion in aid for five years , " he said .

and success would involve more than a military effort to eliminate extremists , whose ranks are said to be reinforced , trained and equipped by militant camps in neighboring pakistan .
" the approach must be global and joined up , encompassing the rule of law , development , reconstruction , economic growth , rural development and education , " solana said .
" it is very important that the efforts should be led by afghans , " he said , reflecting growing demands by karzai and his government for more ownership of the work in their country .
despite the paris conference 's emphasis on civilian assistance , it is likely that the financial cost and loss of soldiers killed fighting taliban extremists will also be discussed , at a time of growing doubts within some allied nations about the mammoth mission , which has been criticized as wasteful and disjointed .
pakistan visit on itinerary after leaving kabul , solana was expected for talks with pakistan 's president pervez musharraf in islamabad on tuesday .

" it is very important that the efforts should be led by afghans , " he said , reflecting growing demands by karzai and his government for more ownership of the work in their country .

dw-world.de spoke to von richthofen biographer joachim castan about the man behind the myth . the prussian nobleman - dubbed the red baron because of the color of his aircraft - shot down some 80 allied planes before his death at the age of 25 .
his life has become the stuff of legend .
a new film about the red baron , which opened in germany this month , also revives the heroic image .
joachim castan , 41 , was the first historian to write a biography of this famous figure .
the biographer and documentary filmmaker spent three years researching the project , gaining exclusive access to previously unpublished writings and letters .
the book , called " die ganze geschichte " -lrb- the whole story -rrb- and published in 2007 , reveals a far more complex character .
dw-world.de : did your image of von richthofen change in the course of your research ?
joachim castan : i must admit that i had an image of von richthofen before i started my research of him as the last true gentleman of the skies in a dehumanized , industrialized brutal war , heroically participating in airborne duels .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : castan 's preconceptions were overturned while working on the book as i became immersed in the material , i realized that there was a well-maintained von richthofen myth .
the myth propagates the idea that von richthofen forced pilots to land .
he shot down aircraft , but he ensured , if at all possible , that the pilot survived , so that the whole encounter took on the character of a sporting match to determine the better pilot and marksman .
this turned out to be an image created by the german propaganda machine in 1917 .
it needed a young , good-looking radiant hero , a victor who could be served up to a relatively demoralized society . this image of the lonely gentleman of the skies was then taken up in the 1920s and further elaborated upon by the americans , who wanted to sell a romantic notion of air combat .
and who was the man you discovered ?
he was completely different .
without doubt , he was extremely courageous and extremely ambitious , but he was also cold-blooded .
his goal was to shoot down as many aircraft as possible .
in his own writings , he writes quite openly : " i never get into an aircraft for fun .
i aim first for the head of the pilot , or rather at the head of the observer , if there was one . "
i do n't think that von richthofen would have described himself as a hero .
he was doing his duty to defend his fatherland .
at the same time , he was satisfying his passion for hunting .
he was already a passionate hunter at the age of 11 and was taken hunting by his father .
aim , shoot , destroy target - he took his passion for hunting to the skies , transposing it one-to-one .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : von richthofen around 1917 i also do not think he was a brutal killer .
von richthofen also reflected partially upon what he did .
he wrote that he always felt terrible when he came off duty .
he used to come home and lock himself in his room for hours and refuse to talk to anyone .
from mid-1917 he also realized that the war was probably going to be lost .
for me he is a tragic figure , fighting fanatically , remorselessly , in a war that is lost .
what made him into the kind of person he was ?
his mother was extraordinarily ambitious and did n't think much of her husband .
he retired early and did not have a very successful career as an officer .
all of the family 's ambitions were invested first in the eldest son , manfred , and then in the second son , lothar , who was also a fighter pilot .
the young manfred was sent at the age of 11 to a prussian cadet school , which were pretty infamous .
the children were honed into soldiers and there was no scope for any ifs , ands or buts .
the intellectual aspect of schooling was largely neglected .
the children had to function as soldiers first and foremost .
it 's interesting : if you look at von richthofen 's personal development , it showed that , first of all , he functioned in this way .
then a year before his death , he started to come to his senses and think about his actions .
i think he gradually realized that he had arrived at a dead end .
you say that the red baron myth was created in 1917 .
it served then as propaganda intended to boost morale .
but why is it now being revived ?
what is the reason for the current interest in this figure ?
in germany currently , we are thinking about war , heroes , and war heroes , we are rethinking our position .
deployment in a war in afghanistan would have been unthinkable in germany 10 years ago .
at the same time , we are thinking about reintroducing medals to reward bravery .
for germany , that is a very unusual situation because of our history , the third reich and the hitler dictatorship .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : matthias schweighoefer plays the red baron in the new film in other countries , in france , britain and the united states , hero cults exist .
in germany , they ceased to exist after 1945 .
i believe that there is a certain tendency toward reintroducing heroes , to hold them up as examples , as military models and to make military conflict socially acceptable again .
what do you think about the portrayal of von richthofen in nikolai muellerschoen 's new film , " the red baron ? "
the film revives the richthofen myth in parts .
it turns him into a radiant figure , someone who becomes a good person / pacifist through his love for a nurse .
it is a way of seeing von richthofen that is popular at the moment - as a sort of broken hero who is relatively blameless in some respects .
there are those responsible for conducting the war , who are evil , and the good hero .

dw-world.de spoke to von richthofen biographer joachim castan about the man behind the myth . the prussian nobleman - dubbed the red baron because of the color of his aircraft - shot down some 80 allied planes before his death at the age of 25 .
his life has become the stuff of legend .
a new film about the red baron , which opened in germany this month , also revives the heroic image .
joachim castan , 41 , was the first historian to write a biography of this famous figure .
the biographer and documentary filmmaker spent three years researching the project , gaining exclusive access to previously unpublished writings and letters .
the book , called " die ganze geschichte " -lrb- the whole story -rrb- and published in 2007 , reveals a far more complex character .
dw-world.de : did your image of von richthofen change in the course of your research ?
joachim castan : i must admit that i had an image of von richthofen before i started my research of him as the last true gentleman of the skies in a dehumanized , industrialized brutal war , heroically participating in airborne duels .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : castan 's preconceptions were overturned while working on the book as i became immersed in the material , i realized that there was a well-maintained von richthofen myth .

his mother was extraordinarily ambitious and did n't think much of her husband .

what is the reason for the current interest in this figure ?
in germany currently , we are thinking about war , heroes , and war heroes , we are rethinking our position .
deployment in a war in afghanistan would have been unthinkable in germany 10 years ago .
at the same time , we are thinking about reintroducing medals to reward bravery .
for germany , that is a very unusual situation because of our history , the third reich and the hitler dictatorship .

" we are in touch with the uk authorities concerning this scheme and it is far too early to start speculating about whether it is state aid or not , " said jonathan todd , spokesman for the eu 's top competition regulator .
the bank of england 's plan is designed to allow high street banks to swap mortgage-backed securities for government bonds to try to boost liquidity at a time when banks are hesitant to lend to each other .
the intervention followed a meeting of britain 's top bankers with prime minister gordon brown last week , at which the emergency measures were discussed .
" we will make sure that there is enough liquidity in the economy so that we can continue to lend money for businesses and lend money for people to buy their own houses , " brown later said .

the plan is also designed to tackle an estimated overhang of 35 billion pounds of debt in the 1.2 trillion pounds uk mortgage market that banks would have repackaged and sold on , had the credit crisis not hit .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de asia -pipe- 21.04.2008 eu disappoints some readers with response to china großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the eu does n't have plans to invite the dalai lama to brussels some readers wrote in to say they are disappointed with the eu 's response to china 's dealings with tibet . the following comments reflect the views of dw-world.de readers .
not all reader comments have been published .
dw-world.de reserves the right to edit for length and appropriateness of content . if the slovenian presidency of the eu bends to chinese political pressure , then democracy has been struck a deadly blow .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de trans-atlantic relations -pipe- 21.04.2008 german foreign minister embarks on us fact-finding mission großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : steinmeier will assess the foreign policies of the three us presidential candidates german foreign minister frank-walter steinmeier travels to the us on friday , april 11 , for talks with secretary of state condoleezza rice .
dw-world.de talked with a trans-atlantic relations expert about the visit . among the themes likely to come up for discussion during steinmeier 's visit to washington are the middle east conflict , iran 's nuclear program and the situation in the balkans .
during the trip , the german delegation intends to gain information at first hand on the foreign-policy attitudes of the candidates in the us presidential election .
dw-world.de talked to julianne smith , the director of the europe program at the center for strategic and international studies , a bipartisan think-tank based in washington , about the visit .
dw-world.de : part of steinmeier 's visit will include a fact-finding mission to assess the foreign-policy platforms of the us presidential candidates .
considering germany 's foreign-policy stance on issues such as the middle east -lsb- including relations with iran -rsb- , afghanistan , russia and the european union 's role on the international stage , which of the us candidates are most likely to be more in line with the germans ?
julianne smith : all three of the us presidential candidates have some foreign policy issues which the europeans and the germans will be encouraged by .
all three want to close down guantanamo bay , all three want to get tough on torture and roll back many of the policies which the bush administration have brought in which have alienated many of washington 's allies , and all three want to get on board with climate change initiatives .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : john mccain takes a number of hardline stances however , john mccain may be a potential problem .
he is fiercely critical of russia and is likely to stake an incredibly harsh stance on relations .
he has spoken about throwing russia out of the g8 ; he has pilloried putin and has equal disdain for medvedev .
it is likely that mccain would challenge germany on its relations with russia , especially over energy security .
clinton and obama would also take a stand on russia but one which is in no way as harsh as mccain .
neither would consider throwing russia out of the g8 .
there could also be potential conflict over iraq .
mccain is a supporter of the war and believes that the troop surge has been a success , although he admits there have been management failures .
so , given the germans ' view of the iraq war , this could be a sore point .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : clinton and obama would be closer to european policy clinton and specifically obama would come to europe without that iraq baggage .
obama would come and say " look , i was never in favor , i was never a supporter but i have inherited this . "
the europeans would more than likely hear him out .
hillary is a little less clear cut on this issue , as her initial campaign outings showed when she was called on her vagueness over the war .
but both will want to have dialogue with europe over iraq and will want to find solutions together .
iran is another area where there is a big difference .
mccain is in favor of the military option and is absolutely resolute that there should be no appeasement or rewards for iranian compromise .
the democrats have both said that the military option remains on the table but are in favor of dialogue , obama especially .
hillary is more hesitant on that .
either way , both democrats are in favor of the german approach of encouraging discussions with iran .
then again , all three would urge the europeans to increase their economic sanctions and utilize their power , such as when germany closed some banking operations down in tehran .
steinmeier will also meet with secretary of state condoleezza rice during his visit .
given the situations which arose during the last nato meeting in bucharest , regarding russia , the balkans , the potential membership of former soviet states -lsb- ukraine , georgia -rsb- , what can the germans hope for in these talks in terms of progress on the issues washington and berlin are divided on ?
it 's very likely that this meeting will be used to reiterate points made at the nato summit in bucharest rather than to try and make progress on the issues .
rice will probably lecture germany on the ukraine and georgia issue and reiterate president bush 's desire for these countries to join nato .
there could be friction here .
word has it that the way bush pressured the europeans over ukraine and georgia , even after the europeans made it clear that the issue was off the table , angered many .
chancellor merkel in particular was said to have been very upset by that .
so i think steinmeier will also take the opportunity to reiterate germany and the eu 's position and do so strongly .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : steinmeier and rice will reiterate their nations ' positions the balkans will also feature .
the us is very interested in seeing how the eu mission to kosovo works out when it is deployed and what the details of the mission will be .
there will also be some discussion on the missile defense shield .
it 's most likely that the agenda will feature issues which are geopolitically closer to europe than the us .
it is also very likely that steinmeier will press rice for information on the progress in the palestinian-israeli situation .
the us has been sending people to the region for many months now after making some pretty ambitious plans and claims .
steinmeier will want to know what is happening .
the germans , and steinmeier in particular , are very interested in the resolution of this conflict .
will rice use this opportunity to apply more pressure on germany in regard to its involvement in afghanistan ?
rice will probably leave the troop issue to defense secretary robert gates .
what she will be more interested in will be finding out what germany is considering in advance of the meeting france is hosting about civilian aid and missions to afghanistan .
she 'll be interested in what germany has to offer and whether there can be any joint initiatives with the us .
should china be on the agenda , what is the likelihood that the us and germany will find a common stance ?
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : europe is hardening its stance against china china could come up as a topic for discussion , but it is n't really on rice 's agenda , although with the situation in tibet and the current discussion over the olympic games , it may be talked about .
the two nations have very different stances and relations with china , so it is unlikely they will try and broach any of these during these short discussions .
the us has different geopolitical interests in china ; it has strong ties with taiwan and the us has troops in the region .
there is also this idea that the europeans are a lot softer on china than the americans .
in the last two years , things have really changed though .
trade deficits and other economic concerns have made the europeans a little more nervous over their relations with china , and the eu has actually developed a firmer stance recently .
even so , europe and the us keep very much to themselves over the people 's republic , and even germany 's trade ties with china wo n't be of enough interest for it to become a hot topic at these discussions . interview : nick amies send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

all three want to close down guantanamo bay , all three want to get tough on torture and roll back many of the policies which the bush administration have brought in which have alienated many of washington 's allies , and all three want to get on board with climate change initiatives .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : john mccain takes a number of hardline stances however , john mccain may be a potential problem .
he is fiercely critical of russia and is likely to stake an incredibly harsh stance on relations .
he has spoken about throwing russia out of the g8 ; he has pilloried putin and has equal disdain for medvedev .
it is likely that mccain would challenge germany on its relations with russia , especially over energy security .
clinton and obama would also take a stand on russia but one which is in no way as harsh as mccain .
neither would consider throwing russia out of the g8 .
there could also be potential conflict over iraq .
mccain is a supporter of the war and believes that the troop surge has been a success , although he admits there have been management failures .
so , given the germans ' view of the iraq war , this could be a sore point .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : clinton and obama would be closer to european policy clinton and specifically obama would come to europe without that iraq baggage .
obama would come and say " look , i was never in favor , i was never a supporter but i have inherited this . "
the europeans would more than likely hear him out .
hillary is a little less clear cut on this issue , as her initial campaign outings showed when she was called on her vagueness over the war .
but both will want to have dialogue with europe over iraq and will want to find solutions together .
iran is another area where there is a big difference .
mccain is in favor of the military option and is absolutely resolute that there should be no appeasement or rewards for iranian compromise .
the democrats have both said that the military option remains on the table but are in favor of dialogue , obama especially .
hillary is more hesitant on that .
either way , both democrats are in favor of the german approach of encouraging discussions with iran .
then again , all three would urge the europeans to increase their economic sanctions and utilize their power , such as when germany closed some banking operations down in tehran .
steinmeier will also meet with secretary of state condoleezza rice during his visit .
given the situations which arose during the last nato meeting in bucharest , regarding russia , the balkans , the potential membership of former soviet states -lsb- ukraine , georgia -rsb- , what can the germans hope for in these talks in terms of progress on the issues washington and berlin are divided on ?
it 's very likely that this meeting will be used to reiterate points made at the nato summit in bucharest rather than to try and make progress on the issues .
rice will probably lecture germany on the ukraine and georgia issue and reiterate president bush 's desire for these countries to join nato .
there could be friction here .
word has it that the way bush pressured the europeans over ukraine and georgia , even after the europeans made it clear that the issue was off the table , angered many .
chancellor merkel in particular was said to have been very upset by that .
so i think steinmeier will also take the opportunity to reiterate germany and the eu 's position and do so strongly .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : steinmeier and rice will reiterate their nations ' positions the balkans will also feature .
the us is very interested in seeing how the eu mission to kosovo works out when it is deployed and what the details of the mission will be .
there will also be some discussion on the missile defense shield .
it 's most likely that the agenda will feature issues which are geopolitically closer to europe than the us .
it is also very likely that steinmeier will press rice for information on the progress in the palestinian-israeli situation .
the us has been sending people to the region for many months now after making some pretty ambitious plans and claims .
steinmeier will want to know what is happening .
the germans , and steinmeier in particular , are very interested in the resolution of this conflict .
will rice use this opportunity to apply more pressure on germany in regard to its involvement in afghanistan ?
rice will probably leave the troop issue to defense secretary robert gates .
what she will be more interested in will be finding out what germany is considering in advance of the meeting france is hosting about civilian aid and missions to afghanistan .
she 'll be interested in what germany has to offer and whether there can be any joint initiatives with the us .
should china be on the agenda , what is the likelihood that the us and germany will find a common stance ?
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : europe is hardening its stance against china china could come up as a topic for discussion , but it is n't really on rice 's agenda , although with the situation in tibet and the current discussion over the olympic games , it may be talked about .
the two nations have very different stances and relations with china , so it is unlikely they will try and broach any of these during these short discussions .
the us has different geopolitical interests in china ; it has strong ties with taiwan and the us has troops in the region .
there is also this idea that the europeans are a lot softer on china than the americans .
in the last two years , things have really changed though .
trade deficits and other economic concerns have made the europeans a little more nervous over their relations with china , and the eu has actually developed a firmer stance recently .
even so , europe and the us keep very much to themselves over the people 's republic , and even germany 's trade ties with china wo n't be of enough interest for it to become a hot topic at these discussions . interview : nick amies send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

steinmeier will also meet with secretary of state condoleezza rice during his visit .
given the situations which arose during the last nato meeting in bucharest , regarding russia , the balkans , the potential membership of former soviet states -lsb- ukraine , georgia -rsb- , what can the germans hope for in these talks in terms of progress on the issues washington and berlin are divided on ?
it 's very likely that this meeting will be used to reiterate points made at the nato summit in bucharest rather than to try and make progress on the issues .
rice will probably lecture germany on the ukraine and georgia issue and reiterate president bush 's desire for these countries to join nato .
there could be friction here .
word has it that the way bush pressured the europeans over ukraine and georgia , even after the europeans made it clear that the issue was off the table , angered many .
chancellor merkel in particular was said to have been very upset by that .

the us is very interested in seeing how the eu mission to kosovo works out when it is deployed and what the details of the mission will be .
there will also be some discussion on the missile defense shield .
it 's most likely that the agenda will feature issues which are geopolitically closer to europe than the us .
it is also very likely that steinmeier will press rice for information on the progress in the palestinian-israeli situation .
the us has been sending people to the region for many months now after making some pretty ambitious plans and claims .
steinmeier will want to know what is happening .
the germans , and steinmeier in particular , are very interested in the resolution of this conflict .
will rice use this opportunity to apply more pressure on germany in regard to its involvement in afghanistan ?
rice will probably leave the troop issue to defense secretary robert gates .
what she will be more interested in will be finding out what germany is considering in advance of the meeting france is hosting about civilian aid and missions to afghanistan .
she 'll be interested in what germany has to offer and whether there can be any joint initiatives with the us .
should china be on the agenda , what is the likelihood that the us and germany will find a common stance ?

dw-world.de talked with a trans-atlantic relations expert about the visit . among the themes likely to come up for discussion during steinmeier 's visit to washington are the middle east conflict , iran 's nuclear program and the situation in the balkans .
during the trip , the german delegation intends to gain information at first hand on the foreign-policy attitudes of the candidates in the us presidential election .
dw-world.de talked to julianne smith , the director of the europe program at the center for strategic and international studies , a bipartisan think-tank based in washington , about the visit .
dw-world.de : part of steinmeier 's visit will include a fact-finding mission to assess the foreign-policy platforms of the us presidential candidates .
considering germany 's foreign-policy stance on issues such as the middle east -lsb- including relations with iran -rsb- , afghanistan , russia and the european union 's role on the international stage , which of the us candidates are most likely to be more in line with the germans ?
julianne smith : all three of the us presidential candidates have some foreign policy issues which the europeans and the germans will be encouraged by .
all three want to close down guantanamo bay , all three want to get tough on torture and roll back many of the policies which the bush administration have brought in which have alienated many of washington 's allies , and all three want to get on board with climate change initiatives .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : john mccain takes a number of hardline stances however , john mccain may be a potential problem .
he is fiercely critical of russia and is likely to stake an incredibly harsh stance on relations .
he has spoken about throwing russia out of the g8 ; he has pilloried putin and has equal disdain for medvedev .
it is likely that mccain would challenge germany on its relations with russia , especially over energy security .
clinton and obama would also take a stand on russia but one which is in no way as harsh as mccain .
neither would consider throwing russia out of the g8 .
there could also be potential conflict over iraq .
mccain is a supporter of the war and believes that the troop surge has been a success , although he admits there have been management failures .
so , given the germans ' view of the iraq war , this could be a sore point .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : clinton and obama would be closer to european policy clinton and specifically obama would come to europe without that iraq baggage .
obama would come and say " look , i was never in favor , i was never a supporter but i have inherited this . "
the europeans would more than likely hear him out .
hillary is a little less clear cut on this issue , as her initial campaign outings showed when she was called on her vagueness over the war .
but both will want to have dialogue with europe over iraq and will want to find solutions together .
iran is another area where there is a big difference .
mccain is in favor of the military option and is absolutely resolute that there should be no appeasement or rewards for iranian compromise .
the democrats have both said that the military option remains on the table but are in favor of dialogue , obama especially .
hillary is more hesitant on that .
either way , both democrats are in favor of the german approach of encouraging discussions with iran .
then again , all three would urge the europeans to increase their economic sanctions and utilize their power , such as when germany closed some banking operations down in tehran .
steinmeier will also meet with secretary of state condoleezza rice during his visit .

germany 's foreign intelligence service acknowledged , and apologized for , having spied on a german journalist .
it 's not the first time german agents have been caught keeping tabs on reporters . the federal intelligence agency -lrb- bnd -rrb- , read e-mail correspondence that susanne koelbl , an editor at the german newsweekly der spiegel , had exchanged with an afghani politician between june and november , 2006 , according to a report that broke in spiegel in the edition of the magazine published monday , april 21 . bnd chief ernst uhrlau informed koelbl of its actions on friday and apologized at the same time .
koelbl has been reporting for years for the magazine from crisis areas in asia 's hindu kush mountain region . parliament to discuss case according to the web site of koelbl 's publisher , random house , the author has been covering afghanistan since the fall of the taliban , and " has access to almost everyone within the government in kabul , but also to ...

the committee is responsible for monitoring the bnd . acting chairman of the parliamentary control committee , max stadler , has demanded an explanation . " the -lrb- german -rrb- basic law applies even to those germans living abroad , and this was a clear breach of press freedom , " he told the tagesspiegel newspaper . the bnd has already been involved in " spying affairs " involving journalists in past years , and should have developed a stricter attitude about it , stadler told the paper . " the bnd has already apologized to ms. koelbl , " he said .
" that shows that even they see the case as problematic . " similar citations for bnd in 2006 germany saw a scandal involving the bnd spying on journalists back in 2006 .
at the time , a report emerged from the parliamentary committee acknowledging that intelligence agents had illegally spied on journalists to expose their sources . a 180-page parliamentary report released at the time showed that measures taken by the bnd against german reporters in an effort to shut off leaks violated the law . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : koelbl had contacts to high-ranking officials " regarding the accusations in the press that the federal intelligence agency ... illegally spied on journalists in order to expose their sources , it is to be ascertained that such observations did take place ... these measures were predominantly illegal , " the 2006 report read . bnd agents picked through the journalists ' rubbish and traced their research , the report stated .
while none of the reporters was bugged , agents used other measures against them to try to uncover their sources , including stealing a box of his papers that one journalist had thrown away and tracing another 's research in the federal archive . as a result , germany 's ranking dropped on a ranking list of press freedom complied by the independent journalism advocacy group reporters without borders . dw staff -lrb- jen -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

photo exhibition can be seen at the deutsche welle global media forum in june , as well as new york and tokyo this fall . germany ’ s international broadcaster and the foundation for international dialogue of the savings bank in bonn will bring attention to the fate of child soldiers with a special photo exhibition at the deutsche welle global media forum , from june 2-4 , 2008 .
“ forced to be cruel ” will open on june 2 , 2008 , at 4 p.m. at the world conference center in bonn and features 80 emotionally-charged photos .
this is the first time that this selection of photos will be on display , with other shows in new york and tokyo following this fall .
the participating , internationally-renown photographers include : lynsey addario , who documented child soldiers in sudan , martin adler -lrb- columbia -rrb- , riccardo gangale , cedric gerbehaye , roger lemoyne -lrb- congo -rrb- , tim hetherington -lrb- liberia -rrb- , peter mantello -lrb- burma -rrb- , q. sakamaki -lrb- afghanistan -rrb- , dominic sansoni -lrb- sri lanka -rrb- and ami vitale -lrb- nepal -rrb- .
the british photographer tim hetherington was recently awarded the “ oscar ” for press photographers , the world press photo prize , for his photo of a wounded american soldier in iraq .
photographer and film-maker peter mantello was the one who established the exhibition .
he is currently a professor at a university in japan .
mantello , along with the curator of the exhibition leora khan from new york , will be in bonn for the premiere .
according to international estimations , there are 300,000 child soldiers worldwide .
they are being recruited for regular armed forces and rebel groups and forced into combat .
in many conflicts , child soldiers are a constant component of the military infrastructure .
an important milestone in the fight against children in combat is the additional protocol to the un children ’ s rights convention , in which the signing nations agreed not to recruit anyone under the age of 18 .
equally important is the international criminal court in den haag .
according to the statute of the criminal court , those who send children under the age of 15 into combat can be charged as a war criminal .
from more than 10 years , many national and international organizations have been making an effort to counteract the situation facing child soldiers and shed light on the subject worldwide . the foundation for international dialogue of the savings bank in bonn is co-hosting the deutsche welle global media forum .
the conference is also being supported by the german federal foreign office , the state government of north-rhine westphalia , dhl , the city of bonn , vt communications and blatzheim networks telecom .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de history -pipe- 21.04.2008 biographer unveils man behind the red baron myth großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : with his fokker plane , baron von richthofen was molded into a war hero world war one fighter pilot manfred von richthofen - a.k.a. the red baron - died in combat 90 years ago , on april 21 , 1918 .
dw-world.de spoke to von richthofen biographer joachim castan about the man behind the myth . the prussian nobleman - dubbed the red baron because of the color of his aircraft - shot down some 80 allied planes before his death at the age of 25 .
his life has become the stuff of legend .
a new film about the red baron , which opened in germany this month , also revives the heroic image .
joachim castan , 41 , was the first historian to write a biography of this famous figure .
the biographer and documentary filmmaker spent three years researching the project , gaining exclusive access to previously unpublished writings and letters .
the book , called " die ganze geschichte " -lrb- the whole story -rrb- and published in 2007 , reveals a far more complex character .
dw-world.de : did your image of von richthofen change in the course of your research ?
joachim castan : i must admit that i had an image of von richthofen before i started my research of him as the last true gentleman of the skies in a dehumanized , industrialized brutal war , heroically participating in airborne duels .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : castan 's preconceptions were overturned while working on the book as i became immersed in the material , i realized that there was a well-maintained von richthofen myth .
the myth propagates the idea that von richthofen forced pilots to land .
he shot down aircraft , but he ensured , if at all possible , that the pilot survived , so that the whole encounter took on the character of a sporting match to determine the better pilot and marksman .
this turned out to be an image created by the german propaganda machine in 1917 .
it needed a young , good-looking radiant hero , a victor who could be served up to a relatively demoralized society . this image of the lonely gentleman of the skies was then taken up in the 1920s and further elaborated upon by the americans , who wanted to sell a romantic notion of air combat .
and who was the man you discovered ?
he was completely different .
without doubt , he was extremely courageous and extremely ambitious , but he was also cold-blooded .
his goal was to shoot down as many aircraft as possible .
in his own writings , he writes quite openly : " i never get into an aircraft for fun .
i aim first for the head of the pilot , or rather at the head of the observer , if there was one . "
i do n't think that von richthofen would have described himself as a hero .
he was doing his duty to defend his fatherland .
at the same time , he was satisfying his passion for hunting .
he was already a passionate hunter at the age of 11 and was taken hunting by his father .
aim , shoot , destroy target - he took his passion for hunting to the skies , transposing it one-to-one .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : von richthofen around 1917 i also do not think he was a brutal killer .
von richthofen also reflected partially upon what he did .
he wrote that he always felt terrible when he came off duty .
he used to come home and lock himself in his room for hours and refuse to talk to anyone .
from mid-1917 he also realized that the war was probably going to be lost .
for me he is a tragic figure , fighting fanatically , remorselessly , in a war that is lost .
what made him into the kind of person he was ?
his mother was extraordinarily ambitious and did n't think much of her husband .
he retired early and did not have a very successful career as an officer .
all of the family 's ambitions were invested first in the eldest son , manfred , and then in the second son , lothar , who was also a fighter pilot .
the young manfred was sent at the age of 11 to a prussian cadet school , which were pretty infamous .
the children were honed into soldiers and there was no scope for any ifs , ands or buts .
the intellectual aspect of schooling was largely neglected .
the children had to function as soldiers first and foremost .
it 's interesting : if you look at von richthofen 's personal development , it showed that , first of all , he functioned in this way .
then a year before his death , he started to come to his senses and think about his actions .
i think he gradually realized that he had arrived at a dead end .
you say that the red baron myth was created in 1917 .
it served then as propaganda intended to boost morale .
but why is it now being revived ?
what is the reason for the current interest in this figure ?
in germany currently , we are thinking about war , heroes , and war heroes , we are rethinking our position .
deployment in a war in afghanistan would have been unthinkable in germany 10 years ago .
at the same time , we are thinking about reintroducing medals to reward bravery .
for germany , that is a very unusual situation because of our history , the third reich and the hitler dictatorship .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : matthias schweighoefer plays the red baron in the new film in other countries , in france , britain and the united states , hero cults exist .
in germany , they ceased to exist after 1945 .
i believe that there is a certain tendency toward reintroducing heroes , to hold them up as examples , as military models and to make military conflict socially acceptable again .
what do you think about the portrayal of von richthofen in nikolai muellerschoen 's new film , " the red baron ? "
the film revives the richthofen myth in parts .
it turns him into a radiant figure , someone who becomes a good person / pacifist through his love for a nurse .
it is a way of seeing von richthofen that is popular at the moment - as a sort of broken hero who is relatively blameless in some respects .
there are those responsible for conducting the war , who are evil , and the good hero .
this is a distinction that people like to make at the moment . interview : julie gregson send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

not all reader comments have been published .
dw-world.de reserves the right to edit for length and appropriateness of content . if the slovenian presidency of the eu bends to chinese political pressure , then democracy has been struck a deadly blow .
the decision to invite the tibetan head of state , his holiness the dalai lama , must be made with openness in mind , not political pressures .
so in effect china has used its political power to again snuff out democracy and that is a crying shame . what i suspect here is that slovenia has some links with china , but be they political or trade they must not interfere with the practice of open democracy in europe .
so slovenia must know why it used its eu presidency as a means to further its own position with china .
the eu must make clear to slovenia that it is not a forum of deceit .
case closed . - kenneth v. tellis , canada bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : one reader recommended sanctions on chinese products yes , as europeans believing in human rights there should be sanctions against china .
as producers ourselves , there should be sanctions against china .
many western goods are counterfeit and made in china but sold illegally in europe regardless of copyright and patent ; many products that are taken in the mouth -lrb- toothpaste , etc , -rrb- have been found to contain unfit ingredients ; many well-known toy brands that we buy for our children that are made in china have toxic ingredients , and many people , such as prisoners , are forced to work as slaves to create the great chinese economic progress . but the big multi-nationals have made sure we do n't have much choice in buying products that are not made in china .
they made sure they closed down their european factories and opened them up in china where life and labor is cheap and their greed insures they get the best profit .
anyone know where you can still buy toys that are not made in china ?
i will be your first customer . - kaye poole , britain so far , the british and germans are not the focus .
china likes to target the betrayer and the frontier , namely france and the us .
and so far the wasp has succeeded in uniting the catholics , and showing the chinese that the frenchmen are nothing better .
let 's see the reaction of the germans , and see how the anglo can work with the saxons as it unfolds .
china 's dream has definitely been interrupted .
rem period is gone - a step closer to be awakened .
remember what napoleon said about a sleeping lion ? - berg mcfly , china it is unfortunate that china can browbeat the european union on the basis of the economic leverage it enjoys today vis-a-vis europe .
that the eu chooses to remain a mute spectator on the tibet crackdown and refrain from officially recognizing the dalai lama amounts to lending credibility to the religious persecution of christians sponsored by the atheist regime in beijing . do we assume that the rich european tradition of promoting democratic values and peaceful coexistence is fading day by day ?
how else can the european union presidency ignore the reality of 46 christians being arrested for holding a bible class and worshiping in a private home without government permission ?
perhaps it is time that the european citizens decide whether or not to support a tyrannical regime that does not even believe in granting the christians , muslims and tibetan buddhist minorities the right and freedom to quietly express their faith . - seema sengupta , india i think the eu should send a large fact-finding mission to tibet to see the real situation without chinese officials and spies with them then to decide it .
tibetans should have freedom to use their own language and live according to their own style .
tibet has its own language , culture and customs .
chinese leaders in tibet do n't know them and ca n't even speak tibetan . - tsering , china compiled by dw staff -lrb- kjb -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?
dw-world.de eu presidency will not invite dalai lama to brussels the eu 's slovenian presidency said that it would not invite the dalai lama to brussels to meet with the bloc 's foreign ministers , as paris has proposed , but would not rule out other contacts with the tibetan leader .
-lrb- 19.04.2008 -rrb- economic sanctions wrong way to deal with china , experts say beijing 's reaction to the protests in tibet has prompted germans to call for a boycott of the olympics and economic sanctions .

photo exhibition can be seen at the deutsche welle global media forum in june , as well as new york and tokyo this fall . germany ’ s international broadcaster and the foundation for international dialogue of the savings bank in bonn will bring attention to the fate of child soldiers with a special photo exhibition at the deutsche welle global media forum , from june 2-4 , 2008 .
“ forced to be cruel ” will open on june 2 , 2008 , at 4 p.m. at the world conference center in bonn and features 80 emotionally-charged photos .
this is the first time that this selection of photos will be on display , with other shows in new york and tokyo following this fall .
the participating , internationally-renown photographers include : lynsey addario , who documented child soldiers in sudan , martin adler -lrb- columbia -rrb- , riccardo gangale , cedric gerbehaye , roger lemoyne -lrb- congo -rrb- , tim hetherington -lrb- liberia -rrb- , peter mantello -lrb- burma -rrb- , q. sakamaki -lrb- afghanistan -rrb- , dominic sansoni -lrb- sri lanka -rrb- and ami vitale -lrb- nepal -rrb- .

photographer and film-maker peter mantello was the one who established the exhibition .

they are being recruited for regular armed forces and rebel groups and forced into combat .

equally important is the international criminal court in den haag .
according to the statute of the criminal court , those who send children under the age of 15 into combat can be charged as a war criminal .

“ forced to be cruel ” will open on june 2 , 2008 , at 4 p.m. at the world conference center in bonn and features 80 emotionally-charged photos .
this is the first time that this selection of photos will be on display , with other shows in new york and tokyo following this fall .
the participating , internationally-renown photographers include : lynsey addario , who documented child soldiers in sudan , martin adler -lrb- columbia -rrb- , riccardo gangale , cedric gerbehaye , roger lemoyne -lrb- congo -rrb- , tim hetherington -lrb- liberia -rrb- , peter mantello -lrb- burma -rrb- , q. sakamaki -lrb- afghanistan -rrb- , dominic sansoni -lrb- sri lanka -rrb- and ami vitale -lrb- nepal -rrb- .

photographer and film-maker peter mantello was the one who established the exhibition .
he is currently a professor at a university in japan .
mantello , along with the curator of the exhibition leora khan from new york , will be in bonn for the premiere .
according to international estimations , there are 300,000 child soldiers worldwide .
they are being recruited for regular armed forces and rebel groups and forced into combat .
in many conflicts , child soldiers are a constant component of the military infrastructure .
an important milestone in the fight against children in combat is the additional protocol to the un children ’ s rights convention , in which the signing nations agreed not to recruit anyone under the age of 18 .
equally important is the international criminal court in den haag .
according to the statute of the criminal court , those who send children under the age of 15 into combat can be charged as a war criminal .
from more than 10 years , many national and international organizations have been making an effort to counteract the situation facing child soldiers and shed light on the subject worldwide . the foundation for international dialogue of the savings bank in bonn is co-hosting the deutsche welle global media forum .
the conference is also being supported by the german federal foreign office , the state government of north-rhine westphalia , dhl , the city of bonn , vt communications and blatzheim networks telecom .

" i can tell you on behalf of the european union - all the countries of the european union - that we will continue to be working with the government , working with the people of afghanistan for the long haul , " solana said after meeting with afghan president hamid karzai and other senior ministry officials in the fortified presidential palace in kabul on monday , april 21 .
" we , the people in europe , will continue to be helping the people of afghanistan to get what they deserve , the stability , prosperity and peace , " he added .
a renewed commitment bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : solana praised the on-going efforts in afghanistan solana jetted into the capital for a day-long trip which , he said in remarks published in a kabul daily monday , came at an important time of " renewed commitment by the international community " to struggling afghanistan .
following his arrival , solana paid a visit to the headquarters of the eu police mission in afghanistan -lrb- eupol -rrb- and met with police officials .
since june of last year , some 230 eupol officials have been training the upper echelons of the afghan security forces .
eupol is also assisting other western training missions and is now spreading its operations to cover the whole country .
solana praised the progress that afghanistan has made in the past several years since the fall of the taliban , saying " tremendous efforts have been done in education .
the tremendous effort ... done in health is something that we take into great consideration . "
europe is the second largest contributor after the united states to military and development efforts in afghanistan since the 2001 fall of the extremist taliban regime , and president karzai praised the european union as " among the best supporters of afghanistan . "
high hopes for paris donors ' conference bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : karzai thanked the eu and hoped for continued help during their discussions , solana and karzai discussed a number of other issues including security , governance , and rule of law in afghanistan , as well as the international preparation for the afghan donors ' conference in paris in june .
" this is the moment to reflect on what we , the international community , can do , working in conjunction with our afghan partners , to enhance our efforts , " he said of the up-coming conference .
afghanistan is hoping the donors ' meeting in paris will secure $ 50 billion -lrb- 30 billion euros -rrb- in aid to implement a five-year development plan , finance minister anwar-ul haq ahadi said monday .
the plan , called the national development strategy -lrb- ands -rrb- , was presented to donors at an " aid effectiveness " conference in kabul at the same time as solana 's meeting .
based on a year of wide-ranging consultations , it will be assessed by the world bank and international monetary fund , ahadi told reporters after the meeting .
the finalized strategy would become the basis of requests from donors at the june conference , he said .
" for this strategy , the afghan government has asked the world for $ 50 billion in aid for five years , " he said .
the ands was a comprehensive plan , the minister said .
" all walks of government are included : security , good governance , financial growth , important issues such as counter-narcotics , capacity building and equal rights of women ... "
afghan solutions for afghan problems bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the rebuilding and enforcement of security goes on the plan underlines europe 's commitment to restoring afghanistan 's infrastructure and the return of the power to the people .
in written comments for the daily outlook afghanistan newspaper , solana said it was " important that afghan solutions are found to afghan problems . "
and success would involve more than a military effort to eliminate extremists , whose ranks are said to be reinforced , trained and equipped by militant camps in neighboring pakistan .
" the approach must be global and joined up , encompassing the rule of law , development , reconstruction , economic growth , rural development and education , " solana said .
" it is very important that the efforts should be led by afghans , " he said , reflecting growing demands by karzai and his government for more ownership of the work in their country .
despite the paris conference 's emphasis on civilian assistance , it is likely that the financial cost and loss of soldiers killed fighting taliban extremists will also be discussed , at a time of growing doubts within some allied nations about the mammoth mission , which has been criticized as wasteful and disjointed .
pakistan visit on itinerary after leaving kabul , solana was expected for talks with pakistan 's president pervez musharraf in islamabad on tuesday .
solana is expected to reiterate the eu 's support for the democratic process in pakistan .
" we have to continue to show our support and engagement , in particular after the -lsb- recent -rsb- political developments -lsb- in pakistan -rsb- , " an official from solana 's office said ahead of the trip .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : solana will meet president musharraf and prime minister gilani solana will be one of the most senior european union officials to meet pakistan 's new leaders following elections on feb .
18 , his spokeswoman , cristina gallach , said in brussels last week .
his message to them would be that " the world looks at you , the eu looks at you , " she said .

" we have to stand behind our decision , " steinmeier said , adding that western capitals have engaged in discussions with beijing for decades over the human rights abuses in china and the tibetan independence movement . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : steinmeier : " we have to stand behind our decision " steinmeier said he sees his job as being to deflate tensions between tibet and the chinese government , a conflict that has unleashed protests worldwide and especially in cities along the route of the olympic torch relay . steinmeier urges a broad view this job is made easier by the fact that china is eager to make the olympic games a success , steinmeier said . " we have to continue trying to convince the chinese , " he said .
" i 've been on the phone three times with the chinese foreign minister and urged him not to use force " when dealing with protesters . steinmeier said the near daily aggravation of the situation is " not acceptable , " but also called for western governments to remain aware of the sea-change taking place in chinese society . " in a very short time , the country has brought 300 million people from bitter poverty to a humble prosperity , " he said .
" great parts of the developing world look to china with interest and sympathy . " french president nicolas sarkozy appeared to be backpedaling on his hard line , as anti-french sentiment is mushrooming in beijing .
the chinese have begun boycotts of carrefour and held numerous demonstrations over the weekend outside the french retail giant 's stores in china . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : sarkozy is not eager to harm relations with china sarkozy , who previously has urged the chinese government to open talks with the dalai lama and has suggested he might boycott the olympic opening ceremonies in beijing on aug .

he will be carrying a message from sarkozy addressed to the chinese leadership . personal apology from le president in an effort to calm chinese anger over the protest-plagued progress of the olympic flame through france , sarkozy sent a note to disabled female athlete jin jing , who had tried to defend the flame during its run through paris . " i wish to tell you that i was shocked by the attacks you were subjected to on april 7 in paris , " sarkozy wrote .
the letter was delivered to her monday in shanghai by french senate president christian poncelet . " it is understandable that the chinese people were hurt , and i firmly condemn -lsb- those acts -rsb- , " the french president wrote . jin jing , a 27-year-old para-olympics fencer who lost her leg to cancer as a child , became a heroine in china after pictures were flashed around the world showing her protecting the torch from pro-tibetan demonstrators from her wheelchair . the torch was extinguished at least twice during its relay in paris , and the relay itself was cut short because of the numerous anti-chinese incidents along its route . counter-demonstrations in europe meanwhile , chinese in china and in europe have begun staging counter-demonstrations , protesting what they say is a misleading depiction of china in the media and biased media coverage of the torch relay . on saturday , april 19 , several thousand chinese rallied in paris , britain and berlin , supporting the beijing olympics . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the torch relay met protest in paris around 3,000 pro-chinese activists demonstrated in the central potsdamer platz area of berlin , gripping banners with messages like " media = untruths , " and " china olympia , one world , one dream .

photo exhibition can be seen at the deutsche welle global media forum in june , as well as new york and tokyo this fall . germany ’ s international broadcaster and the foundation for international dialogue of the savings bank in bonn will bring attention to the fate of child soldiers with a special photo exhibition at the deutsche welle global media forum , from june 2-4 , 2008 .
“ forced to be cruel ” will open on june 2 , 2008 , at 4 p.m. at the world conference center in bonn and features 80 emotionally-charged photos .
this is the first time that this selection of photos will be on display , with other shows in new york and tokyo following this fall .
the participating , internationally-renown photographers include : lynsey addario , who documented child soldiers in sudan , martin adler -lrb- columbia -rrb- , riccardo gangale , cedric gerbehaye , roger lemoyne -lrb- congo -rrb- , tim hetherington -lrb- liberia -rrb- , peter mantello -lrb- burma -rrb- , q. sakamaki -lrb- afghanistan -rrb- , dominic sansoni -lrb- sri lanka -rrb- and ami vitale -lrb- nepal -rrb- .
the british photographer tim hetherington was recently awarded the “ oscar ” for press photographers , the world press photo prize , for his photo of a wounded american soldier in iraq .
photographer and film-maker peter mantello was the one who established the exhibition .
he is currently a professor at a university in japan .
mantello , along with the curator of the exhibition leora khan from new york , will be in bonn for the premiere .
according to international estimations , there are 300,000 child soldiers worldwide .
they are being recruited for regular armed forces and rebel groups and forced into combat .
in many conflicts , child soldiers are a constant component of the military infrastructure .
an important milestone in the fight against children in combat is the additional protocol to the un children ’ s rights convention , in which the signing nations agreed not to recruit anyone under the age of 18 .
equally important is the international criminal court in den haag .
according to the statute of the criminal court , those who send children under the age of 15 into combat can be charged as a war criminal .
from more than 10 years , many national and international organizations have been making an effort to counteract the situation facing child soldiers and shed light on the subject worldwide . the foundation for international dialogue of the savings bank in bonn is co-hosting the deutsche welle global media forum .
the conference is also being supported by the german federal foreign office , the state government of north-rhine westphalia , dhl , the city of bonn , vt communications and blatzheim networks telecom .

germany 's foreign intelligence service acknowledged , and apologized for , having spied on a german journalist .
it 's not the first time german agents have been caught keeping tabs on reporters . the federal intelligence agency -lrb- bnd -rrb- , read e-mail correspondence that susanne koelbl , an editor at the german newsweekly der spiegel , had exchanged with an afghani politician between june and november , 2006 , according to a report that broke in spiegel in the edition of the magazine published monday , april 21 . bnd chief ernst uhrlau informed koelbl of its actions on friday and apologized at the same time .

" the -lrb- german -rrb- basic law applies even to those germans living abroad , and this was a clear breach of press freedom , " he told the tagesspiegel newspaper . the bnd has already been involved in " spying affairs " involving journalists in past years , and should have developed a stricter attitude about it , stadler told the paper .

however , eu officials warn that there is still a long road ahead for ankara . austrian foreign minister ursala plassnik pledged on monday , april 21 , to keep european union membership negotiations with turkey open , but stressed that austria 's position was that the result of the talks would not necessarily mean that turkey will join the union . speaking at a joint press conference in ankara with her turkish counterpart ali babacan , plassnik said it was important that accession talks continue and that the door is not shut on turkey but that the talks would not necessarily lead to full membership . " our goal is to have turkey as a stable modern dynamic , successful partner , as close a partner of the european union as is imaginable , " plassnik said .
" we are aware that for the turkish side , the one and only exclusive goal is membership in the european union .
i have been trying to enlarge the scope of imagination on that specific point ...
i could imagine a tailor-made turkey-european union community . " babacan repeated that turkey 's aim was full membership and refused to be drawn on alternatives .
he stressed that any decision on turkish membership would occur in the future and that continued people-to- people ties would result in public opinion in europe supporting turkish membership . " the membership decision will not be made on yesterday 's turkey or today 's turkey , but on the turkey of the future , " babacan said . turkey facing domestic tests as eu watches closely bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : turkey 's constitutional court is hearing the closure case on the issue of the potential closure by the turkish constitutional court of the ruling justice and development party -lrb- akp -rrb- for allegedly becoming a focus of anti-secular activities , a topic that has led to criticism from the european union of the turkish legal system , plassnik said the eu should not act as an international police officer .
it was up to turkey to debate the role of secularism in society . babacan refused to speculate on what might happen if his party is closed , saying that he believed turkey would find a solution . " this year our country will go through other tests but i believe our country will pass these tests , " he said . the two foreign ministers said they had agreed to enhance cooperation against terrorism with plassnik making it clear that austria considered the separatist kurdish workers ' party -lrb- pkk -rrb- a terrorist organization . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : austria 's foreign minister ursula plassnik " we are fighting against terrorism with the same determination as others , " plassnik said in response to a question that austria had last year allowed a senior pkk member to flee to iraq .
" i regret that in the turkish media there was a wrong impression concerning austria 's determination to fight terrorism , including the pkk . " turkish media condemned austria 's actions last year when it allegedly allowed riza altun , a senior pkk representative in europe , to escape to iraq despite the fact he was wanted by turkish authorities .
the actions of the austrian government in allowing altun to go free were also condemned by the turkish foreign ministry . rehn warns of akp closure case impact plassnik 's visit coincided with the publication of an interview given by the eu 's enlargement commissioner olli rehn in which he announced that the eu was planning to open two new chapters in turkey 's accession negotiations in june . however , he added that ankara was facing a more critical phase than at any time since its negotiations to join the european union began three years ago . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : rehn hopes turkey will emerge stronger from its trials rehn said in an interview with the german daily die welt that the closure case against the akp was adding extra pressure on ankara at a time when its progress on necessary reforms was also faltering . rehn predicted turkey could emerge with its democratic institutions strengthened once the closure case was resolved , provided that all sides showed willingness to compromise and the necessary reforms were pushed through . delays on both sides hinders turkey 's progress rehn said he also expected turkey to become a member of eu within 10 to 15 years should it continue reforms decisively , according to a separate report from turkey 's anatolian news agency . " we expect freedom of expression for all , " rehn said .
" we expect that the rights of women and minorities are protected . " the eu has been particularly critical of strict laws governing the offence of " insulting turkishness , " under which writers have been prosecuted in the past . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : journalists like ocak isik yurtcu have been jailed in turkey in addition to turkey sticking to its reform course , the enlargement commissioner added that the eu should also play its part by standing by its commitments on turkish accession .
regarding slow progress on the accession process , which began in 2005 , rehn said six of 35 policy chapters in the process had been opened and a further two - business law and intellectual property - would be opened in june . the eu suspended negotiations in eight chapters because of turkey 's refusal to open its ports to greek cypriot vessels . further chapters , including energy , would be opened under the french eu presidency in the second half of the year , rehn said . turkey angered by talk of privileged partnership the french eu presidency may prove to be another critical phase for turkey 's hopes . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : merkel and sarkozy both advocate privileged partnership french president nicolas sarkozy , together with german chancellor angela merkel , has suggested turkey should accept a privileged partnership with the eu and not full eu membership . this stance has angered prime minister tayyip erdogan who has said that his country would settle for nothing less than full membership of the european union . " turkey can not accept any alternative which is going to rule out full membership of the eu , " erdogan said earlier this month .
" an enlargement that is going to embrace turkey is not going to undermine the eu , is not going to weaken the eu . " at the nato summit in bucharest this month , sarkozy attempted conciliation by telling turkish president abdullah gul that france did not oppose the opening of negotiations chapters with turkey and that there would be special attention paid to the negotiations during the french eu presidency to strengthen turkey 's integration into the eu . dw staff / dpa -lrb- nda -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

however , eu officials warn that there is still a long road ahead for ankara . austrian foreign minister ursala plassnik pledged on monday , april 21 , to keep european union membership negotiations with turkey open , but stressed that austria 's position was that the result of the talks would not necessarily mean that turkey will join the union . speaking at a joint press conference in ankara with her turkish counterpart ali babacan , plassnik said it was important that accession talks continue and that the door is not shut on turkey but that the talks would not necessarily lead to full membership . " our goal is to have turkey as a stable modern dynamic , successful partner , as close a partner of the european union as is imaginable , " plassnik said .

i could imagine a tailor-made turkey-european union community . " babacan repeated that turkey 's aim was full membership and refused to be drawn on alternatives .
he stressed that any decision on turkish membership would occur in the future and that continued people-to- people ties would result in public opinion in europe supporting turkish membership .

while none of the reporters was bugged , agents used other measures against them to try to uncover their sources , including stealing a box of his papers that one journalist had thrown away and tracing another 's research in the federal archive . as a result , germany 's ranking dropped on a ranking list of press freedom complied by the independent journalism advocacy group reporters without borders . dw staff -lrb- jen -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

" we are in touch with the uk authorities concerning this scheme and it is far too early to start speculating about whether it is state aid or not , " said jonathan todd , spokesman for the eu 's top competition regulator .
the bank of england 's plan is designed to allow high street banks to swap mortgage-backed securities for government bonds to try to boost liquidity at a time when banks are hesitant to lend to each other .
the intervention followed a meeting of britain 's top bankers with prime minister gordon brown last week , at which the emergency measures were discussed .
" we will make sure that there is enough liquidity in the economy so that we can continue to lend money for businesses and lend money for people to buy their own houses , " brown later said .
a statement from the bank of england 's said that the scheme aimed to improve the liquidity position of the banking system and increase confidence in financial markets , which have been hit by the shockwave emanating from the us economic slowdown and the subsequent global financial turbulence .
the plan is also designed to tackle an estimated overhang of 35 billion pounds of debt in the 1.2 trillion pounds uk mortgage market that banks would have repackaged and sold on , had the credit crisis not hit .
" financial markets are not working normally , which if left unchecked will have an impact on the wider economy .
across the world , there is a lack of confidence in assets created from packages of bank loans , most notably mortgage-backed securities , " the bank of england statement said .
cash injection could increase with demand the initial amount of 50 billion pounds could increase depending on the amount other banks need to get lending going again and how much they 're willing to provide in costly collateral .
" there is no arbitrary limit on it , " bank of england governor mervyn king told reporters when asked about the cash injection .
" it 's not part of this scheme to take us back to the excessive lending of a year or more ago , " king added .
" it 's to return the banking system back to a state of normality . "
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the us subprime crisis led to uk lenders tightening their belts britain 's main home loan providers are rapidly tightening their lending criteria as fears persist over the sector 's exposure to the collapsed subprime or high-risk housing market in the united states .
central banks around the world have been taking a variety of actions to get the frozen markets moving .
the bank of england 's plan is one of the biggest moves yet by a major central bank to combat the global credit crunch .
the us federal reserve last month unveiled a $ 200 billion scheme to help its own mortgage markets .
the bank of england 's plan was revealed at the same time as reports claiming the royal bank of scotland was seeking some 10 billion pounds in a new rights issue to shareholders this week .
the bank , britain 's second-largest , is also expected to reveal further write-downs , probably in the region of 5 billion pounds .
no quick fix , say analysts despite the positive noises being made by the banks in regard to the bank of england 's plan , analysts are less convinced that it would be enough to revive a flagging economy .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the bank of england plan will not fix the financial crisis " it will have a positive impact on the money market but it 's unlikely that it will have any meaningful impact on unlocking mortgage markets , " one economist told reuters .
" this is not going to undo the harm that 's already been done to the economy , " said another .
" it might just stop things getting any worse . "
the international monetary fund -lrb- imf -rrb- took a different view .
according to michael deppler , director of the imf 's european department , the global credit crisis and persistent gloom over the us economy is continuing to have a detrimental effect on the outlook for european economic growth .
imf forecasts negative effects in europe " europe has so far been relatively resilient to the us slowdown and the global financial turbulence , but the historical record suggests these will increasingly take their toll , " he said in a statement .
gross domestic product -lrb- gdp -rrb- across europe is expected to take a significant hit this year due to the combination of the fallout from the credit crisis , the near-record strength of the euro and soaring food and energy prices .
the imf stated that " growth rates in the advanced economies are projected to fall well below potential for some time " and forecasted that europe 's gdp would fall from last year 's figure of 3.9 percent to 2.6 percent this year .
last week , germany 's key economic institutes revised down their growth outlook for europe 's biggest economy , forecasting that german economic growth will come in at 1.8 percent in 2008 before slowing to 1.4 percent in 2009 .
the eight institutes had previously forecast growth at 2.2 percent for this year . dw staff -lrb- nda -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

not all reader comments have been published .
dw-world.de reserves the right to edit for length and appropriateness of content . if the slovenian presidency of the eu bends to chinese political pressure , then democracy has been struck a deadly blow .
the decision to invite the tibetan head of state , his holiness the dalai lama , must be made with openness in mind , not political pressures .
so in effect china has used its political power to again snuff out democracy and that is a crying shame . what i suspect here is that slovenia has some links with china , but be they political or trade they must not interfere with the practice of open democracy in europe .
so slovenia must know why it used its eu presidency as a means to further its own position with china .
the eu must make clear to slovenia that it is not a forum of deceit .
case closed . - kenneth v. tellis , canada bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : one reader recommended sanctions on chinese products yes , as europeans believing in human rights there should be sanctions against china .
as producers ourselves , there should be sanctions against china .
many western goods are counterfeit and made in china but sold illegally in europe regardless of copyright and patent ; many products that are taken in the mouth -lrb- toothpaste , etc , -rrb- have been found to contain unfit ingredients ; many well-known toy brands that we buy for our children that are made in china have toxic ingredients , and many people , such as prisoners , are forced to work as slaves to create the great chinese economic progress . but the big multi-nationals have made sure we do n't have much choice in buying products that are not made in china .
they made sure they closed down their european factories and opened them up in china where life and labor is cheap and their greed insures they get the best profit .
anyone know where you can still buy toys that are not made in china ?
i will be your first customer . - kaye poole , britain so far , the british and germans are not the focus .
china likes to target the betrayer and the frontier , namely france and the us .
and so far the wasp has succeeded in uniting the catholics , and showing the chinese that the frenchmen are nothing better .
let 's see the reaction of the germans , and see how the anglo can work with the saxons as it unfolds .
china 's dream has definitely been interrupted .
rem period is gone - a step closer to be awakened .
remember what napoleon said about a sleeping lion ? - berg mcfly , china it is unfortunate that china can browbeat the european union on the basis of the economic leverage it enjoys today vis-a-vis europe .
that the eu chooses to remain a mute spectator on the tibet crackdown and refrain from officially recognizing the dalai lama amounts to lending credibility to the religious persecution of christians sponsored by the atheist regime in beijing . do we assume that the rich european tradition of promoting democratic values and peaceful coexistence is fading day by day ?
how else can the european union presidency ignore the reality of 46 christians being arrested for holding a bible class and worshiping in a private home without government permission ?
perhaps it is time that the european citizens decide whether or not to support a tyrannical regime that does not even believe in granting the christians , muslims and tibetan buddhist minorities the right and freedom to quietly express their faith . - seema sengupta , india i think the eu should send a large fact-finding mission to tibet to see the real situation without chinese officials and spies with them then to decide it .
tibetans should have freedom to use their own language and live according to their own style .
tibet has its own language , culture and customs .

" i can tell you on behalf of the european union - all the countries of the european union - that we will continue to be working with the government , working with the people of afghanistan for the long haul , " solana said after meeting with afghan president hamid karzai and other senior ministry officials in the fortified presidential palace in kabul on monday , april 21 .
" we , the people in europe , will continue to be helping the people of afghanistan to get what they deserve , the stability , prosperity and peace , " he added .
a renewed commitment bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : solana praised the on-going efforts in afghanistan solana jetted into the capital for a day-long trip which , he said in remarks published in a kabul daily monday , came at an important time of " renewed commitment by the international community " to struggling afghanistan .
following his arrival , solana paid a visit to the headquarters of the eu police mission in afghanistan -lrb- eupol -rrb- and met with police officials .
since june of last year , some 230 eupol officials have been training the upper echelons of the afghan security forces .
eupol is also assisting other western training missions and is now spreading its operations to cover the whole country .
solana praised the progress that afghanistan has made in the past several years since the fall of the taliban , saying " tremendous efforts have been done in education .
the tremendous effort ... done in health is something that we take into great consideration . "
europe is the second largest contributor after the united states to military and development efforts in afghanistan since the 2001 fall of the extremist taliban regime , and president karzai praised the european union as " among the best supporters of afghanistan . "
high hopes for paris donors ' conference bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : karzai thanked the eu and hoped for continued help during their discussions , solana and karzai discussed a number of other issues including security , governance , and rule of law in afghanistan , as well as the international preparation for the afghan donors ' conference in paris in june .
" this is the moment to reflect on what we , the international community , can do , working in conjunction with our afghan partners , to enhance our efforts , " he said of the up-coming conference .
afghanistan is hoping the donors ' meeting in paris will secure $ 50 billion -lrb- 30 billion euros -rrb- in aid to implement a five-year development plan , finance minister anwar-ul haq ahadi said monday .
the plan , called the national development strategy -lrb- ands -rrb- , was presented to donors at an " aid effectiveness " conference in kabul at the same time as solana 's meeting .
based on a year of wide-ranging consultations , it will be assessed by the world bank and international monetary fund , ahadi told reporters after the meeting .
the finalized strategy would become the basis of requests from donors at the june conference , he said .
" for this strategy , the afghan government has asked the world for $ 50 billion in aid for five years , " he said .
the ands was a comprehensive plan , the minister said .
" all walks of government are included : security , good governance , financial growth , important issues such as counter-narcotics , capacity building and equal rights of women ... "
afghan solutions for afghan problems bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the rebuilding and enforcement of security goes on the plan underlines europe 's commitment to restoring afghanistan 's infrastructure and the return of the power to the people .

and success would involve more than a military effort to eliminate extremists , whose ranks are said to be reinforced , trained and equipped by militant camps in neighboring pakistan .
" the approach must be global and joined up , encompassing the rule of law , development , reconstruction , economic growth , rural development and education , " solana said .
" it is very important that the efforts should be led by afghans , " he said , reflecting growing demands by karzai and his government for more ownership of the work in their country .
despite the paris conference 's emphasis on civilian assistance , it is likely that the financial cost and loss of soldiers killed fighting taliban extremists will also be discussed , at a time of growing doubts within some allied nations about the mammoth mission , which has been criticized as wasteful and disjointed .

" i can tell you on behalf of the european union - all the countries of the european union - that we will continue to be working with the government , working with the people of afghanistan for the long haul , " solana said after meeting with afghan president hamid karzai and other senior ministry officials in the fortified presidential palace in kabul on monday , april 21 .
" we , the people in europe , will continue to be helping the people of afghanistan to get what they deserve , the stability , prosperity and peace , " he added .
a renewed commitment bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : solana praised the on-going efforts in afghanistan solana jetted into the capital for a day-long trip which , he said in remarks published in a kabul daily monday , came at an important time of " renewed commitment by the international community " to struggling afghanistan .
following his arrival , solana paid a visit to the headquarters of the eu police mission in afghanistan -lrb- eupol -rrb- and met with police officials .
since june of last year , some 230 eupol officials have been training the upper echelons of the afghan security forces .
eupol is also assisting other western training missions and is now spreading its operations to cover the whole country .
solana praised the progress that afghanistan has made in the past several years since the fall of the taliban , saying " tremendous efforts have been done in education .
the tremendous effort ... done in health is something that we take into great consideration . "
europe is the second largest contributor after the united states to military and development efforts in afghanistan since the 2001 fall of the extremist taliban regime , and president karzai praised the european union as " among the best supporters of afghanistan . "
high hopes for paris donors ' conference bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : karzai thanked the eu and hoped for continued help during their discussions , solana and karzai discussed a number of other issues including security , governance , and rule of law in afghanistan , as well as the international preparation for the afghan donors ' conference in paris in june .
" this is the moment to reflect on what we , the international community , can do , working in conjunction with our afghan partners , to enhance our efforts , " he said of the up-coming conference .
afghanistan is hoping the donors ' meeting in paris will secure $ 50 billion -lrb- 30 billion euros -rrb- in aid to implement a five-year development plan , finance minister anwar-ul haq ahadi said monday .
the plan , called the national development strategy -lrb- ands -rrb- , was presented to donors at an " aid effectiveness " conference in kabul at the same time as solana 's meeting .
based on a year of wide-ranging consultations , it will be assessed by the world bank and international monetary fund , ahadi told reporters after the meeting .
the finalized strategy would become the basis of requests from donors at the june conference , he said .
" for this strategy , the afghan government has asked the world for $ 50 billion in aid for five years , " he said .
the ands was a comprehensive plan , the minister said .
" all walks of government are included : security , good governance , financial growth , important issues such as counter-narcotics , capacity building and equal rights of women ... "
afghan solutions for afghan problems bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the rebuilding and enforcement of security goes on the plan underlines europe 's commitment to restoring afghanistan 's infrastructure and the return of the power to the people .
in written comments for the daily outlook afghanistan newspaper , solana said it was " important that afghan solutions are found to afghan problems . "
and success would involve more than a military effort to eliminate extremists , whose ranks are said to be reinforced , trained and equipped by militant camps in neighboring pakistan .
" the approach must be global and joined up , encompassing the rule of law , development , reconstruction , economic growth , rural development and education , " solana said .
" it is very important that the efforts should be led by afghans , " he said , reflecting growing demands by karzai and his government for more ownership of the work in their country .
despite the paris conference 's emphasis on civilian assistance , it is likely that the financial cost and loss of soldiers killed fighting taliban extremists will also be discussed , at a time of growing doubts within some allied nations about the mammoth mission , which has been criticized as wasteful and disjointed .
pakistan visit on itinerary after leaving kabul , solana was expected for talks with pakistan 's president pervez musharraf in islamabad on tuesday .
solana is expected to reiterate the eu 's support for the democratic process in pakistan .
" we have to continue to show our support and engagement , in particular after the -lsb- recent -rsb- political developments -lsb- in pakistan -rsb- , " an official from solana 's office said ahead of the trip .

" we are in touch with the uk authorities concerning this scheme and it is far too early to start speculating about whether it is state aid or not , " said jonathan todd , spokesman for the eu 's top competition regulator .
the bank of england 's plan is designed to allow high street banks to swap mortgage-backed securities for government bonds to try to boost liquidity at a time when banks are hesitant to lend to each other .
the intervention followed a meeting of britain 's top bankers with prime minister gordon brown last week , at which the emergency measures were discussed .
" we will make sure that there is enough liquidity in the economy so that we can continue to lend money for businesses and lend money for people to buy their own houses , " brown later said .
a statement from the bank of england 's said that the scheme aimed to improve the liquidity position of the banking system and increase confidence in financial markets , which have been hit by the shockwave emanating from the us economic slowdown and the subsequent global financial turbulence .
the plan is also designed to tackle an estimated overhang of 35 billion pounds of debt in the 1.2 trillion pounds uk mortgage market that banks would have repackaged and sold on , had the credit crisis not hit .
" financial markets are not working normally , which if left unchecked will have an impact on the wider economy .
across the world , there is a lack of confidence in assets created from packages of bank loans , most notably mortgage-backed securities , " the bank of england statement said .

" there is no arbitrary limit on it , " bank of england governor mervyn king told reporters when asked about the cash injection .
" it 's not part of this scheme to take us back to the excessive lending of a year or more ago , " king added .
" it 's to return the banking system back to a state of normality . "

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de asia -pipe- 21.04.2008 eu disappoints some readers with response to china großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the eu does n't have plans to invite the dalai lama to brussels some readers wrote in to say they are disappointed with the eu 's response to china 's dealings with tibet . the following comments reflect the views of dw-world.de readers .
not all reader comments have been published .
dw-world.de reserves the right to edit for length and appropriateness of content . if the slovenian presidency of the eu bends to chinese political pressure , then democracy has been struck a deadly blow .
the decision to invite the tibetan head of state , his holiness the dalai lama , must be made with openness in mind , not political pressures .
so in effect china has used its political power to again snuff out democracy and that is a crying shame . what i suspect here is that slovenia has some links with china , but be they political or trade they must not interfere with the practice of open democracy in europe .
so slovenia must know why it used its eu presidency as a means to further its own position with china .
the eu must make clear to slovenia that it is not a forum of deceit .
case closed . - kenneth v. tellis , canada bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : one reader recommended sanctions on chinese products yes , as europeans believing in human rights there should be sanctions against china .
as producers ourselves , there should be sanctions against china .
many western goods are counterfeit and made in china but sold illegally in europe regardless of copyright and patent ; many products that are taken in the mouth -lrb- toothpaste , etc , -rrb- have been found to contain unfit ingredients ; many well-known toy brands that we buy for our children that are made in china have toxic ingredients , and many people , such as prisoners , are forced to work as slaves to create the great chinese economic progress . but the big multi-nationals have made sure we do n't have much choice in buying products that are not made in china .
they made sure they closed down their european factories and opened them up in china where life and labor is cheap and their greed insures they get the best profit .
anyone know where you can still buy toys that are not made in china ?
i will be your first customer . - kaye poole , britain so far , the british and germans are not the focus .
china likes to target the betrayer and the frontier , namely france and the us .
and so far the wasp has succeeded in uniting the catholics , and showing the chinese that the frenchmen are nothing better .
let 's see the reaction of the germans , and see how the anglo can work with the saxons as it unfolds .
china 's dream has definitely been interrupted .
rem period is gone - a step closer to be awakened .
remember what napoleon said about a sleeping lion ? - berg mcfly , china it is unfortunate that china can browbeat the european union on the basis of the economic leverage it enjoys today vis-a-vis europe .
that the eu chooses to remain a mute spectator on the tibet crackdown and refrain from officially recognizing the dalai lama amounts to lending credibility to the religious persecution of christians sponsored by the atheist regime in beijing . do we assume that the rich european tradition of promoting democratic values and peaceful coexistence is fading day by day ?
how else can the european union presidency ignore the reality of 46 christians being arrested for holding a bible class and worshiping in a private home without government permission ?
perhaps it is time that the european citizens decide whether or not to support a tyrannical regime that does not even believe in granting the christians , muslims and tibetan buddhist minorities the right and freedom to quietly express their faith . - seema sengupta , india i think the eu should send a large fact-finding mission to tibet to see the real situation without chinese officials and spies with them then to decide it .
tibetans should have freedom to use their own language and live according to their own style .
tibet has its own language , culture and customs .
chinese leaders in tibet do n't know them and ca n't even speak tibetan . - tsering , china compiled by dw staff -lrb- kjb -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?
dw-world.de eu presidency will not invite dalai lama to brussels the eu 's slovenian presidency said that it would not invite the dalai lama to brussels to meet with the bloc 's foreign ministers , as paris has proposed , but would not rule out other contacts with the tibetan leader .
-lrb- 19.04.2008 -rrb- economic sanctions wrong way to deal with china , experts say beijing 's reaction to the protests in tibet has prompted germans to call for a boycott of the olympics and economic sanctions .
business representatives are now asking people to consider the consequences of such a move .
-lrb- 16.04.2008 -rrb- poll : europeans see china as biggest threat to global stability europeans see china as being a greater threat to global stability than the united states or iran , an opinion poll published tuesday , april 15 , discovered .
-lrb- 15.04.2008 -rrb- report : germany 's merkel will meet dalai lama again german chancellor angela merkel is willing to meet the dalai lama again despite china 's anger over a previous meeting , a german newspaper said saturday .
merkel also urged china to overcome it " fear " of dialogue .

however , eu officials warn that there is still a long road ahead for ankara . austrian foreign minister ursala plassnik pledged on monday , april 21 , to keep european union membership negotiations with turkey open , but stressed that austria 's position was that the result of the talks would not necessarily mean that turkey will join the union . speaking at a joint press conference in ankara with her turkish counterpart ali babacan , plassnik said it was important that accession talks continue and that the door is not shut on turkey but that the talks would not necessarily lead to full membership . " our goal is to have turkey as a stable modern dynamic , successful partner , as close a partner of the european union as is imaginable , " plassnik said .
" we are aware that for the turkish side , the one and only exclusive goal is membership in the european union .
i have been trying to enlarge the scope of imagination on that specific point ...
i could imagine a tailor-made turkey-european union community . " babacan repeated that turkey 's aim was full membership and refused to be drawn on alternatives .
he stressed that any decision on turkish membership would occur in the future and that continued people-to- people ties would result in public opinion in europe supporting turkish membership . " the membership decision will not be made on yesterday 's turkey or today 's turkey , but on the turkey of the future , " babacan said . turkey facing domestic tests as eu watches closely bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : turkey 's constitutional court is hearing the closure case on the issue of the potential closure by the turkish constitutional court of the ruling justice and development party -lrb- akp -rrb- for allegedly becoming a focus of anti-secular activities , a topic that has led to criticism from the european union of the turkish legal system , plassnik said the eu should not act as an international police officer .
it was up to turkey to debate the role of secularism in society . babacan refused to speculate on what might happen if his party is closed , saying that he believed turkey would find a solution . " this year our country will go through other tests but i believe our country will pass these tests , " he said . the two foreign ministers said they had agreed to enhance cooperation against terrorism with plassnik making it clear that austria considered the separatist kurdish workers ' party -lrb- pkk -rrb- a terrorist organization . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : austria 's foreign minister ursula plassnik " we are fighting against terrorism with the same determination as others , " plassnik said in response to a question that austria had last year allowed a senior pkk member to flee to iraq .
" i regret that in the turkish media there was a wrong impression concerning austria 's determination to fight terrorism , including the pkk . " turkish media condemned austria 's actions last year when it allegedly allowed riza altun , a senior pkk representative in europe , to escape to iraq despite the fact he was wanted by turkish authorities .
the actions of the austrian government in allowing altun to go free were also condemned by the turkish foreign ministry . rehn warns of akp closure case impact plassnik 's visit coincided with the publication of an interview given by the eu 's enlargement commissioner olli rehn in which he announced that the eu was planning to open two new chapters in turkey 's accession negotiations in june . however , he added that ankara was facing a more critical phase than at any time since its negotiations to join the european union began three years ago . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : rehn hopes turkey will emerge stronger from its trials rehn said in an interview with the german daily die welt that the closure case against the akp was adding extra pressure on ankara at a time when its progress on necessary reforms was also faltering . rehn predicted turkey could emerge with its democratic institutions strengthened once the closure case was resolved , provided that all sides showed willingness to compromise and the necessary reforms were pushed through . delays on both sides hinders turkey 's progress rehn said he also expected turkey to become a member of eu within 10 to 15 years should it continue reforms decisively , according to a separate report from turkey 's anatolian news agency . " we expect freedom of expression for all , " rehn said .
" we expect that the rights of women and minorities are protected . " the eu has been particularly critical of strict laws governing the offence of " insulting turkishness , " under which writers have been prosecuted in the past . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : journalists like ocak isik yurtcu have been jailed in turkey in addition to turkey sticking to its reform course , the enlargement commissioner added that the eu should also play its part by standing by its commitments on turkish accession .
regarding slow progress on the accession process , which began in 2005 , rehn said six of 35 policy chapters in the process had been opened and a further two - business law and intellectual property - would be opened in june . the eu suspended negotiations in eight chapters because of turkey 's refusal to open its ports to greek cypriot vessels . further chapters , including energy , would be opened under the french eu presidency in the second half of the year , rehn said . turkey angered by talk of privileged partnership the french eu presidency may prove to be another critical phase for turkey 's hopes . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : merkel and sarkozy both advocate privileged partnership french president nicolas sarkozy , together with german chancellor angela merkel , has suggested turkey should accept a privileged partnership with the eu and not full eu membership . this stance has angered prime minister tayyip erdogan who has said that his country would settle for nothing less than full membership of the european union . " turkey can not accept any alternative which is going to rule out full membership of the eu , " erdogan said earlier this month .
" an enlargement that is going to embrace turkey is not going to undermine the eu , is not going to weaken the eu . " at the nato summit in bucharest this month , sarkozy attempted conciliation by telling turkish president abdullah gul that france did not oppose the opening of negotiations chapters with turkey and that there would be special attention paid to the negotiations during the french eu presidency to strengthen turkey 's integration into the eu . dw staff / dpa -lrb- nda -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

however , eu officials warn that there is still a long road ahead for ankara . austrian foreign minister ursala plassnik pledged on monday , april 21 , to keep european union membership negotiations with turkey open , but stressed that austria 's position was that the result of the talks would not necessarily mean that turkey will join the union . speaking at a joint press conference in ankara with her turkish counterpart ali babacan , plassnik said it was important that accession talks continue and that the door is not shut on turkey but that the talks would not necessarily lead to full membership . " our goal is to have turkey as a stable modern dynamic , successful partner , as close a partner of the european union as is imaginable , " plassnik said .
" we are aware that for the turkish side , the one and only exclusive goal is membership in the european union .
i have been trying to enlarge the scope of imagination on that specific point ...
i could imagine a tailor-made turkey-european union community . " babacan repeated that turkey 's aim was full membership and refused to be drawn on alternatives .
he stressed that any decision on turkish membership would occur in the future and that continued people-to- people ties would result in public opinion in europe supporting turkish membership . " the membership decision will not be made on yesterday 's turkey or today 's turkey , but on the turkey of the future , " babacan said . turkey facing domestic tests as eu watches closely bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : turkey 's constitutional court is hearing the closure case on the issue of the potential closure by the turkish constitutional court of the ruling justice and development party -lrb- akp -rrb- for allegedly becoming a focus of anti-secular activities , a topic that has led to criticism from the european union of the turkish legal system , plassnik said the eu should not act as an international police officer .
it was up to turkey to debate the role of secularism in society . babacan refused to speculate on what might happen if his party is closed , saying that he believed turkey would find a solution . " this year our country will go through other tests but i believe our country will pass these tests , " he said . the two foreign ministers said they had agreed to enhance cooperation against terrorism with plassnik making it clear that austria considered the separatist kurdish workers ' party -lrb- pkk -rrb- a terrorist organization . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : austria 's foreign minister ursula plassnik " we are fighting against terrorism with the same determination as others , " plassnik said in response to a question that austria had last year allowed a senior pkk member to flee to iraq .
" i regret that in the turkish media there was a wrong impression concerning austria 's determination to fight terrorism , including the pkk . " turkish media condemned austria 's actions last year when it allegedly allowed riza altun , a senior pkk representative in europe , to escape to iraq despite the fact he was wanted by turkish authorities .
the actions of the austrian government in allowing altun to go free were also condemned by the turkish foreign ministry . rehn warns of akp closure case impact plassnik 's visit coincided with the publication of an interview given by the eu 's enlargement commissioner olli rehn in which he announced that the eu was planning to open two new chapters in turkey 's accession negotiations in june . however , he added that ankara was facing a more critical phase than at any time since its negotiations to join the european union began three years ago . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : rehn hopes turkey will emerge stronger from its trials rehn said in an interview with the german daily die welt that the closure case against the akp was adding extra pressure on ankara at a time when its progress on necessary reforms was also faltering . rehn predicted turkey could emerge with its democratic institutions strengthened once the closure case was resolved , provided that all sides showed willingness to compromise and the necessary reforms were pushed through . delays on both sides hinders turkey 's progress rehn said he also expected turkey to become a member of eu within 10 to 15 years should it continue reforms decisively , according to a separate report from turkey 's anatolian news agency . " we expect freedom of expression for all , " rehn said .
" we expect that the rights of women and minorities are protected . " the eu has been particularly critical of strict laws governing the offence of " insulting turkishness , " under which writers have been prosecuted in the past . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : journalists like ocak isik yurtcu have been jailed in turkey in addition to turkey sticking to its reform course , the enlargement commissioner added that the eu should also play its part by standing by its commitments on turkish accession .
regarding slow progress on the accession process , which began in 2005 , rehn said six of 35 policy chapters in the process had been opened and a further two - business law and intellectual property - would be opened in june . the eu suspended negotiations in eight chapters because of turkey 's refusal to open its ports to greek cypriot vessels . further chapters , including energy , would be opened under the french eu presidency in the second half of the year , rehn said . turkey angered by talk of privileged partnership the french eu presidency may prove to be another critical phase for turkey 's hopes . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : merkel and sarkozy both advocate privileged partnership french president nicolas sarkozy , together with german chancellor angela merkel , has suggested turkey should accept a privileged partnership with the eu and not full eu membership . this stance has angered prime minister tayyip erdogan who has said that his country would settle for nothing less than full membership of the european union . " turkey can not accept any alternative which is going to rule out full membership of the eu , " erdogan said earlier this month .
" an enlargement that is going to embrace turkey is not going to undermine the eu , is not going to weaken the eu . " at the nato summit in bucharest this month , sarkozy attempted conciliation by telling turkish president abdullah gul that france did not oppose the opening of negotiations chapters with turkey and that there would be special attention paid to the negotiations during the french eu presidency to strengthen turkey 's integration into the eu . dw staff / dpa -lrb- nda -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de history -pipe- 21.04.2008 biographer unveils man behind the red baron myth großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : with his fokker plane , baron von richthofen was molded into a war hero world war one fighter pilot manfred von richthofen - a.k.a. the red baron - died in combat 90 years ago , on april 21 , 1918 .
dw-world.de spoke to von richthofen biographer joachim castan about the man behind the myth . the prussian nobleman - dubbed the red baron because of the color of his aircraft - shot down some 80 allied planes before his death at the age of 25 .
his life has become the stuff of legend .
a new film about the red baron , which opened in germany this month , also revives the heroic image .
joachim castan , 41 , was the first historian to write a biography of this famous figure .
the biographer and documentary filmmaker spent three years researching the project , gaining exclusive access to previously unpublished writings and letters .
the book , called " die ganze geschichte " -lrb- the whole story -rrb- and published in 2007 , reveals a far more complex character .
dw-world.de : did your image of von richthofen change in the course of your research ?
joachim castan : i must admit that i had an image of von richthofen before i started my research of him as the last true gentleman of the skies in a dehumanized , industrialized brutal war , heroically participating in airborne duels .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : castan 's preconceptions were overturned while working on the book as i became immersed in the material , i realized that there was a well-maintained von richthofen myth .
the myth propagates the idea that von richthofen forced pilots to land .
he shot down aircraft , but he ensured , if at all possible , that the pilot survived , so that the whole encounter took on the character of a sporting match to determine the better pilot and marksman .
this turned out to be an image created by the german propaganda machine in 1917 .
it needed a young , good-looking radiant hero , a victor who could be served up to a relatively demoralized society . this image of the lonely gentleman of the skies was then taken up in the 1920s and further elaborated upon by the americans , who wanted to sell a romantic notion of air combat .
and who was the man you discovered ?
he was completely different .
without doubt , he was extremely courageous and extremely ambitious , but he was also cold-blooded .
his goal was to shoot down as many aircraft as possible .
in his own writings , he writes quite openly : " i never get into an aircraft for fun .
i aim first for the head of the pilot , or rather at the head of the observer , if there was one . "
i do n't think that von richthofen would have described himself as a hero .
he was doing his duty to defend his fatherland .
at the same time , he was satisfying his passion for hunting .
he was already a passionate hunter at the age of 11 and was taken hunting by his father .
aim , shoot , destroy target - he took his passion for hunting to the skies , transposing it one-to-one .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : von richthofen around 1917 i also do not think he was a brutal killer .
von richthofen also reflected partially upon what he did .
he wrote that he always felt terrible when he came off duty .
he used to come home and lock himself in his room for hours and refuse to talk to anyone .
from mid-1917 he also realized that the war was probably going to be lost .
for me he is a tragic figure , fighting fanatically , remorselessly , in a war that is lost .
what made him into the kind of person he was ?
his mother was extraordinarily ambitious and did n't think much of her husband .
he retired early and did not have a very successful career as an officer .
all of the family 's ambitions were invested first in the eldest son , manfred , and then in the second son , lothar , who was also a fighter pilot .
the young manfred was sent at the age of 11 to a prussian cadet school , which were pretty infamous .
the children were honed into soldiers and there was no scope for any ifs , ands or buts .
the intellectual aspect of schooling was largely neglected .
the children had to function as soldiers first and foremost .
it 's interesting : if you look at von richthofen 's personal development , it showed that , first of all , he functioned in this way .
then a year before his death , he started to come to his senses and think about his actions .
i think he gradually realized that he had arrived at a dead end .
you say that the red baron myth was created in 1917 .
it served then as propaganda intended to boost morale .
but why is it now being revived ?
what is the reason for the current interest in this figure ?
in germany currently , we are thinking about war , heroes , and war heroes , we are rethinking our position .
deployment in a war in afghanistan would have been unthinkable in germany 10 years ago .
at the same time , we are thinking about reintroducing medals to reward bravery .
for germany , that is a very unusual situation because of our history , the third reich and the hitler dictatorship .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : matthias schweighoefer plays the red baron in the new film in other countries , in france , britain and the united states , hero cults exist .
in germany , they ceased to exist after 1945 .
i believe that there is a certain tendency toward reintroducing heroes , to hold them up as examples , as military models and to make military conflict socially acceptable again .
what do you think about the portrayal of von richthofen in nikolai muellerschoen 's new film , " the red baron ? "
the film revives the richthofen myth in parts .
it turns him into a radiant figure , someone who becomes a good person / pacifist through his love for a nurse .
it is a way of seeing von richthofen that is popular at the moment - as a sort of broken hero who is relatively blameless in some respects .
there are those responsible for conducting the war , who are evil , and the good hero .
this is a distinction that people like to make at the moment . interview : julie gregson send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

" we have to stand behind our decision , " steinmeier said , adding that western capitals have engaged in discussions with beijing for decades over the human rights abuses in china and the tibetan independence movement . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : steinmeier : " we have to stand behind our decision " steinmeier said he sees his job as being to deflate tensions between tibet and the chinese government , a conflict that has unleashed protests worldwide and especially in cities along the route of the olympic torch relay . steinmeier urges a broad view this job is made easier by the fact that china is eager to make the olympic games a success , steinmeier said . " we have to continue trying to convince the chinese , " he said .
" i 've been on the phone three times with the chinese foreign minister and urged him not to use force " when dealing with protesters . steinmeier said the near daily aggravation of the situation is " not acceptable , " but also called for western governments to remain aware of the sea-change taking place in chinese society . " in a very short time , the country has brought 300 million people from bitter poverty to a humble prosperity , " he said .
" great parts of the developing world look to china with interest and sympathy . " french president nicolas sarkozy appeared to be backpedaling on his hard line , as anti-french sentiment is mushrooming in beijing .
the chinese have begun boycotts of carrefour and held numerous demonstrations over the weekend outside the french retail giant 's stores in china . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : sarkozy is not eager to harm relations with china sarkozy , who previously has urged the chinese government to open talks with the dalai lama and has suggested he might boycott the olympic opening ceremonies in beijing on aug .
8 , decided to send former prime minister jean-pierre raffarin and the presidential foreign affairs advisor , jean-david levitte , to china to calm bilateral tensions . raffarin is scheduled to travel to beijing on wednesday to meet with chinese premier wen jiabao .
he will be carrying a message from sarkozy addressed to the chinese leadership . personal apology from le president in an effort to calm chinese anger over the protest-plagued progress of the olympic flame through france , sarkozy sent a note to disabled female athlete jin jing , who had tried to defend the flame during its run through paris . " i wish to tell you that i was shocked by the attacks you were subjected to on april 7 in paris , " sarkozy wrote .
the letter was delivered to her monday in shanghai by french senate president christian poncelet . " it is understandable that the chinese people were hurt , and i firmly condemn -lsb- those acts -rsb- , " the french president wrote . jin jing , a 27-year-old para-olympics fencer who lost her leg to cancer as a child , became a heroine in china after pictures were flashed around the world showing her protecting the torch from pro-tibetan demonstrators from her wheelchair . the torch was extinguished at least twice during its relay in paris , and the relay itself was cut short because of the numerous anti-chinese incidents along its route . counter-demonstrations in europe meanwhile , chinese in china and in europe have begun staging counter-demonstrations , protesting what they say is a misleading depiction of china in the media and biased media coverage of the torch relay . on saturday , april 19 , several thousand chinese rallied in paris , britain and berlin , supporting the beijing olympics . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the torch relay met protest in paris around 3,000 pro-chinese activists demonstrated in the central potsdamer platz area of berlin , gripping banners with messages like " media = untruths , " and " china olympia , one world , one dream . " on the same day in paris , nearly 4,000 chinese students and other expatriates gathered in the place de la republique , according to police estimates .
they wore t-shirts with the slogan " one china , one family , " and waved signs criticizing the western media . " we 're demonstrating against the disinformation in the french and western media , to promote the olympic games and to construct a bridge between the french and chinese people - and not a wall as the media do , " one of the rally 's spokesmen , thierry liu , told the afp news service . more than 1,000 people , mainly students , also gathered outside the bbc 's offices in manchester , north-west england , while around 300 staged a demonstration outside the houses of parliament in london . the european commission on monday said people were free to show their displeasure with the west 's reaction to demonstrations in tibet and media coverage of the run-up to the 2008 olympics .

" i can tell you on behalf of the european union - all the countries of the european union - that we will continue to be working with the government , working with the people of afghanistan for the long haul , " solana said after meeting with afghan president hamid karzai and other senior ministry officials in the fortified presidential palace in kabul on monday , april 21 .
" we , the people in europe , will continue to be helping the people of afghanistan to get what they deserve , the stability , prosperity and peace , " he added .
a renewed commitment bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : solana praised the on-going efforts in afghanistan solana jetted into the capital for a day-long trip which , he said in remarks published in a kabul daily monday , came at an important time of " renewed commitment by the international community " to struggling afghanistan .
following his arrival , solana paid a visit to the headquarters of the eu police mission in afghanistan -lrb- eupol -rrb- and met with police officials .
since june of last year , some 230 eupol officials have been training the upper echelons of the afghan security forces .
eupol is also assisting other western training missions and is now spreading its operations to cover the whole country .
solana praised the progress that afghanistan has made in the past several years since the fall of the taliban , saying " tremendous efforts have been done in education .
the tremendous effort ... done in health is something that we take into great consideration . "
europe is the second largest contributor after the united states to military and development efforts in afghanistan since the 2001 fall of the extremist taliban regime , and president karzai praised the european union as " among the best supporters of afghanistan . "
high hopes for paris donors ' conference bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : karzai thanked the eu and hoped for continued help during their discussions , solana and karzai discussed a number of other issues including security , governance , and rule of law in afghanistan , as well as the international preparation for the afghan donors ' conference in paris in june .
" this is the moment to reflect on what we , the international community , can do , working in conjunction with our afghan partners , to enhance our efforts , " he said of the up-coming conference .
afghanistan is hoping the donors ' meeting in paris will secure $ 50 billion -lrb- 30 billion euros -rrb- in aid to implement a five-year development plan , finance minister anwar-ul haq ahadi said monday .
the plan , called the national development strategy -lrb- ands -rrb- , was presented to donors at an " aid effectiveness " conference in kabul at the same time as solana 's meeting .
based on a year of wide-ranging consultations , it will be assessed by the world bank and international monetary fund , ahadi told reporters after the meeting .
the finalized strategy would become the basis of requests from donors at the june conference , he said .
" for this strategy , the afghan government has asked the world for $ 50 billion in aid for five years , " he said .
the ands was a comprehensive plan , the minister said .
" all walks of government are included : security , good governance , financial growth , important issues such as counter-narcotics , capacity building and equal rights of women ... "
afghan solutions for afghan problems bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the rebuilding and enforcement of security goes on the plan underlines europe 's commitment to restoring afghanistan 's infrastructure and the return of the power to the people .
in written comments for the daily outlook afghanistan newspaper , solana said it was " important that afghan solutions are found to afghan problems . "
and success would involve more than a military effort to eliminate extremists , whose ranks are said to be reinforced , trained and equipped by militant camps in neighboring pakistan .
" the approach must be global and joined up , encompassing the rule of law , development , reconstruction , economic growth , rural development and education , " solana said .
" it is very important that the efforts should be led by afghans , " he said , reflecting growing demands by karzai and his government for more ownership of the work in their country .
despite the paris conference 's emphasis on civilian assistance , it is likely that the financial cost and loss of soldiers killed fighting taliban extremists will also be discussed , at a time of growing doubts within some allied nations about the mammoth mission , which has been criticized as wasteful and disjointed .
pakistan visit on itinerary after leaving kabul , solana was expected for talks with pakistan 's president pervez musharraf in islamabad on tuesday .
solana is expected to reiterate the eu 's support for the democratic process in pakistan .
" we have to continue to show our support and engagement , in particular after the -lsb- recent -rsb- political developments -lsb- in pakistan -rsb- , " an official from solana 's office said ahead of the trip .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : solana will meet president musharraf and prime minister gilani solana will be one of the most senior european union officials to meet pakistan 's new leaders following elections on feb .

dw-world.de talked with a trans-atlantic relations expert about the visit . among the themes likely to come up for discussion during steinmeier 's visit to washington are the middle east conflict , iran 's nuclear program and the situation in the balkans .
during the trip , the german delegation intends to gain information at first hand on the foreign-policy attitudes of the candidates in the us presidential election .
dw-world.de talked to julianne smith , the director of the europe program at the center for strategic and international studies , a bipartisan think-tank based in washington , about the visit .
dw-world.de : part of steinmeier 's visit will include a fact-finding mission to assess the foreign-policy platforms of the us presidential candidates .
considering germany 's foreign-policy stance on issues such as the middle east -lsb- including relations with iran -rsb- , afghanistan , russia and the european union 's role on the international stage , which of the us candidates are most likely to be more in line with the germans ?
julianne smith : all three of the us presidential candidates have some foreign policy issues which the europeans and the germans will be encouraged by .
all three want to close down guantanamo bay , all three want to get tough on torture and roll back many of the policies which the bush administration have brought in which have alienated many of washington 's allies , and all three want to get on board with climate change initiatives .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : john mccain takes a number of hardline stances however , john mccain may be a potential problem .
he is fiercely critical of russia and is likely to stake an incredibly harsh stance on relations .
he has spoken about throwing russia out of the g8 ; he has pilloried putin and has equal disdain for medvedev .
it is likely that mccain would challenge germany on its relations with russia , especially over energy security .
clinton and obama would also take a stand on russia but one which is in no way as harsh as mccain .
neither would consider throwing russia out of the g8 .
there could also be potential conflict over iraq .
mccain is a supporter of the war and believes that the troop surge has been a success , although he admits there have been management failures .
so , given the germans ' view of the iraq war , this could be a sore point .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : clinton and obama would be closer to european policy clinton and specifically obama would come to europe without that iraq baggage .
obama would come and say " look , i was never in favor , i was never a supporter but i have inherited this . "
the europeans would more than likely hear him out .
hillary is a little less clear cut on this issue , as her initial campaign outings showed when she was called on her vagueness over the war .
but both will want to have dialogue with europe over iraq and will want to find solutions together .
iran is another area where there is a big difference .
mccain is in favor of the military option and is absolutely resolute that there should be no appeasement or rewards for iranian compromise .
the democrats have both said that the military option remains on the table but are in favor of dialogue , obama especially .
hillary is more hesitant on that .
either way , both democrats are in favor of the german approach of encouraging discussions with iran .
then again , all three would urge the europeans to increase their economic sanctions and utilize their power , such as when germany closed some banking operations down in tehran .
steinmeier will also meet with secretary of state condoleezza rice during his visit .
given the situations which arose during the last nato meeting in bucharest , regarding russia , the balkans , the potential membership of former soviet states -lsb- ukraine , georgia -rsb- , what can the germans hope for in these talks in terms of progress on the issues washington and berlin are divided on ?
it 's very likely that this meeting will be used to reiterate points made at the nato summit in bucharest rather than to try and make progress on the issues .
rice will probably lecture germany on the ukraine and georgia issue and reiterate president bush 's desire for these countries to join nato .
there could be friction here .
word has it that the way bush pressured the europeans over ukraine and georgia , even after the europeans made it clear that the issue was off the table , angered many .
chancellor merkel in particular was said to have been very upset by that .
so i think steinmeier will also take the opportunity to reiterate germany and the eu 's position and do so strongly .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : steinmeier and rice will reiterate their nations ' positions the balkans will also feature .
the us is very interested in seeing how the eu mission to kosovo works out when it is deployed and what the details of the mission will be .
there will also be some discussion on the missile defense shield .
it 's most likely that the agenda will feature issues which are geopolitically closer to europe than the us .
it is also very likely that steinmeier will press rice for information on the progress in the palestinian-israeli situation .
the us has been sending people to the region for many months now after making some pretty ambitious plans and claims .
steinmeier will want to know what is happening .
the germans , and steinmeier in particular , are very interested in the resolution of this conflict .
will rice use this opportunity to apply more pressure on germany in regard to its involvement in afghanistan ?
rice will probably leave the troop issue to defense secretary robert gates .
what she will be more interested in will be finding out what germany is considering in advance of the meeting france is hosting about civilian aid and missions to afghanistan .
she 'll be interested in what germany has to offer and whether there can be any joint initiatives with the us .
should china be on the agenda , what is the likelihood that the us and germany will find a common stance ?
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : europe is hardening its stance against china china could come up as a topic for discussion , but it is n't really on rice 's agenda , although with the situation in tibet and the current discussion over the olympic games , it may be talked about .
the two nations have very different stances and relations with china , so it is unlikely they will try and broach any of these during these short discussions .
the us has different geopolitical interests in china ; it has strong ties with taiwan and the us has troops in the region .
there is also this idea that the europeans are a lot softer on china than the americans .
in the last two years , things have really changed though .
trade deficits and other economic concerns have made the europeans a little more nervous over their relations with china , and the eu has actually developed a firmer stance recently .
even so , europe and the us keep very much to themselves over the people 's republic , and even germany 's trade ties with china wo n't be of enough interest for it to become a hot topic at these discussions . interview : nick amies send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

“ forced to be cruel ” will open on june 2 , 2008 , at 4 p.m. at the world conference center in bonn and features 80 emotionally-charged photos .
this is the first time that this selection of photos will be on display , with other shows in new york and tokyo following this fall .
the participating , internationally-renown photographers include : lynsey addario , who documented child soldiers in sudan , martin adler -lrb- columbia -rrb- , riccardo gangale , cedric gerbehaye , roger lemoyne -lrb- congo -rrb- , tim hetherington -lrb- liberia -rrb- , peter mantello -lrb- burma -rrb- , q. sakamaki -lrb- afghanistan -rrb- , dominic sansoni -lrb- sri lanka -rrb- and ami vitale -lrb- nepal -rrb- .
the british photographer tim hetherington was recently awarded the “ oscar ” for press photographers , the world press photo prize , for his photo of a wounded american soldier in iraq .
photographer and film-maker peter mantello was the one who established the exhibition .

mantello , along with the curator of the exhibition leora khan from new york , will be in bonn for the premiere .
according to international estimations , there are 300,000 child soldiers worldwide .
they are being recruited for regular armed forces and rebel groups and forced into combat .
in many conflicts , child soldiers are a constant component of the military infrastructure .
an important milestone in the fight against children in combat is the additional protocol to the un children ’ s rights convention , in which the signing nations agreed not to recruit anyone under the age of 18 .
equally important is the international criminal court in den haag .
according to the statute of the criminal court , those who send children under the age of 15 into combat can be charged as a war criminal .
from more than 10 years , many national and international organizations have been making an effort to counteract the situation facing child soldiers and shed light on the subject worldwide . the foundation for international dialogue of the savings bank in bonn is co-hosting the deutsche welle global media forum .
the conference is also being supported by the german federal foreign office , the state government of north-rhine westphalia , dhl , the city of bonn , vt communications and blatzheim networks telecom .

germany 's foreign intelligence service acknowledged , and apologized for , having spied on a german journalist .
it 's not the first time german agents have been caught keeping tabs on reporters . the federal intelligence agency -lrb- bnd -rrb- , read e-mail correspondence that susanne koelbl , an editor at the german newsweekly der spiegel , had exchanged with an afghani politician between june and november , 2006 , according to a report that broke in spiegel in the edition of the magazine published monday , april 21 . bnd chief ernst uhrlau informed koelbl of its actions on friday and apologized at the same time .
koelbl has been reporting for years for the magazine from crisis areas in asia 's hindu kush mountain region . parliament to discuss case according to the web site of koelbl 's publisher , random house , the author has been covering afghanistan since the fall of the taliban , and " has access to almost everyone within the government in kabul , but also to ...
pakistan . " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : susanne koelbl is well-connected in the hindu kush the case is expected to be discussed by the parliamentary control committee of the bundestag on wednesday , the magazine reported .
the committee is responsible for monitoring the bnd . acting chairman of the parliamentary control committee , max stadler , has demanded an explanation . " the -lrb- german -rrb- basic law applies even to those germans living abroad , and this was a clear breach of press freedom , " he told the tagesspiegel newspaper . the bnd has already been involved in " spying affairs " involving journalists in past years , and should have developed a stricter attitude about it , stadler told the paper . " the bnd has already apologized to ms. koelbl , " he said .
" that shows that even they see the case as problematic . " similar citations for bnd in 2006 germany saw a scandal involving the bnd spying on journalists back in 2006 .
at the time , a report emerged from the parliamentary committee acknowledging that intelligence agents had illegally spied on journalists to expose their sources . a 180-page parliamentary report released at the time showed that measures taken by the bnd against german reporters in an effort to shut off leaks violated the law . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : koelbl had contacts to high-ranking officials " regarding the accusations in the press that the federal intelligence agency ... illegally spied on journalists in order to expose their sources , it is to be ascertained that such observations did take place ... these measures were predominantly illegal , " the 2006 report read . bnd agents picked through the journalists ' rubbish and traced their research , the report stated .
while none of the reporters was bugged , agents used other measures against them to try to uncover their sources , including stealing a box of his papers that one journalist had thrown away and tracing another 's research in the federal archive . as a result , germany 's ranking dropped on a ranking list of press freedom complied by the independent journalism advocacy group reporters without borders . dw staff -lrb- jen -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

dw-world.de spoke to von richthofen biographer joachim castan about the man behind the myth . the prussian nobleman - dubbed the red baron because of the color of his aircraft - shot down some 80 allied planes before his death at the age of 25 .
his life has become the stuff of legend .
a new film about the red baron , which opened in germany this month , also revives the heroic image .
joachim castan , 41 , was the first historian to write a biography of this famous figure .
the biographer and documentary filmmaker spent three years researching the project , gaining exclusive access to previously unpublished writings and letters .
the book , called " die ganze geschichte " -lrb- the whole story -rrb- and published in 2007 , reveals a far more complex character .
dw-world.de : did your image of von richthofen change in the course of your research ?
joachim castan : i must admit that i had an image of von richthofen before i started my research of him as the last true gentleman of the skies in a dehumanized , industrialized brutal war , heroically participating in airborne duels .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : castan 's preconceptions were overturned while working on the book as i became immersed in the material , i realized that there was a well-maintained von richthofen myth .
the myth propagates the idea that von richthofen forced pilots to land .
he shot down aircraft , but he ensured , if at all possible , that the pilot survived , so that the whole encounter took on the character of a sporting match to determine the better pilot and marksman .
this turned out to be an image created by the german propaganda machine in 1917 .
it needed a young , good-looking radiant hero , a victor who could be served up to a relatively demoralized society . this image of the lonely gentleman of the skies was then taken up in the 1920s and further elaborated upon by the americans , who wanted to sell a romantic notion of air combat .
and who was the man you discovered ?
he was completely different .
without doubt , he was extremely courageous and extremely ambitious , but he was also cold-blooded .
his goal was to shoot down as many aircraft as possible .
in his own writings , he writes quite openly : " i never get into an aircraft for fun .
i aim first for the head of the pilot , or rather at the head of the observer , if there was one . "
i do n't think that von richthofen would have described himself as a hero .
he was doing his duty to defend his fatherland .
at the same time , he was satisfying his passion for hunting .
he was already a passionate hunter at the age of 11 and was taken hunting by his father .
aim , shoot , destroy target - he took his passion for hunting to the skies , transposing it one-to-one .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : von richthofen around 1917 i also do not think he was a brutal killer .
von richthofen also reflected partially upon what he did .
he wrote that he always felt terrible when he came off duty .
he used to come home and lock himself in his room for hours and refuse to talk to anyone .
from mid-1917 he also realized that the war was probably going to be lost .
for me he is a tragic figure , fighting fanatically , remorselessly , in a war that is lost .
what made him into the kind of person he was ?
his mother was extraordinarily ambitious and did n't think much of her husband .
he retired early and did not have a very successful career as an officer .
all of the family 's ambitions were invested first in the eldest son , manfred , and then in the second son , lothar , who was also a fighter pilot .
the young manfred was sent at the age of 11 to a prussian cadet school , which were pretty infamous .
the children were honed into soldiers and there was no scope for any ifs , ands or buts .
the intellectual aspect of schooling was largely neglected .
the children had to function as soldiers first and foremost .
it 's interesting : if you look at von richthofen 's personal development , it showed that , first of all , he functioned in this way .
then a year before his death , he started to come to his senses and think about his actions .
i think he gradually realized that he had arrived at a dead end .
you say that the red baron myth was created in 1917 .
it served then as propaganda intended to boost morale .
but why is it now being revived ?
what is the reason for the current interest in this figure ?
in germany currently , we are thinking about war , heroes , and war heroes , we are rethinking our position .
deployment in a war in afghanistan would have been unthinkable in germany 10 years ago .
at the same time , we are thinking about reintroducing medals to reward bravery .
for germany , that is a very unusual situation because of our history , the third reich and the hitler dictatorship .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : matthias schweighoefer plays the red baron in the new film in other countries , in france , britain and the united states , hero cults exist .
in germany , they ceased to exist after 1945 .
i believe that there is a certain tendency toward reintroducing heroes , to hold them up as examples , as military models and to make military conflict socially acceptable again .
what do you think about the portrayal of von richthofen in nikolai muellerschoen 's new film , " the red baron ? "
the film revives the richthofen myth in parts .
it turns him into a radiant figure , someone who becomes a good person / pacifist through his love for a nurse .
it is a way of seeing von richthofen that is popular at the moment - as a sort of broken hero who is relatively blameless in some respects .
there are those responsible for conducting the war , who are evil , and the good hero .
this is a distinction that people like to make at the moment . interview : julie gregson send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

considering germany 's foreign-policy stance on issues such as the middle east -lsb- including relations with iran -rsb- , afghanistan , russia and the european union 's role on the international stage , which of the us candidates are most likely to be more in line with the germans ?
julianne smith : all three of the us presidential candidates have some foreign policy issues which the europeans and the germans will be encouraged by .
all three want to close down guantanamo bay , all three want to get tough on torture and roll back many of the policies which the bush administration have brought in which have alienated many of washington 's allies , and all three want to get on board with climate change initiatives .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : john mccain takes a number of hardline stances however , john mccain may be a potential problem .
he is fiercely critical of russia and is likely to stake an incredibly harsh stance on relations .
he has spoken about throwing russia out of the g8 ; he has pilloried putin and has equal disdain for medvedev .
it is likely that mccain would challenge germany on its relations with russia , especially over energy security .
clinton and obama would also take a stand on russia but one which is in no way as harsh as mccain .
neither would consider throwing russia out of the g8 .
there could also be potential conflict over iraq .
mccain is a supporter of the war and believes that the troop surge has been a success , although he admits there have been management failures .
so , given the germans ' view of the iraq war , this could be a sore point .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : clinton and obama would be closer to european policy clinton and specifically obama would come to europe without that iraq baggage .
obama would come and say " look , i was never in favor , i was never a supporter but i have inherited this . "
the europeans would more than likely hear him out .
hillary is a little less clear cut on this issue , as her initial campaign outings showed when she was called on her vagueness over the war .
but both will want to have dialogue with europe over iraq and will want to find solutions together .
iran is another area where there is a big difference .
mccain is in favor of the military option and is absolutely resolute that there should be no appeasement or rewards for iranian compromise .
the democrats have both said that the military option remains on the table but are in favor of dialogue , obama especially .
hillary is more hesitant on that .
either way , both democrats are in favor of the german approach of encouraging discussions with iran .
then again , all three would urge the europeans to increase their economic sanctions and utilize their power , such as when germany closed some banking operations down in tehran .
steinmeier will also meet with secretary of state condoleezza rice during his visit .
given the situations which arose during the last nato meeting in bucharest , regarding russia , the balkans , the potential membership of former soviet states -lsb- ukraine , georgia -rsb- , what can the germans hope for in these talks in terms of progress on the issues washington and berlin are divided on ?
it 's very likely that this meeting will be used to reiterate points made at the nato summit in bucharest rather than to try and make progress on the issues .
rice will probably lecture germany on the ukraine and georgia issue and reiterate president bush 's desire for these countries to join nato .
there could be friction here .
word has it that the way bush pressured the europeans over ukraine and georgia , even after the europeans made it clear that the issue was off the table , angered many .
chancellor merkel in particular was said to have been very upset by that .
so i think steinmeier will also take the opportunity to reiterate germany and the eu 's position and do so strongly .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : steinmeier and rice will reiterate their nations ' positions the balkans will also feature .
the us is very interested in seeing how the eu mission to kosovo works out when it is deployed and what the details of the mission will be .
there will also be some discussion on the missile defense shield .
it 's most likely that the agenda will feature issues which are geopolitically closer to europe than the us .
it is also very likely that steinmeier will press rice for information on the progress in the palestinian-israeli situation .
the us has been sending people to the region for many months now after making some pretty ambitious plans and claims .
steinmeier will want to know what is happening .
the germans , and steinmeier in particular , are very interested in the resolution of this conflict .
will rice use this opportunity to apply more pressure on germany in regard to its involvement in afghanistan ?
rice will probably leave the troop issue to defense secretary robert gates .
what she will be more interested in will be finding out what germany is considering in advance of the meeting france is hosting about civilian aid and missions to afghanistan .
she 'll be interested in what germany has to offer and whether there can be any joint initiatives with the us .
should china be on the agenda , what is the likelihood that the us and germany will find a common stance ?
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : europe is hardening its stance against china china could come up as a topic for discussion , but it is n't really on rice 's agenda , although with the situation in tibet and the current discussion over the olympic games , it may be talked about .
the two nations have very different stances and relations with china , so it is unlikely they will try and broach any of these during these short discussions .
the us has different geopolitical interests in china ; it has strong ties with taiwan and the us has troops in the region .
there is also this idea that the europeans are a lot softer on china than the americans .
in the last two years , things have really changed though .
trade deficits and other economic concerns have made the europeans a little more nervous over their relations with china , and the eu has actually developed a firmer stance recently .
even so , europe and the us keep very much to themselves over the people 's republic , and even germany 's trade ties with china wo n't be of enough interest for it to become a hot topic at these discussions . interview : nick amies send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

then again , all three would urge the europeans to increase their economic sanctions and utilize their power , such as when germany closed some banking operations down in tehran .
steinmeier will also meet with secretary of state condoleezza rice during his visit .
given the situations which arose during the last nato meeting in bucharest , regarding russia , the balkans , the potential membership of former soviet states -lsb- ukraine , georgia -rsb- , what can the germans hope for in these talks in terms of progress on the issues washington and berlin are divided on ?
it 's very likely that this meeting will be used to reiterate points made at the nato summit in bucharest rather than to try and make progress on the issues .
rice will probably lecture germany on the ukraine and georgia issue and reiterate president bush 's desire for these countries to join nato .
there could be friction here .
word has it that the way bush pressured the europeans over ukraine and georgia , even after the europeans made it clear that the issue was off the table , angered many .
chancellor merkel in particular was said to have been very upset by that .
so i think steinmeier will also take the opportunity to reiterate germany and the eu 's position and do so strongly .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : steinmeier and rice will reiterate their nations ' positions the balkans will also feature .
the us is very interested in seeing how the eu mission to kosovo works out when it is deployed and what the details of the mission will be .
there will also be some discussion on the missile defense shield .
it 's most likely that the agenda will feature issues which are geopolitically closer to europe than the us .
it is also very likely that steinmeier will press rice for information on the progress in the palestinian-israeli situation .
the us has been sending people to the region for many months now after making some pretty ambitious plans and claims .
steinmeier will want to know what is happening .
the germans , and steinmeier in particular , are very interested in the resolution of this conflict .
will rice use this opportunity to apply more pressure on germany in regard to its involvement in afghanistan ?
rice will probably leave the troop issue to defense secretary robert gates .
what she will be more interested in will be finding out what germany is considering in advance of the meeting france is hosting about civilian aid and missions to afghanistan .
she 'll be interested in what germany has to offer and whether there can be any joint initiatives with the us .
should china be on the agenda , what is the likelihood that the us and germany will find a common stance ?
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : europe is hardening its stance against china china could come up as a topic for discussion , but it is n't really on rice 's agenda , although with the situation in tibet and the current discussion over the olympic games , it may be talked about .
the two nations have very different stances and relations with china , so it is unlikely they will try and broach any of these during these short discussions .
the us has different geopolitical interests in china ; it has strong ties with taiwan and the us has troops in the region .
there is also this idea that the europeans are a lot softer on china than the americans .
in the last two years , things have really changed though .
trade deficits and other economic concerns have made the europeans a little more nervous over their relations with china , and the eu has actually developed a firmer stance recently .
even so , europe and the us keep very much to themselves over the people 's republic , and even germany 's trade ties with china wo n't be of enough interest for it to become a hot topic at these discussions . interview : nick amies send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

dw-world.de talked with a trans-atlantic relations expert about the visit . among the themes likely to come up for discussion during steinmeier 's visit to washington are the middle east conflict , iran 's nuclear program and the situation in the balkans .
during the trip , the german delegation intends to gain information at first hand on the foreign-policy attitudes of the candidates in the us presidential election .
dw-world.de talked to julianne smith , the director of the europe program at the center for strategic and international studies , a bipartisan think-tank based in washington , about the visit .
dw-world.de : part of steinmeier 's visit will include a fact-finding mission to assess the foreign-policy platforms of the us presidential candidates .
considering germany 's foreign-policy stance on issues such as the middle east -lsb- including relations with iran -rsb- , afghanistan , russia and the european union 's role on the international stage , which of the us candidates are most likely to be more in line with the germans ?
julianne smith : all three of the us presidential candidates have some foreign policy issues which the europeans and the germans will be encouraged by .
all three want to close down guantanamo bay , all three want to get tough on torture and roll back many of the policies which the bush administration have brought in which have alienated many of washington 's allies , and all three want to get on board with climate change initiatives .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : john mccain takes a number of hardline stances however , john mccain may be a potential problem .
he is fiercely critical of russia and is likely to stake an incredibly harsh stance on relations .
he has spoken about throwing russia out of the g8 ; he has pilloried putin and has equal disdain for medvedev .
it is likely that mccain would challenge germany on its relations with russia , especially over energy security .
clinton and obama would also take a stand on russia but one which is in no way as harsh as mccain .
neither would consider throwing russia out of the g8 .
there could also be potential conflict over iraq .
mccain is a supporter of the war and believes that the troop surge has been a success , although he admits there have been management failures .
so , given the germans ' view of the iraq war , this could be a sore point .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : clinton and obama would be closer to european policy clinton and specifically obama would come to europe without that iraq baggage .
obama would come and say " look , i was never in favor , i was never a supporter but i have inherited this . "
the europeans would more than likely hear him out .
hillary is a little less clear cut on this issue , as her initial campaign outings showed when she was called on her vagueness over the war .
but both will want to have dialogue with europe over iraq and will want to find solutions together .
iran is another area where there is a big difference .
mccain is in favor of the military option and is absolutely resolute that there should be no appeasement or rewards for iranian compromise .
the democrats have both said that the military option remains on the table but are in favor of dialogue , obama especially .
hillary is more hesitant on that .
either way , both democrats are in favor of the german approach of encouraging discussions with iran .
then again , all three would urge the europeans to increase their economic sanctions and utilize their power , such as when germany closed some banking operations down in tehran .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de trans-atlantic relations -pipe- 21.04.2008 german foreign minister embarks on us fact-finding mission großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : steinmeier will assess the foreign policies of the three us presidential candidates german foreign minister frank-walter steinmeier travels to the us on friday , april 11 , for talks with secretary of state condoleezza rice .
dw-world.de talked with a trans-atlantic relations expert about the visit . among the themes likely to come up for discussion during steinmeier 's visit to washington are the middle east conflict , iran 's nuclear program and the situation in the balkans .
during the trip , the german delegation intends to gain information at first hand on the foreign-policy attitudes of the candidates in the us presidential election .
dw-world.de talked to julianne smith , the director of the europe program at the center for strategic and international studies , a bipartisan think-tank based in washington , about the visit .
dw-world.de : part of steinmeier 's visit will include a fact-finding mission to assess the foreign-policy platforms of the us presidential candidates .
considering germany 's foreign-policy stance on issues such as the middle east -lsb- including relations with iran -rsb- , afghanistan , russia and the european union 's role on the international stage , which of the us candidates are most likely to be more in line with the germans ?
julianne smith : all three of the us presidential candidates have some foreign policy issues which the europeans and the germans will be encouraged by .
all three want to close down guantanamo bay , all three want to get tough on torture and roll back many of the policies which the bush administration have brought in which have alienated many of washington 's allies , and all three want to get on board with climate change initiatives .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : john mccain takes a number of hardline stances however , john mccain may be a potential problem .
he is fiercely critical of russia and is likely to stake an incredibly harsh stance on relations .
he has spoken about throwing russia out of the g8 ; he has pilloried putin and has equal disdain for medvedev .
it is likely that mccain would challenge germany on its relations with russia , especially over energy security .
clinton and obama would also take a stand on russia but one which is in no way as harsh as mccain .
neither would consider throwing russia out of the g8 .
there could also be potential conflict over iraq .
mccain is a supporter of the war and believes that the troop surge has been a success , although he admits there have been management failures .
so , given the germans ' view of the iraq war , this could be a sore point .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : clinton and obama would be closer to european policy clinton and specifically obama would come to europe without that iraq baggage .
obama would come and say " look , i was never in favor , i was never a supporter but i have inherited this . "
the europeans would more than likely hear him out .
hillary is a little less clear cut on this issue , as her initial campaign outings showed when she was called on her vagueness over the war .
but both will want to have dialogue with europe over iraq and will want to find solutions together .
iran is another area where there is a big difference .
mccain is in favor of the military option and is absolutely resolute that there should be no appeasement or rewards for iranian compromise .
the democrats have both said that the military option remains on the table but are in favor of dialogue , obama especially .
hillary is more hesitant on that .
either way , both democrats are in favor of the german approach of encouraging discussions with iran .
then again , all three would urge the europeans to increase their economic sanctions and utilize their power , such as when germany closed some banking operations down in tehran .
steinmeier will also meet with secretary of state condoleezza rice during his visit .
given the situations which arose during the last nato meeting in bucharest , regarding russia , the balkans , the potential membership of former soviet states -lsb- ukraine , georgia -rsb- , what can the germans hope for in these talks in terms of progress on the issues washington and berlin are divided on ?
it 's very likely that this meeting will be used to reiterate points made at the nato summit in bucharest rather than to try and make progress on the issues .
rice will probably lecture germany on the ukraine and georgia issue and reiterate president bush 's desire for these countries to join nato .
there could be friction here .
word has it that the way bush pressured the europeans over ukraine and georgia , even after the europeans made it clear that the issue was off the table , angered many .
chancellor merkel in particular was said to have been very upset by that .
so i think steinmeier will also take the opportunity to reiterate germany and the eu 's position and do so strongly .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : steinmeier and rice will reiterate their nations ' positions the balkans will also feature .
the us is very interested in seeing how the eu mission to kosovo works out when it is deployed and what the details of the mission will be .
there will also be some discussion on the missile defense shield .
it 's most likely that the agenda will feature issues which are geopolitically closer to europe than the us .
it is also very likely that steinmeier will press rice for information on the progress in the palestinian-israeli situation .
the us has been sending people to the region for many months now after making some pretty ambitious plans and claims .
steinmeier will want to know what is happening .
the germans , and steinmeier in particular , are very interested in the resolution of this conflict .
will rice use this opportunity to apply more pressure on germany in regard to its involvement in afghanistan ?
rice will probably leave the troop issue to defense secretary robert gates .
what she will be more interested in will be finding out what germany is considering in advance of the meeting france is hosting about civilian aid and missions to afghanistan .
she 'll be interested in what germany has to offer and whether there can be any joint initiatives with the us .
should china be on the agenda , what is the likelihood that the us and germany will find a common stance ?
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : europe is hardening its stance against china china could come up as a topic for discussion , but it is n't really on rice 's agenda , although with the situation in tibet and the current discussion over the olympic games , it may be talked about .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de trans-atlantic relations -pipe- 21.04.2008 german foreign minister embarks on us fact-finding mission großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : steinmeier will assess the foreign policies of the three us presidential candidates german foreign minister frank-walter steinmeier travels to the us on friday , april 11 , for talks with secretary of state condoleezza rice .
dw-world.de talked with a trans-atlantic relations expert about the visit . among the themes likely to come up for discussion during steinmeier 's visit to washington are the middle east conflict , iran 's nuclear program and the situation in the balkans .
during the trip , the german delegation intends to gain information at first hand on the foreign-policy attitudes of the candidates in the us presidential election .
dw-world.de talked to julianne smith , the director of the europe program at the center for strategic and international studies , a bipartisan think-tank based in washington , about the visit .
dw-world.de : part of steinmeier 's visit will include a fact-finding mission to assess the foreign-policy platforms of the us presidential candidates .
considering germany 's foreign-policy stance on issues such as the middle east -lsb- including relations with iran -rsb- , afghanistan , russia and the european union 's role on the international stage , which of the us candidates are most likely to be more in line with the germans ?
julianne smith : all three of the us presidential candidates have some foreign policy issues which the europeans and the germans will be encouraged by .
all three want to close down guantanamo bay , all three want to get tough on torture and roll back many of the policies which the bush administration have brought in which have alienated many of washington 's allies , and all three want to get on board with climate change initiatives .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : john mccain takes a number of hardline stances however , john mccain may be a potential problem .
he is fiercely critical of russia and is likely to stake an incredibly harsh stance on relations .
he has spoken about throwing russia out of the g8 ; he has pilloried putin and has equal disdain for medvedev .
it is likely that mccain would challenge germany on its relations with russia , especially over energy security .
clinton and obama would also take a stand on russia but one which is in no way as harsh as mccain .
neither would consider throwing russia out of the g8 .
there could also be potential conflict over iraq .
mccain is a supporter of the war and believes that the troop surge has been a success , although he admits there have been management failures .
so , given the germans ' view of the iraq war , this could be a sore point .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : clinton and obama would be closer to european policy clinton and specifically obama would come to europe without that iraq baggage .
obama would come and say " look , i was never in favor , i was never a supporter but i have inherited this . "
the europeans would more than likely hear him out .
hillary is a little less clear cut on this issue , as her initial campaign outings showed when she was called on her vagueness over the war .
but both will want to have dialogue with europe over iraq and will want to find solutions together .
iran is another area where there is a big difference .
mccain is in favor of the military option and is absolutely resolute that there should be no appeasement or rewards for iranian compromise .
the democrats have both said that the military option remains on the table but are in favor of dialogue , obama especially .
hillary is more hesitant on that .
either way , both democrats are in favor of the german approach of encouraging discussions with iran .
then again , all three would urge the europeans to increase their economic sanctions and utilize their power , such as when germany closed some banking operations down in tehran .
steinmeier will also meet with secretary of state condoleezza rice during his visit .
given the situations which arose during the last nato meeting in bucharest , regarding russia , the balkans , the potential membership of former soviet states -lsb- ukraine , georgia -rsb- , what can the germans hope for in these talks in terms of progress on the issues washington and berlin are divided on ?
it 's very likely that this meeting will be used to reiterate points made at the nato summit in bucharest rather than to try and make progress on the issues .
rice will probably lecture germany on the ukraine and georgia issue and reiterate president bush 's desire for these countries to join nato .
there could be friction here .
word has it that the way bush pressured the europeans over ukraine and georgia , even after the europeans made it clear that the issue was off the table , angered many .
chancellor merkel in particular was said to have been very upset by that .
so i think steinmeier will also take the opportunity to reiterate germany and the eu 's position and do so strongly .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : steinmeier and rice will reiterate their nations ' positions the balkans will also feature .
the us is very interested in seeing how the eu mission to kosovo works out when it is deployed and what the details of the mission will be .
there will also be some discussion on the missile defense shield .
it 's most likely that the agenda will feature issues which are geopolitically closer to europe than the us .
it is also very likely that steinmeier will press rice for information on the progress in the palestinian-israeli situation .
the us has been sending people to the region for many months now after making some pretty ambitious plans and claims .
steinmeier will want to know what is happening .
the germans , and steinmeier in particular , are very interested in the resolution of this conflict .
will rice use this opportunity to apply more pressure on germany in regard to its involvement in afghanistan ?
rice will probably leave the troop issue to defense secretary robert gates .
what she will be more interested in will be finding out what germany is considering in advance of the meeting france is hosting about civilian aid and missions to afghanistan .
she 'll be interested in what germany has to offer and whether there can be any joint initiatives with the us .
should china be on the agenda , what is the likelihood that the us and germany will find a common stance ?
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : europe is hardening its stance against china china could come up as a topic for discussion , but it is n't really on rice 's agenda , although with the situation in tibet and the current discussion over the olympic games , it may be talked about .
the two nations have very different stances and relations with china , so it is unlikely they will try and broach any of these during these short discussions .
the us has different geopolitical interests in china ; it has strong ties with taiwan and the us has troops in the region .
there is also this idea that the europeans are a lot softer on china than the americans .
in the last two years , things have really changed though .
trade deficits and other economic concerns have made the europeans a little more nervous over their relations with china , and the eu has actually developed a firmer stance recently .
even so , europe and the us keep very much to themselves over the people 's republic , and even germany 's trade ties with china wo n't be of enough interest for it to become a hot topic at these discussions . interview : nick amies send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

during the trip , the german delegation intends to gain information at first hand on the foreign-policy attitudes of the candidates in the us presidential election .
dw-world.de talked to julianne smith , the director of the europe program at the center for strategic and international studies , a bipartisan think-tank based in washington , about the visit .
dw-world.de : part of steinmeier 's visit will include a fact-finding mission to assess the foreign-policy platforms of the us presidential candidates .
considering germany 's foreign-policy stance on issues such as the middle east -lsb- including relations with iran -rsb- , afghanistan , russia and the european union 's role on the international stage , which of the us candidates are most likely to be more in line with the germans ?
julianne smith : all three of the us presidential candidates have some foreign policy issues which the europeans and the germans will be encouraged by .
all three want to close down guantanamo bay , all three want to get tough on torture and roll back many of the policies which the bush administration have brought in which have alienated many of washington 's allies , and all three want to get on board with climate change initiatives .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : john mccain takes a number of hardline stances however , john mccain may be a potential problem .
he is fiercely critical of russia and is likely to stake an incredibly harsh stance on relations .
he has spoken about throwing russia out of the g8 ; he has pilloried putin and has equal disdain for medvedev .
it is likely that mccain would challenge germany on its relations with russia , especially over energy security .
clinton and obama would also take a stand on russia but one which is in no way as harsh as mccain .
neither would consider throwing russia out of the g8 .
there could also be potential conflict over iraq .
mccain is a supporter of the war and believes that the troop surge has been a success , although he admits there have been management failures .
so , given the germans ' view of the iraq war , this could be a sore point .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : clinton and obama would be closer to european policy clinton and specifically obama would come to europe without that iraq baggage .
obama would come and say " look , i was never in favor , i was never a supporter but i have inherited this . "
the europeans would more than likely hear him out .
hillary is a little less clear cut on this issue , as her initial campaign outings showed when she was called on her vagueness over the war .
but both will want to have dialogue with europe over iraq and will want to find solutions together .
iran is another area where there is a big difference .
mccain is in favor of the military option and is absolutely resolute that there should be no appeasement or rewards for iranian compromise .
the democrats have both said that the military option remains on the table but are in favor of dialogue , obama especially .
hillary is more hesitant on that .
either way , both democrats are in favor of the german approach of encouraging discussions with iran .
then again , all three would urge the europeans to increase their economic sanctions and utilize their power , such as when germany closed some banking operations down in tehran .
steinmeier will also meet with secretary of state condoleezza rice during his visit .
given the situations which arose during the last nato meeting in bucharest , regarding russia , the balkans , the potential membership of former soviet states -lsb- ukraine , georgia -rsb- , what can the germans hope for in these talks in terms of progress on the issues washington and berlin are divided on ?
it 's very likely that this meeting will be used to reiterate points made at the nato summit in bucharest rather than to try and make progress on the issues .
rice will probably lecture germany on the ukraine and georgia issue and reiterate president bush 's desire for these countries to join nato .
there could be friction here .
word has it that the way bush pressured the europeans over ukraine and georgia , even after the europeans made it clear that the issue was off the table , angered many .
chancellor merkel in particular was said to have been very upset by that .
so i think steinmeier will also take the opportunity to reiterate germany and the eu 's position and do so strongly .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : steinmeier and rice will reiterate their nations ' positions the balkans will also feature .
the us is very interested in seeing how the eu mission to kosovo works out when it is deployed and what the details of the mission will be .
there will also be some discussion on the missile defense shield .
it 's most likely that the agenda will feature issues which are geopolitically closer to europe than the us .
it is also very likely that steinmeier will press rice for information on the progress in the palestinian-israeli situation .
the us has been sending people to the region for many months now after making some pretty ambitious plans and claims .
steinmeier will want to know what is happening .
the germans , and steinmeier in particular , are very interested in the resolution of this conflict .
will rice use this opportunity to apply more pressure on germany in regard to its involvement in afghanistan ?
rice will probably leave the troop issue to defense secretary robert gates .
what she will be more interested in will be finding out what germany is considering in advance of the meeting france is hosting about civilian aid and missions to afghanistan .
she 'll be interested in what germany has to offer and whether there can be any joint initiatives with the us .
should china be on the agenda , what is the likelihood that the us and germany will find a common stance ?
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : europe is hardening its stance against china china could come up as a topic for discussion , but it is n't really on rice 's agenda , although with the situation in tibet and the current discussion over the olympic games , it may be talked about .
the two nations have very different stances and relations with china , so it is unlikely they will try and broach any of these during these short discussions .
the us has different geopolitical interests in china ; it has strong ties with taiwan and the us has troops in the region .
there is also this idea that the europeans are a lot softer on china than the americans .
in the last two years , things have really changed though .
trade deficits and other economic concerns have made the europeans a little more nervous over their relations with china , and the eu has actually developed a firmer stance recently .
even so , europe and the us keep very much to themselves over the people 's republic , and even germany 's trade ties with china wo n't be of enough interest for it to become a hot topic at these discussions . interview : nick amies send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

so , given the germans ' view of the iraq war , this could be a sore point .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : clinton and obama would be closer to european policy clinton and specifically obama would come to europe without that iraq baggage .
obama would come and say " look , i was never in favor , i was never a supporter but i have inherited this . "
the europeans would more than likely hear him out .
hillary is a little less clear cut on this issue , as her initial campaign outings showed when she was called on her vagueness over the war .
but both will want to have dialogue with europe over iraq and will want to find solutions together .
iran is another area where there is a big difference .
mccain is in favor of the military option and is absolutely resolute that there should be no appeasement or rewards for iranian compromise .
the democrats have both said that the military option remains on the table but are in favor of dialogue , obama especially .
hillary is more hesitant on that .
either way , both democrats are in favor of the german approach of encouraging discussions with iran .
then again , all three would urge the europeans to increase their economic sanctions and utilize their power , such as when germany closed some banking operations down in tehran .
steinmeier will also meet with secretary of state condoleezza rice during his visit .
given the situations which arose during the last nato meeting in bucharest , regarding russia , the balkans , the potential membership of former soviet states -lsb- ukraine , georgia -rsb- , what can the germans hope for in these talks in terms of progress on the issues washington and berlin are divided on ?
it 's very likely that this meeting will be used to reiterate points made at the nato summit in bucharest rather than to try and make progress on the issues .
rice will probably lecture germany on the ukraine and georgia issue and reiterate president bush 's desire for these countries to join nato .
there could be friction here .
word has it that the way bush pressured the europeans over ukraine and georgia , even after the europeans made it clear that the issue was off the table , angered many .
chancellor merkel in particular was said to have been very upset by that .
so i think steinmeier will also take the opportunity to reiterate germany and the eu 's position and do so strongly .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : steinmeier and rice will reiterate their nations ' positions the balkans will also feature .
the us is very interested in seeing how the eu mission to kosovo works out when it is deployed and what the details of the mission will be .
there will also be some discussion on the missile defense shield .
it 's most likely that the agenda will feature issues which are geopolitically closer to europe than the us .
it is also very likely that steinmeier will press rice for information on the progress in the palestinian-israeli situation .
the us has been sending people to the region for many months now after making some pretty ambitious plans and claims .
steinmeier will want to know what is happening .
the germans , and steinmeier in particular , are very interested in the resolution of this conflict .
will rice use this opportunity to apply more pressure on germany in regard to its involvement in afghanistan ?
rice will probably leave the troop issue to defense secretary robert gates .
what she will be more interested in will be finding out what germany is considering in advance of the meeting france is hosting about civilian aid and missions to afghanistan .
she 'll be interested in what germany has to offer and whether there can be any joint initiatives with the us .
should china be on the agenda , what is the likelihood that the us and germany will find a common stance ?
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : europe is hardening its stance against china china could come up as a topic for discussion , but it is n't really on rice 's agenda , although with the situation in tibet and the current discussion over the olympic games , it may be talked about .
the two nations have very different stances and relations with china , so it is unlikely they will try and broach any of these during these short discussions .
the us has different geopolitical interests in china ; it has strong ties with taiwan and the us has troops in the region .
there is also this idea that the europeans are a lot softer on china than the americans .
in the last two years , things have really changed though .
trade deficits and other economic concerns have made the europeans a little more nervous over their relations with china , and the eu has actually developed a firmer stance recently .
even so , europe and the us keep very much to themselves over the people 's republic , and even germany 's trade ties with china wo n't be of enough interest for it to become a hot topic at these discussions . interview : nick amies send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

dw-world.de talked with a trans-atlantic relations expert about the visit . among the themes likely to come up for discussion during steinmeier 's visit to washington are the middle east conflict , iran 's nuclear program and the situation in the balkans .
during the trip , the german delegation intends to gain information at first hand on the foreign-policy attitudes of the candidates in the us presidential election .
dw-world.de talked to julianne smith , the director of the europe program at the center for strategic and international studies , a bipartisan think-tank based in washington , about the visit .
dw-world.de : part of steinmeier 's visit will include a fact-finding mission to assess the foreign-policy platforms of the us presidential candidates .
considering germany 's foreign-policy stance on issues such as the middle east -lsb- including relations with iran -rsb- , afghanistan , russia and the european union 's role on the international stage , which of the us candidates are most likely to be more in line with the germans ?
julianne smith : all three of the us presidential candidates have some foreign policy issues which the europeans and the germans will be encouraged by .
all three want to close down guantanamo bay , all three want to get tough on torture and roll back many of the policies which the bush administration have brought in which have alienated many of washington 's allies , and all three want to get on board with climate change initiatives .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : john mccain takes a number of hardline stances however , john mccain may be a potential problem .
he is fiercely critical of russia and is likely to stake an incredibly harsh stance on relations .
he has spoken about throwing russia out of the g8 ; he has pilloried putin and has equal disdain for medvedev .
it is likely that mccain would challenge germany on its relations with russia , especially over energy security .
clinton and obama would also take a stand on russia but one which is in no way as harsh as mccain .
neither would consider throwing russia out of the g8 .
there could also be potential conflict over iraq .
mccain is a supporter of the war and believes that the troop surge has been a success , although he admits there have been management failures .

it is also very likely that steinmeier will press rice for information on the progress in the palestinian-israeli situation .
the us has been sending people to the region for many months now after making some pretty ambitious plans and claims .
steinmeier will want to know what is happening .
the germans , and steinmeier in particular , are very interested in the resolution of this conflict .
will rice use this opportunity to apply more pressure on germany in regard to its involvement in afghanistan ?
rice will probably leave the troop issue to defense secretary robert gates .
what she will be more interested in will be finding out what germany is considering in advance of the meeting france is hosting about civilian aid and missions to afghanistan .
she 'll be interested in what germany has to offer and whether there can be any joint initiatives with the us .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de trans-atlantic relations -pipe- 21.04.2008 german foreign minister embarks on us fact-finding mission großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : steinmeier will assess the foreign policies of the three us presidential candidates german foreign minister frank-walter steinmeier travels to the us on friday , april 11 , for talks with secretary of state condoleezza rice .
dw-world.de talked with a trans-atlantic relations expert about the visit . among the themes likely to come up for discussion during steinmeier 's visit to washington are the middle east conflict , iran 's nuclear program and the situation in the balkans .
during the trip , the german delegation intends to gain information at first hand on the foreign-policy attitudes of the candidates in the us presidential election .
dw-world.de talked to julianne smith , the director of the europe program at the center for strategic and international studies , a bipartisan think-tank based in washington , about the visit .
dw-world.de : part of steinmeier 's visit will include a fact-finding mission to assess the foreign-policy platforms of the us presidential candidates .
considering germany 's foreign-policy stance on issues such as the middle east -lsb- including relations with iran -rsb- , afghanistan , russia and the european union 's role on the international stage , which of the us candidates are most likely to be more in line with the germans ?
julianne smith : all three of the us presidential candidates have some foreign policy issues which the europeans and the germans will be encouraged by .
all three want to close down guantanamo bay , all three want to get tough on torture and roll back many of the policies which the bush administration have brought in which have alienated many of washington 's allies , and all three want to get on board with climate change initiatives .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : john mccain takes a number of hardline stances however , john mccain may be a potential problem .
he is fiercely critical of russia and is likely to stake an incredibly harsh stance on relations .
he has spoken about throwing russia out of the g8 ; he has pilloried putin and has equal disdain for medvedev .
it is likely that mccain would challenge germany on its relations with russia , especially over energy security .
clinton and obama would also take a stand on russia but one which is in no way as harsh as mccain .
neither would consider throwing russia out of the g8 .
there could also be potential conflict over iraq .
mccain is a supporter of the war and believes that the troop surge has been a success , although he admits there have been management failures .
so , given the germans ' view of the iraq war , this could be a sore point .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : clinton and obama would be closer to european policy clinton and specifically obama would come to europe without that iraq baggage .
obama would come and say " look , i was never in favor , i was never a supporter but i have inherited this . "
the europeans would more than likely hear him out .
hillary is a little less clear cut on this issue , as her initial campaign outings showed when she was called on her vagueness over the war .
but both will want to have dialogue with europe over iraq and will want to find solutions together .
iran is another area where there is a big difference .
mccain is in favor of the military option and is absolutely resolute that there should be no appeasement or rewards for iranian compromise .
the democrats have both said that the military option remains on the table but are in favor of dialogue , obama especially .
hillary is more hesitant on that .
either way , both democrats are in favor of the german approach of encouraging discussions with iran .
then again , all three would urge the europeans to increase their economic sanctions and utilize their power , such as when germany closed some banking operations down in tehran .
steinmeier will also meet with secretary of state condoleezza rice during his visit .
given the situations which arose during the last nato meeting in bucharest , regarding russia , the balkans , the potential membership of former soviet states -lsb- ukraine , georgia -rsb- , what can the germans hope for in these talks in terms of progress on the issues washington and berlin are divided on ?
it 's very likely that this meeting will be used to reiterate points made at the nato summit in bucharest rather than to try and make progress on the issues .
rice will probably lecture germany on the ukraine and georgia issue and reiterate president bush 's desire for these countries to join nato .
there could be friction here .
word has it that the way bush pressured the europeans over ukraine and georgia , even after the europeans made it clear that the issue was off the table , angered many .
chancellor merkel in particular was said to have been very upset by that .
so i think steinmeier will also take the opportunity to reiterate germany and the eu 's position and do so strongly .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : steinmeier and rice will reiterate their nations ' positions the balkans will also feature .
the us is very interested in seeing how the eu mission to kosovo works out when it is deployed and what the details of the mission will be .
there will also be some discussion on the missile defense shield .
it 's most likely that the agenda will feature issues which are geopolitically closer to europe than the us .
it is also very likely that steinmeier will press rice for information on the progress in the palestinian-israeli situation .
the us has been sending people to the region for many months now after making some pretty ambitious plans and claims .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de trans-atlantic relations -pipe- 21.04.2008 german foreign minister embarks on us fact-finding mission großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : steinmeier will assess the foreign policies of the three us presidential candidates german foreign minister frank-walter steinmeier travels to the us on friday , april 11 , for talks with secretary of state condoleezza rice .
dw-world.de talked with a trans-atlantic relations expert about the visit . among the themes likely to come up for discussion during steinmeier 's visit to washington are the middle east conflict , iran 's nuclear program and the situation in the balkans .
during the trip , the german delegation intends to gain information at first hand on the foreign-policy attitudes of the candidates in the us presidential election .
dw-world.de talked to julianne smith , the director of the europe program at the center for strategic and international studies , a bipartisan think-tank based in washington , about the visit .
dw-world.de : part of steinmeier 's visit will include a fact-finding mission to assess the foreign-policy platforms of the us presidential candidates .
considering germany 's foreign-policy stance on issues such as the middle east -lsb- including relations with iran -rsb- , afghanistan , russia and the european union 's role on the international stage , which of the us candidates are most likely to be more in line with the germans ?
julianne smith : all three of the us presidential candidates have some foreign policy issues which the europeans and the germans will be encouraged by .
all three want to close down guantanamo bay , all three want to get tough on torture and roll back many of the policies which the bush administration have brought in which have alienated many of washington 's allies , and all three want to get on board with climate change initiatives .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : john mccain takes a number of hardline stances however , john mccain may be a potential problem .
he is fiercely critical of russia and is likely to stake an incredibly harsh stance on relations .
he has spoken about throwing russia out of the g8 ; he has pilloried putin and has equal disdain for medvedev .
it is likely that mccain would challenge germany on its relations with russia , especially over energy security .
clinton and obama would also take a stand on russia but one which is in no way as harsh as mccain .
neither would consider throwing russia out of the g8 .
there could also be potential conflict over iraq .
mccain is a supporter of the war and believes that the troop surge has been a success , although he admits there have been management failures .
so , given the germans ' view of the iraq war , this could be a sore point .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : clinton and obama would be closer to european policy clinton and specifically obama would come to europe without that iraq baggage .
obama would come and say " look , i was never in favor , i was never a supporter but i have inherited this . "
the europeans would more than likely hear him out .
hillary is a little less clear cut on this issue , as her initial campaign outings showed when she was called on her vagueness over the war .
but both will want to have dialogue with europe over iraq and will want to find solutions together .
iran is another area where there is a big difference .
mccain is in favor of the military option and is absolutely resolute that there should be no appeasement or rewards for iranian compromise .
the democrats have both said that the military option remains on the table but are in favor of dialogue , obama especially .
hillary is more hesitant on that .
either way , both democrats are in favor of the german approach of encouraging discussions with iran .
then again , all three would urge the europeans to increase their economic sanctions and utilize their power , such as when germany closed some banking operations down in tehran .
steinmeier will also meet with secretary of state condoleezza rice during his visit .
given the situations which arose during the last nato meeting in bucharest , regarding russia , the balkans , the potential membership of former soviet states -lsb- ukraine , georgia -rsb- , what can the germans hope for in these talks in terms of progress on the issues washington and berlin are divided on ?
it 's very likely that this meeting will be used to reiterate points made at the nato summit in bucharest rather than to try and make progress on the issues .
rice will probably lecture germany on the ukraine and georgia issue and reiterate president bush 's desire for these countries to join nato .
there could be friction here .
word has it that the way bush pressured the europeans over ukraine and georgia , even after the europeans made it clear that the issue was off the table , angered many .
chancellor merkel in particular was said to have been very upset by that .
so i think steinmeier will also take the opportunity to reiterate germany and the eu 's position and do so strongly .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : steinmeier and rice will reiterate their nations ' positions the balkans will also feature .
the us is very interested in seeing how the eu mission to kosovo works out when it is deployed and what the details of the mission will be .
there will also be some discussion on the missile defense shield .
it 's most likely that the agenda will feature issues which are geopolitically closer to europe than the us .
it is also very likely that steinmeier will press rice for information on the progress in the palestinian-israeli situation .
the us has been sending people to the region for many months now after making some pretty ambitious plans and claims .
steinmeier will want to know what is happening .
the germans , and steinmeier in particular , are very interested in the resolution of this conflict .
will rice use this opportunity to apply more pressure on germany in regard to its involvement in afghanistan ?
rice will probably leave the troop issue to defense secretary robert gates .
what she will be more interested in will be finding out what germany is considering in advance of the meeting france is hosting about civilian aid and missions to afghanistan .
she 'll be interested in what germany has to offer and whether there can be any joint initiatives with the us .
should china be on the agenda , what is the likelihood that the us and germany will find a common stance ?
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : europe is hardening its stance against china china could come up as a topic for discussion , but it is n't really on rice 's agenda , although with the situation in tibet and the current discussion over the olympic games , it may be talked about .
the two nations have very different stances and relations with china , so it is unlikely they will try and broach any of these during these short discussions .
the us has different geopolitical interests in china ; it has strong ties with taiwan and the us has troops in the region .
there is also this idea that the europeans are a lot softer on china than the americans .
in the last two years , things have really changed though .
trade deficits and other economic concerns have made the europeans a little more nervous over their relations with china , and the eu has actually developed a firmer stance recently .
even so , europe and the us keep very much to themselves over the people 's republic , and even germany 's trade ties with china wo n't be of enough interest for it to become a hot topic at these discussions . interview : nick amies send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

she defended its merits , while pushing for its modernization . merkel said it was the joint task of politicians , businesses and unions to work together to make the economic model , which has a strong consensual aspect and seeks to carve a middle way between socialism and capitalism , fit to face the challenges of the future . her comments come against the background of the global financial crisis , a number of high-level corruption scandals in big german companies and a string of labor disputes .
there has been widespread media criticism of businesses , which have made job cuts or relocated their plants abroad to cut costs despite rising profits . speaking at the opening of the hanover industrial trade fair on sunday , april 19 , she praised the " cohesive power " of the social market economy , which many see as helping to bring about the country 's economic miracle after world war ii . managers urged to lead by example bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : german engineering firm siemens is one of the firms hit by corruption scandals juergen thumann , head of the bdi , the federation of german industries , said the behavior of business people also played a role in determining whether people would support this social model in the future . " people in positions of responsibility have to set a good example , " thumann said , adding that the federation had faith in the system , which he praised as a successful one . merkel also said germany should be prepared to change , to carry out reforms and to invest in order to continue to successfully compete in the global market . she expressed understanding for people who were worried about the impact of globalization , particularly in the light of the global financial crisis , but she said that she did not share these fears . " we can continue to profit from globalization , but it is up to us to determine to what extent , " the chancellor said . germany at less risk than other countries bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : green technology like this wind engine hub are being showcased at the hanover fair merkel also said despite the impact of the crisis of germany 's growth rates that the country had good prospects of being less hit by the credit crunch than other states .
however , she also said there was need to reform the german banking system and called for more transparency . thumann described economic developments in germany as " robust " with 1.7 million jobs being created since 2005 .
he said the government had helped improved the situation for businesses , but called for further reforms . almost 5,100 businesses from 62 countries are represented at the hanover fair , which runs through friday .

germany 's foreign intelligence service acknowledged , and apologized for , having spied on a german journalist .
it 's not the first time german agents have been caught keeping tabs on reporters . the federal intelligence agency -lrb- bnd -rrb- , read e-mail correspondence that susanne koelbl , an editor at the german newsweekly der spiegel , had exchanged with an afghani politician between june and november , 2006 , according to a report that broke in spiegel in the edition of the magazine published monday , april 21 . bnd chief ernst uhrlau informed koelbl of its actions on friday and apologized at the same time .
koelbl has been reporting for years for the magazine from crisis areas in asia 's hindu kush mountain region . parliament to discuss case according to the web site of koelbl 's publisher , random house , the author has been covering afghanistan since the fall of the taliban , and " has access to almost everyone within the government in kabul , but also to ...

the committee is responsible for monitoring the bnd . acting chairman of the parliamentary control committee , max stadler , has demanded an explanation . " the -lrb- german -rrb- basic law applies even to those germans living abroad , and this was a clear breach of press freedom , " he told the tagesspiegel newspaper . the bnd has already been involved in " spying affairs " involving journalists in past years , and should have developed a stricter attitude about it , stadler told the paper . " the bnd has already apologized to ms. koelbl , " he said .
" that shows that even they see the case as problematic . " similar citations for bnd in 2006 germany saw a scandal involving the bnd spying on journalists back in 2006 .
at the time , a report emerged from the parliamentary committee acknowledging that intelligence agents had illegally spied on journalists to expose their sources . a 180-page parliamentary report released at the time showed that measures taken by the bnd against german reporters in an effort to shut off leaks violated the law . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : koelbl had contacts to high-ranking officials " regarding the accusations in the press that the federal intelligence agency ... illegally spied on journalists in order to expose their sources , it is to be ascertained that such observations did take place ... these measures were predominantly illegal , " the 2006 report read . bnd agents picked through the journalists ' rubbish and traced their research , the report stated .
while none of the reporters was bugged , agents used other measures against them to try to uncover their sources , including stealing a box of his papers that one journalist had thrown away and tracing another 's research in the federal archive . as a result , germany 's ranking dropped on a ranking list of press freedom complied by the independent journalism advocacy group reporters without borders . dw staff -lrb- jen -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

she defended its merits , while pushing for its modernization . merkel said it was the joint task of politicians , businesses and unions to work together to make the economic model , which has a strong consensual aspect and seeks to carve a middle way between socialism and capitalism , fit to face the challenges of the future . her comments come against the background of the global financial crisis , a number of high-level corruption scandals in big german companies and a string of labor disputes .
there has been widespread media criticism of businesses , which have made job cuts or relocated their plants abroad to cut costs despite rising profits . speaking at the opening of the hanover industrial trade fair on sunday , april 19 , she praised the " cohesive power " of the social market economy , which many see as helping to bring about the country 's economic miracle after world war ii . managers urged to lead by example bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : german engineering firm siemens is one of the firms hit by corruption scandals juergen thumann , head of the bdi , the federation of german industries , said the behavior of business people also played a role in determining whether people would support this social model in the future . " people in positions of responsibility have to set a good example , " thumann said , adding that the federation had faith in the system , which he praised as a successful one . merkel also said germany should be prepared to change , to carry out reforms and to invest in order to continue to successfully compete in the global market . she expressed understanding for people who were worried about the impact of globalization , particularly in the light of the global financial crisis , but she said that she did not share these fears . " we can continue to profit from globalization , but it is up to us to determine to what extent , " the chancellor said . germany at less risk than other countries bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : green technology like this wind engine hub are being showcased at the hanover fair merkel also said despite the impact of the crisis of germany 's growth rates that the country had good prospects of being less hit by the credit crunch than other states .
however , she also said there was need to reform the german banking system and called for more transparency . thumann described economic developments in germany as " robust " with 1.7 million jobs being created since 2005 .
he said the government had helped improved the situation for businesses , but called for further reforms . almost 5,100 businesses from 62 countries are represented at the hanover fair , which runs through friday .
the main focus of the fair is on energy-saving and climate protection technology .

“ forced to be cruel ” will open on june 2 , 2008 , at 4 p.m. at the world conference center in bonn and features 80 emotionally-charged photos .
this is the first time that this selection of photos will be on display , with other shows in new york and tokyo following this fall .
the participating , internationally-renown photographers include : lynsey addario , who documented child soldiers in sudan , martin adler -lrb- columbia -rrb- , riccardo gangale , cedric gerbehaye , roger lemoyne -lrb- congo -rrb- , tim hetherington -lrb- liberia -rrb- , peter mantello -lrb- burma -rrb- , q. sakamaki -lrb- afghanistan -rrb- , dominic sansoni -lrb- sri lanka -rrb- and ami vitale -lrb- nepal -rrb- .

they are being recruited for regular armed forces and rebel groups and forced into combat .

according to the statute of the criminal court , those who send children under the age of 15 into combat can be charged as a war criminal .

" the -lrb- german -rrb- basic law applies even to those germans living abroad , and this was a clear breach of press freedom , " he told the tagesspiegel newspaper . the bnd has already been involved in " spying affairs " involving journalists in past years , and should have developed a stricter attitude about it , stadler told the paper . " the bnd has already apologized to ms. koelbl , " he said .
" that shows that even they see the case as problematic . " similar citations for bnd in 2006 germany saw a scandal involving the bnd spying on journalists back in 2006 .
at the time , a report emerged from the parliamentary committee acknowledging that intelligence agents had illegally spied on journalists to expose their sources . a 180-page parliamentary report released at the time showed that measures taken by the bnd against german reporters in an effort to shut off leaks violated the law . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : koelbl had contacts to high-ranking officials " regarding the accusations in the press that the federal intelligence agency ... illegally spied on journalists in order to expose their sources , it is to be ascertained that such observations did take place ... these measures were predominantly illegal , " the 2006 report read . bnd agents picked through the journalists ' rubbish and traced their research , the report stated .
while none of the reporters was bugged , agents used other measures against them to try to uncover their sources , including stealing a box of his papers that one journalist had thrown away and tracing another 's research in the federal archive . as a result , germany 's ranking dropped on a ranking list of press freedom complied by the independent journalism advocacy group reporters without borders . dw staff -lrb- jen -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

" we have to stand behind our decision , " steinmeier said , adding that western capitals have engaged in discussions with beijing for decades over the human rights abuses in china and the tibetan independence movement . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : steinmeier : " we have to stand behind our decision " steinmeier said he sees his job as being to deflate tensions between tibet and the chinese government , a conflict that has unleashed protests worldwide and especially in cities along the route of the olympic torch relay . steinmeier urges a broad view this job is made easier by the fact that china is eager to make the olympic games a success , steinmeier said . " we have to continue trying to convince the chinese , " he said .
" i 've been on the phone three times with the chinese foreign minister and urged him not to use force " when dealing with protesters . steinmeier said the near daily aggravation of the situation is " not acceptable , " but also called for western governments to remain aware of the sea-change taking place in chinese society . " in a very short time , the country has brought 300 million people from bitter poverty to a humble prosperity , " he said .
" great parts of the developing world look to china with interest and sympathy . " french president nicolas sarkozy appeared to be backpedaling on his hard line , as anti-french sentiment is mushrooming in beijing .
the chinese have begun boycotts of carrefour and held numerous demonstrations over the weekend outside the french retail giant 's stores in china . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : sarkozy is not eager to harm relations with china sarkozy , who previously has urged the chinese government to open talks with the dalai lama and has suggested he might boycott the olympic opening ceremonies in beijing on aug .

he will be carrying a message from sarkozy addressed to the chinese leadership . personal apology from le president in an effort to calm chinese anger over the protest-plagued progress of the olympic flame through france , sarkozy sent a note to disabled female athlete jin jing , who had tried to defend the flame during its run through paris . " i wish to tell you that i was shocked by the attacks you were subjected to on april 7 in paris , " sarkozy wrote .
the letter was delivered to her monday in shanghai by french senate president christian poncelet . " it is understandable that the chinese people were hurt , and i firmly condemn -lsb- those acts -rsb- , " the french president wrote . jin jing , a 27-year-old para-olympics fencer who lost her leg to cancer as a child , became a heroine in china after pictures were flashed around the world showing her protecting the torch from pro-tibetan demonstrators from her wheelchair . the torch was extinguished at least twice during its relay in paris , and the relay itself was cut short because of the numerous anti-chinese incidents along its route . counter-demonstrations in europe meanwhile , chinese in china and in europe have begun staging counter-demonstrations , protesting what they say is a misleading depiction of china in the media and biased media coverage of the torch relay . on saturday , april 19 , several thousand chinese rallied in paris , britain and berlin , supporting the beijing olympics . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the torch relay met protest in paris around 3,000 pro-chinese activists demonstrated in the central potsdamer platz area of berlin , gripping banners with messages like " media = untruths , " and " china olympia , one world , one dream . " on the same day in paris , nearly 4,000 chinese students and other expatriates gathered in the place de la republique , according to police estimates .
they wore t-shirts with the slogan " one china , one family , " and waved signs criticizing the western media . " we 're demonstrating against the disinformation in the french and western media , to promote the olympic games and to construct a bridge between the french and chinese people - and not a wall as the media do , " one of the rally 's spokesmen , thierry liu , told the afp news service . more than 1,000 people , mainly students , also gathered outside the bbc 's offices in manchester , north-west england , while around 300 staged a demonstration outside the houses of parliament in london . the european commission on monday said people were free to show their displeasure with the west 's reaction to demonstrations in tibet and media coverage of the run-up to the 2008 olympics .

however , eu officials warn that there is still a long road ahead for ankara . austrian foreign minister ursala plassnik pledged on monday , april 21 , to keep european union membership negotiations with turkey open , but stressed that austria 's position was that the result of the talks would not necessarily mean that turkey will join the union . speaking at a joint press conference in ankara with her turkish counterpart ali babacan , plassnik said it was important that accession talks continue and that the door is not shut on turkey but that the talks would not necessarily lead to full membership . " our goal is to have turkey as a stable modern dynamic , successful partner , as close a partner of the european union as is imaginable , " plassnik said .
" we are aware that for the turkish side , the one and only exclusive goal is membership in the european union .
i have been trying to enlarge the scope of imagination on that specific point ...
i could imagine a tailor-made turkey-european union community . " babacan repeated that turkey 's aim was full membership and refused to be drawn on alternatives .
he stressed that any decision on turkish membership would occur in the future and that continued people-to- people ties would result in public opinion in europe supporting turkish membership . " the membership decision will not be made on yesterday 's turkey or today 's turkey , but on the turkey of the future , " babacan said . turkey facing domestic tests as eu watches closely bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : turkey 's constitutional court is hearing the closure case on the issue of the potential closure by the turkish constitutional court of the ruling justice and development party -lrb- akp -rrb- for allegedly becoming a focus of anti-secular activities , a topic that has led to criticism from the european union of the turkish legal system , plassnik said the eu should not act as an international police officer .
it was up to turkey to debate the role of secularism in society . babacan refused to speculate on what might happen if his party is closed , saying that he believed turkey would find a solution . " this year our country will go through other tests but i believe our country will pass these tests , " he said . the two foreign ministers said they had agreed to enhance cooperation against terrorism with plassnik making it clear that austria considered the separatist kurdish workers ' party -lrb- pkk -rrb- a terrorist organization . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : austria 's foreign minister ursula plassnik " we are fighting against terrorism with the same determination as others , " plassnik said in response to a question that austria had last year allowed a senior pkk member to flee to iraq .
" i regret that in the turkish media there was a wrong impression concerning austria 's determination to fight terrorism , including the pkk . " turkish media condemned austria 's actions last year when it allegedly allowed riza altun , a senior pkk representative in europe , to escape to iraq despite the fact he was wanted by turkish authorities .
the actions of the austrian government in allowing altun to go free were also condemned by the turkish foreign ministry . rehn warns of akp closure case impact plassnik 's visit coincided with the publication of an interview given by the eu 's enlargement commissioner olli rehn in which he announced that the eu was planning to open two new chapters in turkey 's accession negotiations in june . however , he added that ankara was facing a more critical phase than at any time since its negotiations to join the european union began three years ago . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : rehn hopes turkey will emerge stronger from its trials rehn said in an interview with the german daily die welt that the closure case against the akp was adding extra pressure on ankara at a time when its progress on necessary reforms was also faltering . rehn predicted turkey could emerge with its democratic institutions strengthened once the closure case was resolved , provided that all sides showed willingness to compromise and the necessary reforms were pushed through . delays on both sides hinders turkey 's progress rehn said he also expected turkey to become a member of eu within 10 to 15 years should it continue reforms decisively , according to a separate report from turkey 's anatolian news agency . " we expect freedom of expression for all , " rehn said .
" we expect that the rights of women and minorities are protected . " the eu has been particularly critical of strict laws governing the offence of " insulting turkishness , " under which writers have been prosecuted in the past . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : journalists like ocak isik yurtcu have been jailed in turkey in addition to turkey sticking to its reform course , the enlargement commissioner added that the eu should also play its part by standing by its commitments on turkish accession .
regarding slow progress on the accession process , which began in 2005 , rehn said six of 35 policy chapters in the process had been opened and a further two - business law and intellectual property - would be opened in june . the eu suspended negotiations in eight chapters because of turkey 's refusal to open its ports to greek cypriot vessels . further chapters , including energy , would be opened under the french eu presidency in the second half of the year , rehn said . turkey angered by talk of privileged partnership the french eu presidency may prove to be another critical phase for turkey 's hopes . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : merkel and sarkozy both advocate privileged partnership french president nicolas sarkozy , together with german chancellor angela merkel , has suggested turkey should accept a privileged partnership with the eu and not full eu membership . this stance has angered prime minister tayyip erdogan who has said that his country would settle for nothing less than full membership of the european union . " turkey can not accept any alternative which is going to rule out full membership of the eu , " erdogan said earlier this month .
" an enlargement that is going to embrace turkey is not going to undermine the eu , is not going to weaken the eu . " at the nato summit in bucharest this month , sarkozy attempted conciliation by telling turkish president abdullah gul that france did not oppose the opening of negotiations chapters with turkey and that there would be special attention paid to the negotiations during the french eu presidency to strengthen turkey 's integration into the eu . dw staff / dpa -lrb- nda -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

" our goal is to have turkey as a stable modern dynamic , successful partner , as close a partner of the european union as is imaginable , " plassnik said .
" we are aware that for the turkish side , the one and only exclusive goal is membership in the european union .
i have been trying to enlarge the scope of imagination on that specific point ...
i could imagine a tailor-made turkey-european union community . " babacan repeated that turkey 's aim was full membership and refused to be drawn on alternatives .
he stressed that any decision on turkish membership would occur in the future and that continued people-to- people ties would result in public opinion in europe supporting turkish membership . " the membership decision will not be made on yesterday 's turkey or today 's turkey , but on the turkey of the future , " babacan said . turkey facing domestic tests as eu watches closely bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : turkey 's constitutional court is hearing the closure case on the issue of the potential closure by the turkish constitutional court of the ruling justice and development party -lrb- akp -rrb- for allegedly becoming a focus of anti-secular activities , a topic that has led to criticism from the european union of the turkish legal system , plassnik said the eu should not act as an international police officer .
it was up to turkey to debate the role of secularism in society . babacan refused to speculate on what might happen if his party is closed , saying that he believed turkey would find a solution . " this year our country will go through other tests but i believe our country will pass these tests , " he said . the two foreign ministers said they had agreed to enhance cooperation against terrorism with plassnik making it clear that austria considered the separatist kurdish workers ' party -lrb- pkk -rrb- a terrorist organization . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : austria 's foreign minister ursula plassnik " we are fighting against terrorism with the same determination as others , " plassnik said in response to a question that austria had last year allowed a senior pkk member to flee to iraq .
" i regret that in the turkish media there was a wrong impression concerning austria 's determination to fight terrorism , including the pkk . " turkish media condemned austria 's actions last year when it allegedly allowed riza altun , a senior pkk representative in europe , to escape to iraq despite the fact he was wanted by turkish authorities .
the actions of the austrian government in allowing altun to go free were also condemned by the turkish foreign ministry . rehn warns of akp closure case impact plassnik 's visit coincided with the publication of an interview given by the eu 's enlargement commissioner olli rehn in which he announced that the eu was planning to open two new chapters in turkey 's accession negotiations in june . however , he added that ankara was facing a more critical phase than at any time since its negotiations to join the european union began three years ago . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : rehn hopes turkey will emerge stronger from its trials rehn said in an interview with the german daily die welt that the closure case against the akp was adding extra pressure on ankara at a time when its progress on necessary reforms was also faltering . rehn predicted turkey could emerge with its democratic institutions strengthened once the closure case was resolved , provided that all sides showed willingness to compromise and the necessary reforms were pushed through . delays on both sides hinders turkey 's progress rehn said he also expected turkey to become a member of eu within 10 to 15 years should it continue reforms decisively , according to a separate report from turkey 's anatolian news agency . " we expect freedom of expression for all , " rehn said .
" we expect that the rights of women and minorities are protected . " the eu has been particularly critical of strict laws governing the offence of " insulting turkishness , " under which writers have been prosecuted in the past . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : journalists like ocak isik yurtcu have been jailed in turkey in addition to turkey sticking to its reform course , the enlargement commissioner added that the eu should also play its part by standing by its commitments on turkish accession .
regarding slow progress on the accession process , which began in 2005 , rehn said six of 35 policy chapters in the process had been opened and a further two - business law and intellectual property - would be opened in june . the eu suspended negotiations in eight chapters because of turkey 's refusal to open its ports to greek cypriot vessels . further chapters , including energy , would be opened under the french eu presidency in the second half of the year , rehn said . turkey angered by talk of privileged partnership the french eu presidency may prove to be another critical phase for turkey 's hopes . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : merkel and sarkozy both advocate privileged partnership french president nicolas sarkozy , together with german chancellor angela merkel , has suggested turkey should accept a privileged partnership with the eu and not full eu membership . this stance has angered prime minister tayyip erdogan who has said that his country would settle for nothing less than full membership of the european union . " turkey can not accept any alternative which is going to rule out full membership of the eu , " erdogan said earlier this month .
" an enlargement that is going to embrace turkey is not going to undermine the eu , is not going to weaken the eu . " at the nato summit in bucharest this month , sarkozy attempted conciliation by telling turkish president abdullah gul that france did not oppose the opening of negotiations chapters with turkey and that there would be special attention paid to the negotiations during the french eu presidency to strengthen turkey 's integration into the eu . dw staff / dpa -lrb- nda -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

germany 's foreign intelligence service acknowledged , and apologized for , having spied on a german journalist .
it 's not the first time german agents have been caught keeping tabs on reporters . the federal intelligence agency -lrb- bnd -rrb- , read e-mail correspondence that susanne koelbl , an editor at the german newsweekly der spiegel , had exchanged with an afghani politician between june and november , 2006 , according to a report that broke in spiegel in the edition of the magazine published monday , april 21 . bnd chief ernst uhrlau informed koelbl of its actions on friday and apologized at the same time .

the committee is responsible for monitoring the bnd . acting chairman of the parliamentary control committee , max stadler , has demanded an explanation . " the -lrb- german -rrb- basic law applies even to those germans living abroad , and this was a clear breach of press freedom , " he told the tagesspiegel newspaper . the bnd has already been involved in " spying affairs " involving journalists in past years , and should have developed a stricter attitude about it , stadler told the paper . " the bnd has already apologized to ms. koelbl , " he said .
" that shows that even they see the case as problematic . " similar citations for bnd in 2006 germany saw a scandal involving the bnd spying on journalists back in 2006 .
at the time , a report emerged from the parliamentary committee acknowledging that intelligence agents had illegally spied on journalists to expose their sources . a 180-page parliamentary report released at the time showed that measures taken by the bnd against german reporters in an effort to shut off leaks violated the law . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : koelbl had contacts to high-ranking officials " regarding the accusations in the press that the federal intelligence agency ... illegally spied on journalists in order to expose their sources , it is to be ascertained that such observations did take place ... these measures were predominantly illegal , " the 2006 report read . bnd agents picked through the journalists ' rubbish and traced their research , the report stated .
while none of the reporters was bugged , agents used other measures against them to try to uncover their sources , including stealing a box of his papers that one journalist had thrown away and tracing another 's research in the federal archive . as a result , germany 's ranking dropped on a ranking list of press freedom complied by the independent journalism advocacy group reporters without borders . dw staff -lrb- jen -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

not all reader comments have been published .
dw-world.de reserves the right to edit for length and appropriateness of content . if the slovenian presidency of the eu bends to chinese political pressure , then democracy has been struck a deadly blow .
the decision to invite the tibetan head of state , his holiness the dalai lama , must be made with openness in mind , not political pressures .
so in effect china has used its political power to again snuff out democracy and that is a crying shame . what i suspect here is that slovenia has some links with china , but be they political or trade they must not interfere with the practice of open democracy in europe .
so slovenia must know why it used its eu presidency as a means to further its own position with china .
the eu must make clear to slovenia that it is not a forum of deceit .
case closed . - kenneth v. tellis , canada bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : one reader recommended sanctions on chinese products yes , as europeans believing in human rights there should be sanctions against china .
as producers ourselves , there should be sanctions against china .
many western goods are counterfeit and made in china but sold illegally in europe regardless of copyright and patent ; many products that are taken in the mouth -lrb- toothpaste , etc , -rrb- have been found to contain unfit ingredients ; many well-known toy brands that we buy for our children that are made in china have toxic ingredients , and many people , such as prisoners , are forced to work as slaves to create the great chinese economic progress . but the big multi-nationals have made sure we do n't have much choice in buying products that are not made in china .
they made sure they closed down their european factories and opened them up in china where life and labor is cheap and their greed insures they get the best profit .
anyone know where you can still buy toys that are not made in china ?
i will be your first customer . - kaye poole , britain so far , the british and germans are not the focus .
china likes to target the betrayer and the frontier , namely france and the us .
and so far the wasp has succeeded in uniting the catholics , and showing the chinese that the frenchmen are nothing better .
let 's see the reaction of the germans , and see how the anglo can work with the saxons as it unfolds .
china 's dream has definitely been interrupted .
rem period is gone - a step closer to be awakened .
remember what napoleon said about a sleeping lion ? - berg mcfly , china it is unfortunate that china can browbeat the european union on the basis of the economic leverage it enjoys today vis-a-vis europe .
that the eu chooses to remain a mute spectator on the tibet crackdown and refrain from officially recognizing the dalai lama amounts to lending credibility to the religious persecution of christians sponsored by the atheist regime in beijing . do we assume that the rich european tradition of promoting democratic values and peaceful coexistence is fading day by day ?
how else can the european union presidency ignore the reality of 46 christians being arrested for holding a bible class and worshiping in a private home without government permission ?
perhaps it is time that the european citizens decide whether or not to support a tyrannical regime that does not even believe in granting the christians , muslims and tibetan buddhist minorities the right and freedom to quietly express their faith . - seema sengupta , india i think the eu should send a large fact-finding mission to tibet to see the real situation without chinese officials and spies with them then to decide it .
tibetans should have freedom to use their own language and live according to their own style .
tibet has its own language , culture and customs .
chinese leaders in tibet do n't know them and ca n't even speak tibetan . - tsering , china compiled by dw staff -lrb- kjb -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?
dw-world.de eu presidency will not invite dalai lama to brussels the eu 's slovenian presidency said that it would not invite the dalai lama to brussels to meet with the bloc 's foreign ministers , as paris has proposed , but would not rule out other contacts with the tibetan leader .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de turkey -pipe- 21.04.2008 eu plans new accession negotiations with turkey at critical time großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : turkey is facing domestic trials at a time when the eu is looking for progress on reforms turkey , facing the most critical phase of its eu accession negotiations , has been told that two new policy chapters will be opened in june .
however , eu officials warn that there is still a long road ahead for ankara . austrian foreign minister ursala plassnik pledged on monday , april 21 , to keep european union membership negotiations with turkey open , but stressed that austria 's position was that the result of the talks would not necessarily mean that turkey will join the union . speaking at a joint press conference in ankara with her turkish counterpart ali babacan , plassnik said it was important that accession talks continue and that the door is not shut on turkey but that the talks would not necessarily lead to full membership . " our goal is to have turkey as a stable modern dynamic , successful partner , as close a partner of the european union as is imaginable , " plassnik said .
" we are aware that for the turkish side , the one and only exclusive goal is membership in the european union .
i have been trying to enlarge the scope of imagination on that specific point ...
i could imagine a tailor-made turkey-european union community . " babacan repeated that turkey 's aim was full membership and refused to be drawn on alternatives .
he stressed that any decision on turkish membership would occur in the future and that continued people-to- people ties would result in public opinion in europe supporting turkish membership . " the membership decision will not be made on yesterday 's turkey or today 's turkey , but on the turkey of the future , " babacan said . turkey facing domestic tests as eu watches closely bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : turkey 's constitutional court is hearing the closure case on the issue of the potential closure by the turkish constitutional court of the ruling justice and development party -lrb- akp -rrb- for allegedly becoming a focus of anti-secular activities , a topic that has led to criticism from the european union of the turkish legal system , plassnik said the eu should not act as an international police officer .
it was up to turkey to debate the role of secularism in society . babacan refused to speculate on what might happen if his party is closed , saying that he believed turkey would find a solution . " this year our country will go through other tests but i believe our country will pass these tests , " he said . the two foreign ministers said they had agreed to enhance cooperation against terrorism with plassnik making it clear that austria considered the separatist kurdish workers ' party -lrb- pkk -rrb- a terrorist organization . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : austria 's foreign minister ursula plassnik " we are fighting against terrorism with the same determination as others , " plassnik said in response to a question that austria had last year allowed a senior pkk member to flee to iraq .
" i regret that in the turkish media there was a wrong impression concerning austria 's determination to fight terrorism , including the pkk . " turkish media condemned austria 's actions last year when it allegedly allowed riza altun , a senior pkk representative in europe , to escape to iraq despite the fact he was wanted by turkish authorities .
the actions of the austrian government in allowing altun to go free were also condemned by the turkish foreign ministry . rehn warns of akp closure case impact plassnik 's visit coincided with the publication of an interview given by the eu 's enlargement commissioner olli rehn in which he announced that the eu was planning to open two new chapters in turkey 's accession negotiations in june . however , he added that ankara was facing a more critical phase than at any time since its negotiations to join the european union began three years ago . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : rehn hopes turkey will emerge stronger from its trials rehn said in an interview with the german daily die welt that the closure case against the akp was adding extra pressure on ankara at a time when its progress on necessary reforms was also faltering . rehn predicted turkey could emerge with its democratic institutions strengthened once the closure case was resolved , provided that all sides showed willingness to compromise and the necessary reforms were pushed through . delays on both sides hinders turkey 's progress rehn said he also expected turkey to become a member of eu within 10 to 15 years should it continue reforms decisively , according to a separate report from turkey 's anatolian news agency . " we expect freedom of expression for all , " rehn said .
" we expect that the rights of women and minorities are protected . " the eu has been particularly critical of strict laws governing the offence of " insulting turkishness , " under which writers have been prosecuted in the past . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : journalists like ocak isik yurtcu have been jailed in turkey in addition to turkey sticking to its reform course , the enlargement commissioner added that the eu should also play its part by standing by its commitments on turkish accession .
regarding slow progress on the accession process , which began in 2005 , rehn said six of 35 policy chapters in the process had been opened and a further two - business law and intellectual property - would be opened in june . the eu suspended negotiations in eight chapters because of turkey 's refusal to open its ports to greek cypriot vessels . further chapters , including energy , would be opened under the french eu presidency in the second half of the year , rehn said . turkey angered by talk of privileged partnership the french eu presidency may prove to be another critical phase for turkey 's hopes . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : merkel and sarkozy both advocate privileged partnership french president nicolas sarkozy , together with german chancellor angela merkel , has suggested turkey should accept a privileged partnership with the eu and not full eu membership . this stance has angered prime minister tayyip erdogan who has said that his country would settle for nothing less than full membership of the european union . " turkey can not accept any alternative which is going to rule out full membership of the eu , " erdogan said earlier this month .
" an enlargement that is going to embrace turkey is not going to undermine the eu , is not going to weaken the eu . " at the nato summit in bucharest this month , sarkozy attempted conciliation by telling turkish president abdullah gul that france did not oppose the opening of negotiations chapters with turkey and that there would be special attention paid to the negotiations during the french eu presidency to strengthen turkey 's integration into the eu . dw staff / dpa -lrb- nda -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

not all reader comments have been published .
dw-world.de reserves the right to edit for length and appropriateness of content . if the slovenian presidency of the eu bends to chinese political pressure , then democracy has been struck a deadly blow .
the decision to invite the tibetan head of state , his holiness the dalai lama , must be made with openness in mind , not political pressures .
so in effect china has used its political power to again snuff out democracy and that is a crying shame . what i suspect here is that slovenia has some links with china , but be they political or trade they must not interfere with the practice of open democracy in europe .
so slovenia must know why it used its eu presidency as a means to further its own position with china .
the eu must make clear to slovenia that it is not a forum of deceit .

" we have to stand behind our decision , " steinmeier said , adding that western capitals have engaged in discussions with beijing for decades over the human rights abuses in china and the tibetan independence movement . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : steinmeier : " we have to stand behind our decision " steinmeier said he sees his job as being to deflate tensions between tibet and the chinese government , a conflict that has unleashed protests worldwide and especially in cities along the route of the olympic torch relay . steinmeier urges a broad view this job is made easier by the fact that china is eager to make the olympic games a success , steinmeier said . " we have to continue trying to convince the chinese , " he said .
" i 've been on the phone three times with the chinese foreign minister and urged him not to use force " when dealing with protesters . steinmeier said the near daily aggravation of the situation is " not acceptable , " but also called for western governments to remain aware of the sea-change taking place in chinese society . " in a very short time , the country has brought 300 million people from bitter poverty to a humble prosperity , " he said .
" great parts of the developing world look to china with interest and sympathy . " french president nicolas sarkozy appeared to be backpedaling on his hard line , as anti-french sentiment is mushrooming in beijing .

he will be carrying a message from sarkozy addressed to the chinese leadership . personal apology from le president in an effort to calm chinese anger over the protest-plagued progress of the olympic flame through france , sarkozy sent a note to disabled female athlete jin jing , who had tried to defend the flame during its run through paris . " i wish to tell you that i was shocked by the attacks you were subjected to on april 7 in paris , " sarkozy wrote .
the letter was delivered to her monday in shanghai by french senate president christian poncelet . " it is understandable that the chinese people were hurt , and i firmly condemn -lsb- those acts -rsb- , " the french president wrote . jin jing , a 27-year-old para-olympics fencer who lost her leg to cancer as a child , became a heroine in china after pictures were flashed around the world showing her protecting the torch from pro-tibetan demonstrators from her wheelchair . the torch was extinguished at least twice during its relay in paris , and the relay itself was cut short because of the numerous anti-chinese incidents along its route . counter-demonstrations in europe meanwhile , chinese in china and in europe have begun staging counter-demonstrations , protesting what they say is a misleading depiction of china in the media and biased media coverage of the torch relay . on saturday , april 19 , several thousand chinese rallied in paris , britain and berlin , supporting the beijing olympics . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the torch relay met protest in paris around 3,000 pro-chinese activists demonstrated in the central potsdamer platz area of berlin , gripping banners with messages like " media = untruths , " and " china olympia , one world , one dream .

germany 's foreign intelligence service acknowledged , and apologized for , having spied on a german journalist .
it 's not the first time german agents have been caught keeping tabs on reporters . the federal intelligence agency -lrb- bnd -rrb- , read e-mail correspondence that susanne koelbl , an editor at the german newsweekly der spiegel , had exchanged with an afghani politician between june and november , 2006 , according to a report that broke in spiegel in the edition of the magazine published monday , april 21 . bnd chief ernst uhrlau informed koelbl of its actions on friday and apologized at the same time .

" the -lrb- german -rrb- basic law applies even to those germans living abroad , and this was a clear breach of press freedom , " he told the tagesspiegel newspaper . the bnd has already been involved in " spying affairs " involving journalists in past years , and should have developed a stricter attitude about it , stadler told the paper . " the bnd has already apologized to ms. koelbl , " he said .
" that shows that even they see the case as problematic . " similar citations for bnd in 2006 germany saw a scandal involving the bnd spying on journalists back in 2006 .
at the time , a report emerged from the parliamentary committee acknowledging that intelligence agents had illegally spied on journalists to expose their sources . a 180-page parliamentary report released at the time showed that measures taken by the bnd against german reporters in an effort to shut off leaks violated the law . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : koelbl had contacts to high-ranking officials " regarding the accusations in the press that the federal intelligence agency ... illegally spied on journalists in order to expose their sources , it is to be ascertained that such observations did take place ... these measures were predominantly illegal , " the 2006 report read . bnd agents picked through the journalists ' rubbish and traced their research , the report stated .
while none of the reporters was bugged , agents used other measures against them to try to uncover their sources , including stealing a box of his papers that one journalist had thrown away and tracing another 's research in the federal archive . as a result , germany 's ranking dropped on a ranking list of press freedom complied by the independent journalism advocacy group reporters without borders . dw staff -lrb- jen -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

" i can tell you on behalf of the european union - all the countries of the european union - that we will continue to be working with the government , working with the people of afghanistan for the long haul , " solana said after meeting with afghan president hamid karzai and other senior ministry officials in the fortified presidential palace in kabul on monday , april 21 .
" we , the people in europe , will continue to be helping the people of afghanistan to get what they deserve , the stability , prosperity and peace , " he added .
a renewed commitment bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : solana praised the on-going efforts in afghanistan solana jetted into the capital for a day-long trip which , he said in remarks published in a kabul daily monday , came at an important time of " renewed commitment by the international community " to struggling afghanistan .
following his arrival , solana paid a visit to the headquarters of the eu police mission in afghanistan -lrb- eupol -rrb- and met with police officials .
since june of last year , some 230 eupol officials have been training the upper echelons of the afghan security forces .
eupol is also assisting other western training missions and is now spreading its operations to cover the whole country .
solana praised the progress that afghanistan has made in the past several years since the fall of the taliban , saying " tremendous efforts have been done in education .
the tremendous effort ... done in health is something that we take into great consideration . "
europe is the second largest contributor after the united states to military and development efforts in afghanistan since the 2001 fall of the extremist taliban regime , and president karzai praised the european union as " among the best supporters of afghanistan . "
high hopes for paris donors ' conference bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : karzai thanked the eu and hoped for continued help during their discussions , solana and karzai discussed a number of other issues including security , governance , and rule of law in afghanistan , as well as the international preparation for the afghan donors ' conference in paris in june .
" this is the moment to reflect on what we , the international community , can do , working in conjunction with our afghan partners , to enhance our efforts , " he said of the up-coming conference .
afghanistan is hoping the donors ' meeting in paris will secure $ 50 billion -lrb- 30 billion euros -rrb- in aid to implement a five-year development plan , finance minister anwar-ul haq ahadi said monday .
the plan , called the national development strategy -lrb- ands -rrb- , was presented to donors at an " aid effectiveness " conference in kabul at the same time as solana 's meeting .
based on a year of wide-ranging consultations , it will be assessed by the world bank and international monetary fund , ahadi told reporters after the meeting .
the finalized strategy would become the basis of requests from donors at the june conference , he said .
" for this strategy , the afghan government has asked the world for $ 50 billion in aid for five years , " he said .
the ands was a comprehensive plan , the minister said .
" all walks of government are included : security , good governance , financial growth , important issues such as counter-narcotics , capacity building and equal rights of women ... "
afghan solutions for afghan problems bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the rebuilding and enforcement of security goes on the plan underlines europe 's commitment to restoring afghanistan 's infrastructure and the return of the power to the people .
in written comments for the daily outlook afghanistan newspaper , solana said it was " important that afghan solutions are found to afghan problems . "
and success would involve more than a military effort to eliminate extremists , whose ranks are said to be reinforced , trained and equipped by militant camps in neighboring pakistan .
" the approach must be global and joined up , encompassing the rule of law , development , reconstruction , economic growth , rural development and education , " solana said .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de history -pipe- 21.04.2008 biographer unveils man behind the red baron myth großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : with his fokker plane , baron von richthofen was molded into a war hero world war one fighter pilot manfred von richthofen - a.k.a. the red baron - died in combat 90 years ago , on april 21 , 1918 .
dw-world.de spoke to von richthofen biographer joachim castan about the man behind the myth . the prussian nobleman - dubbed the red baron because of the color of his aircraft - shot down some 80 allied planes before his death at the age of 25 .
his life has become the stuff of legend .
a new film about the red baron , which opened in germany this month , also revives the heroic image .
joachim castan , 41 , was the first historian to write a biography of this famous figure .
the biographer and documentary filmmaker spent three years researching the project , gaining exclusive access to previously unpublished writings and letters .
the book , called " die ganze geschichte " -lrb- the whole story -rrb- and published in 2007 , reveals a far more complex character .
dw-world.de : did your image of von richthofen change in the course of your research ?
joachim castan : i must admit that i had an image of von richthofen before i started my research of him as the last true gentleman of the skies in a dehumanized , industrialized brutal war , heroically participating in airborne duels .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : castan 's preconceptions were overturned while working on the book as i became immersed in the material , i realized that there was a well-maintained von richthofen myth .
the myth propagates the idea that von richthofen forced pilots to land .
he shot down aircraft , but he ensured , if at all possible , that the pilot survived , so that the whole encounter took on the character of a sporting match to determine the better pilot and marksman .
this turned out to be an image created by the german propaganda machine in 1917 .
it needed a young , good-looking radiant hero , a victor who could be served up to a relatively demoralized society . this image of the lonely gentleman of the skies was then taken up in the 1920s and further elaborated upon by the americans , who wanted to sell a romantic notion of air combat .
and who was the man you discovered ?
he was completely different .
without doubt , he was extremely courageous and extremely ambitious , but he was also cold-blooded .
his goal was to shoot down as many aircraft as possible .
in his own writings , he writes quite openly : " i never get into an aircraft for fun .
i aim first for the head of the pilot , or rather at the head of the observer , if there was one . "
i do n't think that von richthofen would have described himself as a hero .
he was doing his duty to defend his fatherland .
at the same time , he was satisfying his passion for hunting .
he was already a passionate hunter at the age of 11 and was taken hunting by his father .
aim , shoot , destroy target - he took his passion for hunting to the skies , transposing it one-to-one .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : von richthofen around 1917 i also do not think he was a brutal killer .
von richthofen also reflected partially upon what he did .
he wrote that he always felt terrible when he came off duty .
he used to come home and lock himself in his room for hours and refuse to talk to anyone .
from mid-1917 he also realized that the war was probably going to be lost .
for me he is a tragic figure , fighting fanatically , remorselessly , in a war that is lost .
what made him into the kind of person he was ?
his mother was extraordinarily ambitious and did n't think much of her husband .
he retired early and did not have a very successful career as an officer .
all of the family 's ambitions were invested first in the eldest son , manfred , and then in the second son , lothar , who was also a fighter pilot .
the young manfred was sent at the age of 11 to a prussian cadet school , which were pretty infamous .
the children were honed into soldiers and there was no scope for any ifs , ands or buts .
the intellectual aspect of schooling was largely neglected .
the children had to function as soldiers first and foremost .
it 's interesting : if you look at von richthofen 's personal development , it showed that , first of all , he functioned in this way .
then a year before his death , he started to come to his senses and think about his actions .
i think he gradually realized that he had arrived at a dead end .
you say that the red baron myth was created in 1917 .
it served then as propaganda intended to boost morale .
but why is it now being revived ?
what is the reason for the current interest in this figure ?
in germany currently , we are thinking about war , heroes , and war heroes , we are rethinking our position .
deployment in a war in afghanistan would have been unthinkable in germany 10 years ago .
at the same time , we are thinking about reintroducing medals to reward bravery .
for germany , that is a very unusual situation because of our history , the third reich and the hitler dictatorship .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : matthias schweighoefer plays the red baron in the new film in other countries , in france , britain and the united states , hero cults exist .
in germany , they ceased to exist after 1945 .
i believe that there is a certain tendency toward reintroducing heroes , to hold them up as examples , as military models and to make military conflict socially acceptable again .
what do you think about the portrayal of von richthofen in nikolai muellerschoen 's new film , " the red baron ? "
the film revives the richthofen myth in parts .
it turns him into a radiant figure , someone who becomes a good person / pacifist through his love for a nurse .
it is a way of seeing von richthofen that is popular at the moment - as a sort of broken hero who is relatively blameless in some respects .
there are those responsible for conducting the war , who are evil , and the good hero .
this is a distinction that people like to make at the moment . interview : julie gregson send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

not all reader comments have been published .
dw-world.de reserves the right to edit for length and appropriateness of content . if the slovenian presidency of the eu bends to chinese political pressure , then democracy has been struck a deadly blow .
the decision to invite the tibetan head of state , his holiness the dalai lama , must be made with openness in mind , not political pressures .
so in effect china has used its political power to again snuff out democracy and that is a crying shame . what i suspect here is that slovenia has some links with china , but be they political or trade they must not interfere with the practice of open democracy in europe .
so slovenia must know why it used its eu presidency as a means to further its own position with china .
the eu must make clear to slovenia that it is not a forum of deceit .
case closed . - kenneth v. tellis , canada bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : one reader recommended sanctions on chinese products yes , as europeans believing in human rights there should be sanctions against china .
as producers ourselves , there should be sanctions against china .
many western goods are counterfeit and made in china but sold illegally in europe regardless of copyright and patent ; many products that are taken in the mouth -lrb- toothpaste , etc , -rrb- have been found to contain unfit ingredients ; many well-known toy brands that we buy for our children that are made in china have toxic ingredients , and many people , such as prisoners , are forced to work as slaves to create the great chinese economic progress . but the big multi-nationals have made sure we do n't have much choice in buying products that are not made in china .
they made sure they closed down their european factories and opened them up in china where life and labor is cheap and their greed insures they get the best profit .
anyone know where you can still buy toys that are not made in china ?
i will be your first customer . - kaye poole , britain so far , the british and germans are not the focus .
china likes to target the betrayer and the frontier , namely france and the us .
and so far the wasp has succeeded in uniting the catholics , and showing the chinese that the frenchmen are nothing better .
let 's see the reaction of the germans , and see how the anglo can work with the saxons as it unfolds .
china 's dream has definitely been interrupted .
rem period is gone - a step closer to be awakened .
remember what napoleon said about a sleeping lion ? - berg mcfly , china it is unfortunate that china can browbeat the european union on the basis of the economic leverage it enjoys today vis-a-vis europe .
that the eu chooses to remain a mute spectator on the tibet crackdown and refrain from officially recognizing the dalai lama amounts to lending credibility to the religious persecution of christians sponsored by the atheist regime in beijing . do we assume that the rich european tradition of promoting democratic values and peaceful coexistence is fading day by day ?
how else can the european union presidency ignore the reality of 46 christians being arrested for holding a bible class and worshiping in a private home without government permission ?
perhaps it is time that the european citizens decide whether or not to support a tyrannical regime that does not even believe in granting the christians , muslims and tibetan buddhist minorities the right and freedom to quietly express their faith . - seema sengupta , india i think the eu should send a large fact-finding mission to tibet to see the real situation without chinese officials and spies with them then to decide it .
tibetans should have freedom to use their own language and live according to their own style .
tibet has its own language , culture and customs .
chinese leaders in tibet do n't know them and ca n't even speak tibetan . - tsering , china compiled by dw staff -lrb- kjb -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?
dw-world.de eu presidency will not invite dalai lama to brussels the eu 's slovenian presidency said that it would not invite the dalai lama to brussels to meet with the bloc 's foreign ministers , as paris has proposed , but would not rule out other contacts with the tibetan leader .
-lrb- 19.04.2008 -rrb- economic sanctions wrong way to deal with china , experts say beijing 's reaction to the protests in tibet has prompted germans to call for a boycott of the olympics and economic sanctions .

" we have to stand behind our decision , " steinmeier said , adding that western capitals have engaged in discussions with beijing for decades over the human rights abuses in china and the tibetan independence movement . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : steinmeier : " we have to stand behind our decision " steinmeier said he sees his job as being to deflate tensions between tibet and the chinese government , a conflict that has unleashed protests worldwide and especially in cities along the route of the olympic torch relay . steinmeier urges a broad view this job is made easier by the fact that china is eager to make the olympic games a success , steinmeier said . " we have to continue trying to convince the chinese , " he said .
" i 've been on the phone three times with the chinese foreign minister and urged him not to use force " when dealing with protesters . steinmeier said the near daily aggravation of the situation is " not acceptable , " but also called for western governments to remain aware of the sea-change taking place in chinese society . " in a very short time , the country has brought 300 million people from bitter poverty to a humble prosperity , " he said .

the letter was delivered to her monday in shanghai by french senate president christian poncelet . " it is understandable that the chinese people were hurt , and i firmly condemn -lsb- those acts -rsb- , " the french president wrote . jin jing , a 27-year-old para-olympics fencer who lost her leg to cancer as a child , became a heroine in china after pictures were flashed around the world showing her protecting the torch from pro-tibetan demonstrators from her wheelchair . the torch was extinguished at least twice during its relay in paris , and the relay itself was cut short because of the numerous anti-chinese incidents along its route . counter-demonstrations in europe meanwhile , chinese in china and in europe have begun staging counter-demonstrations , protesting what they say is a misleading depiction of china in the media and biased media coverage of the torch relay . on saturday , april 19 , several thousand chinese rallied in paris , britain and berlin , supporting the beijing olympics . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the torch relay met protest in paris around 3,000 pro-chinese activists demonstrated in the central potsdamer platz area of berlin , gripping banners with messages like " media = untruths , " and " china olympia , one world , one dream .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de finance -pipe- 21.04.2008 eu surveys bank of england 's cash injection plan with caution großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : bank of england governor mervyn king hopes to inspire confidence in the economy the bank of england 's plan to free up britain 's home loan market by injecting 50 billion pounds into the banking sector to ease the mortgage squeeze has come under scrutiny from the eu . the bank 's 50-billion-pound -lrb- 62.3 billion euros , $ 100 billion -rrb- plan is being studied by the eu as to whether it constitutes state aid , a european commission spokesman said monday , april 21 .
" we are in touch with the uk authorities concerning this scheme and it is far too early to start speculating about whether it is state aid or not , " said jonathan todd , spokesman for the eu 's top competition regulator .
the bank of england 's plan is designed to allow high street banks to swap mortgage-backed securities for government bonds to try to boost liquidity at a time when banks are hesitant to lend to each other .
the intervention followed a meeting of britain 's top bankers with prime minister gordon brown last week , at which the emergency measures were discussed .
" we will make sure that there is enough liquidity in the economy so that we can continue to lend money for businesses and lend money for people to buy their own houses , " brown later said .
a statement from the bank of england 's said that the scheme aimed to improve the liquidity position of the banking system and increase confidence in financial markets , which have been hit by the shockwave emanating from the us economic slowdown and the subsequent global financial turbulence .
the plan is also designed to tackle an estimated overhang of 35 billion pounds of debt in the 1.2 trillion pounds uk mortgage market that banks would have repackaged and sold on , had the credit crisis not hit .
" financial markets are not working normally , which if left unchecked will have an impact on the wider economy .
across the world , there is a lack of confidence in assets created from packages of bank loans , most notably mortgage-backed securities , " the bank of england statement said .
cash injection could increase with demand the initial amount of 50 billion pounds could increase depending on the amount other banks need to get lending going again and how much they 're willing to provide in costly collateral .
" there is no arbitrary limit on it , " bank of england governor mervyn king told reporters when asked about the cash injection .
" it 's not part of this scheme to take us back to the excessive lending of a year or more ago , " king added .
" it 's to return the banking system back to a state of normality . "
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the us subprime crisis led to uk lenders tightening their belts britain 's main home loan providers are rapidly tightening their lending criteria as fears persist over the sector 's exposure to the collapsed subprime or high-risk housing market in the united states .
central banks around the world have been taking a variety of actions to get the frozen markets moving .
the bank of england 's plan is one of the biggest moves yet by a major central bank to combat the global credit crunch .
the us federal reserve last month unveiled a $ 200 billion scheme to help its own mortgage markets .
the bank of england 's plan was revealed at the same time as reports claiming the royal bank of scotland was seeking some 10 billion pounds in a new rights issue to shareholders this week .
the bank , britain 's second-largest , is also expected to reveal further write-downs , probably in the region of 5 billion pounds .
no quick fix , say analysts despite the positive noises being made by the banks in regard to the bank of england 's plan , analysts are less convinced that it would be enough to revive a flagging economy .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the bank of england plan will not fix the financial crisis " it will have a positive impact on the money market but it 's unlikely that it will have any meaningful impact on unlocking mortgage markets , " one economist told reuters .
" this is not going to undo the harm that 's already been done to the economy , " said another .
" it might just stop things getting any worse . "
the international monetary fund -lrb- imf -rrb- took a different view .
according to michael deppler , director of the imf 's european department , the global credit crisis and persistent gloom over the us economy is continuing to have a detrimental effect on the outlook for european economic growth .
imf forecasts negative effects in europe " europe has so far been relatively resilient to the us slowdown and the global financial turbulence , but the historical record suggests these will increasingly take their toll , " he said in a statement .
gross domestic product -lrb- gdp -rrb- across europe is expected to take a significant hit this year due to the combination of the fallout from the credit crisis , the near-record strength of the euro and soaring food and energy prices .
the imf stated that " growth rates in the advanced economies are projected to fall well below potential for some time " and forecasted that europe 's gdp would fall from last year 's figure of 3.9 percent to 2.6 percent this year .
last week , germany 's key economic institutes revised down their growth outlook for europe 's biggest economy , forecasting that german economic growth will come in at 1.8 percent in 2008 before slowing to 1.4 percent in 2009 .
the eight institutes had previously forecast growth at 2.2 percent for this year . dw staff -lrb- nda -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

however , eu officials warn that there is still a long road ahead for ankara . austrian foreign minister ursala plassnik pledged on monday , april 21 , to keep european union membership negotiations with turkey open , but stressed that austria 's position was that the result of the talks would not necessarily mean that turkey will join the union . speaking at a joint press conference in ankara with her turkish counterpart ali babacan , plassnik said it was important that accession talks continue and that the door is not shut on turkey but that the talks would not necessarily lead to full membership . " our goal is to have turkey as a stable modern dynamic , successful partner , as close a partner of the european union as is imaginable , " plassnik said .
" we are aware that for the turkish side , the one and only exclusive goal is membership in the european union .
i have been trying to enlarge the scope of imagination on that specific point ...
i could imagine a tailor-made turkey-european union community . " babacan repeated that turkey 's aim was full membership and refused to be drawn on alternatives .
he stressed that any decision on turkish membership would occur in the future and that continued people-to- people ties would result in public opinion in europe supporting turkish membership . " the membership decision will not be made on yesterday 's turkey or today 's turkey , but on the turkey of the future , " babacan said . turkey facing domestic tests as eu watches closely bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : turkey 's constitutional court is hearing the closure case on the issue of the potential closure by the turkish constitutional court of the ruling justice and development party -lrb- akp -rrb- for allegedly becoming a focus of anti-secular activities , a topic that has led to criticism from the european union of the turkish legal system , plassnik said the eu should not act as an international police officer .
it was up to turkey to debate the role of secularism in society . babacan refused to speculate on what might happen if his party is closed , saying that he believed turkey would find a solution . " this year our country will go through other tests but i believe our country will pass these tests , " he said . the two foreign ministers said they had agreed to enhance cooperation against terrorism with plassnik making it clear that austria considered the separatist kurdish workers ' party -lrb- pkk -rrb- a terrorist organization . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : austria 's foreign minister ursula plassnik " we are fighting against terrorism with the same determination as others , " plassnik said in response to a question that austria had last year allowed a senior pkk member to flee to iraq .
" i regret that in the turkish media there was a wrong impression concerning austria 's determination to fight terrorism , including the pkk . " turkish media condemned austria 's actions last year when it allegedly allowed riza altun , a senior pkk representative in europe , to escape to iraq despite the fact he was wanted by turkish authorities .
the actions of the austrian government in allowing altun to go free were also condemned by the turkish foreign ministry . rehn warns of akp closure case impact plassnik 's visit coincided with the publication of an interview given by the eu 's enlargement commissioner olli rehn in which he announced that the eu was planning to open two new chapters in turkey 's accession negotiations in june . however , he added that ankara was facing a more critical phase than at any time since its negotiations to join the european union began three years ago . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : rehn hopes turkey will emerge stronger from its trials rehn said in an interview with the german daily die welt that the closure case against the akp was adding extra pressure on ankara at a time when its progress on necessary reforms was also faltering . rehn predicted turkey could emerge with its democratic institutions strengthened once the closure case was resolved , provided that all sides showed willingness to compromise and the necessary reforms were pushed through . delays on both sides hinders turkey 's progress rehn said he also expected turkey to become a member of eu within 10 to 15 years should it continue reforms decisively , according to a separate report from turkey 's anatolian news agency . " we expect freedom of expression for all , " rehn said .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de turkey -pipe- 21.04.2008 eu plans new accession negotiations with turkey at critical time großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : turkey is facing domestic trials at a time when the eu is looking for progress on reforms turkey , facing the most critical phase of its eu accession negotiations , has been told that two new policy chapters will be opened in june .
however , eu officials warn that there is still a long road ahead for ankara . austrian foreign minister ursala plassnik pledged on monday , april 21 , to keep european union membership negotiations with turkey open , but stressed that austria 's position was that the result of the talks would not necessarily mean that turkey will join the union . speaking at a joint press conference in ankara with her turkish counterpart ali babacan , plassnik said it was important that accession talks continue and that the door is not shut on turkey but that the talks would not necessarily lead to full membership . " our goal is to have turkey as a stable modern dynamic , successful partner , as close a partner of the european union as is imaginable , " plassnik said .
" we are aware that for the turkish side , the one and only exclusive goal is membership in the european union .
i have been trying to enlarge the scope of imagination on that specific point ...
i could imagine a tailor-made turkey-european union community . " babacan repeated that turkey 's aim was full membership and refused to be drawn on alternatives .
he stressed that any decision on turkish membership would occur in the future and that continued people-to- people ties would result in public opinion in europe supporting turkish membership . " the membership decision will not be made on yesterday 's turkey or today 's turkey , but on the turkey of the future , " babacan said . turkey facing domestic tests as eu watches closely bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : turkey 's constitutional court is hearing the closure case on the issue of the potential closure by the turkish constitutional court of the ruling justice and development party -lrb- akp -rrb- for allegedly becoming a focus of anti-secular activities , a topic that has led to criticism from the european union of the turkish legal system , plassnik said the eu should not act as an international police officer .
it was up to turkey to debate the role of secularism in society . babacan refused to speculate on what might happen if his party is closed , saying that he believed turkey would find a solution . " this year our country will go through other tests but i believe our country will pass these tests , " he said . the two foreign ministers said they had agreed to enhance cooperation against terrorism with plassnik making it clear that austria considered the separatist kurdish workers ' party -lrb- pkk -rrb- a terrorist organization . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : austria 's foreign minister ursula plassnik " we are fighting against terrorism with the same determination as others , " plassnik said in response to a question that austria had last year allowed a senior pkk member to flee to iraq .
" i regret that in the turkish media there was a wrong impression concerning austria 's determination to fight terrorism , including the pkk . " turkish media condemned austria 's actions last year when it allegedly allowed riza altun , a senior pkk representative in europe , to escape to iraq despite the fact he was wanted by turkish authorities .
the actions of the austrian government in allowing altun to go free were also condemned by the turkish foreign ministry . rehn warns of akp closure case impact plassnik 's visit coincided with the publication of an interview given by the eu 's enlargement commissioner olli rehn in which he announced that the eu was planning to open two new chapters in turkey 's accession negotiations in june . however , he added that ankara was facing a more critical phase than at any time since its negotiations to join the european union began three years ago . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : rehn hopes turkey will emerge stronger from its trials rehn said in an interview with the german daily die welt that the closure case against the akp was adding extra pressure on ankara at a time when its progress on necessary reforms was also faltering . rehn predicted turkey could emerge with its democratic institutions strengthened once the closure case was resolved , provided that all sides showed willingness to compromise and the necessary reforms were pushed through . delays on both sides hinders turkey 's progress rehn said he also expected turkey to become a member of eu within 10 to 15 years should it continue reforms decisively , according to a separate report from turkey 's anatolian news agency . " we expect freedom of expression for all , " rehn said .
" we expect that the rights of women and minorities are protected . " the eu has been particularly critical of strict laws governing the offence of " insulting turkishness , " under which writers have been prosecuted in the past . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : journalists like ocak isik yurtcu have been jailed in turkey in addition to turkey sticking to its reform course , the enlargement commissioner added that the eu should also play its part by standing by its commitments on turkish accession .
regarding slow progress on the accession process , which began in 2005 , rehn said six of 35 policy chapters in the process had been opened and a further two - business law and intellectual property - would be opened in june . the eu suspended negotiations in eight chapters because of turkey 's refusal to open its ports to greek cypriot vessels . further chapters , including energy , would be opened under the french eu presidency in the second half of the year , rehn said . turkey angered by talk of privileged partnership the french eu presidency may prove to be another critical phase for turkey 's hopes . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : merkel and sarkozy both advocate privileged partnership french president nicolas sarkozy , together with german chancellor angela merkel , has suggested turkey should accept a privileged partnership with the eu and not full eu membership . this stance has angered prime minister tayyip erdogan who has said that his country would settle for nothing less than full membership of the european union . " turkey can not accept any alternative which is going to rule out full membership of the eu , " erdogan said earlier this month .
" an enlargement that is going to embrace turkey is not going to undermine the eu , is not going to weaken the eu . " at the nato summit in bucharest this month , sarkozy attempted conciliation by telling turkish president abdullah gul that france did not oppose the opening of negotiations chapters with turkey and that there would be special attention paid to the negotiations during the french eu presidency to strengthen turkey 's integration into the eu . dw staff / dpa -lrb- nda -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

" we are in touch with the uk authorities concerning this scheme and it is far too early to start speculating about whether it is state aid or not , " said jonathan todd , spokesman for the eu 's top competition regulator .
the bank of england 's plan is designed to allow high street banks to swap mortgage-backed securities for government bonds to try to boost liquidity at a time when banks are hesitant to lend to each other .
the intervention followed a meeting of britain 's top bankers with prime minister gordon brown last week , at which the emergency measures were discussed .
" we will make sure that there is enough liquidity in the economy so that we can continue to lend money for businesses and lend money for people to buy their own houses , " brown later said .
a statement from the bank of england 's said that the scheme aimed to improve the liquidity position of the banking system and increase confidence in financial markets , which have been hit by the shockwave emanating from the us economic slowdown and the subsequent global financial turbulence .
the plan is also designed to tackle an estimated overhang of 35 billion pounds of debt in the 1.2 trillion pounds uk mortgage market that banks would have repackaged and sold on , had the credit crisis not hit .
" financial markets are not working normally , which if left unchecked will have an impact on the wider economy .

" it 's not part of this scheme to take us back to the excessive lending of a year or more ago , " king added .

not all reader comments have been published .
dw-world.de reserves the right to edit for length and appropriateness of content . if the slovenian presidency of the eu bends to chinese political pressure , then democracy has been struck a deadly blow .
the decision to invite the tibetan head of state , his holiness the dalai lama , must be made with openness in mind , not political pressures .
so in effect china has used its political power to again snuff out democracy and that is a crying shame . what i suspect here is that slovenia has some links with china , but be they political or trade they must not interfere with the practice of open democracy in europe .
so slovenia must know why it used its eu presidency as a means to further its own position with china .
the eu must make clear to slovenia that it is not a forum of deceit .
case closed . - kenneth v. tellis , canada bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : one reader recommended sanctions on chinese products yes , as europeans believing in human rights there should be sanctions against china .
as producers ourselves , there should be sanctions against china .
many western goods are counterfeit and made in china but sold illegally in europe regardless of copyright and patent ; many products that are taken in the mouth -lrb- toothpaste , etc , -rrb- have been found to contain unfit ingredients ; many well-known toy brands that we buy for our children that are made in china have toxic ingredients , and many people , such as prisoners , are forced to work as slaves to create the great chinese economic progress . but the big multi-nationals have made sure we do n't have much choice in buying products that are not made in china .
they made sure they closed down their european factories and opened them up in china where life and labor is cheap and their greed insures they get the best profit .

that the eu chooses to remain a mute spectator on the tibet crackdown and refrain from officially recognizing the dalai lama amounts to lending credibility to the religious persecution of christians sponsored by the atheist regime in beijing . do we assume that the rich european tradition of promoting democratic values and peaceful coexistence is fading day by day ?
how else can the european union presidency ignore the reality of 46 christians being arrested for holding a bible class and worshiping in a private home without government permission ?
perhaps it is time that the european citizens decide whether or not to support a tyrannical regime that does not even believe in granting the christians , muslims and tibetan buddhist minorities the right and freedom to quietly express their faith . - seema sengupta , india i think the eu should send a large fact-finding mission to tibet to see the real situation without chinese officials and spies with them then to decide it .

dw-world.de spoke to von richthofen biographer joachim castan about the man behind the myth . the prussian nobleman - dubbed the red baron because of the color of his aircraft - shot down some 80 allied planes before his death at the age of 25 .
his life has become the stuff of legend .
a new film about the red baron , which opened in germany this month , also revives the heroic image .
joachim castan , 41 , was the first historian to write a biography of this famous figure .
the biographer and documentary filmmaker spent three years researching the project , gaining exclusive access to previously unpublished writings and letters .
the book , called " die ganze geschichte " -lrb- the whole story -rrb- and published in 2007 , reveals a far more complex character .
dw-world.de : did your image of von richthofen change in the course of your research ?
joachim castan : i must admit that i had an image of von richthofen before i started my research of him as the last true gentleman of the skies in a dehumanized , industrialized brutal war , heroically participating in airborne duels .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : castan 's preconceptions were overturned while working on the book as i became immersed in the material , i realized that there was a well-maintained von richthofen myth .
the myth propagates the idea that von richthofen forced pilots to land .
he shot down aircraft , but he ensured , if at all possible , that the pilot survived , so that the whole encounter took on the character of a sporting match to determine the better pilot and marksman .
this turned out to be an image created by the german propaganda machine in 1917 .
it needed a young , good-looking radiant hero , a victor who could be served up to a relatively demoralized society . this image of the lonely gentleman of the skies was then taken up in the 1920s and further elaborated upon by the americans , who wanted to sell a romantic notion of air combat .
and who was the man you discovered ?
he was completely different .
without doubt , he was extremely courageous and extremely ambitious , but he was also cold-blooded .
his goal was to shoot down as many aircraft as possible .
in his own writings , he writes quite openly : " i never get into an aircraft for fun .
i aim first for the head of the pilot , or rather at the head of the observer , if there was one . "
i do n't think that von richthofen would have described himself as a hero .
he was doing his duty to defend his fatherland .
at the same time , he was satisfying his passion for hunting .
he was already a passionate hunter at the age of 11 and was taken hunting by his father .
aim , shoot , destroy target - he took his passion for hunting to the skies , transposing it one-to-one .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : von richthofen around 1917 i also do not think he was a brutal killer .
von richthofen also reflected partially upon what he did .
he wrote that he always felt terrible when he came off duty .
he used to come home and lock himself in his room for hours and refuse to talk to anyone .
from mid-1917 he also realized that the war was probably going to be lost .
for me he is a tragic figure , fighting fanatically , remorselessly , in a war that is lost .
what made him into the kind of person he was ?
his mother was extraordinarily ambitious and did n't think much of her husband .
he retired early and did not have a very successful career as an officer .
all of the family 's ambitions were invested first in the eldest son , manfred , and then in the second son , lothar , who was also a fighter pilot .
the young manfred was sent at the age of 11 to a prussian cadet school , which were pretty infamous .
the children were honed into soldiers and there was no scope for any ifs , ands or buts .
the intellectual aspect of schooling was largely neglected .
the children had to function as soldiers first and foremost .
it 's interesting : if you look at von richthofen 's personal development , it showed that , first of all , he functioned in this way .
then a year before his death , he started to come to his senses and think about his actions .
i think he gradually realized that he had arrived at a dead end .
you say that the red baron myth was created in 1917 .
it served then as propaganda intended to boost morale .
but why is it now being revived ?
what is the reason for the current interest in this figure ?
in germany currently , we are thinking about war , heroes , and war heroes , we are rethinking our position .
deployment in a war in afghanistan would have been unthinkable in germany 10 years ago .
at the same time , we are thinking about reintroducing medals to reward bravery .
for germany , that is a very unusual situation because of our history , the third reich and the hitler dictatorship .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : matthias schweighoefer plays the red baron in the new film in other countries , in france , britain and the united states , hero cults exist .
in germany , they ceased to exist after 1945 .
i believe that there is a certain tendency toward reintroducing heroes , to hold them up as examples , as military models and to make military conflict socially acceptable again .
what do you think about the portrayal of von richthofen in nikolai muellerschoen 's new film , " the red baron ? "
the film revives the richthofen myth in parts .
it turns him into a radiant figure , someone who becomes a good person / pacifist through his love for a nurse .
it is a way of seeing von richthofen that is popular at the moment - as a sort of broken hero who is relatively blameless in some respects .
there are those responsible for conducting the war , who are evil , and the good hero .
this is a distinction that people like to make at the moment . interview : julie gregson send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

" we have to stand behind our decision , " steinmeier said , adding that western capitals have engaged in discussions with beijing for decades over the human rights abuses in china and the tibetan independence movement . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : steinmeier : " we have to stand behind our decision " steinmeier said he sees his job as being to deflate tensions between tibet and the chinese government , a conflict that has unleashed protests worldwide and especially in cities along the route of the olympic torch relay . steinmeier urges a broad view this job is made easier by the fact that china is eager to make the olympic games a success , steinmeier said . " we have to continue trying to convince the chinese , " he said .
" i 've been on the phone three times with the chinese foreign minister and urged him not to use force " when dealing with protesters . steinmeier said the near daily aggravation of the situation is " not acceptable , " but also called for western governments to remain aware of the sea-change taking place in chinese society . " in a very short time , the country has brought 300 million people from bitter poverty to a humble prosperity , " he said .
" great parts of the developing world look to china with interest and sympathy . " french president nicolas sarkozy appeared to be backpedaling on his hard line , as anti-french sentiment is mushrooming in beijing .
the chinese have begun boycotts of carrefour and held numerous demonstrations over the weekend outside the french retail giant 's stores in china . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : sarkozy is not eager to harm relations with china sarkozy , who previously has urged the chinese government to open talks with the dalai lama and has suggested he might boycott the olympic opening ceremonies in beijing on aug .
8 , decided to send former prime minister jean-pierre raffarin and the presidential foreign affairs advisor , jean-david levitte , to china to calm bilateral tensions . raffarin is scheduled to travel to beijing on wednesday to meet with chinese premier wen jiabao .
he will be carrying a message from sarkozy addressed to the chinese leadership . personal apology from le president in an effort to calm chinese anger over the protest-plagued progress of the olympic flame through france , sarkozy sent a note to disabled female athlete jin jing , who had tried to defend the flame during its run through paris . " i wish to tell you that i was shocked by the attacks you were subjected to on april 7 in paris , " sarkozy wrote .
the letter was delivered to her monday in shanghai by french senate president christian poncelet . " it is understandable that the chinese people were hurt , and i firmly condemn -lsb- those acts -rsb- , " the french president wrote . jin jing , a 27-year-old para-olympics fencer who lost her leg to cancer as a child , became a heroine in china after pictures were flashed around the world showing her protecting the torch from pro-tibetan demonstrators from her wheelchair . the torch was extinguished at least twice during its relay in paris , and the relay itself was cut short because of the numerous anti-chinese incidents along its route . counter-demonstrations in europe meanwhile , chinese in china and in europe have begun staging counter-demonstrations , protesting what they say is a misleading depiction of china in the media and biased media coverage of the torch relay . on saturday , april 19 , several thousand chinese rallied in paris , britain and berlin , supporting the beijing olympics . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the torch relay met protest in paris around 3,000 pro-chinese activists demonstrated in the central potsdamer platz area of berlin , gripping banners with messages like " media = untruths , " and " china olympia , one world , one dream . " on the same day in paris , nearly 4,000 chinese students and other expatriates gathered in the place de la republique , according to police estimates .
they wore t-shirts with the slogan " one china , one family , " and waved signs criticizing the western media . " we 're demonstrating against the disinformation in the french and western media , to promote the olympic games and to construct a bridge between the french and chinese people - and not a wall as the media do , " one of the rally 's spokesmen , thierry liu , told the afp news service . more than 1,000 people , mainly students , also gathered outside the bbc 's offices in manchester , north-west england , while around 300 staged a demonstration outside the houses of parliament in london . the european commission on monday said people were free to show their displeasure with the west 's reaction to demonstrations in tibet and media coverage of the run-up to the 2008 olympics .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de turkey -pipe- 21.04.2008 eu plans new accession negotiations with turkey at critical time großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : turkey is facing domestic trials at a time when the eu is looking for progress on reforms turkey , facing the most critical phase of its eu accession negotiations , has been told that two new policy chapters will be opened in june .
however , eu officials warn that there is still a long road ahead for ankara . austrian foreign minister ursala plassnik pledged on monday , april 21 , to keep european union membership negotiations with turkey open , but stressed that austria 's position was that the result of the talks would not necessarily mean that turkey will join the union . speaking at a joint press conference in ankara with her turkish counterpart ali babacan , plassnik said it was important that accession talks continue and that the door is not shut on turkey but that the talks would not necessarily lead to full membership . " our goal is to have turkey as a stable modern dynamic , successful partner , as close a partner of the european union as is imaginable , " plassnik said .
" we are aware that for the turkish side , the one and only exclusive goal is membership in the european union .
i have been trying to enlarge the scope of imagination on that specific point ...
i could imagine a tailor-made turkey-european union community . " babacan repeated that turkey 's aim was full membership and refused to be drawn on alternatives .
he stressed that any decision on turkish membership would occur in the future and that continued people-to- people ties would result in public opinion in europe supporting turkish membership . " the membership decision will not be made on yesterday 's turkey or today 's turkey , but on the turkey of the future , " babacan said . turkey facing domestic tests as eu watches closely bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : turkey 's constitutional court is hearing the closure case on the issue of the potential closure by the turkish constitutional court of the ruling justice and development party -lrb- akp -rrb- for allegedly becoming a focus of anti-secular activities , a topic that has led to criticism from the european union of the turkish legal system , plassnik said the eu should not act as an international police officer .
it was up to turkey to debate the role of secularism in society . babacan refused to speculate on what might happen if his party is closed , saying that he believed turkey would find a solution . " this year our country will go through other tests but i believe our country will pass these tests , " he said . the two foreign ministers said they had agreed to enhance cooperation against terrorism with plassnik making it clear that austria considered the separatist kurdish workers ' party -lrb- pkk -rrb- a terrorist organization . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : austria 's foreign minister ursula plassnik " we are fighting against terrorism with the same determination as others , " plassnik said in response to a question that austria had last year allowed a senior pkk member to flee to iraq .
" i regret that in the turkish media there was a wrong impression concerning austria 's determination to fight terrorism , including the pkk . " turkish media condemned austria 's actions last year when it allegedly allowed riza altun , a senior pkk representative in europe , to escape to iraq despite the fact he was wanted by turkish authorities .
the actions of the austrian government in allowing altun to go free were also condemned by the turkish foreign ministry . rehn warns of akp closure case impact plassnik 's visit coincided with the publication of an interview given by the eu 's enlargement commissioner olli rehn in which he announced that the eu was planning to open two new chapters in turkey 's accession negotiations in june . however , he added that ankara was facing a more critical phase than at any time since its negotiations to join the european union began three years ago . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : rehn hopes turkey will emerge stronger from its trials rehn said in an interview with the german daily die welt that the closure case against the akp was adding extra pressure on ankara at a time when its progress on necessary reforms was also faltering . rehn predicted turkey could emerge with its democratic institutions strengthened once the closure case was resolved , provided that all sides showed willingness to compromise and the necessary reforms were pushed through . delays on both sides hinders turkey 's progress rehn said he also expected turkey to become a member of eu within 10 to 15 years should it continue reforms decisively , according to a separate report from turkey 's anatolian news agency . " we expect freedom of expression for all , " rehn said .
" we expect that the rights of women and minorities are protected . " the eu has been particularly critical of strict laws governing the offence of " insulting turkishness , " under which writers have been prosecuted in the past . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : journalists like ocak isik yurtcu have been jailed in turkey in addition to turkey sticking to its reform course , the enlargement commissioner added that the eu should also play its part by standing by its commitments on turkish accession .
regarding slow progress on the accession process , which began in 2005 , rehn said six of 35 policy chapters in the process had been opened and a further two - business law and intellectual property - would be opened in june . the eu suspended negotiations in eight chapters because of turkey 's refusal to open its ports to greek cypriot vessels . further chapters , including energy , would be opened under the french eu presidency in the second half of the year , rehn said . turkey angered by talk of privileged partnership the french eu presidency may prove to be another critical phase for turkey 's hopes . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : merkel and sarkozy both advocate privileged partnership french president nicolas sarkozy , together with german chancellor angela merkel , has suggested turkey should accept a privileged partnership with the eu and not full eu membership . this stance has angered prime minister tayyip erdogan who has said that his country would settle for nothing less than full membership of the european union . " turkey can not accept any alternative which is going to rule out full membership of the eu , " erdogan said earlier this month .
" an enlargement that is going to embrace turkey is not going to undermine the eu , is not going to weaken the eu . " at the nato summit in bucharest this month , sarkozy attempted conciliation by telling turkish president abdullah gul that france did not oppose the opening of negotiations chapters with turkey and that there would be special attention paid to the negotiations during the french eu presidency to strengthen turkey 's integration into the eu . dw staff / dpa -lrb- nda -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

" we are in touch with the uk authorities concerning this scheme and it is far too early to start speculating about whether it is state aid or not , " said jonathan todd , spokesman for the eu 's top competition regulator .
the bank of england 's plan is designed to allow high street banks to swap mortgage-backed securities for government bonds to try to boost liquidity at a time when banks are hesitant to lend to each other .
the intervention followed a meeting of britain 's top bankers with prime minister gordon brown last week , at which the emergency measures were discussed .
" we will make sure that there is enough liquidity in the economy so that we can continue to lend money for businesses and lend money for people to buy their own houses , " brown later said .
a statement from the bank of england 's said that the scheme aimed to improve the liquidity position of the banking system and increase confidence in financial markets , which have been hit by the shockwave emanating from the us economic slowdown and the subsequent global financial turbulence .
the plan is also designed to tackle an estimated overhang of 35 billion pounds of debt in the 1.2 trillion pounds uk mortgage market that banks would have repackaged and sold on , had the credit crisis not hit .
" financial markets are not working normally , which if left unchecked will have an impact on the wider economy .

" it 's not part of this scheme to take us back to the excessive lending of a year or more ago , " king added .
" it 's to return the banking system back to a state of normality . "

" we have to continue trying to convince the chinese , " he said .
" i 've been on the phone three times with the chinese foreign minister and urged him not to use force " when dealing with protesters . steinmeier said the near daily aggravation of the situation is " not acceptable , " but also called for western governments to remain aware of the sea-change taking place in chinese society . " in a very short time , the country has brought 300 million people from bitter poverty to a humble prosperity , " he said .

the letter was delivered to her monday in shanghai by french senate president christian poncelet . " it is understandable that the chinese people were hurt , and i firmly condemn -lsb- those acts -rsb- , " the french president wrote . jin jing , a 27-year-old para-olympics fencer who lost her leg to cancer as a child , became a heroine in china after pictures were flashed around the world showing her protecting the torch from pro-tibetan demonstrators from her wheelchair . the torch was extinguished at least twice during its relay in paris , and the relay itself was cut short because of the numerous anti-chinese incidents along its route . counter-demonstrations in europe meanwhile , chinese in china and in europe have begun staging counter-demonstrations , protesting what they say is a misleading depiction of china in the media and biased media coverage of the torch relay . on saturday , april 19 , several thousand chinese rallied in paris , britain and berlin , supporting the beijing olympics . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the torch relay met protest in paris around 3,000 pro-chinese activists demonstrated in the central potsdamer platz area of berlin , gripping banners with messages like " media = untruths , " and " china olympia , one world , one dream .

" i can tell you on behalf of the european union - all the countries of the european union - that we will continue to be working with the government , working with the people of afghanistan for the long haul , " solana said after meeting with afghan president hamid karzai and other senior ministry officials in the fortified presidential palace in kabul on monday , april 21 .
" we , the people in europe , will continue to be helping the people of afghanistan to get what they deserve , the stability , prosperity and peace , " he added .
a renewed commitment bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : solana praised the on-going efforts in afghanistan solana jetted into the capital for a day-long trip which , he said in remarks published in a kabul daily monday , came at an important time of " renewed commitment by the international community " to struggling afghanistan .
following his arrival , solana paid a visit to the headquarters of the eu police mission in afghanistan -lrb- eupol -rrb- and met with police officials .
since june of last year , some 230 eupol officials have been training the upper echelons of the afghan security forces .
eupol is also assisting other western training missions and is now spreading its operations to cover the whole country .
solana praised the progress that afghanistan has made in the past several years since the fall of the taliban , saying " tremendous efforts have been done in education .
the tremendous effort ... done in health is something that we take into great consideration . "
europe is the second largest contributor after the united states to military and development efforts in afghanistan since the 2001 fall of the extremist taliban regime , and president karzai praised the european union as " among the best supporters of afghanistan . "
high hopes for paris donors ' conference bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : karzai thanked the eu and hoped for continued help during their discussions , solana and karzai discussed a number of other issues including security , governance , and rule of law in afghanistan , as well as the international preparation for the afghan donors ' conference in paris in june .
" this is the moment to reflect on what we , the international community , can do , working in conjunction with our afghan partners , to enhance our efforts , " he said of the up-coming conference .
afghanistan is hoping the donors ' meeting in paris will secure $ 50 billion -lrb- 30 billion euros -rrb- in aid to implement a five-year development plan , finance minister anwar-ul haq ahadi said monday .
the plan , called the national development strategy -lrb- ands -rrb- , was presented to donors at an " aid effectiveness " conference in kabul at the same time as solana 's meeting .
based on a year of wide-ranging consultations , it will be assessed by the world bank and international monetary fund , ahadi told reporters after the meeting .
the finalized strategy would become the basis of requests from donors at the june conference , he said .
" for this strategy , the afghan government has asked the world for $ 50 billion in aid for five years , " he said .
the ands was a comprehensive plan , the minister said .
" all walks of government are included : security , good governance , financial growth , important issues such as counter-narcotics , capacity building and equal rights of women ... "
afghan solutions for afghan problems bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the rebuilding and enforcement of security goes on the plan underlines europe 's commitment to restoring afghanistan 's infrastructure and the return of the power to the people .
in written comments for the daily outlook afghanistan newspaper , solana said it was " important that afghan solutions are found to afghan problems . "
and success would involve more than a military effort to eliminate extremists , whose ranks are said to be reinforced , trained and equipped by militant camps in neighboring pakistan .
" the approach must be global and joined up , encompassing the rule of law , development , reconstruction , economic growth , rural development and education , " solana said .
" it is very important that the efforts should be led by afghans , " he said , reflecting growing demands by karzai and his government for more ownership of the work in their country .
despite the paris conference 's emphasis on civilian assistance , it is likely that the financial cost and loss of soldiers killed fighting taliban extremists will also be discussed , at a time of growing doubts within some allied nations about the mammoth mission , which has been criticized as wasteful and disjointed .
pakistan visit on itinerary after leaving kabul , solana was expected for talks with pakistan 's president pervez musharraf in islamabad on tuesday .
solana is expected to reiterate the eu 's support for the democratic process in pakistan .
" we have to continue to show our support and engagement , in particular after the -lsb- recent -rsb- political developments -lsb- in pakistan -rsb- , " an official from solana 's office said ahead of the trip .

" we have to stand behind our decision , " steinmeier said , adding that western capitals have engaged in discussions with beijing for decades over the human rights abuses in china and the tibetan independence movement . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : steinmeier : " we have to stand behind our decision " steinmeier said he sees his job as being to deflate tensions between tibet and the chinese government , a conflict that has unleashed protests worldwide and especially in cities along the route of the olympic torch relay . steinmeier urges a broad view this job is made easier by the fact that china is eager to make the olympic games a success , steinmeier said . " we have to continue trying to convince the chinese , " he said .
" i 've been on the phone three times with the chinese foreign minister and urged him not to use force " when dealing with protesters . steinmeier said the near daily aggravation of the situation is " not acceptable , " but also called for western governments to remain aware of the sea-change taking place in chinese society . " in a very short time , the country has brought 300 million people from bitter poverty to a humble prosperity , " he said .
" great parts of the developing world look to china with interest and sympathy . " french president nicolas sarkozy appeared to be backpedaling on his hard line , as anti-french sentiment is mushrooming in beijing .
the chinese have begun boycotts of carrefour and held numerous demonstrations over the weekend outside the french retail giant 's stores in china . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : sarkozy is not eager to harm relations with china sarkozy , who previously has urged the chinese government to open talks with the dalai lama and has suggested he might boycott the olympic opening ceremonies in beijing on aug .
8 , decided to send former prime minister jean-pierre raffarin and the presidential foreign affairs advisor , jean-david levitte , to china to calm bilateral tensions . raffarin is scheduled to travel to beijing on wednesday to meet with chinese premier wen jiabao .
he will be carrying a message from sarkozy addressed to the chinese leadership . personal apology from le president in an effort to calm chinese anger over the protest-plagued progress of the olympic flame through france , sarkozy sent a note to disabled female athlete jin jing , who had tried to defend the flame during its run through paris . " i wish to tell you that i was shocked by the attacks you were subjected to on april 7 in paris , " sarkozy wrote .
the letter was delivered to her monday in shanghai by french senate president christian poncelet . " it is understandable that the chinese people were hurt , and i firmly condemn -lsb- those acts -rsb- , " the french president wrote . jin jing , a 27-year-old para-olympics fencer who lost her leg to cancer as a child , became a heroine in china after pictures were flashed around the world showing her protecting the torch from pro-tibetan demonstrators from her wheelchair . the torch was extinguished at least twice during its relay in paris , and the relay itself was cut short because of the numerous anti-chinese incidents along its route . counter-demonstrations in europe meanwhile , chinese in china and in europe have begun staging counter-demonstrations , protesting what they say is a misleading depiction of china in the media and biased media coverage of the torch relay . on saturday , april 19 , several thousand chinese rallied in paris , britain and berlin , supporting the beijing olympics . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the torch relay met protest in paris around 3,000 pro-chinese activists demonstrated in the central potsdamer platz area of berlin , gripping banners with messages like " media = untruths , " and " china olympia , one world , one dream . " on the same day in paris , nearly 4,000 chinese students and other expatriates gathered in the place de la republique , according to police estimates .
they wore t-shirts with the slogan " one china , one family , " and waved signs criticizing the western media . " we 're demonstrating against the disinformation in the french and western media , to promote the olympic games and to construct a bridge between the french and chinese people - and not a wall as the media do , " one of the rally 's spokesmen , thierry liu , told the afp news service . more than 1,000 people , mainly students , also gathered outside the bbc 's offices in manchester , north-west england , while around 300 staged a demonstration outside the houses of parliament in london . the european commission on monday said people were free to show their displeasure with the west 's reaction to demonstrations in tibet and media coverage of the run-up to the 2008 olympics .

however , eu officials warn that there is still a long road ahead for ankara . austrian foreign minister ursala plassnik pledged on monday , april 21 , to keep european union membership negotiations with turkey open , but stressed that austria 's position was that the result of the talks would not necessarily mean that turkey will join the union . speaking at a joint press conference in ankara with her turkish counterpart ali babacan , plassnik said it was important that accession talks continue and that the door is not shut on turkey but that the talks would not necessarily lead to full membership . " our goal is to have turkey as a stable modern dynamic , successful partner , as close a partner of the european union as is imaginable , " plassnik said .
" we are aware that for the turkish side , the one and only exclusive goal is membership in the european union .
i have been trying to enlarge the scope of imagination on that specific point ...
i could imagine a tailor-made turkey-european union community . " babacan repeated that turkey 's aim was full membership and refused to be drawn on alternatives .
he stressed that any decision on turkish membership would occur in the future and that continued people-to- people ties would result in public opinion in europe supporting turkish membership . " the membership decision will not be made on yesterday 's turkey or today 's turkey , but on the turkey of the future , " babacan said . turkey facing domestic tests as eu watches closely bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : turkey 's constitutional court is hearing the closure case on the issue of the potential closure by the turkish constitutional court of the ruling justice and development party -lrb- akp -rrb- for allegedly becoming a focus of anti-secular activities , a topic that has led to criticism from the european union of the turkish legal system , plassnik said the eu should not act as an international police officer .
it was up to turkey to debate the role of secularism in society . babacan refused to speculate on what might happen if his party is closed , saying that he believed turkey would find a solution . " this year our country will go through other tests but i believe our country will pass these tests , " he said . the two foreign ministers said they had agreed to enhance cooperation against terrorism with plassnik making it clear that austria considered the separatist kurdish workers ' party -lrb- pkk -rrb- a terrorist organization . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : austria 's foreign minister ursula plassnik " we are fighting against terrorism with the same determination as others , " plassnik said in response to a question that austria had last year allowed a senior pkk member to flee to iraq .
" i regret that in the turkish media there was a wrong impression concerning austria 's determination to fight terrorism , including the pkk . " turkish media condemned austria 's actions last year when it allegedly allowed riza altun , a senior pkk representative in europe , to escape to iraq despite the fact he was wanted by turkish authorities .
the actions of the austrian government in allowing altun to go free were also condemned by the turkish foreign ministry . rehn warns of akp closure case impact plassnik 's visit coincided with the publication of an interview given by the eu 's enlargement commissioner olli rehn in which he announced that the eu was planning to open two new chapters in turkey 's accession negotiations in june . however , he added that ankara was facing a more critical phase than at any time since its negotiations to join the european union began three years ago . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : rehn hopes turkey will emerge stronger from its trials rehn said in an interview with the german daily die welt that the closure case against the akp was adding extra pressure on ankara at a time when its progress on necessary reforms was also faltering . rehn predicted turkey could emerge with its democratic institutions strengthened once the closure case was resolved , provided that all sides showed willingness to compromise and the necessary reforms were pushed through . delays on both sides hinders turkey 's progress rehn said he also expected turkey to become a member of eu within 10 to 15 years should it continue reforms decisively , according to a separate report from turkey 's anatolian news agency . " we expect freedom of expression for all , " rehn said .
" we expect that the rights of women and minorities are protected . " the eu has been particularly critical of strict laws governing the offence of " insulting turkishness , " under which writers have been prosecuted in the past . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : journalists like ocak isik yurtcu have been jailed in turkey in addition to turkey sticking to its reform course , the enlargement commissioner added that the eu should also play its part by standing by its commitments on turkish accession .
regarding slow progress on the accession process , which began in 2005 , rehn said six of 35 policy chapters in the process had been opened and a further two - business law and intellectual property - would be opened in june . the eu suspended negotiations in eight chapters because of turkey 's refusal to open its ports to greek cypriot vessels . further chapters , including energy , would be opened under the french eu presidency in the second half of the year , rehn said . turkey angered by talk of privileged partnership the french eu presidency may prove to be another critical phase for turkey 's hopes . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : merkel and sarkozy both advocate privileged partnership french president nicolas sarkozy , together with german chancellor angela merkel , has suggested turkey should accept a privileged partnership with the eu and not full eu membership . this stance has angered prime minister tayyip erdogan who has said that his country would settle for nothing less than full membership of the european union . " turkey can not accept any alternative which is going to rule out full membership of the eu , " erdogan said earlier this month .
" an enlargement that is going to embrace turkey is not going to undermine the eu , is not going to weaken the eu . " at the nato summit in bucharest this month , sarkozy attempted conciliation by telling turkish president abdullah gul that france did not oppose the opening of negotiations chapters with turkey and that there would be special attention paid to the negotiations during the french eu presidency to strengthen turkey 's integration into the eu . dw staff / dpa -lrb- nda -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de finance -pipe- 21.04.2008 eu surveys bank of england 's cash injection plan with caution großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : bank of england governor mervyn king hopes to inspire confidence in the economy the bank of england 's plan to free up britain 's home loan market by injecting 50 billion pounds into the banking sector to ease the mortgage squeeze has come under scrutiny from the eu . the bank 's 50-billion-pound -lrb- 62.3 billion euros , $ 100 billion -rrb- plan is being studied by the eu as to whether it constitutes state aid , a european commission spokesman said monday , april 21 .
" we are in touch with the uk authorities concerning this scheme and it is far too early to start speculating about whether it is state aid or not , " said jonathan todd , spokesman for the eu 's top competition regulator .
the bank of england 's plan is designed to allow high street banks to swap mortgage-backed securities for government bonds to try to boost liquidity at a time when banks are hesitant to lend to each other .
the intervention followed a meeting of britain 's top bankers with prime minister gordon brown last week , at which the emergency measures were discussed .
" we will make sure that there is enough liquidity in the economy so that we can continue to lend money for businesses and lend money for people to buy their own houses , " brown later said .
a statement from the bank of england 's said that the scheme aimed to improve the liquidity position of the banking system and increase confidence in financial markets , which have been hit by the shockwave emanating from the us economic slowdown and the subsequent global financial turbulence .
the plan is also designed to tackle an estimated overhang of 35 billion pounds of debt in the 1.2 trillion pounds uk mortgage market that banks would have repackaged and sold on , had the credit crisis not hit .
" financial markets are not working normally , which if left unchecked will have an impact on the wider economy .
across the world , there is a lack of confidence in assets created from packages of bank loans , most notably mortgage-backed securities , " the bank of england statement said .
cash injection could increase with demand the initial amount of 50 billion pounds could increase depending on the amount other banks need to get lending going again and how much they 're willing to provide in costly collateral .
" there is no arbitrary limit on it , " bank of england governor mervyn king told reporters when asked about the cash injection .
" it 's not part of this scheme to take us back to the excessive lending of a year or more ago , " king added .
" it 's to return the banking system back to a state of normality . "
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the us subprime crisis led to uk lenders tightening their belts britain 's main home loan providers are rapidly tightening their lending criteria as fears persist over the sector 's exposure to the collapsed subprime or high-risk housing market in the united states .
central banks around the world have been taking a variety of actions to get the frozen markets moving .
the bank of england 's plan is one of the biggest moves yet by a major central bank to combat the global credit crunch .
the us federal reserve last month unveiled a $ 200 billion scheme to help its own mortgage markets .
the bank of england 's plan was revealed at the same time as reports claiming the royal bank of scotland was seeking some 10 billion pounds in a new rights issue to shareholders this week .
the bank , britain 's second-largest , is also expected to reveal further write-downs , probably in the region of 5 billion pounds .
no quick fix , say analysts despite the positive noises being made by the banks in regard to the bank of england 's plan , analysts are less convinced that it would be enough to revive a flagging economy .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the bank of england plan will not fix the financial crisis " it will have a positive impact on the money market but it 's unlikely that it will have any meaningful impact on unlocking mortgage markets , " one economist told reuters .
" this is not going to undo the harm that 's already been done to the economy , " said another .
" it might just stop things getting any worse . "
the international monetary fund -lrb- imf -rrb- took a different view .
according to michael deppler , director of the imf 's european department , the global credit crisis and persistent gloom over the us economy is continuing to have a detrimental effect on the outlook for european economic growth .
imf forecasts negative effects in europe " europe has so far been relatively resilient to the us slowdown and the global financial turbulence , but the historical record suggests these will increasingly take their toll , " he said in a statement .
gross domestic product -lrb- gdp -rrb- across europe is expected to take a significant hit this year due to the combination of the fallout from the credit crisis , the near-record strength of the euro and soaring food and energy prices .
the imf stated that " growth rates in the advanced economies are projected to fall well below potential for some time " and forecasted that europe 's gdp would fall from last year 's figure of 3.9 percent to 2.6 percent this year .
last week , germany 's key economic institutes revised down their growth outlook for europe 's biggest economy , forecasting that german economic growth will come in at 1.8 percent in 2008 before slowing to 1.4 percent in 2009 .
the eight institutes had previously forecast growth at 2.2 percent for this year . dw staff -lrb- nda -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

dw-world.de spoke to von richthofen biographer joachim castan about the man behind the myth . the prussian nobleman - dubbed the red baron because of the color of his aircraft - shot down some 80 allied planes before his death at the age of 25 .
his life has become the stuff of legend .
a new film about the red baron , which opened in germany this month , also revives the heroic image .
joachim castan , 41 , was the first historian to write a biography of this famous figure .
the biographer and documentary filmmaker spent three years researching the project , gaining exclusive access to previously unpublished writings and letters .
the book , called " die ganze geschichte " -lrb- the whole story -rrb- and published in 2007 , reveals a far more complex character .
dw-world.de : did your image of von richthofen change in the course of your research ?
joachim castan : i must admit that i had an image of von richthofen before i started my research of him as the last true gentleman of the skies in a dehumanized , industrialized brutal war , heroically participating in airborne duels .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : castan 's preconceptions were overturned while working on the book as i became immersed in the material , i realized that there was a well-maintained von richthofen myth .
the myth propagates the idea that von richthofen forced pilots to land .
he shot down aircraft , but he ensured , if at all possible , that the pilot survived , so that the whole encounter took on the character of a sporting match to determine the better pilot and marksman .
this turned out to be an image created by the german propaganda machine in 1917 .
it needed a young , good-looking radiant hero , a victor who could be served up to a relatively demoralized society . this image of the lonely gentleman of the skies was then taken up in the 1920s and further elaborated upon by the americans , who wanted to sell a romantic notion of air combat .
and who was the man you discovered ?
he was completely different .
without doubt , he was extremely courageous and extremely ambitious , but he was also cold-blooded .
his goal was to shoot down as many aircraft as possible .
in his own writings , he writes quite openly : " i never get into an aircraft for fun .
i aim first for the head of the pilot , or rather at the head of the observer , if there was one . "
i do n't think that von richthofen would have described himself as a hero .
he was doing his duty to defend his fatherland .
at the same time , he was satisfying his passion for hunting .
he was already a passionate hunter at the age of 11 and was taken hunting by his father .
aim , shoot , destroy target - he took his passion for hunting to the skies , transposing it one-to-one .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : von richthofen around 1917 i also do not think he was a brutal killer .
von richthofen also reflected partially upon what he did .
he wrote that he always felt terrible when he came off duty .
he used to come home and lock himself in his room for hours and refuse to talk to anyone .
from mid-1917 he also realized that the war was probably going to be lost .
for me he is a tragic figure , fighting fanatically , remorselessly , in a war that is lost .
what made him into the kind of person he was ?
his mother was extraordinarily ambitious and did n't think much of her husband .
he retired early and did not have a very successful career as an officer .
all of the family 's ambitions were invested first in the eldest son , manfred , and then in the second son , lothar , who was also a fighter pilot .
the young manfred was sent at the age of 11 to a prussian cadet school , which were pretty infamous .
the children were honed into soldiers and there was no scope for any ifs , ands or buts .
the intellectual aspect of schooling was largely neglected .
the children had to function as soldiers first and foremost .
it 's interesting : if you look at von richthofen 's personal development , it showed that , first of all , he functioned in this way .
then a year before his death , he started to come to his senses and think about his actions .
i think he gradually realized that he had arrived at a dead end .
you say that the red baron myth was created in 1917 .
it served then as propaganda intended to boost morale .
but why is it now being revived ?
what is the reason for the current interest in this figure ?
in germany currently , we are thinking about war , heroes , and war heroes , we are rethinking our position .
deployment in a war in afghanistan would have been unthinkable in germany 10 years ago .
at the same time , we are thinking about reintroducing medals to reward bravery .
for germany , that is a very unusual situation because of our history , the third reich and the hitler dictatorship .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : matthias schweighoefer plays the red baron in the new film in other countries , in france , britain and the united states , hero cults exist .
in germany , they ceased to exist after 1945 .
i believe that there is a certain tendency toward reintroducing heroes , to hold them up as examples , as military models and to make military conflict socially acceptable again .
what do you think about the portrayal of von richthofen in nikolai muellerschoen 's new film , " the red baron ? "
the film revives the richthofen myth in parts .
it turns him into a radiant figure , someone who becomes a good person / pacifist through his love for a nurse .
it is a way of seeing von richthofen that is popular at the moment - as a sort of broken hero who is relatively blameless in some respects .
there are those responsible for conducting the war , who are evil , and the good hero .
this is a distinction that people like to make at the moment . interview : julie gregson send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

not all reader comments have been published .
dw-world.de reserves the right to edit for length and appropriateness of content . if the slovenian presidency of the eu bends to chinese political pressure , then democracy has been struck a deadly blow .
the decision to invite the tibetan head of state , his holiness the dalai lama , must be made with openness in mind , not political pressures .
so in effect china has used its political power to again snuff out democracy and that is a crying shame . what i suspect here is that slovenia has some links with china , but be they political or trade they must not interfere with the practice of open democracy in europe .
so slovenia must know why it used its eu presidency as a means to further its own position with china .
the eu must make clear to slovenia that it is not a forum of deceit .
case closed . - kenneth v. tellis , canada bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : one reader recommended sanctions on chinese products yes , as europeans believing in human rights there should be sanctions against china .
as producers ourselves , there should be sanctions against china .
many western goods are counterfeit and made in china but sold illegally in europe regardless of copyright and patent ; many products that are taken in the mouth -lrb- toothpaste , etc , -rrb- have been found to contain unfit ingredients ; many well-known toy brands that we buy for our children that are made in china have toxic ingredients , and many people , such as prisoners , are forced to work as slaves to create the great chinese economic progress . but the big multi-nationals have made sure we do n't have much choice in buying products that are not made in china .
they made sure they closed down their european factories and opened them up in china where life and labor is cheap and their greed insures they get the best profit .
anyone know where you can still buy toys that are not made in china ?
i will be your first customer . - kaye poole , britain so far , the british and germans are not the focus .
china likes to target the betrayer and the frontier , namely france and the us .
and so far the wasp has succeeded in uniting the catholics , and showing the chinese that the frenchmen are nothing better .
let 's see the reaction of the germans , and see how the anglo can work with the saxons as it unfolds .
china 's dream has definitely been interrupted .
rem period is gone - a step closer to be awakened .
remember what napoleon said about a sleeping lion ? - berg mcfly , china it is unfortunate that china can browbeat the european union on the basis of the economic leverage it enjoys today vis-a-vis europe .
that the eu chooses to remain a mute spectator on the tibet crackdown and refrain from officially recognizing the dalai lama amounts to lending credibility to the religious persecution of christians sponsored by the atheist regime in beijing . do we assume that the rich european tradition of promoting democratic values and peaceful coexistence is fading day by day ?
how else can the european union presidency ignore the reality of 46 christians being arrested for holding a bible class and worshiping in a private home without government permission ?
perhaps it is time that the european citizens decide whether or not to support a tyrannical regime that does not even believe in granting the christians , muslims and tibetan buddhist minorities the right and freedom to quietly express their faith . - seema sengupta , india i think the eu should send a large fact-finding mission to tibet to see the real situation without chinese officials and spies with them then to decide it .
tibetans should have freedom to use their own language and live according to their own style .

however , eu officials warn that there is still a long road ahead for ankara . austrian foreign minister ursala plassnik pledged on monday , april 21 , to keep european union membership negotiations with turkey open , but stressed that austria 's position was that the result of the talks would not necessarily mean that turkey will join the union . speaking at a joint press conference in ankara with her turkish counterpart ali babacan , plassnik said it was important that accession talks continue and that the door is not shut on turkey but that the talks would not necessarily lead to full membership . " our goal is to have turkey as a stable modern dynamic , successful partner , as close a partner of the european union as is imaginable , " plassnik said .
" we are aware that for the turkish side , the one and only exclusive goal is membership in the european union .
i have been trying to enlarge the scope of imagination on that specific point ...
i could imagine a tailor-made turkey-european union community . " babacan repeated that turkey 's aim was full membership and refused to be drawn on alternatives .
he stressed that any decision on turkish membership would occur in the future and that continued people-to- people ties would result in public opinion in europe supporting turkish membership . " the membership decision will not be made on yesterday 's turkey or today 's turkey , but on the turkey of the future , " babacan said . turkey facing domestic tests as eu watches closely bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : turkey 's constitutional court is hearing the closure case on the issue of the potential closure by the turkish constitutional court of the ruling justice and development party -lrb- akp -rrb- for allegedly becoming a focus of anti-secular activities , a topic that has led to criticism from the european union of the turkish legal system , plassnik said the eu should not act as an international police officer .
it was up to turkey to debate the role of secularism in society . babacan refused to speculate on what might happen if his party is closed , saying that he believed turkey would find a solution . " this year our country will go through other tests but i believe our country will pass these tests , " he said . the two foreign ministers said they had agreed to enhance cooperation against terrorism with plassnik making it clear that austria considered the separatist kurdish workers ' party -lrb- pkk -rrb- a terrorist organization . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : austria 's foreign minister ursula plassnik " we are fighting against terrorism with the same determination as others , " plassnik said in response to a question that austria had last year allowed a senior pkk member to flee to iraq .
" i regret that in the turkish media there was a wrong impression concerning austria 's determination to fight terrorism , including the pkk . " turkish media condemned austria 's actions last year when it allegedly allowed riza altun , a senior pkk representative in europe , to escape to iraq despite the fact he was wanted by turkish authorities .
the actions of the austrian government in allowing altun to go free were also condemned by the turkish foreign ministry . rehn warns of akp closure case impact plassnik 's visit coincided with the publication of an interview given by the eu 's enlargement commissioner olli rehn in which he announced that the eu was planning to open two new chapters in turkey 's accession negotiations in june . however , he added that ankara was facing a more critical phase than at any time since its negotiations to join the european union began three years ago . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : rehn hopes turkey will emerge stronger from its trials rehn said in an interview with the german daily die welt that the closure case against the akp was adding extra pressure on ankara at a time when its progress on necessary reforms was also faltering . rehn predicted turkey could emerge with its democratic institutions strengthened once the closure case was resolved , provided that all sides showed willingness to compromise and the necessary reforms were pushed through . delays on both sides hinders turkey 's progress rehn said he also expected turkey to become a member of eu within 10 to 15 years should it continue reforms decisively , according to a separate report from turkey 's anatolian news agency . " we expect freedom of expression for all , " rehn said .
" we expect that the rights of women and minorities are protected . " the eu has been particularly critical of strict laws governing the offence of " insulting turkishness , " under which writers have been prosecuted in the past . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : journalists like ocak isik yurtcu have been jailed in turkey in addition to turkey sticking to its reform course , the enlargement commissioner added that the eu should also play its part by standing by its commitments on turkish accession .
regarding slow progress on the accession process , which began in 2005 , rehn said six of 35 policy chapters in the process had been opened and a further two - business law and intellectual property - would be opened in june . the eu suspended negotiations in eight chapters because of turkey 's refusal to open its ports to greek cypriot vessels . further chapters , including energy , would be opened under the french eu presidency in the second half of the year , rehn said . turkey angered by talk of privileged partnership the french eu presidency may prove to be another critical phase for turkey 's hopes . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : merkel and sarkozy both advocate privileged partnership french president nicolas sarkozy , together with german chancellor angela merkel , has suggested turkey should accept a privileged partnership with the eu and not full eu membership . this stance has angered prime minister tayyip erdogan who has said that his country would settle for nothing less than full membership of the european union . " turkey can not accept any alternative which is going to rule out full membership of the eu , " erdogan said earlier this month .
" an enlargement that is going to embrace turkey is not going to undermine the eu , is not going to weaken the eu . " at the nato summit in bucharest this month , sarkozy attempted conciliation by telling turkish president abdullah gul that france did not oppose the opening of negotiations chapters with turkey and that there would be special attention paid to the negotiations during the french eu presidency to strengthen turkey 's integration into the eu . dw staff / dpa -lrb- nda -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

eupol is also assisting other western training missions and is now spreading its operations to cover the whole country .
solana praised the progress that afghanistan has made in the past several years since the fall of the taliban , saying " tremendous efforts have been done in education .
the tremendous effort ... done in health is something that we take into great consideration . "
europe is the second largest contributor after the united states to military and development efforts in afghanistan since the 2001 fall of the extremist taliban regime , and president karzai praised the european union as " among the best supporters of afghanistan . "
high hopes for paris donors ' conference bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : karzai thanked the eu and hoped for continued help during their discussions , solana and karzai discussed a number of other issues including security , governance , and rule of law in afghanistan , as well as the international preparation for the afghan donors ' conference in paris in june .
" this is the moment to reflect on what we , the international community , can do , working in conjunction with our afghan partners , to enhance our efforts , " he said of the up-coming conference .
afghanistan is hoping the donors ' meeting in paris will secure $ 50 billion -lrb- 30 billion euros -rrb- in aid to implement a five-year development plan , finance minister anwar-ul haq ahadi said monday .
the plan , called the national development strategy -lrb- ands -rrb- , was presented to donors at an " aid effectiveness " conference in kabul at the same time as solana 's meeting .
based on a year of wide-ranging consultations , it will be assessed by the world bank and international monetary fund , ahadi told reporters after the meeting .
the finalized strategy would become the basis of requests from donors at the june conference , he said .
" for this strategy , the afghan government has asked the world for $ 50 billion in aid for five years , " he said .
the ands was a comprehensive plan , the minister said .
" all walks of government are included : security , good governance , financial growth , important issues such as counter-narcotics , capacity building and equal rights of women ... "
afghan solutions for afghan problems bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the rebuilding and enforcement of security goes on the plan underlines europe 's commitment to restoring afghanistan 's infrastructure and the return of the power to the people .
in written comments for the daily outlook afghanistan newspaper , solana said it was " important that afghan solutions are found to afghan problems . "
and success would involve more than a military effort to eliminate extremists , whose ranks are said to be reinforced , trained and equipped by militant camps in neighboring pakistan .
" the approach must be global and joined up , encompassing the rule of law , development , reconstruction , economic growth , rural development and education , " solana said .
" it is very important that the efforts should be led by afghans , " he said , reflecting growing demands by karzai and his government for more ownership of the work in their country .
despite the paris conference 's emphasis on civilian assistance , it is likely that the financial cost and loss of soldiers killed fighting taliban extremists will also be discussed , at a time of growing doubts within some allied nations about the mammoth mission , which has been criticized as wasteful and disjointed .
pakistan visit on itinerary after leaving kabul , solana was expected for talks with pakistan 's president pervez musharraf in islamabad on tuesday .
solana is expected to reiterate the eu 's support for the democratic process in pakistan .
" we have to continue to show our support and engagement , in particular after the -lsb- recent -rsb- political developments -lsb- in pakistan -rsb- , " an official from solana 's office said ahead of the trip .

not all reader comments have been published .
dw-world.de reserves the right to edit for length and appropriateness of content . if the slovenian presidency of the eu bends to chinese political pressure , then democracy has been struck a deadly blow .
the decision to invite the tibetan head of state , his holiness the dalai lama , must be made with openness in mind , not political pressures .
so in effect china has used its political power to again snuff out democracy and that is a crying shame . what i suspect here is that slovenia has some links with china , but be they political or trade they must not interfere with the practice of open democracy in europe .
so slovenia must know why it used its eu presidency as a means to further its own position with china .
the eu must make clear to slovenia that it is not a forum of deceit .
case closed . - kenneth v. tellis , canada bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : one reader recommended sanctions on chinese products yes , as europeans believing in human rights there should be sanctions against china .
as producers ourselves , there should be sanctions against china .
many western goods are counterfeit and made in china but sold illegally in europe regardless of copyright and patent ; many products that are taken in the mouth -lrb- toothpaste , etc , -rrb- have been found to contain unfit ingredients ; many well-known toy brands that we buy for our children that are made in china have toxic ingredients , and many people , such as prisoners , are forced to work as slaves to create the great chinese economic progress . but the big multi-nationals have made sure we do n't have much choice in buying products that are not made in china .
they made sure they closed down their european factories and opened them up in china where life and labor is cheap and their greed insures they get the best profit .
anyone know where you can still buy toys that are not made in china ?
i will be your first customer . - kaye poole , britain so far , the british and germans are not the focus .
china likes to target the betrayer and the frontier , namely france and the us .
and so far the wasp has succeeded in uniting the catholics , and showing the chinese that the frenchmen are nothing better .
let 's see the reaction of the germans , and see how the anglo can work with the saxons as it unfolds .
china 's dream has definitely been interrupted .
rem period is gone - a step closer to be awakened .
remember what napoleon said about a sleeping lion ? - berg mcfly , china it is unfortunate that china can browbeat the european union on the basis of the economic leverage it enjoys today vis-a-vis europe .
that the eu chooses to remain a mute spectator on the tibet crackdown and refrain from officially recognizing the dalai lama amounts to lending credibility to the religious persecution of christians sponsored by the atheist regime in beijing . do we assume that the rich european tradition of promoting democratic values and peaceful coexistence is fading day by day ?
how else can the european union presidency ignore the reality of 46 christians being arrested for holding a bible class and worshiping in a private home without government permission ?
perhaps it is time that the european citizens decide whether or not to support a tyrannical regime that does not even believe in granting the christians , muslims and tibetan buddhist minorities the right and freedom to quietly express their faith . - seema sengupta , india i think the eu should send a large fact-finding mission to tibet to see the real situation without chinese officials and spies with them then to decide it .
tibetans should have freedom to use their own language and live according to their own style .
tibet has its own language , culture and customs .
chinese leaders in tibet do n't know them and ca n't even speak tibetan . - tsering , china compiled by dw staff -lrb- kjb -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?
dw-world.de eu presidency will not invite dalai lama to brussels the eu 's slovenian presidency said that it would not invite the dalai lama to brussels to meet with the bloc 's foreign ministers , as paris has proposed , but would not rule out other contacts with the tibetan leader .
-lrb- 19.04.2008 -rrb- economic sanctions wrong way to deal with china , experts say beijing 's reaction to the protests in tibet has prompted germans to call for a boycott of the olympics and economic sanctions .
business representatives are now asking people to consider the consequences of such a move .
-lrb- 16.04.2008 -rrb- poll : europeans see china as biggest threat to global stability europeans see china as being a greater threat to global stability than the united states or iran , an opinion poll published tuesday , april 15 , discovered .

the decision to invite the tibetan head of state , his holiness the dalai lama , must be made with openness in mind , not political pressures .
so in effect china has used its political power to again snuff out democracy and that is a crying shame . what i suspect here is that slovenia has some links with china , but be they political or trade they must not interfere with the practice of open democracy in europe .

that the eu chooses to remain a mute spectator on the tibet crackdown and refrain from officially recognizing the dalai lama amounts to lending credibility to the religious persecution of christians sponsored by the atheist regime in beijing . do we assume that the rich european tradition of promoting democratic values and peaceful coexistence is fading day by day ?
how else can the european union presidency ignore the reality of 46 christians being arrested for holding a bible class and worshiping in a private home without government permission ?
perhaps it is time that the european citizens decide whether or not to support a tyrannical regime that does not even believe in granting the christians , muslims and tibetan buddhist minorities the right and freedom to quietly express their faith . - seema sengupta , india i think the eu should send a large fact-finding mission to tibet to see the real situation without chinese officials and spies with them then to decide it .
tibetans should have freedom to use their own language and live according to their own style .

dw-world.de spoke to von richthofen biographer joachim castan about the man behind the myth . the prussian nobleman - dubbed the red baron because of the color of his aircraft - shot down some 80 allied planes before his death at the age of 25 .
his life has become the stuff of legend .
a new film about the red baron , which opened in germany this month , also revives the heroic image .
joachim castan , 41 , was the first historian to write a biography of this famous figure .
the biographer and documentary filmmaker spent three years researching the project , gaining exclusive access to previously unpublished writings and letters .
the book , called " die ganze geschichte " -lrb- the whole story -rrb- and published in 2007 , reveals a far more complex character .
dw-world.de : did your image of von richthofen change in the course of your research ?
joachim castan : i must admit that i had an image of von richthofen before i started my research of him as the last true gentleman of the skies in a dehumanized , industrialized brutal war , heroically participating in airborne duels .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : castan 's preconceptions were overturned while working on the book as i became immersed in the material , i realized that there was a well-maintained von richthofen myth .
the myth propagates the idea that von richthofen forced pilots to land .
he shot down aircraft , but he ensured , if at all possible , that the pilot survived , so that the whole encounter took on the character of a sporting match to determine the better pilot and marksman .
this turned out to be an image created by the german propaganda machine in 1917 .
it needed a young , good-looking radiant hero , a victor who could be served up to a relatively demoralized society . this image of the lonely gentleman of the skies was then taken up in the 1920s and further elaborated upon by the americans , who wanted to sell a romantic notion of air combat .
and who was the man you discovered ?
he was completely different .
without doubt , he was extremely courageous and extremely ambitious , but he was also cold-blooded .
his goal was to shoot down as many aircraft as possible .
in his own writings , he writes quite openly : " i never get into an aircraft for fun .
i aim first for the head of the pilot , or rather at the head of the observer , if there was one . "
i do n't think that von richthofen would have described himself as a hero .
he was doing his duty to defend his fatherland .
at the same time , he was satisfying his passion for hunting .
he was already a passionate hunter at the age of 11 and was taken hunting by his father .
aim , shoot , destroy target - he took his passion for hunting to the skies , transposing it one-to-one .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : von richthofen around 1917 i also do not think he was a brutal killer .
von richthofen also reflected partially upon what he did .
he wrote that he always felt terrible when he came off duty .
he used to come home and lock himself in his room for hours and refuse to talk to anyone .
from mid-1917 he also realized that the war was probably going to be lost .
for me he is a tragic figure , fighting fanatically , remorselessly , in a war that is lost .
what made him into the kind of person he was ?
his mother was extraordinarily ambitious and did n't think much of her husband .
he retired early and did not have a very successful career as an officer .
all of the family 's ambitions were invested first in the eldest son , manfred , and then in the second son , lothar , who was also a fighter pilot .
the young manfred was sent at the age of 11 to a prussian cadet school , which were pretty infamous .
the children were honed into soldiers and there was no scope for any ifs , ands or buts .
the intellectual aspect of schooling was largely neglected .
the children had to function as soldiers first and foremost .
it 's interesting : if you look at von richthofen 's personal development , it showed that , first of all , he functioned in this way .
then a year before his death , he started to come to his senses and think about his actions .
i think he gradually realized that he had arrived at a dead end .
you say that the red baron myth was created in 1917 .
it served then as propaganda intended to boost morale .
but why is it now being revived ?
what is the reason for the current interest in this figure ?
in germany currently , we are thinking about war , heroes , and war heroes , we are rethinking our position .
deployment in a war in afghanistan would have been unthinkable in germany 10 years ago .
at the same time , we are thinking about reintroducing medals to reward bravery .
for germany , that is a very unusual situation because of our history , the third reich and the hitler dictatorship .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : matthias schweighoefer plays the red baron in the new film in other countries , in france , britain and the united states , hero cults exist .
in germany , they ceased to exist after 1945 .
i believe that there is a certain tendency toward reintroducing heroes , to hold them up as examples , as military models and to make military conflict socially acceptable again .
what do you think about the portrayal of von richthofen in nikolai muellerschoen 's new film , " the red baron ? "
the film revives the richthofen myth in parts .
it turns him into a radiant figure , someone who becomes a good person / pacifist through his love for a nurse .
it is a way of seeing von richthofen that is popular at the moment - as a sort of broken hero who is relatively blameless in some respects .
there are those responsible for conducting the war , who are evil , and the good hero .
this is a distinction that people like to make at the moment . interview : julie gregson send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

dw-world.de spoke to von richthofen biographer joachim castan about the man behind the myth . the prussian nobleman - dubbed the red baron because of the color of his aircraft - shot down some 80 allied planes before his death at the age of 25 .
his life has become the stuff of legend .
a new film about the red baron , which opened in germany this month , also revives the heroic image .
joachim castan , 41 , was the first historian to write a biography of this famous figure .
the biographer and documentary filmmaker spent three years researching the project , gaining exclusive access to previously unpublished writings and letters .
the book , called " die ganze geschichte " -lrb- the whole story -rrb- and published in 2007 , reveals a far more complex character .
dw-world.de : did your image of von richthofen change in the course of your research ?
joachim castan : i must admit that i had an image of von richthofen before i started my research of him as the last true gentleman of the skies in a dehumanized , industrialized brutal war , heroically participating in airborne duels .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : castan 's preconceptions were overturned while working on the book as i became immersed in the material , i realized that there was a well-maintained von richthofen myth .
the myth propagates the idea that von richthofen forced pilots to land .
he shot down aircraft , but he ensured , if at all possible , that the pilot survived , so that the whole encounter took on the character of a sporting match to determine the better pilot and marksman .
this turned out to be an image created by the german propaganda machine in 1917 .
it needed a young , good-looking radiant hero , a victor who could be served up to a relatively demoralized society . this image of the lonely gentleman of the skies was then taken up in the 1920s and further elaborated upon by the americans , who wanted to sell a romantic notion of air combat .
and who was the man you discovered ?
he was completely different .
without doubt , he was extremely courageous and extremely ambitious , but he was also cold-blooded .
his goal was to shoot down as many aircraft as possible .
in his own writings , he writes quite openly : " i never get into an aircraft for fun .
i aim first for the head of the pilot , or rather at the head of the observer , if there was one . "
i do n't think that von richthofen would have described himself as a hero .
he was doing his duty to defend his fatherland .
at the same time , he was satisfying his passion for hunting .
he was already a passionate hunter at the age of 11 and was taken hunting by his father .
aim , shoot , destroy target - he took his passion for hunting to the skies , transposing it one-to-one .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : von richthofen around 1917 i also do not think he was a brutal killer .
von richthofen also reflected partially upon what he did .
he wrote that he always felt terrible when he came off duty .
he used to come home and lock himself in his room for hours and refuse to talk to anyone .
from mid-1917 he also realized that the war was probably going to be lost .
for me he is a tragic figure , fighting fanatically , remorselessly , in a war that is lost .
what made him into the kind of person he was ?
his mother was extraordinarily ambitious and did n't think much of her husband .
he retired early and did not have a very successful career as an officer .
all of the family 's ambitions were invested first in the eldest son , manfred , and then in the second son , lothar , who was also a fighter pilot .
the young manfred was sent at the age of 11 to a prussian cadet school , which were pretty infamous .
the children were honed into soldiers and there was no scope for any ifs , ands or buts .
the intellectual aspect of schooling was largely neglected .
the children had to function as soldiers first and foremost .
it 's interesting : if you look at von richthofen 's personal development , it showed that , first of all , he functioned in this way .
then a year before his death , he started to come to his senses and think about his actions .
i think he gradually realized that he had arrived at a dead end .
you say that the red baron myth was created in 1917 .
it served then as propaganda intended to boost morale .
but why is it now being revived ?
what is the reason for the current interest in this figure ?
in germany currently , we are thinking about war , heroes , and war heroes , we are rethinking our position .
deployment in a war in afghanistan would have been unthinkable in germany 10 years ago .
at the same time , we are thinking about reintroducing medals to reward bravery .
for germany , that is a very unusual situation because of our history , the third reich and the hitler dictatorship .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : matthias schweighoefer plays the red baron in the new film in other countries , in france , britain and the united states , hero cults exist .
in germany , they ceased to exist after 1945 .
i believe that there is a certain tendency toward reintroducing heroes , to hold them up as examples , as military models and to make military conflict socially acceptable again .
what do you think about the portrayal of von richthofen in nikolai muellerschoen 's new film , " the red baron ? "
the film revives the richthofen myth in parts .
it turns him into a radiant figure , someone who becomes a good person / pacifist through his love for a nurse .
it is a way of seeing von richthofen that is popular at the moment - as a sort of broken hero who is relatively blameless in some respects .
there are those responsible for conducting the war , who are evil , and the good hero .
this is a distinction that people like to make at the moment . interview : julie gregson send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

however , eu officials warn that there is still a long road ahead for ankara . austrian foreign minister ursala plassnik pledged on monday , april 21 , to keep european union membership negotiations with turkey open , but stressed that austria 's position was that the result of the talks would not necessarily mean that turkey will join the union . speaking at a joint press conference in ankara with her turkish counterpart ali babacan , plassnik said it was important that accession talks continue and that the door is not shut on turkey but that the talks would not necessarily lead to full membership . " our goal is to have turkey as a stable modern dynamic , successful partner , as close a partner of the european union as is imaginable , " plassnik said .
" we are aware that for the turkish side , the one and only exclusive goal is membership in the european union .
i have been trying to enlarge the scope of imagination on that specific point ...
i could imagine a tailor-made turkey-european union community . " babacan repeated that turkey 's aim was full membership and refused to be drawn on alternatives .
he stressed that any decision on turkish membership would occur in the future and that continued people-to- people ties would result in public opinion in europe supporting turkish membership . " the membership decision will not be made on yesterday 's turkey or today 's turkey , but on the turkey of the future , " babacan said . turkey facing domestic tests as eu watches closely bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : turkey 's constitutional court is hearing the closure case on the issue of the potential closure by the turkish constitutional court of the ruling justice and development party -lrb- akp -rrb- for allegedly becoming a focus of anti-secular activities , a topic that has led to criticism from the european union of the turkish legal system , plassnik said the eu should not act as an international police officer .
it was up to turkey to debate the role of secularism in society . babacan refused to speculate on what might happen if his party is closed , saying that he believed turkey would find a solution . " this year our country will go through other tests but i believe our country will pass these tests , " he said . the two foreign ministers said they had agreed to enhance cooperation against terrorism with plassnik making it clear that austria considered the separatist kurdish workers ' party -lrb- pkk -rrb- a terrorist organization . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : austria 's foreign minister ursula plassnik " we are fighting against terrorism with the same determination as others , " plassnik said in response to a question that austria had last year allowed a senior pkk member to flee to iraq .
" i regret that in the turkish media there was a wrong impression concerning austria 's determination to fight terrorism , including the pkk . " turkish media condemned austria 's actions last year when it allegedly allowed riza altun , a senior pkk representative in europe , to escape to iraq despite the fact he was wanted by turkish authorities .
the actions of the austrian government in allowing altun to go free were also condemned by the turkish foreign ministry . rehn warns of akp closure case impact plassnik 's visit coincided with the publication of an interview given by the eu 's enlargement commissioner olli rehn in which he announced that the eu was planning to open two new chapters in turkey 's accession negotiations in june . however , he added that ankara was facing a more critical phase than at any time since its negotiations to join the european union began three years ago . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : rehn hopes turkey will emerge stronger from its trials rehn said in an interview with the german daily die welt that the closure case against the akp was adding extra pressure on ankara at a time when its progress on necessary reforms was also faltering . rehn predicted turkey could emerge with its democratic institutions strengthened once the closure case was resolved , provided that all sides showed willingness to compromise and the necessary reforms were pushed through . delays on both sides hinders turkey 's progress rehn said he also expected turkey to become a member of eu within 10 to 15 years should it continue reforms decisively , according to a separate report from turkey 's anatolian news agency . " we expect freedom of expression for all , " rehn said .
" we expect that the rights of women and minorities are protected . " the eu has been particularly critical of strict laws governing the offence of " insulting turkishness , " under which writers have been prosecuted in the past . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : journalists like ocak isik yurtcu have been jailed in turkey in addition to turkey sticking to its reform course , the enlargement commissioner added that the eu should also play its part by standing by its commitments on turkish accession .
regarding slow progress on the accession process , which began in 2005 , rehn said six of 35 policy chapters in the process had been opened and a further two - business law and intellectual property - would be opened in june . the eu suspended negotiations in eight chapters because of turkey 's refusal to open its ports to greek cypriot vessels . further chapters , including energy , would be opened under the french eu presidency in the second half of the year , rehn said . turkey angered by talk of privileged partnership the french eu presidency may prove to be another critical phase for turkey 's hopes . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : merkel and sarkozy both advocate privileged partnership french president nicolas sarkozy , together with german chancellor angela merkel , has suggested turkey should accept a privileged partnership with the eu and not full eu membership . this stance has angered prime minister tayyip erdogan who has said that his country would settle for nothing less than full membership of the european union . " turkey can not accept any alternative which is going to rule out full membership of the eu , " erdogan said earlier this month .
" an enlargement that is going to embrace turkey is not going to undermine the eu , is not going to weaken the eu . " at the nato summit in bucharest this month , sarkozy attempted conciliation by telling turkish president abdullah gul that france did not oppose the opening of negotiations chapters with turkey and that there would be special attention paid to the negotiations during the french eu presidency to strengthen turkey 's integration into the eu . dw staff / dpa -lrb- nda -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

it was up to turkey to debate the role of secularism in society . babacan refused to speculate on what might happen if his party is closed , saying that he believed turkey would find a solution . " this year our country will go through other tests but i believe our country will pass these tests , " he said . the two foreign ministers said they had agreed to enhance cooperation against terrorism with plassnik making it clear that austria considered the separatist kurdish workers ' party -lrb- pkk -rrb- a terrorist organization . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : austria 's foreign minister ursula plassnik " we are fighting against terrorism with the same determination as others , " plassnik said in response to a question that austria had last year allowed a senior pkk member to flee to iraq .
" i regret that in the turkish media there was a wrong impression concerning austria 's determination to fight terrorism , including the pkk . " turkish media condemned austria 's actions last year when it allegedly allowed riza altun , a senior pkk representative in europe , to escape to iraq despite the fact he was wanted by turkish authorities .
the actions of the austrian government in allowing altun to go free were also condemned by the turkish foreign ministry . rehn warns of akp closure case impact plassnik 's visit coincided with the publication of an interview given by the eu 's enlargement commissioner olli rehn in which he announced that the eu was planning to open two new chapters in turkey 's accession negotiations in june . however , he added that ankara was facing a more critical phase than at any time since its negotiations to join the european union began three years ago . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : rehn hopes turkey will emerge stronger from its trials rehn said in an interview with the german daily die welt that the closure case against the akp was adding extra pressure on ankara at a time when its progress on necessary reforms was also faltering . rehn predicted turkey could emerge with its democratic institutions strengthened once the closure case was resolved , provided that all sides showed willingness to compromise and the necessary reforms were pushed through . delays on both sides hinders turkey 's progress rehn said he also expected turkey to become a member of eu within 10 to 15 years should it continue reforms decisively , according to a separate report from turkey 's anatolian news agency . " we expect freedom of expression for all , " rehn said .
" we expect that the rights of women and minorities are protected .

regarding slow progress on the accession process , which began in 2005 , rehn said six of 35 policy chapters in the process had been opened and a further two - business law and intellectual property - would be opened in june . the eu suspended negotiations in eight chapters because of turkey 's refusal to open its ports to greek cypriot vessels . further chapters , including energy , would be opened under the french eu presidency in the second half of the year , rehn said . turkey angered by talk of privileged partnership the french eu presidency may prove to be another critical phase for turkey 's hopes . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : merkel and sarkozy both advocate privileged partnership french president nicolas sarkozy , together with german chancellor angela merkel , has suggested turkey should accept a privileged partnership with the eu and not full eu membership . this stance has angered prime minister tayyip erdogan who has said that his country would settle for nothing less than full membership of the european union . " turkey can not accept any alternative which is going to rule out full membership of the eu , " erdogan said earlier this month .

however , eu officials warn that there is still a long road ahead for ankara . austrian foreign minister ursala plassnik pledged on monday , april 21 , to keep european union membership negotiations with turkey open , but stressed that austria 's position was that the result of the talks would not necessarily mean that turkey will join the union . speaking at a joint press conference in ankara with her turkish counterpart ali babacan , plassnik said it was important that accession talks continue and that the door is not shut on turkey but that the talks would not necessarily lead to full membership . " our goal is to have turkey as a stable modern dynamic , successful partner , as close a partner of the european union as is imaginable , " plassnik said .
" we are aware that for the turkish side , the one and only exclusive goal is membership in the european union .
i have been trying to enlarge the scope of imagination on that specific point ...
i could imagine a tailor-made turkey-european union community . " babacan repeated that turkey 's aim was full membership and refused to be drawn on alternatives .
he stressed that any decision on turkish membership would occur in the future and that continued people-to- people ties would result in public opinion in europe supporting turkish membership . " the membership decision will not be made on yesterday 's turkey or today 's turkey , but on the turkey of the future , " babacan said . turkey facing domestic tests as eu watches closely bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : turkey 's constitutional court is hearing the closure case on the issue of the potential closure by the turkish constitutional court of the ruling justice and development party -lrb- akp -rrb- for allegedly becoming a focus of anti-secular activities , a topic that has led to criticism from the european union of the turkish legal system , plassnik said the eu should not act as an international police officer .
it was up to turkey to debate the role of secularism in society . babacan refused to speculate on what might happen if his party is closed , saying that he believed turkey would find a solution . " this year our country will go through other tests but i believe our country will pass these tests , " he said . the two foreign ministers said they had agreed to enhance cooperation against terrorism with plassnik making it clear that austria considered the separatist kurdish workers ' party -lrb- pkk -rrb- a terrorist organization . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : austria 's foreign minister ursula plassnik " we are fighting against terrorism with the same determination as others , " plassnik said in response to a question that austria had last year allowed a senior pkk member to flee to iraq .
" i regret that in the turkish media there was a wrong impression concerning austria 's determination to fight terrorism , including the pkk . " turkish media condemned austria 's actions last year when it allegedly allowed riza altun , a senior pkk representative in europe , to escape to iraq despite the fact he was wanted by turkish authorities .
the actions of the austrian government in allowing altun to go free were also condemned by the turkish foreign ministry . rehn warns of akp closure case impact plassnik 's visit coincided with the publication of an interview given by the eu 's enlargement commissioner olli rehn in which he announced that the eu was planning to open two new chapters in turkey 's accession negotiations in june . however , he added that ankara was facing a more critical phase than at any time since its negotiations to join the european union began three years ago . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : rehn hopes turkey will emerge stronger from its trials rehn said in an interview with the german daily die welt that the closure case against the akp was adding extra pressure on ankara at a time when its progress on necessary reforms was also faltering . rehn predicted turkey could emerge with its democratic institutions strengthened once the closure case was resolved , provided that all sides showed willingness to compromise and the necessary reforms were pushed through . delays on both sides hinders turkey 's progress rehn said he also expected turkey to become a member of eu within 10 to 15 years should it continue reforms decisively , according to a separate report from turkey 's anatolian news agency . " we expect freedom of expression for all , " rehn said .
" we expect that the rights of women and minorities are protected . " the eu has been particularly critical of strict laws governing the offence of " insulting turkishness , " under which writers have been prosecuted in the past . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : journalists like ocak isik yurtcu have been jailed in turkey in addition to turkey sticking to its reform course , the enlargement commissioner added that the eu should also play its part by standing by its commitments on turkish accession .
regarding slow progress on the accession process , which began in 2005 , rehn said six of 35 policy chapters in the process had been opened and a further two - business law and intellectual property - would be opened in june . the eu suspended negotiations in eight chapters because of turkey 's refusal to open its ports to greek cypriot vessels . further chapters , including energy , would be opened under the french eu presidency in the second half of the year , rehn said . turkey angered by talk of privileged partnership the french eu presidency may prove to be another critical phase for turkey 's hopes . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : merkel and sarkozy both advocate privileged partnership french president nicolas sarkozy , together with german chancellor angela merkel , has suggested turkey should accept a privileged partnership with the eu and not full eu membership . this stance has angered prime minister tayyip erdogan who has said that his country would settle for nothing less than full membership of the european union .

" we have to stand behind our decision , " steinmeier said , adding that western capitals have engaged in discussions with beijing for decades over the human rights abuses in china and the tibetan independence movement . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : steinmeier : " we have to stand behind our decision " steinmeier said he sees his job as being to deflate tensions between tibet and the chinese government , a conflict that has unleashed protests worldwide and especially in cities along the route of the olympic torch relay . steinmeier urges a broad view this job is made easier by the fact that china is eager to make the olympic games a success , steinmeier said . " we have to continue trying to convince the chinese , " he said .
" i 've been on the phone three times with the chinese foreign minister and urged him not to use force " when dealing with protesters . steinmeier said the near daily aggravation of the situation is " not acceptable , " but also called for western governments to remain aware of the sea-change taking place in chinese society . " in a very short time , the country has brought 300 million people from bitter poverty to a humble prosperity , " he said .
" great parts of the developing world look to china with interest and sympathy . " french president nicolas sarkozy appeared to be backpedaling on his hard line , as anti-french sentiment is mushrooming in beijing .
the chinese have begun boycotts of carrefour and held numerous demonstrations over the weekend outside the french retail giant 's stores in china . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : sarkozy is not eager to harm relations with china sarkozy , who previously has urged the chinese government to open talks with the dalai lama and has suggested he might boycott the olympic opening ceremonies in beijing on aug .
8 , decided to send former prime minister jean-pierre raffarin and the presidential foreign affairs advisor , jean-david levitte , to china to calm bilateral tensions . raffarin is scheduled to travel to beijing on wednesday to meet with chinese premier wen jiabao .
he will be carrying a message from sarkozy addressed to the chinese leadership . personal apology from le president in an effort to calm chinese anger over the protest-plagued progress of the olympic flame through france , sarkozy sent a note to disabled female athlete jin jing , who had tried to defend the flame during its run through paris . " i wish to tell you that i was shocked by the attacks you were subjected to on april 7 in paris , " sarkozy wrote .
the letter was delivered to her monday in shanghai by french senate president christian poncelet . " it is understandable that the chinese people were hurt , and i firmly condemn -lsb- those acts -rsb- , " the french president wrote . jin jing , a 27-year-old para-olympics fencer who lost her leg to cancer as a child , became a heroine in china after pictures were flashed around the world showing her protecting the torch from pro-tibetan demonstrators from her wheelchair . the torch was extinguished at least twice during its relay in paris , and the relay itself was cut short because of the numerous anti-chinese incidents along its route . counter-demonstrations in europe meanwhile , chinese in china and in europe have begun staging counter-demonstrations , protesting what they say is a misleading depiction of china in the media and biased media coverage of the torch relay . on saturday , april 19 , several thousand chinese rallied in paris , britain and berlin , supporting the beijing olympics . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the torch relay met protest in paris around 3,000 pro-chinese activists demonstrated in the central potsdamer platz area of berlin , gripping banners with messages like " media = untruths , " and " china olympia , one world , one dream . " on the same day in paris , nearly 4,000 chinese students and other expatriates gathered in the place de la republique , according to police estimates .
they wore t-shirts with the slogan " one china , one family , " and waved signs criticizing the western media . " we 're demonstrating against the disinformation in the french and western media , to promote the olympic games and to construct a bridge between the french and chinese people - and not a wall as the media do , " one of the rally 's spokesmen , thierry liu , told the afp news service . more than 1,000 people , mainly students , also gathered outside the bbc 's offices in manchester , north-west england , while around 300 staged a demonstration outside the houses of parliament in london . the european commission on monday said people were free to show their displeasure with the west 's reaction to demonstrations in tibet and media coverage of the run-up to the 2008 olympics .

photo exhibition can be seen at the deutsche welle global media forum in june , as well as new york and tokyo this fall . germany ’ s international broadcaster and the foundation for international dialogue of the savings bank in bonn will bring attention to the fate of child soldiers with a special photo exhibition at the deutsche welle global media forum , from june 2-4 , 2008 .
“ forced to be cruel ” will open on june 2 , 2008 , at 4 p.m. at the world conference center in bonn and features 80 emotionally-charged photos .
this is the first time that this selection of photos will be on display , with other shows in new york and tokyo following this fall .
the participating , internationally-renown photographers include : lynsey addario , who documented child soldiers in sudan , martin adler -lrb- columbia -rrb- , riccardo gangale , cedric gerbehaye , roger lemoyne -lrb- congo -rrb- , tim hetherington -lrb- liberia -rrb- , peter mantello -lrb- burma -rrb- , q. sakamaki -lrb- afghanistan -rrb- , dominic sansoni -lrb- sri lanka -rrb- and ami vitale -lrb- nepal -rrb- .
the british photographer tim hetherington was recently awarded the “ oscar ” for press photographers , the world press photo prize , for his photo of a wounded american soldier in iraq .
photographer and film-maker peter mantello was the one who established the exhibition .
he is currently a professor at a university in japan .
mantello , along with the curator of the exhibition leora khan from new york , will be in bonn for the premiere .
according to international estimations , there are 300,000 child soldiers worldwide .
they are being recruited for regular armed forces and rebel groups and forced into combat .
in many conflicts , child soldiers are a constant component of the military infrastructure .
an important milestone in the fight against children in combat is the additional protocol to the un children ’ s rights convention , in which the signing nations agreed not to recruit anyone under the age of 18 .
equally important is the international criminal court in den haag .

" i can tell you on behalf of the european union - all the countries of the european union - that we will continue to be working with the government , working with the people of afghanistan for the long haul , " solana said after meeting with afghan president hamid karzai and other senior ministry officials in the fortified presidential palace in kabul on monday , april 21 .
" we , the people in europe , will continue to be helping the people of afghanistan to get what they deserve , the stability , prosperity and peace , " he added .
a renewed commitment bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : solana praised the on-going efforts in afghanistan solana jetted into the capital for a day-long trip which , he said in remarks published in a kabul daily monday , came at an important time of " renewed commitment by the international community " to struggling afghanistan .
following his arrival , solana paid a visit to the headquarters of the eu police mission in afghanistan -lrb- eupol -rrb- and met with police officials .
since june of last year , some 230 eupol officials have been training the upper echelons of the afghan security forces .
eupol is also assisting other western training missions and is now spreading its operations to cover the whole country .
solana praised the progress that afghanistan has made in the past several years since the fall of the taliban , saying " tremendous efforts have been done in education .
the tremendous effort ... done in health is something that we take into great consideration . "
europe is the second largest contributor after the united states to military and development efforts in afghanistan since the 2001 fall of the extremist taliban regime , and president karzai praised the european union as " among the best supporters of afghanistan . "
high hopes for paris donors ' conference bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : karzai thanked the eu and hoped for continued help during their discussions , solana and karzai discussed a number of other issues including security , governance , and rule of law in afghanistan , as well as the international preparation for the afghan donors ' conference in paris in june .
" this is the moment to reflect on what we , the international community , can do , working in conjunction with our afghan partners , to enhance our efforts , " he said of the up-coming conference .
afghanistan is hoping the donors ' meeting in paris will secure $ 50 billion -lrb- 30 billion euros -rrb- in aid to implement a five-year development plan , finance minister anwar-ul haq ahadi said monday .
the plan , called the national development strategy -lrb- ands -rrb- , was presented to donors at an " aid effectiveness " conference in kabul at the same time as solana 's meeting .
based on a year of wide-ranging consultations , it will be assessed by the world bank and international monetary fund , ahadi told reporters after the meeting .
the finalized strategy would become the basis of requests from donors at the june conference , he said .
" for this strategy , the afghan government has asked the world for $ 50 billion in aid for five years , " he said .
the ands was a comprehensive plan , the minister said .
" all walks of government are included : security , good governance , financial growth , important issues such as counter-narcotics , capacity building and equal rights of women ... "
afghan solutions for afghan problems bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the rebuilding and enforcement of security goes on the plan underlines europe 's commitment to restoring afghanistan 's infrastructure and the return of the power to the people .
in written comments for the daily outlook afghanistan newspaper , solana said it was " important that afghan solutions are found to afghan problems . "
and success would involve more than a military effort to eliminate extremists , whose ranks are said to be reinforced , trained and equipped by militant camps in neighboring pakistan .
" the approach must be global and joined up , encompassing the rule of law , development , reconstruction , economic growth , rural development and education , " solana said .
" it is very important that the efforts should be led by afghans , " he said , reflecting growing demands by karzai and his government for more ownership of the work in their country .
despite the paris conference 's emphasis on civilian assistance , it is likely that the financial cost and loss of soldiers killed fighting taliban extremists will also be discussed , at a time of growing doubts within some allied nations about the mammoth mission , which has been criticized as wasteful and disjointed .
pakistan visit on itinerary after leaving kabul , solana was expected for talks with pakistan 's president pervez musharraf in islamabad on tuesday .
solana is expected to reiterate the eu 's support for the democratic process in pakistan .
" we have to continue to show our support and engagement , in particular after the -lsb- recent -rsb- political developments -lsb- in pakistan -rsb- , " an official from solana 's office said ahead of the trip .

" i can tell you on behalf of the european union - all the countries of the european union - that we will continue to be working with the government , working with the people of afghanistan for the long haul , " solana said after meeting with afghan president hamid karzai and other senior ministry officials in the fortified presidential palace in kabul on monday , april 21 .
" we , the people in europe , will continue to be helping the people of afghanistan to get what they deserve , the stability , prosperity and peace , " he added .
a renewed commitment bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : solana praised the on-going efforts in afghanistan solana jetted into the capital for a day-long trip which , he said in remarks published in a kabul daily monday , came at an important time of " renewed commitment by the international community " to struggling afghanistan .
following his arrival , solana paid a visit to the headquarters of the eu police mission in afghanistan -lrb- eupol -rrb- and met with police officials .
since june of last year , some 230 eupol officials have been training the upper echelons of the afghan security forces .
eupol is also assisting other western training missions and is now spreading its operations to cover the whole country .
solana praised the progress that afghanistan has made in the past several years since the fall of the taliban , saying " tremendous efforts have been done in education .
the tremendous effort ... done in health is something that we take into great consideration . "
europe is the second largest contributor after the united states to military and development efforts in afghanistan since the 2001 fall of the extremist taliban regime , and president karzai praised the european union as " among the best supporters of afghanistan . "
high hopes for paris donors ' conference bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : karzai thanked the eu and hoped for continued help during their discussions , solana and karzai discussed a number of other issues including security , governance , and rule of law in afghanistan , as well as the international preparation for the afghan donors ' conference in paris in june .
" this is the moment to reflect on what we , the international community , can do , working in conjunction with our afghan partners , to enhance our efforts , " he said of the up-coming conference .
afghanistan is hoping the donors ' meeting in paris will secure $ 50 billion -lrb- 30 billion euros -rrb- in aid to implement a five-year development plan , finance minister anwar-ul haq ahadi said monday .
the plan , called the national development strategy -lrb- ands -rrb- , was presented to donors at an " aid effectiveness " conference in kabul at the same time as solana 's meeting .
based on a year of wide-ranging consultations , it will be assessed by the world bank and international monetary fund , ahadi told reporters after the meeting .
the finalized strategy would become the basis of requests from donors at the june conference , he said .
" for this strategy , the afghan government has asked the world for $ 50 billion in aid for five years , " he said .
the ands was a comprehensive plan , the minister said .
" all walks of government are included : security , good governance , financial growth , important issues such as counter-narcotics , capacity building and equal rights of women ... "
afghan solutions for afghan problems bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the rebuilding and enforcement of security goes on the plan underlines europe 's commitment to restoring afghanistan 's infrastructure and the return of the power to the people .
in written comments for the daily outlook afghanistan newspaper , solana said it was " important that afghan solutions are found to afghan problems . "
and success would involve more than a military effort to eliminate extremists , whose ranks are said to be reinforced , trained and equipped by militant camps in neighboring pakistan .
" the approach must be global and joined up , encompassing the rule of law , development , reconstruction , economic growth , rural development and education , " solana said .
" it is very important that the efforts should be led by afghans , " he said , reflecting growing demands by karzai and his government for more ownership of the work in their country .
despite the paris conference 's emphasis on civilian assistance , it is likely that the financial cost and loss of soldiers killed fighting taliban extremists will also be discussed , at a time of growing doubts within some allied nations about the mammoth mission , which has been criticized as wasteful and disjointed .
pakistan visit on itinerary after leaving kabul , solana was expected for talks with pakistan 's president pervez musharraf in islamabad on tuesday .
solana is expected to reiterate the eu 's support for the democratic process in pakistan .
" we have to continue to show our support and engagement , in particular after the -lsb- recent -rsb- political developments -lsb- in pakistan -rsb- , " an official from solana 's office said ahead of the trip .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : solana will meet president musharraf and prime minister gilani solana will be one of the most senior european union officials to meet pakistan 's new leaders following elections on feb .

his message to them would be that " the world looks at you , the eu looks at you , " she said .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de asia -pipe- 21.04.2008 eu disappoints some readers with response to china großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the eu does n't have plans to invite the dalai lama to brussels some readers wrote in to say they are disappointed with the eu 's response to china 's dealings with tibet . the following comments reflect the views of dw-world.de readers .
not all reader comments have been published .
dw-world.de reserves the right to edit for length and appropriateness of content . if the slovenian presidency of the eu bends to chinese political pressure , then democracy has been struck a deadly blow .
the decision to invite the tibetan head of state , his holiness the dalai lama , must be made with openness in mind , not political pressures .
so in effect china has used its political power to again snuff out democracy and that is a crying shame . what i suspect here is that slovenia has some links with china , but be they political or trade they must not interfere with the practice of open democracy in europe .
so slovenia must know why it used its eu presidency as a means to further its own position with china .
the eu must make clear to slovenia that it is not a forum of deceit .
case closed . - kenneth v. tellis , canada bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : one reader recommended sanctions on chinese products yes , as europeans believing in human rights there should be sanctions against china .
as producers ourselves , there should be sanctions against china .
many western goods are counterfeit and made in china but sold illegally in europe regardless of copyright and patent ; many products that are taken in the mouth -lrb- toothpaste , etc , -rrb- have been found to contain unfit ingredients ; many well-known toy brands that we buy for our children that are made in china have toxic ingredients , and many people , such as prisoners , are forced to work as slaves to create the great chinese economic progress . but the big multi-nationals have made sure we do n't have much choice in buying products that are not made in china .
they made sure they closed down their european factories and opened them up in china where life and labor is cheap and their greed insures they get the best profit .
anyone know where you can still buy toys that are not made in china ?
i will be your first customer . - kaye poole , britain so far , the british and germans are not the focus .
china likes to target the betrayer and the frontier , namely france and the us .
and so far the wasp has succeeded in uniting the catholics , and showing the chinese that the frenchmen are nothing better .
let 's see the reaction of the germans , and see how the anglo can work with the saxons as it unfolds .
china 's dream has definitely been interrupted .
rem period is gone - a step closer to be awakened .
remember what napoleon said about a sleeping lion ? - berg mcfly , china it is unfortunate that china can browbeat the european union on the basis of the economic leverage it enjoys today vis-a-vis europe .
that the eu chooses to remain a mute spectator on the tibet crackdown and refrain from officially recognizing the dalai lama amounts to lending credibility to the religious persecution of christians sponsored by the atheist regime in beijing . do we assume that the rich european tradition of promoting democratic values and peaceful coexistence is fading day by day ?
how else can the european union presidency ignore the reality of 46 christians being arrested for holding a bible class and worshiping in a private home without government permission ?
perhaps it is time that the european citizens decide whether or not to support a tyrannical regime that does not even believe in granting the christians , muslims and tibetan buddhist minorities the right and freedom to quietly express their faith . - seema sengupta , india i think the eu should send a large fact-finding mission to tibet to see the real situation without chinese officials and spies with them then to decide it .
tibetans should have freedom to use their own language and live according to their own style .
tibet has its own language , culture and customs .
chinese leaders in tibet do n't know them and ca n't even speak tibetan . - tsering , china compiled by dw staff -lrb- kjb -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?
dw-world.de eu presidency will not invite dalai lama to brussels the eu 's slovenian presidency said that it would not invite the dalai lama to brussels to meet with the bloc 's foreign ministers , as paris has proposed , but would not rule out other contacts with the tibetan leader .
-lrb- 19.04.2008 -rrb- economic sanctions wrong way to deal with china , experts say beijing 's reaction to the protests in tibet has prompted germans to call for a boycott of the olympics and economic sanctions .
business representatives are now asking people to consider the consequences of such a move .
-lrb- 16.04.2008 -rrb- poll : europeans see china as biggest threat to global stability europeans see china as being a greater threat to global stability than the united states or iran , an opinion poll published tuesday , april 15 , discovered .
-lrb- 15.04.2008 -rrb- report : germany 's merkel will meet dalai lama again german chancellor angela merkel is willing to meet the dalai lama again despite china 's anger over a previous meeting , a german newspaper said saturday .

the bank of england 's plan is designed to allow high street banks to swap mortgage-backed securities for government bonds to try to boost liquidity at a time when banks are hesitant to lend to each other .
the intervention followed a meeting of britain 's top bankers with prime minister gordon brown last week , at which the emergency measures were discussed .

" we are in touch with the uk authorities concerning this scheme and it is far too early to start speculating about whether it is state aid or not , " said jonathan todd , spokesman for the eu 's top competition regulator .
the bank of england 's plan is designed to allow high street banks to swap mortgage-backed securities for government bonds to try to boost liquidity at a time when banks are hesitant to lend to each other .
the intervention followed a meeting of britain 's top bankers with prime minister gordon brown last week , at which the emergency measures were discussed .
" we will make sure that there is enough liquidity in the economy so that we can continue to lend money for businesses and lend money for people to buy their own houses , " brown later said .
a statement from the bank of england 's said that the scheme aimed to improve the liquidity position of the banking system and increase confidence in financial markets , which have been hit by the shockwave emanating from the us economic slowdown and the subsequent global financial turbulence .
the plan is also designed to tackle an estimated overhang of 35 billion pounds of debt in the 1.2 trillion pounds uk mortgage market that banks would have repackaged and sold on , had the credit crisis not hit .
" financial markets are not working normally , which if left unchecked will have an impact on the wider economy .
across the world , there is a lack of confidence in assets created from packages of bank loans , most notably mortgage-backed securities , " the bank of england statement said .
cash injection could increase with demand the initial amount of 50 billion pounds could increase depending on the amount other banks need to get lending going again and how much they 're willing to provide in costly collateral .
" there is no arbitrary limit on it , " bank of england governor mervyn king told reporters when asked about the cash injection .
" it 's not part of this scheme to take us back to the excessive lending of a year or more ago , " king added .
" it 's to return the banking system back to a state of normality . "
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the us subprime crisis led to uk lenders tightening their belts britain 's main home loan providers are rapidly tightening their lending criteria as fears persist over the sector 's exposure to the collapsed subprime or high-risk housing market in the united states .
central banks around the world have been taking a variety of actions to get the frozen markets moving .
the bank of england 's plan is one of the biggest moves yet by a major central bank to combat the global credit crunch .
the us federal reserve last month unveiled a $ 200 billion scheme to help its own mortgage markets .
the bank of england 's plan was revealed at the same time as reports claiming the royal bank of scotland was seeking some 10 billion pounds in a new rights issue to shareholders this week .
the bank , britain 's second-largest , is also expected to reveal further write-downs , probably in the region of 5 billion pounds .
no quick fix , say analysts despite the positive noises being made by the banks in regard to the bank of england 's plan , analysts are less convinced that it would be enough to revive a flagging economy .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the bank of england plan will not fix the financial crisis " it will have a positive impact on the money market but it 's unlikely that it will have any meaningful impact on unlocking mortgage markets , " one economist told reuters .
" this is not going to undo the harm that 's already been done to the economy , " said another .
" it might just stop things getting any worse . "
the international monetary fund -lrb- imf -rrb- took a different view .
according to michael deppler , director of the imf 's european department , the global credit crisis and persistent gloom over the us economy is continuing to have a detrimental effect on the outlook for european economic growth .
imf forecasts negative effects in europe " europe has so far been relatively resilient to the us slowdown and the global financial turbulence , but the historical record suggests these will increasingly take their toll , " he said in a statement .
gross domestic product -lrb- gdp -rrb- across europe is expected to take a significant hit this year due to the combination of the fallout from the credit crisis , the near-record strength of the euro and soaring food and energy prices .
the imf stated that " growth rates in the advanced economies are projected to fall well below potential for some time " and forecasted that europe 's gdp would fall from last year 's figure of 3.9 percent to 2.6 percent this year .
last week , germany 's key economic institutes revised down their growth outlook for europe 's biggest economy , forecasting that german economic growth will come in at 1.8 percent in 2008 before slowing to 1.4 percent in 2009 .
the eight institutes had previously forecast growth at 2.2 percent for this year . dw staff -lrb- nda -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de history -pipe- 21.04.2008 biographer unveils man behind the red baron myth großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : with his fokker plane , baron von richthofen was molded into a war hero world war one fighter pilot manfred von richthofen - a.k.a. the red baron - died in combat 90 years ago , on april 21 , 1918 .
dw-world.de spoke to von richthofen biographer joachim castan about the man behind the myth . the prussian nobleman - dubbed the red baron because of the color of his aircraft - shot down some 80 allied planes before his death at the age of 25 .
his life has become the stuff of legend .
a new film about the red baron , which opened in germany this month , also revives the heroic image .
joachim castan , 41 , was the first historian to write a biography of this famous figure .
the biographer and documentary filmmaker spent three years researching the project , gaining exclusive access to previously unpublished writings and letters .
the book , called " die ganze geschichte " -lrb- the whole story -rrb- and published in 2007 , reveals a far more complex character .
dw-world.de : did your image of von richthofen change in the course of your research ?
joachim castan : i must admit that i had an image of von richthofen before i started my research of him as the last true gentleman of the skies in a dehumanized , industrialized brutal war , heroically participating in airborne duels .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : castan 's preconceptions were overturned while working on the book as i became immersed in the material , i realized that there was a well-maintained von richthofen myth .
the myth propagates the idea that von richthofen forced pilots to land .
he shot down aircraft , but he ensured , if at all possible , that the pilot survived , so that the whole encounter took on the character of a sporting match to determine the better pilot and marksman .
this turned out to be an image created by the german propaganda machine in 1917 .
it needed a young , good-looking radiant hero , a victor who could be served up to a relatively demoralized society . this image of the lonely gentleman of the skies was then taken up in the 1920s and further elaborated upon by the americans , who wanted to sell a romantic notion of air combat .
and who was the man you discovered ?
he was completely different .
without doubt , he was extremely courageous and extremely ambitious , but he was also cold-blooded .
his goal was to shoot down as many aircraft as possible .
in his own writings , he writes quite openly : " i never get into an aircraft for fun .
i aim first for the head of the pilot , or rather at the head of the observer , if there was one . "
i do n't think that von richthofen would have described himself as a hero .
he was doing his duty to defend his fatherland .
at the same time , he was satisfying his passion for hunting .
he was already a passionate hunter at the age of 11 and was taken hunting by his father .
aim , shoot , destroy target - he took his passion for hunting to the skies , transposing it one-to-one .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : von richthofen around 1917 i also do not think he was a brutal killer .
von richthofen also reflected partially upon what he did .
he wrote that he always felt terrible when he came off duty .
he used to come home and lock himself in his room for hours and refuse to talk to anyone .
from mid-1917 he also realized that the war was probably going to be lost .
for me he is a tragic figure , fighting fanatically , remorselessly , in a war that is lost .
what made him into the kind of person he was ?
his mother was extraordinarily ambitious and did n't think much of her husband .
he retired early and did not have a very successful career as an officer .
all of the family 's ambitions were invested first in the eldest son , manfred , and then in the second son , lothar , who was also a fighter pilot .
the young manfred was sent at the age of 11 to a prussian cadet school , which were pretty infamous .
the children were honed into soldiers and there was no scope for any ifs , ands or buts .
the intellectual aspect of schooling was largely neglected .
the children had to function as soldiers first and foremost .
it 's interesting : if you look at von richthofen 's personal development , it showed that , first of all , he functioned in this way .
then a year before his death , he started to come to his senses and think about his actions .
i think he gradually realized that he had arrived at a dead end .
you say that the red baron myth was created in 1917 .
it served then as propaganda intended to boost morale .
but why is it now being revived ?
what is the reason for the current interest in this figure ?
in germany currently , we are thinking about war , heroes , and war heroes , we are rethinking our position .
deployment in a war in afghanistan would have been unthinkable in germany 10 years ago .
at the same time , we are thinking about reintroducing medals to reward bravery .
for germany , that is a very unusual situation because of our history , the third reich and the hitler dictatorship .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : matthias schweighoefer plays the red baron in the new film in other countries , in france , britain and the united states , hero cults exist .
in germany , they ceased to exist after 1945 .
i believe that there is a certain tendency toward reintroducing heroes , to hold them up as examples , as military models and to make military conflict socially acceptable again .
what do you think about the portrayal of von richthofen in nikolai muellerschoen 's new film , " the red baron ? "
the film revives the richthofen myth in parts .
it turns him into a radiant figure , someone who becomes a good person / pacifist through his love for a nurse .
it is a way of seeing von richthofen that is popular at the moment - as a sort of broken hero who is relatively blameless in some respects .
there are those responsible for conducting the war , who are evil , and the good hero .
this is a distinction that people like to make at the moment . interview : julie gregson send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

" i can tell you on behalf of the european union - all the countries of the european union - that we will continue to be working with the government , working with the people of afghanistan for the long haul , " solana said after meeting with afghan president hamid karzai and other senior ministry officials in the fortified presidential palace in kabul on monday , april 21 .
" we , the people in europe , will continue to be helping the people of afghanistan to get what they deserve , the stability , prosperity and peace , " he added .
a renewed commitment bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : solana praised the on-going efforts in afghanistan solana jetted into the capital for a day-long trip which , he said in remarks published in a kabul daily monday , came at an important time of " renewed commitment by the international community " to struggling afghanistan .
following his arrival , solana paid a visit to the headquarters of the eu police mission in afghanistan -lrb- eupol -rrb- and met with police officials .
since june of last year , some 230 eupol officials have been training the upper echelons of the afghan security forces .
eupol is also assisting other western training missions and is now spreading its operations to cover the whole country .
solana praised the progress that afghanistan has made in the past several years since the fall of the taliban , saying " tremendous efforts have been done in education .
the tremendous effort ... done in health is something that we take into great consideration . "
europe is the second largest contributor after the united states to military and development efforts in afghanistan since the 2001 fall of the extremist taliban regime , and president karzai praised the european union as " among the best supporters of afghanistan . "
high hopes for paris donors ' conference bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : karzai thanked the eu and hoped for continued help during their discussions , solana and karzai discussed a number of other issues including security , governance , and rule of law in afghanistan , as well as the international preparation for the afghan donors ' conference in paris in june .
" this is the moment to reflect on what we , the international community , can do , working in conjunction with our afghan partners , to enhance our efforts , " he said of the up-coming conference .
afghanistan is hoping the donors ' meeting in paris will secure $ 50 billion -lrb- 30 billion euros -rrb- in aid to implement a five-year development plan , finance minister anwar-ul haq ahadi said monday .
the plan , called the national development strategy -lrb- ands -rrb- , was presented to donors at an " aid effectiveness " conference in kabul at the same time as solana 's meeting .
based on a year of wide-ranging consultations , it will be assessed by the world bank and international monetary fund , ahadi told reporters after the meeting .
the finalized strategy would become the basis of requests from donors at the june conference , he said .
" for this strategy , the afghan government has asked the world for $ 50 billion in aid for five years , " he said .
the ands was a comprehensive plan , the minister said .
" all walks of government are included : security , good governance , financial growth , important issues such as counter-narcotics , capacity building and equal rights of women ... "
afghan solutions for afghan problems bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the rebuilding and enforcement of security goes on the plan underlines europe 's commitment to restoring afghanistan 's infrastructure and the return of the power to the people .
in written comments for the daily outlook afghanistan newspaper , solana said it was " important that afghan solutions are found to afghan problems . "
and success would involve more than a military effort to eliminate extremists , whose ranks are said to be reinforced , trained and equipped by militant camps in neighboring pakistan .
" the approach must be global and joined up , encompassing the rule of law , development , reconstruction , economic growth , rural development and education , " solana said .
" it is very important that the efforts should be led by afghans , " he said , reflecting growing demands by karzai and his government for more ownership of the work in their country .
despite the paris conference 's emphasis on civilian assistance , it is likely that the financial cost and loss of soldiers killed fighting taliban extremists will also be discussed , at a time of growing doubts within some allied nations about the mammoth mission , which has been criticized as wasteful and disjointed .
pakistan visit on itinerary after leaving kabul , solana was expected for talks with pakistan 's president pervez musharraf in islamabad on tuesday .
solana is expected to reiterate the eu 's support for the democratic process in pakistan .
" we have to continue to show our support and engagement , in particular after the -lsb- recent -rsb- political developments -lsb- in pakistan -rsb- , " an official from solana 's office said ahead of the trip .

" for this strategy , the afghan government has asked the world for $ 50 billion in aid for five years , " he said .

" i can tell you on behalf of the european union - all the countries of the european union - that we will continue to be working with the government , working with the people of afghanistan for the long haul , " solana said after meeting with afghan president hamid karzai and other senior ministry officials in the fortified presidential palace in kabul on monday , april 21 .
" we , the people in europe , will continue to be helping the people of afghanistan to get what they deserve , the stability , prosperity and peace , " he added .
a renewed commitment bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : solana praised the on-going efforts in afghanistan solana jetted into the capital for a day-long trip which , he said in remarks published in a kabul daily monday , came at an important time of " renewed commitment by the international community " to struggling afghanistan .
following his arrival , solana paid a visit to the headquarters of the eu police mission in afghanistan -lrb- eupol -rrb- and met with police officials .
since june of last year , some 230 eupol officials have been training the upper echelons of the afghan security forces .
eupol is also assisting other western training missions and is now spreading its operations to cover the whole country .
solana praised the progress that afghanistan has made in the past several years since the fall of the taliban , saying " tremendous efforts have been done in education .
the tremendous effort ... done in health is something that we take into great consideration . "
europe is the second largest contributor after the united states to military and development efforts in afghanistan since the 2001 fall of the extremist taliban regime , and president karzai praised the european union as " among the best supporters of afghanistan . "
high hopes for paris donors ' conference bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : karzai thanked the eu and hoped for continued help during their discussions , solana and karzai discussed a number of other issues including security , governance , and rule of law in afghanistan , as well as the international preparation for the afghan donors ' conference in paris in june .
" this is the moment to reflect on what we , the international community , can do , working in conjunction with our afghan partners , to enhance our efforts , " he said of the up-coming conference .
afghanistan is hoping the donors ' meeting in paris will secure $ 50 billion -lrb- 30 billion euros -rrb- in aid to implement a five-year development plan , finance minister anwar-ul haq ahadi said monday .
the plan , called the national development strategy -lrb- ands -rrb- , was presented to donors at an " aid effectiveness " conference in kabul at the same time as solana 's meeting .
based on a year of wide-ranging consultations , it will be assessed by the world bank and international monetary fund , ahadi told reporters after the meeting .
the finalized strategy would become the basis of requests from donors at the june conference , he said .
" for this strategy , the afghan government has asked the world for $ 50 billion in aid for five years , " he said .
the ands was a comprehensive plan , the minister said .
" all walks of government are included : security , good governance , financial growth , important issues such as counter-narcotics , capacity building and equal rights of women ... "
afghan solutions for afghan problems bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the rebuilding and enforcement of security goes on the plan underlines europe 's commitment to restoring afghanistan 's infrastructure and the return of the power to the people .
in written comments for the daily outlook afghanistan newspaper , solana said it was " important that afghan solutions are found to afghan problems . "
and success would involve more than a military effort to eliminate extremists , whose ranks are said to be reinforced , trained and equipped by militant camps in neighboring pakistan .
" the approach must be global and joined up , encompassing the rule of law , development , reconstruction , economic growth , rural development and education , " solana said .
" it is very important that the efforts should be led by afghans , " he said , reflecting growing demands by karzai and his government for more ownership of the work in their country .
despite the paris conference 's emphasis on civilian assistance , it is likely that the financial cost and loss of soldiers killed fighting taliban extremists will also be discussed , at a time of growing doubts within some allied nations about the mammoth mission , which has been criticized as wasteful and disjointed .
pakistan visit on itinerary after leaving kabul , solana was expected for talks with pakistan 's president pervez musharraf in islamabad on tuesday .
solana is expected to reiterate the eu 's support for the democratic process in pakistan .
" we have to continue to show our support and engagement , in particular after the -lsb- recent -rsb- political developments -lsb- in pakistan -rsb- , " an official from solana 's office said ahead of the trip .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : solana will meet president musharraf and prime minister gilani solana will be one of the most senior european union officials to meet pakistan 's new leaders following elections on feb .
18 , his spokeswoman , cristina gallach , said in brussels last week .
his message to them would be that " the world looks at you , the eu looks at you , " she said .

dw-world.de spoke to von richthofen biographer joachim castan about the man behind the myth . the prussian nobleman - dubbed the red baron because of the color of his aircraft - shot down some 80 allied planes before his death at the age of 25 .
his life has become the stuff of legend .
a new film about the red baron , which opened in germany this month , also revives the heroic image .
joachim castan , 41 , was the first historian to write a biography of this famous figure .
the biographer and documentary filmmaker spent three years researching the project , gaining exclusive access to previously unpublished writings and letters .
the book , called " die ganze geschichte " -lrb- the whole story -rrb- and published in 2007 , reveals a far more complex character .
dw-world.de : did your image of von richthofen change in the course of your research ?
joachim castan : i must admit that i had an image of von richthofen before i started my research of him as the last true gentleman of the skies in a dehumanized , industrialized brutal war , heroically participating in airborne duels .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : castan 's preconceptions were overturned while working on the book as i became immersed in the material , i realized that there was a well-maintained von richthofen myth .
the myth propagates the idea that von richthofen forced pilots to land .
he shot down aircraft , but he ensured , if at all possible , that the pilot survived , so that the whole encounter took on the character of a sporting match to determine the better pilot and marksman .
this turned out to be an image created by the german propaganda machine in 1917 .
it needed a young , good-looking radiant hero , a victor who could be served up to a relatively demoralized society . this image of the lonely gentleman of the skies was then taken up in the 1920s and further elaborated upon by the americans , who wanted to sell a romantic notion of air combat .
and who was the man you discovered ?
he was completely different .
without doubt , he was extremely courageous and extremely ambitious , but he was also cold-blooded .
his goal was to shoot down as many aircraft as possible .
in his own writings , he writes quite openly : " i never get into an aircraft for fun .
i aim first for the head of the pilot , or rather at the head of the observer , if there was one . "
i do n't think that von richthofen would have described himself as a hero .
he was doing his duty to defend his fatherland .
at the same time , he was satisfying his passion for hunting .
he was already a passionate hunter at the age of 11 and was taken hunting by his father .
aim , shoot , destroy target - he took his passion for hunting to the skies , transposing it one-to-one .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : von richthofen around 1917 i also do not think he was a brutal killer .
von richthofen also reflected partially upon what he did .
he wrote that he always felt terrible when he came off duty .
he used to come home and lock himself in his room for hours and refuse to talk to anyone .
from mid-1917 he also realized that the war was probably going to be lost .
for me he is a tragic figure , fighting fanatically , remorselessly , in a war that is lost .
what made him into the kind of person he was ?
his mother was extraordinarily ambitious and did n't think much of her husband .
he retired early and did not have a very successful career as an officer .
all of the family 's ambitions were invested first in the eldest son , manfred , and then in the second son , lothar , who was also a fighter pilot .
the young manfred was sent at the age of 11 to a prussian cadet school , which were pretty infamous .
the children were honed into soldiers and there was no scope for any ifs , ands or buts .
the intellectual aspect of schooling was largely neglected .
the children had to function as soldiers first and foremost .
it 's interesting : if you look at von richthofen 's personal development , it showed that , first of all , he functioned in this way .
then a year before his death , he started to come to his senses and think about his actions .
i think he gradually realized that he had arrived at a dead end .
you say that the red baron myth was created in 1917 .
it served then as propaganda intended to boost morale .
but why is it now being revived ?
what is the reason for the current interest in this figure ?
in germany currently , we are thinking about war , heroes , and war heroes , we are rethinking our position .
deployment in a war in afghanistan would have been unthinkable in germany 10 years ago .
at the same time , we are thinking about reintroducing medals to reward bravery .
for germany , that is a very unusual situation because of our history , the third reich and the hitler dictatorship .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : matthias schweighoefer plays the red baron in the new film in other countries , in france , britain and the united states , hero cults exist .
in germany , they ceased to exist after 1945 .
i believe that there is a certain tendency toward reintroducing heroes , to hold them up as examples , as military models and to make military conflict socially acceptable again .
what do you think about the portrayal of von richthofen in nikolai muellerschoen 's new film , " the red baron ? "
the film revives the richthofen myth in parts .
it turns him into a radiant figure , someone who becomes a good person / pacifist through his love for a nurse .
it is a way of seeing von richthofen that is popular at the moment - as a sort of broken hero who is relatively blameless in some respects .
there are those responsible for conducting the war , who are evil , and the good hero .
this is a distinction that people like to make at the moment . interview : julie gregson send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de finance -pipe- 21.04.2008 eu surveys bank of england 's cash injection plan with caution großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : bank of england governor mervyn king hopes to inspire confidence in the economy the bank of england 's plan to free up britain 's home loan market by injecting 50 billion pounds into the banking sector to ease the mortgage squeeze has come under scrutiny from the eu . the bank 's 50-billion-pound -lrb- 62.3 billion euros , $ 100 billion -rrb- plan is being studied by the eu as to whether it constitutes state aid , a european commission spokesman said monday , april 21 .
" we are in touch with the uk authorities concerning this scheme and it is far too early to start speculating about whether it is state aid or not , " said jonathan todd , spokesman for the eu 's top competition regulator .
the bank of england 's plan is designed to allow high street banks to swap mortgage-backed securities for government bonds to try to boost liquidity at a time when banks are hesitant to lend to each other .
the intervention followed a meeting of britain 's top bankers with prime minister gordon brown last week , at which the emergency measures were discussed .
" we will make sure that there is enough liquidity in the economy so that we can continue to lend money for businesses and lend money for people to buy their own houses , " brown later said .
a statement from the bank of england 's said that the scheme aimed to improve the liquidity position of the banking system and increase confidence in financial markets , which have been hit by the shockwave emanating from the us economic slowdown and the subsequent global financial turbulence .
the plan is also designed to tackle an estimated overhang of 35 billion pounds of debt in the 1.2 trillion pounds uk mortgage market that banks would have repackaged and sold on , had the credit crisis not hit .
" financial markets are not working normally , which if left unchecked will have an impact on the wider economy .
across the world , there is a lack of confidence in assets created from packages of bank loans , most notably mortgage-backed securities , " the bank of england statement said .
cash injection could increase with demand the initial amount of 50 billion pounds could increase depending on the amount other banks need to get lending going again and how much they 're willing to provide in costly collateral .
" there is no arbitrary limit on it , " bank of england governor mervyn king told reporters when asked about the cash injection .
" it 's not part of this scheme to take us back to the excessive lending of a year or more ago , " king added .
" it 's to return the banking system back to a state of normality . "
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the us subprime crisis led to uk lenders tightening their belts britain 's main home loan providers are rapidly tightening their lending criteria as fears persist over the sector 's exposure to the collapsed subprime or high-risk housing market in the united states .
central banks around the world have been taking a variety of actions to get the frozen markets moving .
the bank of england 's plan is one of the biggest moves yet by a major central bank to combat the global credit crunch .
the us federal reserve last month unveiled a $ 200 billion scheme to help its own mortgage markets .
the bank of england 's plan was revealed at the same time as reports claiming the royal bank of scotland was seeking some 10 billion pounds in a new rights issue to shareholders this week .
the bank , britain 's second-largest , is also expected to reveal further write-downs , probably in the region of 5 billion pounds .
no quick fix , say analysts despite the positive noises being made by the banks in regard to the bank of england 's plan , analysts are less convinced that it would be enough to revive a flagging economy .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the bank of england plan will not fix the financial crisis " it will have a positive impact on the money market but it 's unlikely that it will have any meaningful impact on unlocking mortgage markets , " one economist told reuters .
" this is not going to undo the harm that 's already been done to the economy , " said another .
" it might just stop things getting any worse . "
the international monetary fund -lrb- imf -rrb- took a different view .
according to michael deppler , director of the imf 's european department , the global credit crisis and persistent gloom over the us economy is continuing to have a detrimental effect on the outlook for european economic growth .
imf forecasts negative effects in europe " europe has so far been relatively resilient to the us slowdown and the global financial turbulence , but the historical record suggests these will increasingly take their toll , " he said in a statement .
gross domestic product -lrb- gdp -rrb- across europe is expected to take a significant hit this year due to the combination of the fallout from the credit crisis , the near-record strength of the euro and soaring food and energy prices .
the imf stated that " growth rates in the advanced economies are projected to fall well below potential for some time " and forecasted that europe 's gdp would fall from last year 's figure of 3.9 percent to 2.6 percent this year .
last week , germany 's key economic institutes revised down their growth outlook for europe 's biggest economy , forecasting that german economic growth will come in at 1.8 percent in 2008 before slowing to 1.4 percent in 2009 .
the eight institutes had previously forecast growth at 2.2 percent for this year . dw staff -lrb- nda -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

dw-world.de spoke to von richthofen biographer joachim castan about the man behind the myth . the prussian nobleman - dubbed the red baron because of the color of his aircraft - shot down some 80 allied planes before his death at the age of 25 .
his life has become the stuff of legend .
a new film about the red baron , which opened in germany this month , also revives the heroic image .
joachim castan , 41 , was the first historian to write a biography of this famous figure .
the biographer and documentary filmmaker spent three years researching the project , gaining exclusive access to previously unpublished writings and letters .
the book , called " die ganze geschichte " -lrb- the whole story -rrb- and published in 2007 , reveals a far more complex character .
dw-world.de : did your image of von richthofen change in the course of your research ?
joachim castan : i must admit that i had an image of von richthofen before i started my research of him as the last true gentleman of the skies in a dehumanized , industrialized brutal war , heroically participating in airborne duels .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : castan 's preconceptions were overturned while working on the book as i became immersed in the material , i realized that there was a well-maintained von richthofen myth .
the myth propagates the idea that von richthofen forced pilots to land .
he shot down aircraft , but he ensured , if at all possible , that the pilot survived , so that the whole encounter took on the character of a sporting match to determine the better pilot and marksman .
this turned out to be an image created by the german propaganda machine in 1917 .
it needed a young , good-looking radiant hero , a victor who could be served up to a relatively demoralized society . this image of the lonely gentleman of the skies was then taken up in the 1920s and further elaborated upon by the americans , who wanted to sell a romantic notion of air combat .
and who was the man you discovered ?
he was completely different .
without doubt , he was extremely courageous and extremely ambitious , but he was also cold-blooded .
his goal was to shoot down as many aircraft as possible .
in his own writings , he writes quite openly : " i never get into an aircraft for fun .
i aim first for the head of the pilot , or rather at the head of the observer , if there was one . "
i do n't think that von richthofen would have described himself as a hero .
he was doing his duty to defend his fatherland .
at the same time , he was satisfying his passion for hunting .
he was already a passionate hunter at the age of 11 and was taken hunting by his father .
aim , shoot , destroy target - he took his passion for hunting to the skies , transposing it one-to-one .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : von richthofen around 1917 i also do not think he was a brutal killer .
von richthofen also reflected partially upon what he did .
he wrote that he always felt terrible when he came off duty .
he used to come home and lock himself in his room for hours and refuse to talk to anyone .
from mid-1917 he also realized that the war was probably going to be lost .
for me he is a tragic figure , fighting fanatically , remorselessly , in a war that is lost .
what made him into the kind of person he was ?
his mother was extraordinarily ambitious and did n't think much of her husband .
he retired early and did not have a very successful career as an officer .
all of the family 's ambitions were invested first in the eldest son , manfred , and then in the second son , lothar , who was also a fighter pilot .
the young manfred was sent at the age of 11 to a prussian cadet school , which were pretty infamous .
the children were honed into soldiers and there was no scope for any ifs , ands or buts .
the intellectual aspect of schooling was largely neglected .
the children had to function as soldiers first and foremost .
it 's interesting : if you look at von richthofen 's personal development , it showed that , first of all , he functioned in this way .
then a year before his death , he started to come to his senses and think about his actions .
i think he gradually realized that he had arrived at a dead end .
you say that the red baron myth was created in 1917 .
it served then as propaganda intended to boost morale .
but why is it now being revived ?
what is the reason for the current interest in this figure ?
in germany currently , we are thinking about war , heroes , and war heroes , we are rethinking our position .
deployment in a war in afghanistan would have been unthinkable in germany 10 years ago .
at the same time , we are thinking about reintroducing medals to reward bravery .
for germany , that is a very unusual situation because of our history , the third reich and the hitler dictatorship .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : matthias schweighoefer plays the red baron in the new film in other countries , in france , britain and the united states , hero cults exist .
in germany , they ceased to exist after 1945 .
i believe that there is a certain tendency toward reintroducing heroes , to hold them up as examples , as military models and to make military conflict socially acceptable again .
what do you think about the portrayal of von richthofen in nikolai muellerschoen 's new film , " the red baron ? "
the film revives the richthofen myth in parts .
it turns him into a radiant figure , someone who becomes a good person / pacifist through his love for a nurse .
it is a way of seeing von richthofen that is popular at the moment - as a sort of broken hero who is relatively blameless in some respects .
there are those responsible for conducting the war , who are evil , and the good hero .
this is a distinction that people like to make at the moment . interview : julie gregson send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

by chris mason bbc news , calais mr west said he has seen sterling 's value decline for 20 years it has almost become a british institution .
returning from a holiday in europe , no trip was complete without a trip to a giant warehouse full of very cheap drink - and loading the car so full there was barely room for the suitcase .
others hired a van and headed to france for the weekend for no other reason than to stock up on their favourite tipple - in bulk .
but could the so-called " booze cruise " now be under threat - because of the exchange rate between sterling and the euro ?
at eastenders cash and carry in calais - one of around half a dozen wine and beer supermarkets in the town - evidence of the impact is clear .
it 's not a place you could mistake for being french .
the warehouse is painted a garish yellow - and the eastenders lettering is in the same style as the bbc1 soap .
it is very , very hard on customers and they 're not sure whether it 's worth coming in any more david west , supermarket owner a pink london taxi , perched on top of a nearby garage roof , adds a certain something too .
the business has been run by the west family for around 20 years .
setting up here in france was all about offering one unique selling point - cheap alcohol .
but , thanks to the exchange rate , it 's not quite so cheap any more .
the pound has hit its lowest level ever against the euro this month - and it 's estimated to have lost about 17 % of its value in the course of a year .
research by the post office shows that a year ago changing £ 100 would have bought 139 euros .
to get the same number of euros now , would mean having to change around £ 117 .
some shoppers are still keen to fill their cars with alcohol great news for british businesses exporting to europe , and potentially for the british tourist industry too .
but not for businesses like eastenders .
" it 's putting prices up here by about a fifth , " david west , who runs the warehouse , says .
" it is very , very hard on customers and they 're not sure whether it 's worth coming in any more .
if you add 20 % onto the price of anything - it does n't matter what kind of business you are in - it is going to be hard . "
there is still a steady trickle of tourists pulling into the car park , many of whom ready to fill supermarket trolleys .
but their numbers are dwindling , mr west says , and they are buying less .
john wyon-brown , 61 , from lyme regis in dorset , is still prepared to make a stop .
he and his wife and two friends have just got off the ferry , a 10-minute drive away - and are en-route to the south of france on holiday .
" the exchange rate is appalling .
it is dire , " mr wyon-brown says .
' cut back ' he has been on french soil for less than an hour - but already he 's noticed that each pound of spending money is n't going as far .
" looking at the price of fuel , and then the price of booze here - we can see it is good for the french going to england , but bad for the english coming here .
we have had to cut back . "
as far as the exchange rate is concerned , mr west is pessimistic about the future .
" in 20 years of business - seeing the pound fluctuate against first the french franc and now the euro , i 've never seen sterling gain substantially .
i have never seen it go up in the same way as it 's come down .
i hope i am wrong , but i suspect i wo n't be . "
" this has a knock on effect for everybody , " mr west acknowledges .
" and anyone planning a holiday over here - or anywhere that has the euro , is really going to notice the difference this summer . "

by chris mason bbc news , calais mr west said he has seen sterling 's value decline for 20 years it has almost become a british institution .
returning from a holiday in europe , no trip was complete without a trip to a giant warehouse full of very cheap drink - and loading the car so full there was barely room for the suitcase .
others hired a van and headed to france for the weekend for no other reason than to stock up on their favourite tipple - in bulk .
but could the so-called " booze cruise " now be under threat - because of the exchange rate between sterling and the euro ?
at eastenders cash and carry in calais - one of around half a dozen wine and beer supermarkets in the town - evidence of the impact is clear .
it 's not a place you could mistake for being french .
the warehouse is painted a garish yellow - and the eastenders lettering is in the same style as the bbc1 soap .
it is very , very hard on customers and they 're not sure whether it 's worth coming in any more david west , supermarket owner a pink london taxi , perched on top of a nearby garage roof , adds a certain something too .
the business has been run by the west family for around 20 years .
setting up here in france was all about offering one unique selling point - cheap alcohol .
but , thanks to the exchange rate , it 's not quite so cheap any more .
the pound has hit its lowest level ever against the euro this month - and it 's estimated to have lost about 17 % of its value in the course of a year .
research by the post office shows that a year ago changing £ 100 would have bought 139 euros .
to get the same number of euros now , would mean having to change around £ 117 .
some shoppers are still keen to fill their cars with alcohol great news for british businesses exporting to europe , and potentially for the british tourist industry too .
but not for businesses like eastenders .
" it 's putting prices up here by about a fifth , " david west , who runs the warehouse , says .
" it is very , very hard on customers and they 're not sure whether it 's worth coming in any more .
if you add 20 % onto the price of anything - it does n't matter what kind of business you are in - it is going to be hard . "
there is still a steady trickle of tourists pulling into the car park , many of whom ready to fill supermarket trolleys .
but their numbers are dwindling , mr west says , and they are buying less .
john wyon-brown , 61 , from lyme regis in dorset , is still prepared to make a stop .
he and his wife and two friends have just got off the ferry , a 10-minute drive away - and are en-route to the south of france on holiday .
" the exchange rate is appalling .
it is dire , " mr wyon-brown says .
' cut back ' he has been on french soil for less than an hour - but already he 's noticed that each pound of spending money is n't going as far .

setting up here in france was all about offering one unique selling point - cheap alcohol .
but , thanks to the exchange rate , it 's not quite so cheap any more .
the pound has hit its lowest level ever against the euro this month - and it 's estimated to have lost about 17 % of its value in the course of a year .
research by the post office shows that a year ago changing £ 100 would have bought 139 euros .
to get the same number of euros now , would mean having to change around £ 117 .
some shoppers are still keen to fill their cars with alcohol great news for british businesses exporting to europe , and potentially for the british tourist industry too .
but not for businesses like eastenders .
" it 's putting prices up here by about a fifth , " david west , who runs the warehouse , says .
" it is very , very hard on customers and they 're not sure whether it 's worth coming in any more .
if you add 20 % onto the price of anything - it does n't matter what kind of business you are in - it is going to be hard . "
there is still a steady trickle of tourists pulling into the car park , many of whom ready to fill supermarket trolleys .
but their numbers are dwindling , mr west says , and they are buying less .
john wyon-brown , 61 , from lyme regis in dorset , is still prepared to make a stop .
he and his wife and two friends have just got off the ferry , a 10-minute drive away - and are en-route to the south of france on holiday .
" the exchange rate is appalling .
it is dire , " mr wyon-brown says .
' cut back ' he has been on french soil for less than an hour - but already he 's noticed that each pound of spending money is n't going as far .
" looking at the price of fuel , and then the price of booze here - we can see it is good for the french going to england , but bad for the english coming here .
we have had to cut back . "
as far as the exchange rate is concerned , mr west is pessimistic about the future .
" in 20 years of business - seeing the pound fluctuate against first the french franc and now the euro , i 've never seen sterling gain substantially .
i have never seen it go up in the same way as it 's come down .
i hope i am wrong , but i suspect i wo n't be . "
" this has a knock on effect for everybody , " mr west acknowledges .
" and anyone planning a holiday over here - or anywhere that has the euro , is really going to notice the difference this summer . "

by chris mason bbc news , calais mr west said he has seen sterling 's value decline for 20 years it has almost become a british institution .
returning from a holiday in europe , no trip was complete without a trip to a giant warehouse full of very cheap drink - and loading the car so full there was barely room for the suitcase .
others hired a van and headed to france for the weekend for no other reason than to stock up on their favourite tipple - in bulk .
but could the so-called " booze cruise " now be under threat - because of the exchange rate between sterling and the euro ?
at eastenders cash and carry in calais - one of around half a dozen wine and beer supermarkets in the town - evidence of the impact is clear .
it 's not a place you could mistake for being french .
the warehouse is painted a garish yellow - and the eastenders lettering is in the same style as the bbc1 soap .

more than half of uk bosses assess the chances of a member of staff falling pregnant before employing them , a survey suggests .
and 76 % of managers admitted that they would not hire a new recruit if they knew they were going to fall pregnant within six months of starting the job .
employment law advisory services -lrb- elas -rrb- said discrimination was prevalent , despite legislation to outlaw it .
there had been a rise in cases over pregnancy and new starters , elas added .
' dangerous area ' about 52 % of those surveyed said that they considered the chances of a candidate getting pregnant taking into account age and whether they have just got married .
legally , a direct question to a potential employee can not be asked .
for many bosses it is down to the bottom line – a pregnant member of staff will cost money peter mooney elas other findings included only 5 % employing someone knowing they were pregnant with 86 % saying they would feel " cheated " if someone announced their pregnancy weeks after joining a firm .
and almost seven in ten bosses want would like more powers to ask candidates whether they had plans for a family .
head of consultancy at elas , peter mooney said that bosses would still shy away from employing a candidate who was pregnant .
" it is a very dangerous area and you simply can not ask the question about plans for a family in an interview .
for many bosses it is down to the bottom line – a pregnant member of staff will cost money .
however a visit to a tribunal can be even more costly . "
" the fact that almost 8 in 10 of those we surveyed would not employ someone if they knew they were going to fall pregnant within six months shows that discrimination is bound to happen if it is obvious that a candidate is expecting a baby . "

jubilant supporters of the victorious opposition presidential candidate fernando lugo packed the streets waving flags and banners and singing songs as it became clear not only that he had won , but that the victory would be respected .
after 61 years of continuous rule by the same party this was a moment the opposition wanted to savour .
it was almost as if they could not believe the scale of their achievement .
it seems they were joined by many ordinary paraguayans weary of corruption and poverty in their society , and who felt that fernando lugo embodied the idea of change .

" this had to end eventually and god sent us this man to liberate us . "
when mr lugo came to speak to the people on the streets it almost seemed as if , in their enthusiasm , the crowd would sweep the former bishop away .
earlier he paid an emotional tribute to his supporters at his campaign headquarters .
" you are responsible for the happiness of the paraguayan people today , " he said .
" today we can say that small people can also win .

mr lugo faces major challenges in meeting voters ' expectations his party 's candidate , blanca ovelar , also acknowledged defeat , her campaign undermined by internal divisions and the sheer desire for change in the country , a mood she was unable to capture .
the colorado party , which for many people had been synonymous with the state , had been its own worst enemy with bickering continuing in public up to and including election day .
in the end , even the most controversial candidate , former general lino oviedo , could not halt the momentum towards fernando lugo .
mr oviedo , whose sentence for plotting a military coup was overturned last year , was quick to acknowledge his opponent 's victory .
daunting task fernando lugo has inspired hope among many of paraguay 's citizens and now faces the challenge of delivering on those expectations .
while the colorados could not retain their majority in the senate , the new president will need to forge alliances to push his programme through the congress .
there will have to be difficult discussions with brazil and argentina about whether paraguay gets a fair deal for the hydro-electric power it sells to them .

opposition supporters celebrate on the streets former roman catholic bishop fernando lugo has won paraguay 's presidential election , ending more than six decades of rule by the colorado party .
with results declared in most polling stations , mr lugo has 41 % of the vote .
his main rival , blanca ovelar of the colorado party , has 31 % and former army chief lino oviedo 22 % .
the bbc 's gary duffy in the capital , asuncion , says many wanted a leadership change to help confront the poverty and unemployment rife in the country .
mr lugo brought together leftist unions , indigenous people and poor farmers into a coalition to form the centre-left patriotic alliance for change .
i invite paraguayans of all political types , even the ones who do n't share our ideals , to help this country that was once great be great again fernando lugo celebrating change in pictures : opposition win observers say that the man often described as the " bishop for the poor " , is a virtual political novice , best known for his advocacy of land reform and calls to renegotiate an energy treaty with neighbouring brazil .
speaking to his supporters at his campaign headquarters , mr lugo said the result showed that little people could also win and that this was the paraguay he had dreamt about - a country for everyone .
" i invite paraguayans of all political types , even the ones who do n't share our ideals , to help this country that was once great be great again , " he told the cheering crowd .
our correspondent says that jubilant supporters of mr lugo packed the streets of the capital , waving banners and singing songs , as it became clear not only that he had won , but that the victory would be respected .
blanca ovelar was the colorado party 's first female candidate ms ovelar , whose campaign to become the first woman president had suffered from internal party divisions , acknowledged defeat , and wished the country " a time of reconciliation " and " joint reconstruction " .
sitting president nicanor duarte hailed the democratic process : " for the first time in our history , one party will transfer power to another without a coup , without bloodshed and without fighting among brothers , " he told a news conference .
challenges ahead mr lugo 's victory brings to an end one of the longest periods of continuous rule by any party in the world - the colorado party has been in power since 1947 .
" this is the first time in my life that i have witnessed a power change in my country and so has my mother in her 60s , " oliver , a resident of asuncion , told the bbc news website .
" sixty-one years is too many for any party to remain in power . "
the switch in power is also the latest in a series of election triumphs by leftist , or centre-left , leaders in south america .
but mr lugo has rejected accusations from mr duarte that he will follow the style of leftist leaders in bolivia and venezuela once in office .
mr duarte had warned that what he called agitators from venezuela and ecuador were trying to meddle in the poll .
our correspondent says the celebrations will last well into the night in asuncion , but there seems little doubt that the challenges facing the new president when he takes office in august will be enormous .
inequality and corruption are persistent problems and poverty remains widespread , particularly in the rural areas , with many are forced to leave the country in search of work .

with results declared in most polling stations , mr lugo has 41 % of the vote .
his main rival , blanca ovelar of the colorado party , has 31 % and former army chief lino oviedo 22 % .
the bbc 's gary duffy in the capital , asuncion , says many wanted a leadership change to help confront the poverty and unemployment rife in the country .
mr lugo brought together leftist unions , indigenous people and poor farmers into a coalition to form the centre-left patriotic alliance for change .
i invite paraguayans of all political types , even the ones who do n't share our ideals , to help this country that was once great be great again fernando lugo celebrating change in pictures : opposition win observers say that the man often described as the " bishop for the poor " , is a virtual political novice , best known for his advocacy of land reform and calls to renegotiate an energy treaty with neighbouring brazil .
speaking to his supporters at his campaign headquarters , mr lugo said the result showed that little people could also win and that this was the paraguay he had dreamt about - a country for everyone .
" i invite paraguayans of all political types , even the ones who do n't share our ideals , to help this country that was once great be great again , " he told the cheering crowd .
our correspondent says that jubilant supporters of mr lugo packed the streets of the capital , waving banners and singing songs , as it became clear not only that he had won , but that the victory would be respected .
blanca ovelar was the colorado party 's first female candidate ms ovelar , whose campaign to become the first woman president had suffered from internal party divisions , acknowledged defeat , and wished the country " a time of reconciliation " and " joint reconstruction " .
sitting president nicanor duarte hailed the democratic process : " for the first time in our history , one party will transfer power to another without a coup , without bloodshed and without fighting among brothers , " he told a news conference .
challenges ahead mr lugo 's victory brings to an end one of the longest periods of continuous rule by any party in the world - the colorado party has been in power since 1947 .
" this is the first time in my life that i have witnessed a power change in my country and so has my mother in her 60s , " oliver , a resident of asuncion , told the bbc news website .
" sixty-one years is too many for any party to remain in power . "
the switch in power is also the latest in a series of election triumphs by leftist , or centre-left , leaders in south america .
but mr lugo has rejected accusations from mr duarte that he will follow the style of leftist leaders in bolivia and venezuela once in office .
mr duarte had warned that what he called agitators from venezuela and ecuador were trying to meddle in the poll .
our correspondent says the celebrations will last well into the night in asuncion , but there seems little doubt that the challenges facing the new president when he takes office in august will be enormous .
inequality and corruption are persistent problems and poverty remains widespread , particularly in the rural areas , with many are forced to leave the country in search of work .

one out of every three local authority employees are approaching retirement age and could be difficult to replace , the new local government network said .
it said a potential staffing " crisis " could also be caused by fewer graduates wanting a career in local government .
it urged the government to introduce a fast-track graduate recruitment scheme .
a study indicated many graduates believed council jobs were for middle-aged white men having to deal with parking fines or what type of seat to put at bus stops .
negative perceptions report author nigel keohane said : " our focus group reveals a depressingly negative impression of working in local government and approaches to attracting talent too often reinforce negative perceptions . "
brian strutton , national officer of the gmb union , said : " we have been warning for some time that there was an impending recruitment crisis in local government .
" not only is a third of the workforce due to retire soon , but council-service demand is rising fast .
" we have told council leaders that they need to make themselves an employer of choice and that means not just saying so , but being prepared to pay decent pay rates to attract people . "

the psychology of facebook is the brainchild of professor b j fogg , a pioneering persuasion psychologist who founded the persuasive technology lab at stanford .
he says : " when facebook came along i was one of the developers at the launch and what struck me was how there was this new form of persuasion .
this mass interpersonal persuasion . "
professor fogg says the pivotal moment came when he watched an application on the site go from " literally zero to more than a million users in a week " .
he recalls that it was to do with music sharing and buying tickets and that that was when he had his " oh my gosh moment " .
it was quickly followed by a light bulb moment .

professor bj fogg , stanford university as we wait for the technology to click into place that allows another 700 students to tune in online , professor fogg declares that his goal is to help everyone to become a world class expert on the psychology of facebook .

how does the facebook ' question mark ' persuade users ?

the psychology of facebook is the brainchild of professor b j fogg , a pioneering persuasion psychologist who founded the persuasive technology lab at stanford .
he says : " when facebook came along i was one of the developers at the launch and what struck me was how there was this new form of persuasion .
this mass interpersonal persuasion . "
professor fogg says the pivotal moment came when he watched an application on the site go from " literally zero to more than a million users in a week " .
he recalls that it was to do with music sharing and buying tickets and that that was when he had his " oh my gosh moment " .
it was quickly followed by a light bulb moment .
" where on earth could you get a million customers in a week ?
that was when i said ' i want to learn more about this ' and i thought the best way was to teach a class and look at how persuasion happens . "
usual coterie it 's thursday afternoon and the sun is splitting the sky above the adobe-coloured cordura hall , the venue for professor fogg 's psychology of facebook course .
outside there 's a rag tag collection of people dodging the searing heat .
alongside the usual coterie of students is an older crowd known simply as " visitors " .
these people are an assortment of entrepreneurs , angel investors , business heads and myself the only journalist . "
facebook right now stands out from the crowd .
can they continue ? "
professor bj fogg , stanford university as we wait for the technology to click into place that allows another 700 students to tune in online , professor fogg declares that his goal is to help everyone to become a world class expert on the psychology of facebook .
but this is no one trick pony according to the professor .
" what we learn here is n't just relevant to facebook .
the psychology that drives facebook relates to other online success stories , including those blockbusters yet to be invented . "
" there is something enduring about what we are studying , " he declares , " whereas if you are learning how to programme a facebook application , that then could change in 30 days from now .
in fact it probably will ; so that knowledge breaks . "
dissects aspect each week the class dissects an aspect of facebook and looks at the way it works , the psychology behind it and what impression users are trying to convey .
the gamut runs from examining status updates to news feeds and from poking to writing comments .
today the focus is on the use of profile pictures , the photograph on the front page of every facebook entry .
the discussion is led by psychology senior richard barton , who maintains facebook 's high strike rate in this area has to do with the default picture it puts up if you do n't post your own .
" who wants a question mark in place of their face and what questions does that raise about you ?
like , why are you on facebook ?
and so basically facebook sets up an environment where your friends do the persuading to get you to post a picture . "
professor fogg contends this is at the heart of facebook 's achievements .
" what they 're tapping into are some fundamental drivers and it makes it easy to satisfy those drives .
things like the need to be socially accepted and the flip side is to not be rejected . "
class experiment the other strand to professor fogg 's persuasion theory has to do with motivation and outcomes , questioning why users post a certain type of picture and why they constantly change them or not .
to illustrate his point he conducts a class experiment asking people to write out how they want to be regarded based purely on their profile mugshot .
the findings are revealing : " fun , outgoing , nature loving . "
" i was too lazy to rotate my picture and then i had the idea that if i left it you would think i was cool and good looking . "
" i 'm hot . "
" i want to remind my children that i was young once . "
" make people think about peace . "
" web 2.0 revolutionary and world traveller . "
professor fogg says this random sample proves that behind even the innocent act of posting a profile picture , the psychology of persuasion in managing your image or the impression you give off is at play .
and he stresses that albeit unconsciously , facebook 's unbridled success lies in getting users to to do the work for them with friends persuading friends to post pictures , comments , or upload applications .
" i would say they were lucky and have been responsive to users but i do n't think they are persuasion masterminds . "
straightforward tools while luck might have played its part in turning facebook into a major force in social networking , the entrepreneurs attending this course are looking for straightforward tools to help their businesses hit the jackpot .
rob ross has developed the footsies application for facebook and is working on others .
for him the course is a portal into how he can make his business more relevant .
he says : " this opens a door that has not been opened before .
this is going to change the game . "
student roman david agrees : " it 's beyond dollars and cents .
that is part of it but its also where the opportunities are for entrepreneurs and about how the world is changing . "
professor fogg says while his class is about trying to understand what makes facebook tick , the people behind the site have a similar task to ensure it remains a dominant player .
" facebook right now stands out from the crowd .
can they continue ?
so far with its fifty million plus users they 're doing a pretty good job . "

" there 's a real transition from online in to the mobile space , " said simeon coney , head of business development at adaptive mobile , which helps operators keep an eye on the malicious traffic flowing across their networks .
in the pc world malicious programs started with viruses designed to be a nuisance but now they have evolved into software designed solely to help their creators make money .
there is no doubt that hi-tech criminals have cottoned on to the fact that making malicious programs , be they trojans or viruses , can be a very profitable business .
that evolutionary process took , said mr coney , about 15 years .
attack pattern in the mobile world the change from nuisance to profit has happened far faster .
the attacks patterns used with mobile malware suggest that those behind them are applying the lessons they have learned online .
" in the mobile space they are recognising that to be more effective they must try to slip under the radar , " said mr coney .
there were few attempts to swamp networks with malicious programs , he said , most attacks were targeted towards specific segments and users .
in a sense , said mr coney , it was a surprise that mobile networks have not been targeted before now because almost everything that a handset owner does costs money .
even better , he said , was the fact that once you possess someone 's phone number you have a consistent way of reaching them .
by contrast filters on e-mail accounts that spot and stop spam and viruses make it hard to be sure a message has got through .
" mobiles offer so many opportunities for extracting value from people , " he said .
this could explain why the numbers of mobile viruses has remained relatively low .
2008 has seen the release of about 10 new mobile viruses and trojans , said simon heron , managing director of security firm network box .
" there are about 400 variants of mobile malware compared to in excess of 700,000 for computers , " said mr heron .
the vast majority of viruses written for mobile phones are aimed at the symbian mobile operating system - a consequence of its early dominance .
new viruses but these relatively low numbers do not mean that mobile malware can not cause problems .
said mr heron : " the phones themselves have vulnerabilities and there is tremendous take up of email , internet and texting from mobiles , making this one physical platform that can reach a huge number of people . "
in one outbreak logged by f-secure , one of the few firms that produces anti-virus software for phones , an operator with 14m subscribers had 8,000 devices infected with a virus that resulted in the sending of more than 450,000 multimedia messages -lrb- mms -rrb- .
one handset alone sent 3,500 of those messages .
figures gathered by f-secure suggest that for any operator with 9m subscribers or more they can depend on having 5 % of their mms traffic being virus carrying .
among viruses for mobiles what has been growing are trojans that exploit mobile payment systems such as premium rate sms .
one instructive instance of such a malicious program is known as viver .
this was discovered in may 2007 and hides its malicious code inside three fake applications .
installing any one of those bogus applications on a symbian phone starts that handset sending costly premium rate sms messages to an international number .
each sms message costs about $ 7 -lrb- £ 3.50 -rrb- .
spam on mobiles is also starting to become a bigger problem .
one of the biggest spam bombardments on mobiles took place in march 2007 in china when about half the nation 's mobile phone owners received several unsolicited commercial messages in one day .
statistics gathered by adaptive mobile suggest that the average chinese mobile user gets about 6-10 spam sms messages per day .
in india spam traffic can make up 30 % of the text messages flying around networks .
in the uk spam numbers are lower and high profile problems with premium rate services has given rise to a system that has been adopted across all the operators .
texting the word " stop " to the company running a premium rate service should cancel any subscription and stop messages turning up .
if it does not then subscribers are advised to get in touch with their operator to report abuse .
a spokeswoman for vodafone said : " do not sign up for things if you do not know the source of it . "
" virus outbreaks do happen , " she added , " but they usually only affect a very small number of customers . "
" there is a combinations of things that have to happen for you to get hit , " said the spokeswoman .
for instance , she said , many mobile viruses have to be manually installed once they make their way on to a phone and require people to over-ride settings that warn against installation .
said mr coney the lessons learned from viruses and spam hitting pcs had many most in the west less likely to fall for a mobile virus .
by contrast , said mr coney , people fell victim to scams in places where mobiles are becoming hugely popular , such as india and china , people have little experience of malware .
" there is a big demographic of people that have a mobile phone that have never had a pc , " he said .

" there 's a real transition from online in to the mobile space , " said simeon coney , head of business development at adaptive mobile , which helps operators keep an eye on the malicious traffic flowing across their networks .
in the pc world malicious programs started with viruses designed to be a nuisance but now they have evolved into software designed solely to help their creators make money .
there is no doubt that hi-tech criminals have cottoned on to the fact that making malicious programs , be they trojans or viruses , can be a very profitable business .
that evolutionary process took , said mr coney , about 15 years .
attack pattern in the mobile world the change from nuisance to profit has happened far faster .
the attacks patterns used with mobile malware suggest that those behind them are applying the lessons they have learned online .
" in the mobile space they are recognising that to be more effective they must try to slip under the radar , " said mr coney .
there were few attempts to swamp networks with malicious programs , he said , most attacks were targeted towards specific segments and users .
in a sense , said mr coney , it was a surprise that mobile networks have not been targeted before now because almost everything that a handset owner does costs money .
hi-tech criminals are taking lessons learned on computers to mobiles even better , he said , was the fact that once you possess someone 's phone number you have a consistent way of reaching them .
by contrast filters on e-mail accounts that spot and stop spam and viruses make it hard to be sure a message has got through .
" mobiles offer so many opportunities for extracting value from people , " he said .
this could explain why the numbers of mobile viruses has remained relatively low .
2008 has seen the release of about 10 new mobile viruses and trojans , said simon heron , managing director of security firm network box .
" there are about 400 variants of mobile malware compared to in excess of 700,000 for computers , " said mr heron .
the vast majority of viruses written for mobile phones are aimed at the symbian mobile operating system - a consequence of its early dominance .
new viruses but these relatively low numbers do not mean that mobile malware can not cause problems .
said mr heron : " the phones themselves have vulnerabilities and there is tremendous take up of email , internet and texting from mobiles , making this one physical platform that can reach a huge number of people . "
in one outbreak logged by f-secure , one of the few firms that produces anti-virus software for phones , an operator with 14m subscribers had 8,000 devices infected with a virus that resulted in the sending of more than 450,000 multimedia messages -lrb- mms -rrb- .
one handset alone sent 3,500 of those messages .
figures gathered by f-secure suggest that for any operator with 9m subscribers or more they can depend on having 5 % of their mms traffic being virus carrying .
mobiles have become the gadget people carry everywhere with them among viruses for mobiles what has been growing are trojans that exploit mobile payment systems such as premium rate sms .
one instructive instance of such a malicious program is known as viver .
this was discovered in may 2007 and hides its malicious code inside three fake applications .
installing any one of those bogus applications on a symbian phone starts that handset sending costly premium rate sms messages to an international number .
each sms message costs about $ 7 -lrb- £ 3.50 -rrb- .
spam on mobiles is also starting to become a bigger problem .
one of the biggest spam bombardments on mobiles took place in march 2007 in china when about half the nation 's mobile phone owners received several unsolicited commercial messages in one day .
statistics gathered by adaptive mobile suggest that the average chinese mobile user gets about 6-10 spam sms messages per day .
in india spam traffic can make up 30 % of the text messages flying around networks .
in the uk spam numbers are lower and high profile problems with premium rate services has given rise to a system that has been adopted across all the operators .
texting the word " stop " to the company running a premium rate service should cancel any subscription and stop messages turning up .
if it does not then subscribers are advised to get in touch with their operator to report abuse .
a spokeswoman for vodafone said : " do not sign up for things if you do not know the source of it . "
" virus outbreaks do happen , " she added , " but they usually only affect a very small number of customers . "
" there is a combinations of things that have to happen for you to get hit , " said the spokeswoman .
for instance , she said , many mobile viruses have to be manually installed once they make their way on to a phone and require people to over-ride settings that warn against installation .
said mr coney the lessons learned from viruses and spam hitting pcs had many most in the west less likely to fall for a mobile virus .
by contrast , said mr coney , people fell victim to scams in places where mobiles are becoming hugely popular , such as india and china , people have little experience of malware .
" there is a big demographic of people that have a mobile phone that have never had a pc , " he said .

" there 's a real transition from online in to the mobile space , " said simeon coney , head of business development at adaptive mobile , which helps operators keep an eye on the malicious traffic flowing across their networks .
in the pc world malicious programs started with viruses designed to be a nuisance but now they have evolved into software designed solely to help their creators make money .
there is no doubt that hi-tech criminals have cottoned on to the fact that making malicious programs , be they trojans or viruses , can be a very profitable business .
that evolutionary process took , said mr coney , about 15 years .
attack pattern in the mobile world the change from nuisance to profit has happened far faster .
the attacks patterns used with mobile malware suggest that those behind them are applying the lessons they have learned online .
" in the mobile space they are recognising that to be more effective they must try to slip under the radar , " said mr coney .
there were few attempts to swamp networks with malicious programs , he said , most attacks were targeted towards specific segments and users .
in a sense , said mr coney , it was a surprise that mobile networks have not been targeted before now because almost everything that a handset owner does costs money .
hi-tech criminals are taking lessons learned on computers to mobiles even better , he said , was the fact that once you possess someone 's phone number you have a consistent way of reaching them .
by contrast filters on e-mail accounts that spot and stop spam and viruses make it hard to be sure a message has got through .
" mobiles offer so many opportunities for extracting value from people , " he said .
this could explain why the numbers of mobile viruses has remained relatively low .
2008 has seen the release of about 10 new mobile viruses and trojans , said simon heron , managing director of security firm network box .
" there are about 400 variants of mobile malware compared to in excess of 700,000 for computers , " said mr heron .
the vast majority of viruses written for mobile phones are aimed at the symbian mobile operating system - a consequence of its early dominance .
new viruses but these relatively low numbers do not mean that mobile malware can not cause problems .
said mr heron : " the phones themselves have vulnerabilities and there is tremendous take up of email , internet and texting from mobiles , making this one physical platform that can reach a huge number of people . "
in one outbreak logged by f-secure , one of the few firms that produces anti-virus software for phones , an operator with 14m subscribers had 8,000 devices infected with a virus that resulted in the sending of more than 450,000 multimedia messages -lrb- mms -rrb- .
one handset alone sent 3,500 of those messages .
figures gathered by f-secure suggest that for any operator with 9m subscribers or more they can depend on having 5 % of their mms traffic being virus carrying .
mobiles have become the gadget people carry everywhere with them among viruses for mobiles what has been growing are trojans that exploit mobile payment systems such as premium rate sms .
one instructive instance of such a malicious program is known as viver .
this was discovered in may 2007 and hides its malicious code inside three fake applications .
installing any one of those bogus applications on a symbian phone starts that handset sending costly premium rate sms messages to an international number .
each sms message costs about $ 7 -lrb- £ 3.50 -rrb- .
spam on mobiles is also starting to become a bigger problem .
one of the biggest spam bombardments on mobiles took place in march 2007 in china when about half the nation 's mobile phone owners received several unsolicited commercial messages in one day .
statistics gathered by adaptive mobile suggest that the average chinese mobile user gets about 6-10 spam sms messages per day .
in india spam traffic can make up 30 % of the text messages flying around networks .
in the uk spam numbers are lower and high profile problems with premium rate services has given rise to a system that has been adopted across all the operators .
texting the word " stop " to the company running a premium rate service should cancel any subscription and stop messages turning up .
if it does not then subscribers are advised to get in touch with their operator to report abuse .
a spokeswoman for vodafone said : " do not sign up for things if you do not know the source of it . "
" virus outbreaks do happen , " she added , " but they usually only affect a very small number of customers . "
" there is a combinations of things that have to happen for you to get hit , " said the spokeswoman .

" there 's a real transition from online in to the mobile space , " said simeon coney , head of business development at adaptive mobile , which helps operators keep an eye on the malicious traffic flowing across their networks .
in the pc world malicious programs started with viruses designed to be a nuisance but now they have evolved into software designed solely to help their creators make money .
there is no doubt that hi-tech criminals have cottoned on to the fact that making malicious programs , be they trojans or viruses , can be a very profitable business .
that evolutionary process took , said mr coney , about 15 years .
attack pattern in the mobile world the change from nuisance to profit has happened far faster .
the attacks patterns used with mobile malware suggest that those behind them are applying the lessons they have learned online .
" in the mobile space they are recognising that to be more effective they must try to slip under the radar , " said mr coney .
there were few attempts to swamp networks with malicious programs , he said , most attacks were targeted towards specific segments and users .
in a sense , said mr coney , it was a surprise that mobile networks have not been targeted before now because almost everything that a handset owner does costs money .
hi-tech criminals are taking lessons learned on computers to mobiles even better , he said , was the fact that once you possess someone 's phone number you have a consistent way of reaching them .
by contrast filters on e-mail accounts that spot and stop spam and viruses make it hard to be sure a message has got through .
" mobiles offer so many opportunities for extracting value from people , " he said .
this could explain why the numbers of mobile viruses has remained relatively low .
2008 has seen the release of about 10 new mobile viruses and trojans , said simon heron , managing director of security firm network box .
" there are about 400 variants of mobile malware compared to in excess of 700,000 for computers , " said mr heron .
the vast majority of viruses written for mobile phones are aimed at the symbian mobile operating system - a consequence of its early dominance .
new viruses but these relatively low numbers do not mean that mobile malware can not cause problems .
said mr heron : " the phones themselves have vulnerabilities and there is tremendous take up of email , internet and texting from mobiles , making this one physical platform that can reach a huge number of people . "
in one outbreak logged by f-secure , one of the few firms that produces anti-virus software for phones , an operator with 14m subscribers had 8,000 devices infected with a virus that resulted in the sending of more than 450,000 multimedia messages -lrb- mms -rrb- .
one handset alone sent 3,500 of those messages .
figures gathered by f-secure suggest that for any operator with 9m subscribers or more they can depend on having 5 % of their mms traffic being virus carrying .
mobiles have become the gadget people carry everywhere with them among viruses for mobiles what has been growing are trojans that exploit mobile payment systems such as premium rate sms .
one instructive instance of such a malicious program is known as viver .
this was discovered in may 2007 and hides its malicious code inside three fake applications .
installing any one of those bogus applications on a symbian phone starts that handset sending costly premium rate sms messages to an international number .
each sms message costs about $ 7 -lrb- £ 3.50 -rrb- .
spam on mobiles is also starting to become a bigger problem .
one of the biggest spam bombardments on mobiles took place in march 2007 in china when about half the nation 's mobile phone owners received several unsolicited commercial messages in one day .
statistics gathered by adaptive mobile suggest that the average chinese mobile user gets about 6-10 spam sms messages per day .
in india spam traffic can make up 30 % of the text messages flying around networks .
in the uk spam numbers are lower and high profile problems with premium rate services has given rise to a system that has been adopted across all the operators .
texting the word " stop " to the company running a premium rate service should cancel any subscription and stop messages turning up .
if it does not then subscribers are advised to get in touch with their operator to report abuse .
a spokeswoman for vodafone said : " do not sign up for things if you do not know the source of it . "
" virus outbreaks do happen , " she added , " but they usually only affect a very small number of customers . "
" there is a combinations of things that have to happen for you to get hit , " said the spokeswoman .
for instance , she said , many mobile viruses have to be manually installed once they make their way on to a phone and require people to over-ride settings that warn against installation .

bbc news -pipe- programmes -pipe- panorama -pipe- something in the air bbc news / panorama graphics version bbc sport home 09:29 gmt , monday , 21 april 2008 10:29 uk something in the air a panorama investigation has shown how air passengers could be exposed to toxic fumes in the cabin while flying .
our investigators took swabs and air samples during two uk flights .
the air breathed on airliners is drawn in past the engines . "
this proves that oil from the engine gets into the air " professor christiaan van netten it can become polluted by any leaks of engine oil .
' fume events ' are rare but there are no accurate figures of just how many occur each year .
panorama 's secret swabs and samples were analysed by toxicologist , professor christiaan van netten .
the samples were taken from a boeing 757 and a british aerospace 146 .
neurotoxin professor van netten found traces of a neurotoxin - tri-cresylphosphate -lrb- tcp -rrb- in all the samples .
how the tests were done on two domestic flights we used air samplers approved by the us government and took swabs from surfaces on three planes to find out what had been left behind from previous flights .
" this proves that oil from the engine gets into the air and this is what you have been breathing during this flight when you took your sample , " he said .
" the pathway is there , that engine oil gets into the air and people are exposed to it . "
panorama 's investigation follows a series of claims from pilots and passengers who say they 've been made ill by toxic fumes .
the levels of the toxic chemicals found in panorama 's investigation were very low - well within international safety standards . "
these levels are very low and well within current international safety limits " boeing but they are still of concern to professor van netten .
" the international standards are based on non aircraft situations .
" we have to be really careful not to jump to conclusions when you say well this is very low concentration .
" it 's a low concentration but in combination with many other things .
" if there is a fume event you are exposed to much higher quantities of the tri-cresyl phosphates . "
safety limits samantha sabatino and her family believe they were made ill by airline cabin fumes and are taking their case to court read their story boeing told panorama : " as you are making clear these levels are very low and well within current international safety limits . "
bae systems said the sample was just one thousandth of the limit for long-term exposure prescribed in the uk health and safety standard .
within the industry , fumes have long been recognised as a hazard .
bae systems began notifying operators about problems with contaminated air , and the possibility of crew incapacitation , eight years ago .
bae says only a small proportion of fume events are due to oil leaks .
it adds that it has updated 70 per cent of oil seals and has no reports of fume events since fitting them .
it says the quality of air on the 146 has been proved by independent studies to exceed all international standards .
boeing told panorama it 's committed to providing a safe cabin environment .
and that studies show contaminant levels are low and health and safety standards are met .
the government is currently conducting its own studies of cabin air during ' fume events ' .
