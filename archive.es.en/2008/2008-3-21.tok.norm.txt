beijing has also expelled all foreign journalists from the region .
werner pfennig , a political scientist at berlin 's free university , is pessimistic about the prospects of any change happening soon . dw-world.de : why do you think that the protests in tibet and neighboring regions have taken place now ?
werner pfennig : i can only wildly speculate what the motives were of the individuals who actually took part in the protests .
however , march marks the anniversary of the 1959 uprising against the chinese army 's repressive actions .
it was also favorable because the people 's congress was meeting in beijing and tibet 's leading politicians were not in lhasa .
thirdly , the opening of olympic games is getting nearer and china is increasingly coming under the media spotlight .
protesters can count upon more media attention at the moment .
can we expect that what has happened will lead to any change in politics in china ?
no , if there is any change , it will be in terms of methods .
the autonomous region tibet is a fixed part of china and there is no possibility of secession from the people 's republic of china .
after the police and military 's " clean-up " operations , i could imagine that beijing 's strategies might change .
they might buy time , hold talks and get the olympics over and done with .
but there wo n't be any real change of direction .
tibet will continue to be regarded as a intrinsic part of the people 's republic .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : there have been demos calling for a boycott of the olympics this summer order has to be restored in tibet and neighboring regions and perhaps that will involve a renewed offer of dialog , but it wo n't happen overnight .
a big hurdle to any dialogue will that the two parties mean something very different when they refer to tibet .
for beijing , it 's the region of tibet with its 2.7 million people .
for exile tibetans , tibet means greater tibet with a population of 6 to 7 million , which includes the areas in neighbouring chinese regions where there are also protests .
does the west have any scope to exercise more influence on china over tibet ?
very little .
it is good that the demonstrations being staged by committed people : ngos , protesters with sympathy for tibet are getting prominent coverage in the media .
however , what 's more important is what 's taking place at the government level .
the polish government has said it will meet the dalai lama .
the german government has called upon the two sides not to use force and to solve the problems in dialog with one another .
i believe that one of the few options open to the west is to make it clear to the chinese government that , in the long term , talks are the only way ahead and that the dalai lama is the appropriate person to talk to .
why is the west 's strategy against china so different than that , for example , wielded against burma ?
burma is not china .
it 's a big economic power that also has many links with other parts of the world .
china is needed in problem regions , north korea , sudan , afghanistan .
there 's a long list .
burma , in contrast , has nothing to offer .
many of the women in the burmese textile industry have lost their jobs as a result , but in burma nothing has changed -lrb- despite some economic sanctions -rrb- .
economic boycotts have very rarely worked in the past because they rely on everyone adhering to them .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the dalai lama has criticized the crackdown but signaled a willingness to talk some have called for a boycott in response to what has happened in tibet .
do you think that there would be any point ?
if there were to be a boycott of the olympic games , for example , that would not lead to any change in the policies of the chinese government .
and , secondly , it must be possible to communicate the sense of a boycott to those who are immediately affected by it .
the chinese people would not understand why they should now be punished because of tibet and why they have made all of the sacrifices for the olympic games for nothing .
i also do n't think it would even be possible .
the olympic games are a huge economic event .
i do not think it would be feasible to impose a boycott against the wishes of huge media concerns and adidas , nike , etc .
do you think the german government could do more ?
i hope that the chinese government should be told as often and as forcefully as possible to sit down and talk with the dalai lama .
he is the best that they can speak to .
the next generation is more impatient and prepared to use violence .
the dalai lama is not aiming for independence , but for wide-reaching autonomy .
if as many people as possible say we know him , he 's trustworthy , find a way of talking to him , then that would be extremely helpful . inverview : julie gregson send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

the meeting between the two men raised hopes that are also crucial for turkey 's bid to join the european union . reading from a joint statement issued by cypriot president demetris christofias and turkish cypriot leader mehmet ali talat , moller said " the leaders have also agreed that ledra street will as soon as technically possible open and function in accordance with the established practices at other crossings . " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : demetris christofias waves to supporters after elections on feb .
17 speaking later in the day , nicosia mayor eleni mavrou said she was hopeful the street would be reopened by the end of the month . " technical work will begin on monday and i 'm optimistic that the crossing at ledra street will open by march 31 , " she told state radio . ledra street has been a symbol of the decades-old conflict between greek cypriots and turkish cypriots , with christofias calling it the heart of nicosia , the world 's last divided capital . " reduce the gap in the soul " last year , the greek cypriots tore down their side of the concrete barrier on the pedestrian street inside the old city 's 600-year-old venetian walls .
turkish cypriot authorities demolished their side in 2005 . following moller 's intervention , the greek and turkish-cypriot authorities hammered out a deal to open the barricaded street . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : ledra street it will be the sixth crossing point opened since april 2003 when turkish cypriots for the first time lifted entry restrictions for greek cypriots . the announcement came at a meeting between newly elected christofias , the greek cypriot leader , and talat at which they also agreed to start formal negotiations in three months ' time to seek an end to the mediterranean island 's 34-year division . speaking ahead of the anticipated deal on reopening ledra street , christofias said " this opening is very welcome .
by tradition it is the heart of nicosia , the heart of the people of nicosia .
it will bring further communication with people in order to reduce the gap in the soul and heart of the people . " it will convey the message that leaders are ready to make a step forward to a solution .
i 'm ready , it 's to talat to tell me . " last march , the border post on the southern side of the street was demolished . four decades of peacekeepers the barricades were among the first erected after intercommunal violence flared in the city in 1963 .
at the start of 1964 , un peacekeeping troops arrived on the island and have remained ever since . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : un peacekeepers walk along so-called " green line " separating turkish and greek cypriot communities the two sectors stand only around 50 meters -lrb- yards -rrb- apart at ledra street but it may take several days for the crossing to be opened as the area must be cleared of landmines and the buildings made safe after decades of neglect . cyprus has been divided along ethnic lines since 1974 when turkey seized its northern third in response to an short-lived , athens-engineered greek cypriot coup in nicosia aimed at uniting the island with greece . a un bid to reunite the island failed in 2004 when the greek cypriots voted against the plan in a referendum , although the turkish cypriots voted overwhelmingly in favor . nicosia municipality said it would need at least five days to complete the works which are expected to be carried out by greek cypriot and turkish cypriot municipalities of nicosia in conjunction with the united nations . dw staff -lrb- jam -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

beijing has also expelled all foreign journalists from the region .
werner pfennig , a political scientist at berlin 's free university , is pessimistic about the prospects of any change happening soon . dw-world.de : why do you think that the protests in tibet and neighboring regions have taken place now ?
werner pfennig : i can only wildly speculate what the motives were of the individuals who actually took part in the protests .
however , march marks the anniversary of the 1959 uprising against the chinese army 's repressive actions .
it was also favorable because the people 's congress was meeting in beijing and tibet 's leading politicians were not in lhasa .
thirdly , the opening of olympic games is getting nearer and china is increasingly coming under the media spotlight .
protesters can count upon more media attention at the moment .
can we expect that what has happened will lead to any change in politics in china ?
no , if there is any change , it will be in terms of methods .
the autonomous region tibet is a fixed part of china and there is no possibility of secession from the people 's republic of china .
after the police and military 's " clean-up " operations , i could imagine that beijing 's strategies might change .
they might buy time , hold talks and get the olympics over and done with .
but there wo n't be any real change of direction .
tibet will continue to be regarded as a intrinsic part of the people 's republic .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : there have been demos calling for a boycott of the olympics this summer order has to be restored in tibet and neighboring regions and perhaps that will involve a renewed offer of dialog , but it wo n't happen overnight .
a big hurdle to any dialogue will that the two parties mean something very different when they refer to tibet .
for beijing , it 's the region of tibet with its 2.7 million people .
for exile tibetans , tibet means greater tibet with a population of 6 to 7 million , which includes the areas in neighbouring chinese regions where there are also protests .
does the west have any scope to exercise more influence on china over tibet ?
very little .
it is good that the demonstrations being staged by committed people : ngos , protesters with sympathy for tibet are getting prominent coverage in the media .
however , what 's more important is what 's taking place at the government level .
the polish government has said it will meet the dalai lama .
the german government has called upon the two sides not to use force and to solve the problems in dialog with one another .
i believe that one of the few options open to the west is to make it clear to the chinese government that , in the long term , talks are the only way ahead and that the dalai lama is the appropriate person to talk to .
why is the west 's strategy against china so different than that , for example , wielded against burma ?
burma is not china .
it 's a big economic power that also has many links with other parts of the world .
china is needed in problem regions , north korea , sudan , afghanistan .
there 's a long list .
burma , in contrast , has nothing to offer .
many of the women in the burmese textile industry have lost their jobs as a result , but in burma nothing has changed -lrb- despite some economic sanctions -rrb- .
economic boycotts have very rarely worked in the past because they rely on everyone adhering to them .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the dalai lama has criticized the crackdown but signaled a willingness to talk some have called for a boycott in response to what has happened in tibet .
do you think that there would be any point ?
if there were to be a boycott of the olympic games , for example , that would not lead to any change in the policies of the chinese government .
and , secondly , it must be possible to communicate the sense of a boycott to those who are immediately affected by it .
the chinese people would not understand why they should now be punished because of tibet and why they have made all of the sacrifices for the olympic games for nothing .
i also do n't think it would even be possible .
the olympic games are a huge economic event .
i do not think it would be feasible to impose a boycott against the wishes of huge media concerns and adidas , nike , etc .
do you think the german government could do more ?
i hope that the chinese government should be told as often and as forcefully as possible to sit down and talk with the dalai lama .
he is the best that they can speak to .
the next generation is more impatient and prepared to use violence .
the dalai lama is not aiming for independence , but for wide-reaching autonomy .

beijing has also expelled all foreign journalists from the region .
werner pfennig , a political scientist at berlin 's free university , is pessimistic about the prospects of any change happening soon . dw-world.de : why do you think that the protests in tibet and neighboring regions have taken place now ?
werner pfennig : i can only wildly speculate what the motives were of the individuals who actually took part in the protests .
however , march marks the anniversary of the 1959 uprising against the chinese army 's repressive actions .
it was also favorable because the people 's congress was meeting in beijing and tibet 's leading politicians were not in lhasa .
thirdly , the opening of olympic games is getting nearer and china is increasingly coming under the media spotlight .
protesters can count upon more media attention at the moment .
can we expect that what has happened will lead to any change in politics in china ?
no , if there is any change , it will be in terms of methods .
the autonomous region tibet is a fixed part of china and there is no possibility of secession from the people 's republic of china .
after the police and military 's " clean-up " operations , i could imagine that beijing 's strategies might change .
they might buy time , hold talks and get the olympics over and done with .
but there wo n't be any real change of direction .
tibet will continue to be regarded as a intrinsic part of the people 's republic .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : there have been demos calling for a boycott of the olympics this summer order has to be restored in tibet and neighboring regions and perhaps that will involve a renewed offer of dialog , but it wo n't happen overnight .
a big hurdle to any dialogue will that the two parties mean something very different when they refer to tibet .
for beijing , it 's the region of tibet with its 2.7 million people .
for exile tibetans , tibet means greater tibet with a population of 6 to 7 million , which includes the areas in neighbouring chinese regions where there are also protests .
does the west have any scope to exercise more influence on china over tibet ?
very little .
it is good that the demonstrations being staged by committed people : ngos , protesters with sympathy for tibet are getting prominent coverage in the media .
however , what 's more important is what 's taking place at the government level .
the polish government has said it will meet the dalai lama .
the german government has called upon the two sides not to use force and to solve the problems in dialog with one another .
i believe that one of the few options open to the west is to make it clear to the chinese government that , in the long term , talks are the only way ahead and that the dalai lama is the appropriate person to talk to .
why is the west 's strategy against china so different than that , for example , wielded against burma ?
burma is not china .
it 's a big economic power that also has many links with other parts of the world .
china is needed in problem regions , north korea , sudan , afghanistan .
there 's a long list .
burma , in contrast , has nothing to offer .
many of the women in the burmese textile industry have lost their jobs as a result , but in burma nothing has changed -lrb- despite some economic sanctions -rrb- .
economic boycotts have very rarely worked in the past because they rely on everyone adhering to them .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the dalai lama has criticized the crackdown but signaled a willingness to talk some have called for a boycott in response to what has happened in tibet .
do you think that there would be any point ?
if there were to be a boycott of the olympic games , for example , that would not lead to any change in the policies of the chinese government .
and , secondly , it must be possible to communicate the sense of a boycott to those who are immediately affected by it .
the chinese people would not understand why they should now be punished because of tibet and why they have made all of the sacrifices for the olympic games for nothing .
i also do n't think it would even be possible .
the olympic games are a huge economic event .
i do not think it would be feasible to impose a boycott against the wishes of huge media concerns and adidas , nike , etc .
do you think the german government could do more ?
i hope that the chinese government should be told as often and as forcefully as possible to sit down and talk with the dalai lama .
he is the best that they can speak to .
the next generation is more impatient and prepared to use violence .
the dalai lama is not aiming for independence , but for wide-reaching autonomy .

the meeting between the two men raised hopes that are also crucial for turkey 's bid to join the european union . reading from a joint statement issued by cypriot president demetris christofias and turkish cypriot leader mehmet ali talat , moller said " the leaders have also agreed that ledra street will as soon as technically possible open and function in accordance with the established practices at other crossings . " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : demetris christofias waves to supporters after elections on feb .
17 speaking later in the day , nicosia mayor eleni mavrou said she was hopeful the street would be reopened by the end of the month . " technical work will begin on monday and i 'm optimistic that the crossing at ledra street will open by march 31 , " she told state radio . ledra street has been a symbol of the decades-old conflict between greek cypriots and turkish cypriots , with christofias calling it the heart of nicosia , the world 's last divided capital . " reduce the gap in the soul " last year , the greek cypriots tore down their side of the concrete barrier on the pedestrian street inside the old city 's 600-year-old venetian walls .
turkish cypriot authorities demolished their side in 2005 . following moller 's intervention , the greek and turkish-cypriot authorities hammered out a deal to open the barricaded street . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : ledra street it will be the sixth crossing point opened since april 2003 when turkish cypriots for the first time lifted entry restrictions for greek cypriots . the announcement came at a meeting between newly elected christofias , the greek cypriot leader , and talat at which they also agreed to start formal negotiations in three months ' time to seek an end to the mediterranean island 's 34-year division . speaking ahead of the anticipated deal on reopening ledra street , christofias said " this opening is very welcome .
by tradition it is the heart of nicosia , the heart of the people of nicosia .
it will bring further communication with people in order to reduce the gap in the soul and heart of the people . " it will convey the message that leaders are ready to make a step forward to a solution .
i 'm ready , it 's to talat to tell me . " last march , the border post on the southern side of the street was demolished . four decades of peacekeepers the barricades were among the first erected after intercommunal violence flared in the city in 1963 .
at the start of 1964 , un peacekeeping troops arrived on the island and have remained ever since . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : un peacekeepers walk along so-called " green line " separating turkish and greek cypriot communities the two sectors stand only around 50 meters -lrb- yards -rrb- apart at ledra street but it may take several days for the crossing to be opened as the area must be cleared of landmines and the buildings made safe after decades of neglect . cyprus has been divided along ethnic lines since 1974 when turkey seized its northern third in response to an short-lived , athens-engineered greek cypriot coup in nicosia aimed at uniting the island with greece . a un bid to reunite the island failed in 2004 when the greek cypriots voted against the plan in a referendum , although the turkish cypriots voted overwhelmingly in favor . nicosia municipality said it would need at least five days to complete the works which are expected to be carried out by greek cypriot and turkish cypriot municipalities of nicosia in conjunction with the united nations . dw staff -lrb- jam -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

" the -lrb- german -rrb- government is telling the chinese very clearly : make sure that there is transparency !
we want to know exactly what is happening in tibet , " steinmeier told the mass circulation bild newspaper in an interview published saturday . " china is hurting itself if it stops foreign observers from getting an idea of the situation . " steinmeier said window-dressing for television was no longer doing it for the outside world " when chaos is reigning in the backyard . " " he who organizes olympic games today must let thousands of journalists into the country , " he added .
" nothing can be hidden .

the dalai lama has said he is against the current violence and only wants more autonomy for his homeland . faced with international concern over its handling of the crisis , chinese state media have acknowledged that police opened fire on protesters . after days of official statements that no lethal force had been used to quash the unrest , which has left an unknown number dead since protests broke out last week . china has said that 13 " innocent civilians " died in anti-chinese riots last week in tibet 's capital , lhasa .
exiled tibetans put the number of dead at 100 . china has barred foreign reporters from lhasa and parts of neighboring provinces that have seen unrest . the unrest has come at a sensitive time for china 's rulers , with the beijing olympics less than five months away . dw staff -lrb- jam -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

beijing has also expelled all foreign journalists from the region .
werner pfennig , a political scientist at berlin 's free university , is pessimistic about the prospects of any change happening soon . dw-world.de : why do you think that the protests in tibet and neighboring regions have taken place now ?
werner pfennig : i can only wildly speculate what the motives were of the individuals who actually took part in the protests .
however , march marks the anniversary of the 1959 uprising against the chinese army 's repressive actions .
it was also favorable because the people 's congress was meeting in beijing and tibet 's leading politicians were not in lhasa .
thirdly , the opening of olympic games is getting nearer and china is increasingly coming under the media spotlight .
protesters can count upon more media attention at the moment .
can we expect that what has happened will lead to any change in politics in china ?
no , if there is any change , it will be in terms of methods .
the autonomous region tibet is a fixed part of china and there is no possibility of secession from the people 's republic of china .
after the police and military 's " clean-up " operations , i could imagine that beijing 's strategies might change .
they might buy time , hold talks and get the olympics over and done with .
but there wo n't be any real change of direction .
tibet will continue to be regarded as a intrinsic part of the people 's republic .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : there have been demos calling for a boycott of the olympics this summer order has to be restored in tibet and neighboring regions and perhaps that will involve a renewed offer of dialog , but it wo n't happen overnight .
a big hurdle to any dialogue will that the two parties mean something very different when they refer to tibet .
for beijing , it 's the region of tibet with its 2.7 million people .
for exile tibetans , tibet means greater tibet with a population of 6 to 7 million , which includes the areas in neighbouring chinese regions where there are also protests .
does the west have any scope to exercise more influence on china over tibet ?
very little .
it is good that the demonstrations being staged by committed people : ngos , protesters with sympathy for tibet are getting prominent coverage in the media .
however , what 's more important is what 's taking place at the government level .
the polish government has said it will meet the dalai lama .
the german government has called upon the two sides not to use force and to solve the problems in dialog with one another .
i believe that one of the few options open to the west is to make it clear to the chinese government that , in the long term , talks are the only way ahead and that the dalai lama is the appropriate person to talk to .
why is the west 's strategy against china so different than that , for example , wielded against burma ?
burma is not china .
it 's a big economic power that also has many links with other parts of the world .
china is needed in problem regions , north korea , sudan , afghanistan .
there 's a long list .
burma , in contrast , has nothing to offer .
many of the women in the burmese textile industry have lost their jobs as a result , but in burma nothing has changed -lrb- despite some economic sanctions -rrb- .
economic boycotts have very rarely worked in the past because they rely on everyone adhering to them .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the dalai lama has criticized the crackdown but signaled a willingness to talk some have called for a boycott in response to what has happened in tibet .
do you think that there would be any point ?
if there were to be a boycott of the olympic games , for example , that would not lead to any change in the policies of the chinese government .
and , secondly , it must be possible to communicate the sense of a boycott to those who are immediately affected by it .
the chinese people would not understand why they should now be punished because of tibet and why they have made all of the sacrifices for the olympic games for nothing .
i also do n't think it would even be possible .
the olympic games are a huge economic event .
i do not think it would be feasible to impose a boycott against the wishes of huge media concerns and adidas , nike , etc .
do you think the german government could do more ?
i hope that the chinese government should be told as often and as forcefully as possible to sit down and talk with the dalai lama .
he is the best that they can speak to .
the next generation is more impatient and prepared to use violence .
the dalai lama is not aiming for independence , but for wide-reaching autonomy .
if as many people as possible say we know him , he 's trustworthy , find a way of talking to him , then that would be extremely helpful . inverview : julie gregson send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

beijing has also expelled all foreign journalists from the region .
werner pfennig , a political scientist at berlin 's free university , is pessimistic about the prospects of any change happening soon . dw-world.de : why do you think that the protests in tibet and neighboring regions have taken place now ?
werner pfennig : i can only wildly speculate what the motives were of the individuals who actually took part in the protests .
however , march marks the anniversary of the 1959 uprising against the chinese army 's repressive actions .
it was also favorable because the people 's congress was meeting in beijing and tibet 's leading politicians were not in lhasa .
thirdly , the opening of olympic games is getting nearer and china is increasingly coming under the media spotlight .
protesters can count upon more media attention at the moment .
can we expect that what has happened will lead to any change in politics in china ?
no , if there is any change , it will be in terms of methods .
the autonomous region tibet is a fixed part of china and there is no possibility of secession from the people 's republic of china .
after the police and military 's " clean-up " operations , i could imagine that beijing 's strategies might change .
they might buy time , hold talks and get the olympics over and done with .
but there wo n't be any real change of direction .
tibet will continue to be regarded as a intrinsic part of the people 's republic .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : there have been demos calling for a boycott of the olympics this summer order has to be restored in tibet and neighboring regions and perhaps that will involve a renewed offer of dialog , but it wo n't happen overnight .
a big hurdle to any dialogue will that the two parties mean something very different when they refer to tibet .
for beijing , it 's the region of tibet with its 2.7 million people .
for exile tibetans , tibet means greater tibet with a population of 6 to 7 million , which includes the areas in neighbouring chinese regions where there are also protests .
does the west have any scope to exercise more influence on china over tibet ?
very little .
it is good that the demonstrations being staged by committed people : ngos , protesters with sympathy for tibet are getting prominent coverage in the media .
however , what 's more important is what 's taking place at the government level .
the polish government has said it will meet the dalai lama .
the german government has called upon the two sides not to use force and to solve the problems in dialog with one another .
i believe that one of the few options open to the west is to make it clear to the chinese government that , in the long term , talks are the only way ahead and that the dalai lama is the appropriate person to talk to .
why is the west 's strategy against china so different than that , for example , wielded against burma ?
burma is not china .
it 's a big economic power that also has many links with other parts of the world .
china is needed in problem regions , north korea , sudan , afghanistan .
there 's a long list .
burma , in contrast , has nothing to offer .
many of the women in the burmese textile industry have lost their jobs as a result , but in burma nothing has changed -lrb- despite some economic sanctions -rrb- .
economic boycotts have very rarely worked in the past because they rely on everyone adhering to them .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the dalai lama has criticized the crackdown but signaled a willingness to talk some have called for a boycott in response to what has happened in tibet .
do you think that there would be any point ?
if there were to be a boycott of the olympic games , for example , that would not lead to any change in the policies of the chinese government .
and , secondly , it must be possible to communicate the sense of a boycott to those who are immediately affected by it .
the chinese people would not understand why they should now be punished because of tibet and why they have made all of the sacrifices for the olympic games for nothing .
i also do n't think it would even be possible .
the olympic games are a huge economic event .
i do not think it would be feasible to impose a boycott against the wishes of huge media concerns and adidas , nike , etc .
do you think the german government could do more ?
i hope that the chinese government should be told as often and as forcefully as possible to sit down and talk with the dalai lama .
he is the best that they can speak to .
the next generation is more impatient and prepared to use violence .
the dalai lama is not aiming for independence , but for wide-reaching autonomy .
if as many people as possible say we know him , he 's trustworthy , find a way of talking to him , then that would be extremely helpful . inverview : julie gregson send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

beijing has also expelled all foreign journalists from the region .
werner pfennig , a political scientist at berlin 's free university , is pessimistic about the prospects of any change happening soon . dw-world.de : why do you think that the protests in tibet and neighboring regions have taken place now ?
werner pfennig : i can only wildly speculate what the motives were of the individuals who actually took part in the protests .
however , march marks the anniversary of the 1959 uprising against the chinese army 's repressive actions .
it was also favorable because the people 's congress was meeting in beijing and tibet 's leading politicians were not in lhasa .
thirdly , the opening of olympic games is getting nearer and china is increasingly coming under the media spotlight .
protesters can count upon more media attention at the moment .
can we expect that what has happened will lead to any change in politics in china ?
no , if there is any change , it will be in terms of methods .
the autonomous region tibet is a fixed part of china and there is no possibility of secession from the people 's republic of china .
after the police and military 's " clean-up " operations , i could imagine that beijing 's strategies might change .
they might buy time , hold talks and get the olympics over and done with .

tibet will continue to be regarded as a intrinsic part of the people 's republic .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : there have been demos calling for a boycott of the olympics this summer order has to be restored in tibet and neighboring regions and perhaps that will involve a renewed offer of dialog , but it wo n't happen overnight .
a big hurdle to any dialogue will that the two parties mean something very different when they refer to tibet .
for beijing , it 's the region of tibet with its 2.7 million people .
for exile tibetans , tibet means greater tibet with a population of 6 to 7 million , which includes the areas in neighbouring chinese regions where there are also protests .
does the west have any scope to exercise more influence on china over tibet ?
very little .
it is good that the demonstrations being staged by committed people : ngos , protesters with sympathy for tibet are getting prominent coverage in the media .
however , what 's more important is what 's taking place at the government level .
the polish government has said it will meet the dalai lama .
the german government has called upon the two sides not to use force and to solve the problems in dialog with one another .
i believe that one of the few options open to the west is to make it clear to the chinese government that , in the long term , talks are the only way ahead and that the dalai lama is the appropriate person to talk to .
why is the west 's strategy against china so different than that , for example , wielded against burma ?
burma is not china .
it 's a big economic power that also has many links with other parts of the world .
china is needed in problem regions , north korea , sudan , afghanistan .
there 's a long list .
burma , in contrast , has nothing to offer .
many of the women in the burmese textile industry have lost their jobs as a result , but in burma nothing has changed -lrb- despite some economic sanctions -rrb- .

if there were to be a boycott of the olympic games , for example , that would not lead to any change in the policies of the chinese government .
and , secondly , it must be possible to communicate the sense of a boycott to those who are immediately affected by it .
the chinese people would not understand why they should now be punished because of tibet and why they have made all of the sacrifices for the olympic games for nothing .

the olympic games are a huge economic event .

i hope that the chinese government should be told as often and as forcefully as possible to sit down and talk with the dalai lama .

beijing has also expelled all foreign journalists from the region .
werner pfennig , a political scientist at berlin 's free university , is pessimistic about the prospects of any change happening soon . dw-world.de : why do you think that the protests in tibet and neighboring regions have taken place now ?
werner pfennig : i can only wildly speculate what the motives were of the individuals who actually took part in the protests .
however , march marks the anniversary of the 1959 uprising against the chinese army 's repressive actions .

can we expect that what has happened will lead to any change in politics in china ?
no , if there is any change , it will be in terms of methods .
the autonomous region tibet is a fixed part of china and there is no possibility of secession from the people 's republic of china .
after the police and military 's " clean-up " operations , i could imagine that beijing 's strategies might change .

a big hurdle to any dialogue will that the two parties mean something very different when they refer to tibet .
for beijing , it 's the region of tibet with its 2.7 million people .
for exile tibetans , tibet means greater tibet with a population of 6 to 7 million , which includes the areas in neighbouring chinese regions where there are also protests .
does the west have any scope to exercise more influence on china over tibet ?
very little .
it is good that the demonstrations being staged by committed people : ngos , protesters with sympathy for tibet are getting prominent coverage in the media .
however , what 's more important is what 's taking place at the government level .
the polish government has said it will meet the dalai lama .
the german government has called upon the two sides not to use force and to solve the problems in dialog with one another .
i believe that one of the few options open to the west is to make it clear to the chinese government that , in the long term , talks are the only way ahead and that the dalai lama is the appropriate person to talk to .
why is the west 's strategy against china so different than that , for example , wielded against burma ?
burma is not china .
it 's a big economic power that also has many links with other parts of the world .
china is needed in problem regions , north korea , sudan , afghanistan .
there 's a long list .
burma , in contrast , has nothing to offer .

if there were to be a boycott of the olympic games , for example , that would not lead to any change in the policies of the chinese government .
and , secondly , it must be possible to communicate the sense of a boycott to those who are immediately affected by it .
the chinese people would not understand why they should now be punished because of tibet and why they have made all of the sacrifices for the olympic games for nothing .

the olympic games are a huge economic event .
i do not think it would be feasible to impose a boycott against the wishes of huge media concerns and adidas , nike , etc .

i hope that the chinese government should be told as often and as forcefully as possible to sit down and talk with the dalai lama .
he is the best that they can speak to .

" nothing can be hidden .

exiled tibetans put the number of dead at 100 . china has barred foreign reporters from lhasa and parts of neighboring provinces that have seen unrest . the unrest has come at a sensitive time for china 's rulers , with the beijing olympics less than five months away . dw staff -lrb- jam -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

the meeting between the two men raised hopes that are also crucial for turkey 's bid to join the european union . reading from a joint statement issued by cypriot president demetris christofias and turkish cypriot leader mehmet ali talat , moller said " the leaders have also agreed that ledra street will as soon as technically possible open and function in accordance with the established practices at other crossings . " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : demetris christofias waves to supporters after elections on feb .
17 speaking later in the day , nicosia mayor eleni mavrou said she was hopeful the street would be reopened by the end of the month . " technical work will begin on monday and i 'm optimistic that the crossing at ledra street will open by march 31 , " she told state radio . ledra street has been a symbol of the decades-old conflict between greek cypriots and turkish cypriots , with christofias calling it the heart of nicosia , the world 's last divided capital . " reduce the gap in the soul " last year , the greek cypriots tore down their side of the concrete barrier on the pedestrian street inside the old city 's 600-year-old venetian walls .
turkish cypriot authorities demolished their side in 2005 . following moller 's intervention , the greek and turkish-cypriot authorities hammered out a deal to open the barricaded street . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : ledra street it will be the sixth crossing point opened since april 2003 when turkish cypriots for the first time lifted entry restrictions for greek cypriots . the announcement came at a meeting between newly elected christofias , the greek cypriot leader , and talat at which they also agreed to start formal negotiations in three months ' time to seek an end to the mediterranean island 's 34-year division . speaking ahead of the anticipated deal on reopening ledra street , christofias said " this opening is very welcome .
by tradition it is the heart of nicosia , the heart of the people of nicosia .
it will bring further communication with people in order to reduce the gap in the soul and heart of the people . " it will convey the message that leaders are ready to make a step forward to a solution .
i 'm ready , it 's to talat to tell me . " last march , the border post on the southern side of the street was demolished . four decades of peacekeepers the barricades were among the first erected after intercommunal violence flared in the city in 1963 .
at the start of 1964 , un peacekeeping troops arrived on the island and have remained ever since . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : un peacekeepers walk along so-called " green line " separating turkish and greek cypriot communities the two sectors stand only around 50 meters -lrb- yards -rrb- apart at ledra street but it may take several days for the crossing to be opened as the area must be cleared of landmines and the buildings made safe after decades of neglect . cyprus has been divided along ethnic lines since 1974 when turkey seized its northern third in response to an short-lived , athens-engineered greek cypriot coup in nicosia aimed at uniting the island with greece . a un bid to reunite the island failed in 2004 when the greek cypriots voted against the plan in a referendum , although the turkish cypriots voted overwhelmingly in favor . nicosia municipality said it would need at least five days to complete the works which are expected to be carried out by greek cypriot and turkish cypriot municipalities of nicosia in conjunction with the united nations . dw staff -lrb- jam -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

beijing has also expelled all foreign journalists from the region .
werner pfennig , a political scientist at berlin 's free university , is pessimistic about the prospects of any change happening soon . dw-world.de : why do you think that the protests in tibet and neighboring regions have taken place now ?
werner pfennig : i can only wildly speculate what the motives were of the individuals who actually took part in the protests .
however , march marks the anniversary of the 1959 uprising against the chinese army 's repressive actions .
it was also favorable because the people 's congress was meeting in beijing and tibet 's leading politicians were not in lhasa .
thirdly , the opening of olympic games is getting nearer and china is increasingly coming under the media spotlight .
protesters can count upon more media attention at the moment .
can we expect that what has happened will lead to any change in politics in china ?
no , if there is any change , it will be in terms of methods .
the autonomous region tibet is a fixed part of china and there is no possibility of secession from the people 's republic of china .
after the police and military 's " clean-up " operations , i could imagine that beijing 's strategies might change .
they might buy time , hold talks and get the olympics over and done with .
but there wo n't be any real change of direction .
tibet will continue to be regarded as a intrinsic part of the people 's republic .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : there have been demos calling for a boycott of the olympics this summer order has to be restored in tibet and neighboring regions and perhaps that will involve a renewed offer of dialog , but it wo n't happen overnight .
a big hurdle to any dialogue will that the two parties mean something very different when they refer to tibet .
for beijing , it 's the region of tibet with its 2.7 million people .
for exile tibetans , tibet means greater tibet with a population of 6 to 7 million , which includes the areas in neighbouring chinese regions where there are also protests .
does the west have any scope to exercise more influence on china over tibet ?
very little .
it is good that the demonstrations being staged by committed people : ngos , protesters with sympathy for tibet are getting prominent coverage in the media .
however , what 's more important is what 's taking place at the government level .
the polish government has said it will meet the dalai lama .
the german government has called upon the two sides not to use force and to solve the problems in dialog with one another .
i believe that one of the few options open to the west is to make it clear to the chinese government that , in the long term , talks are the only way ahead and that the dalai lama is the appropriate person to talk to .
why is the west 's strategy against china so different than that , for example , wielded against burma ?
burma is not china .
it 's a big economic power that also has many links with other parts of the world .
china is needed in problem regions , north korea , sudan , afghanistan .
there 's a long list .
burma , in contrast , has nothing to offer .
many of the women in the burmese textile industry have lost their jobs as a result , but in burma nothing has changed -lrb- despite some economic sanctions -rrb- .
economic boycotts have very rarely worked in the past because they rely on everyone adhering to them .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the dalai lama has criticized the crackdown but signaled a willingness to talk some have called for a boycott in response to what has happened in tibet .
do you think that there would be any point ?
if there were to be a boycott of the olympic games , for example , that would not lead to any change in the policies of the chinese government .
and , secondly , it must be possible to communicate the sense of a boycott to those who are immediately affected by it .
the chinese people would not understand why they should now be punished because of tibet and why they have made all of the sacrifices for the olympic games for nothing .
i also do n't think it would even be possible .
the olympic games are a huge economic event .
i do not think it would be feasible to impose a boycott against the wishes of huge media concerns and adidas , nike , etc .
do you think the german government could do more ?
i hope that the chinese government should be told as often and as forcefully as possible to sit down and talk with the dalai lama .
he is the best that they can speak to .
the next generation is more impatient and prepared to use violence .
the dalai lama is not aiming for independence , but for wide-reaching autonomy .
if as many people as possible say we know him , he 's trustworthy , find a way of talking to him , then that would be extremely helpful . inverview : julie gregson send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

beijing has also expelled all foreign journalists from the region .
werner pfennig , a political scientist at berlin 's free university , is pessimistic about the prospects of any change happening soon . dw-world.de : why do you think that the protests in tibet and neighboring regions have taken place now ?
werner pfennig : i can only wildly speculate what the motives were of the individuals who actually took part in the protests .
however , march marks the anniversary of the 1959 uprising against the chinese army 's repressive actions .
it was also favorable because the people 's congress was meeting in beijing and tibet 's leading politicians were not in lhasa .
thirdly , the opening of olympic games is getting nearer and china is increasingly coming under the media spotlight .
protesters can count upon more media attention at the moment .
can we expect that what has happened will lead to any change in politics in china ?
no , if there is any change , it will be in terms of methods .
the autonomous region tibet is a fixed part of china and there is no possibility of secession from the people 's republic of china .
after the police and military 's " clean-up " operations , i could imagine that beijing 's strategies might change .
they might buy time , hold talks and get the olympics over and done with .
but there wo n't be any real change of direction .
tibet will continue to be regarded as a intrinsic part of the people 's republic .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : there have been demos calling for a boycott of the olympics this summer order has to be restored in tibet and neighboring regions and perhaps that will involve a renewed offer of dialog , but it wo n't happen overnight .
a big hurdle to any dialogue will that the two parties mean something very different when they refer to tibet .
for beijing , it 's the region of tibet with its 2.7 million people .
for exile tibetans , tibet means greater tibet with a population of 6 to 7 million , which includes the areas in neighbouring chinese regions where there are also protests .
does the west have any scope to exercise more influence on china over tibet ?
very little .
it is good that the demonstrations being staged by committed people : ngos , protesters with sympathy for tibet are getting prominent coverage in the media .
however , what 's more important is what 's taking place at the government level .
the polish government has said it will meet the dalai lama .
the german government has called upon the two sides not to use force and to solve the problems in dialog with one another .
i believe that one of the few options open to the west is to make it clear to the chinese government that , in the long term , talks are the only way ahead and that the dalai lama is the appropriate person to talk to .
why is the west 's strategy against china so different than that , for example , wielded against burma ?
burma is not china .
it 's a big economic power that also has many links with other parts of the world .
china is needed in problem regions , north korea , sudan , afghanistan .
there 's a long list .
burma , in contrast , has nothing to offer .
many of the women in the burmese textile industry have lost their jobs as a result , but in burma nothing has changed -lrb- despite some economic sanctions -rrb- .

do you think that there would be any point ?
if there were to be a boycott of the olympic games , for example , that would not lead to any change in the policies of the chinese government .
and , secondly , it must be possible to communicate the sense of a boycott to those who are immediately affected by it .
the chinese people would not understand why they should now be punished because of tibet and why they have made all of the sacrifices for the olympic games for nothing .
i also do n't think it would even be possible .
the olympic games are a huge economic event .
i do not think it would be feasible to impose a boycott against the wishes of huge media concerns and adidas , nike , etc .
do you think the german government could do more ?
i hope that the chinese government should be told as often and as forcefully as possible to sit down and talk with the dalai lama .
he is the best that they can speak to .
the next generation is more impatient and prepared to use violence .
the dalai lama is not aiming for independence , but for wide-reaching autonomy .

" steinmeier said window-dressing for television was no longer doing it for the outside world " when chaos is reigning in the backyard .

" nothing can be hidden .

exiled tibetans put the number of dead at 100 . china has barred foreign reporters from lhasa and parts of neighboring provinces that have seen unrest . the unrest has come at a sensitive time for china 's rulers , with the beijing olympics less than five months away . dw staff -lrb- jam -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

the meeting between the two men raised hopes that are also crucial for turkey 's bid to join the european union . reading from a joint statement issued by cypriot president demetris christofias and turkish cypriot leader mehmet ali talat , moller said " the leaders have also agreed that ledra street will as soon as technically possible open and function in accordance with the established practices at other crossings . " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : demetris christofias waves to supporters after elections on feb .
17 speaking later in the day , nicosia mayor eleni mavrou said she was hopeful the street would be reopened by the end of the month . " technical work will begin on monday and i 'm optimistic that the crossing at ledra street will open by march 31 , " she told state radio . ledra street has been a symbol of the decades-old conflict between greek cypriots and turkish cypriots , with christofias calling it the heart of nicosia , the world 's last divided capital . " reduce the gap in the soul " last year , the greek cypriots tore down their side of the concrete barrier on the pedestrian street inside the old city 's 600-year-old venetian walls .
turkish cypriot authorities demolished their side in 2005 . following moller 's intervention , the greek and turkish-cypriot authorities hammered out a deal to open the barricaded street . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : ledra street it will be the sixth crossing point opened since april 2003 when turkish cypriots for the first time lifted entry restrictions for greek cypriots . the announcement came at a meeting between newly elected christofias , the greek cypriot leader , and talat at which they also agreed to start formal negotiations in three months ' time to seek an end to the mediterranean island 's 34-year division . speaking ahead of the anticipated deal on reopening ledra street , christofias said " this opening is very welcome .
by tradition it is the heart of nicosia , the heart of the people of nicosia .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de in focus : dossier : independence demonstrations turn violent in tibet olympic torch starts journey to beijing , despite disruptions germany suspends aid talks with china over tibet violence germany calls on china to open up on tibet china expels last foreign journalists from tibet international relations -pipe- 21.03.2008 expert believes west can do little to sway china over tibet großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : china has reacted with force - lethal in some cases - to the protests as the un 's top human rights body faces calls to break its silence over china 's crackdown in tibet , dw-world.de spoke to a german political expert about the protests and what action the international community can take . china appears to be ramping up its security presence in tibet and neighboring regions , and has admitted that security forces shot four people in the southwestern sichuan province .
beijing has also expelled all foreign journalists from the region .
werner pfennig , a political scientist at berlin 's free university , is pessimistic about the prospects of any change happening soon . dw-world.de : why do you think that the protests in tibet and neighboring regions have taken place now ?
werner pfennig : i can only wildly speculate what the motives were of the individuals who actually took part in the protests .
however , march marks the anniversary of the 1959 uprising against the chinese army 's repressive actions .
it was also favorable because the people 's congress was meeting in beijing and tibet 's leading politicians were not in lhasa .
thirdly , the opening of olympic games is getting nearer and china is increasingly coming under the media spotlight .
protesters can count upon more media attention at the moment .
can we expect that what has happened will lead to any change in politics in china ?
no , if there is any change , it will be in terms of methods .
the autonomous region tibet is a fixed part of china and there is no possibility of secession from the people 's republic of china .
after the police and military 's " clean-up " operations , i could imagine that beijing 's strategies might change .
they might buy time , hold talks and get the olympics over and done with .
but there wo n't be any real change of direction .
tibet will continue to be regarded as a intrinsic part of the people 's republic .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : there have been demos calling for a boycott of the olympics this summer order has to be restored in tibet and neighboring regions and perhaps that will involve a renewed offer of dialog , but it wo n't happen overnight .
a big hurdle to any dialogue will that the two parties mean something very different when they refer to tibet .
for beijing , it 's the region of tibet with its 2.7 million people .
for exile tibetans , tibet means greater tibet with a population of 6 to 7 million , which includes the areas in neighbouring chinese regions where there are also protests .
does the west have any scope to exercise more influence on china over tibet ?
very little .
it is good that the demonstrations being staged by committed people : ngos , protesters with sympathy for tibet are getting prominent coverage in the media .
however , what 's more important is what 's taking place at the government level .
the polish government has said it will meet the dalai lama .
the german government has called upon the two sides not to use force and to solve the problems in dialog with one another .
i believe that one of the few options open to the west is to make it clear to the chinese government that , in the long term , talks are the only way ahead and that the dalai lama is the appropriate person to talk to .
why is the west 's strategy against china so different than that , for example , wielded against burma ?
burma is not china .
it 's a big economic power that also has many links with other parts of the world .
china is needed in problem regions , north korea , sudan , afghanistan .
there 's a long list .
burma , in contrast , has nothing to offer .
many of the women in the burmese textile industry have lost their jobs as a result , but in burma nothing has changed -lrb- despite some economic sanctions -rrb- .
economic boycotts have very rarely worked in the past because they rely on everyone adhering to them .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the dalai lama has criticized the crackdown but signaled a willingness to talk some have called for a boycott in response to what has happened in tibet .
do you think that there would be any point ?
if there were to be a boycott of the olympic games , for example , that would not lead to any change in the policies of the chinese government .
and , secondly , it must be possible to communicate the sense of a boycott to those who are immediately affected by it .
the chinese people would not understand why they should now be punished because of tibet and why they have made all of the sacrifices for the olympic games for nothing .
i also do n't think it would even be possible .
the olympic games are a huge economic event .
i do not think it would be feasible to impose a boycott against the wishes of huge media concerns and adidas , nike , etc .
do you think the german government could do more ?
i hope that the chinese government should be told as often and as forcefully as possible to sit down and talk with the dalai lama .
he is the best that they can speak to .
the next generation is more impatient and prepared to use violence .
the dalai lama is not aiming for independence , but for wide-reaching autonomy .
if as many people as possible say we know him , he 's trustworthy , find a way of talking to him , then that would be extremely helpful . inverview : julie gregson send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

the meeting between the two men raised hopes that are also crucial for turkey 's bid to join the european union . reading from a joint statement issued by cypriot president demetris christofias and turkish cypriot leader mehmet ali talat , moller said " the leaders have also agreed that ledra street will as soon as technically possible open and function in accordance with the established practices at other crossings . " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : demetris christofias waves to supporters after elections on feb .
17 speaking later in the day , nicosia mayor eleni mavrou said she was hopeful the street would be reopened by the end of the month . " technical work will begin on monday and i 'm optimistic that the crossing at ledra street will open by march 31 , " she told state radio . ledra street has been a symbol of the decades-old conflict between greek cypriots and turkish cypriots , with christofias calling it the heart of nicosia , the world 's last divided capital . " reduce the gap in the soul " last year , the greek cypriots tore down their side of the concrete barrier on the pedestrian street inside the old city 's 600-year-old venetian walls .
turkish cypriot authorities demolished their side in 2005 . following moller 's intervention , the greek and turkish-cypriot authorities hammered out a deal to open the barricaded street . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : ledra street it will be the sixth crossing point opened since april 2003 when turkish cypriots for the first time lifted entry restrictions for greek cypriots . the announcement came at a meeting between newly elected christofias , the greek cypriot leader , and talat at which they also agreed to start formal negotiations in three months ' time to seek an end to the mediterranean island 's 34-year division . speaking ahead of the anticipated deal on reopening ledra street , christofias said " this opening is very welcome .
by tradition it is the heart of nicosia , the heart of the people of nicosia .
it will bring further communication with people in order to reduce the gap in the soul and heart of the people . " it will convey the message that leaders are ready to make a step forward to a solution .
i 'm ready , it 's to talat to tell me . " last march , the border post on the southern side of the street was demolished . four decades of peacekeepers the barricades were among the first erected after intercommunal violence flared in the city in 1963 .
at the start of 1964 , un peacekeeping troops arrived on the island and have remained ever since . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : un peacekeepers walk along so-called " green line " separating turkish and greek cypriot communities the two sectors stand only around 50 meters -lrb- yards -rrb- apart at ledra street but it may take several days for the crossing to be opened as the area must be cleared of landmines and the buildings made safe after decades of neglect . cyprus has been divided along ethnic lines since 1974 when turkey seized its northern third in response to an short-lived , athens-engineered greek cypriot coup in nicosia aimed at uniting the island with greece . a un bid to reunite the island failed in 2004 when the greek cypriots voted against the plan in a referendum , although the turkish cypriots voted overwhelmingly in favor . nicosia municipality said it would need at least five days to complete the works which are expected to be carried out by greek cypriot and turkish cypriot municipalities of nicosia in conjunction with the united nations . dw staff -lrb- jam -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

beijing has also expelled all foreign journalists from the region .
werner pfennig , a political scientist at berlin 's free university , is pessimistic about the prospects of any change happening soon . dw-world.de : why do you think that the protests in tibet and neighboring regions have taken place now ?
werner pfennig : i can only wildly speculate what the motives were of the individuals who actually took part in the protests .
however , march marks the anniversary of the 1959 uprising against the chinese army 's repressive actions .
it was also favorable because the people 's congress was meeting in beijing and tibet 's leading politicians were not in lhasa .
thirdly , the opening of olympic games is getting nearer and china is increasingly coming under the media spotlight .
protesters can count upon more media attention at the moment .
can we expect that what has happened will lead to any change in politics in china ?
no , if there is any change , it will be in terms of methods .
the autonomous region tibet is a fixed part of china and there is no possibility of secession from the people 's republic of china .
after the police and military 's " clean-up " operations , i could imagine that beijing 's strategies might change .
they might buy time , hold talks and get the olympics over and done with .
but there wo n't be any real change of direction .
tibet will continue to be regarded as a intrinsic part of the people 's republic .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : there have been demos calling for a boycott of the olympics this summer order has to be restored in tibet and neighboring regions and perhaps that will involve a renewed offer of dialog , but it wo n't happen overnight .
a big hurdle to any dialogue will that the two parties mean something very different when they refer to tibet .
for beijing , it 's the region of tibet with its 2.7 million people .
for exile tibetans , tibet means greater tibet with a population of 6 to 7 million , which includes the areas in neighbouring chinese regions where there are also protests .
does the west have any scope to exercise more influence on china over tibet ?
very little .
it is good that the demonstrations being staged by committed people : ngos , protesters with sympathy for tibet are getting prominent coverage in the media .
however , what 's more important is what 's taking place at the government level .
the polish government has said it will meet the dalai lama .
the german government has called upon the two sides not to use force and to solve the problems in dialog with one another .
i believe that one of the few options open to the west is to make it clear to the chinese government that , in the long term , talks are the only way ahead and that the dalai lama is the appropriate person to talk to .
why is the west 's strategy against china so different than that , for example , wielded against burma ?
burma is not china .
it 's a big economic power that also has many links with other parts of the world .
china is needed in problem regions , north korea , sudan , afghanistan .
there 's a long list .
burma , in contrast , has nothing to offer .
many of the women in the burmese textile industry have lost their jobs as a result , but in burma nothing has changed -lrb- despite some economic sanctions -rrb- .
economic boycotts have very rarely worked in the past because they rely on everyone adhering to them .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the dalai lama has criticized the crackdown but signaled a willingness to talk some have called for a boycott in response to what has happened in tibet .
do you think that there would be any point ?
if there were to be a boycott of the olympic games , for example , that would not lead to any change in the policies of the chinese government .
and , secondly , it must be possible to communicate the sense of a boycott to those who are immediately affected by it .
the chinese people would not understand why they should now be punished because of tibet and why they have made all of the sacrifices for the olympic games for nothing .
i also do n't think it would even be possible .
the olympic games are a huge economic event .
i do not think it would be feasible to impose a boycott against the wishes of huge media concerns and adidas , nike , etc .
do you think the german government could do more ?
i hope that the chinese government should be told as often and as forcefully as possible to sit down and talk with the dalai lama .
he is the best that they can speak to .
the next generation is more impatient and prepared to use violence .
the dalai lama is not aiming for independence , but for wide-reaching autonomy .
if as many people as possible say we know him , he 's trustworthy , find a way of talking to him , then that would be extremely helpful . inverview : julie gregson send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

beijing has also expelled all foreign journalists from the region .
werner pfennig , a political scientist at berlin 's free university , is pessimistic about the prospects of any change happening soon . dw-world.de : why do you think that the protests in tibet and neighboring regions have taken place now ?
werner pfennig : i can only wildly speculate what the motives were of the individuals who actually took part in the protests .
however , march marks the anniversary of the 1959 uprising against the chinese army 's repressive actions .
it was also favorable because the people 's congress was meeting in beijing and tibet 's leading politicians were not in lhasa .
thirdly , the opening of olympic games is getting nearer and china is increasingly coming under the media spotlight .
protesters can count upon more media attention at the moment .
can we expect that what has happened will lead to any change in politics in china ?
no , if there is any change , it will be in terms of methods .
the autonomous region tibet is a fixed part of china and there is no possibility of secession from the people 's republic of china .
after the police and military 's " clean-up " operations , i could imagine that beijing 's strategies might change .
they might buy time , hold talks and get the olympics over and done with .
but there wo n't be any real change of direction .
tibet will continue to be regarded as a intrinsic part of the people 's republic .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : there have been demos calling for a boycott of the olympics this summer order has to be restored in tibet and neighboring regions and perhaps that will involve a renewed offer of dialog , but it wo n't happen overnight .
a big hurdle to any dialogue will that the two parties mean something very different when they refer to tibet .
for beijing , it 's the region of tibet with its 2.7 million people .
for exile tibetans , tibet means greater tibet with a population of 6 to 7 million , which includes the areas in neighbouring chinese regions where there are also protests .
does the west have any scope to exercise more influence on china over tibet ?
very little .
it is good that the demonstrations being staged by committed people : ngos , protesters with sympathy for tibet are getting prominent coverage in the media .
however , what 's more important is what 's taking place at the government level .
the polish government has said it will meet the dalai lama .
the german government has called upon the two sides not to use force and to solve the problems in dialog with one another .
i believe that one of the few options open to the west is to make it clear to the chinese government that , in the long term , talks are the only way ahead and that the dalai lama is the appropriate person to talk to .
why is the west 's strategy against china so different than that , for example , wielded against burma ?
burma is not china .
it 's a big economic power that also has many links with other parts of the world .
china is needed in problem regions , north korea , sudan , afghanistan .
there 's a long list .
burma , in contrast , has nothing to offer .
many of the women in the burmese textile industry have lost their jobs as a result , but in burma nothing has changed -lrb- despite some economic sanctions -rrb- .
economic boycotts have very rarely worked in the past because they rely on everyone adhering to them .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the dalai lama has criticized the crackdown but signaled a willingness to talk some have called for a boycott in response to what has happened in tibet .
do you think that there would be any point ?
if there were to be a boycott of the olympic games , for example , that would not lead to any change in the policies of the chinese government .
and , secondly , it must be possible to communicate the sense of a boycott to those who are immediately affected by it .
the chinese people would not understand why they should now be punished because of tibet and why they have made all of the sacrifices for the olympic games for nothing .
i also do n't think it would even be possible .
the olympic games are a huge economic event .
i do not think it would be feasible to impose a boycott against the wishes of huge media concerns and adidas , nike , etc .
do you think the german government could do more ?
i hope that the chinese government should be told as often and as forcefully as possible to sit down and talk with the dalai lama .
he is the best that they can speak to .
the next generation is more impatient and prepared to use violence .
the dalai lama is not aiming for independence , but for wide-reaching autonomy .
if as many people as possible say we know him , he 's trustworthy , find a way of talking to him , then that would be extremely helpful . inverview : julie gregson send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

beijing has also expelled all foreign journalists from the region .
werner pfennig , a political scientist at berlin 's free university , is pessimistic about the prospects of any change happening soon . dw-world.de : why do you think that the protests in tibet and neighboring regions have taken place now ?
werner pfennig : i can only wildly speculate what the motives were of the individuals who actually took part in the protests .
however , march marks the anniversary of the 1959 uprising against the chinese army 's repressive actions .
it was also favorable because the people 's congress was meeting in beijing and tibet 's leading politicians were not in lhasa .
thirdly , the opening of olympic games is getting nearer and china is increasingly coming under the media spotlight .
protesters can count upon more media attention at the moment .
can we expect that what has happened will lead to any change in politics in china ?
no , if there is any change , it will be in terms of methods .
the autonomous region tibet is a fixed part of china and there is no possibility of secession from the people 's republic of china .
after the police and military 's " clean-up " operations , i could imagine that beijing 's strategies might change .
they might buy time , hold talks and get the olympics over and done with .
but there wo n't be any real change of direction .
tibet will continue to be regarded as a intrinsic part of the people 's republic .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : there have been demos calling for a boycott of the olympics this summer order has to be restored in tibet and neighboring regions and perhaps that will involve a renewed offer of dialog , but it wo n't happen overnight .
a big hurdle to any dialogue will that the two parties mean something very different when they refer to tibet .
for beijing , it 's the region of tibet with its 2.7 million people .
for exile tibetans , tibet means greater tibet with a population of 6 to 7 million , which includes the areas in neighbouring chinese regions where there are also protests .
does the west have any scope to exercise more influence on china over tibet ?
very little .
it is good that the demonstrations being staged by committed people : ngos , protesters with sympathy for tibet are getting prominent coverage in the media .
however , what 's more important is what 's taking place at the government level .
the polish government has said it will meet the dalai lama .
the german government has called upon the two sides not to use force and to solve the problems in dialog with one another .
i believe that one of the few options open to the west is to make it clear to the chinese government that , in the long term , talks are the only way ahead and that the dalai lama is the appropriate person to talk to .
why is the west 's strategy against china so different than that , for example , wielded against burma ?
burma is not china .
it 's a big economic power that also has many links with other parts of the world .
china is needed in problem regions , north korea , sudan , afghanistan .
there 's a long list .
burma , in contrast , has nothing to offer .
many of the women in the burmese textile industry have lost their jobs as a result , but in burma nothing has changed -lrb- despite some economic sanctions -rrb- .
economic boycotts have very rarely worked in the past because they rely on everyone adhering to them .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the dalai lama has criticized the crackdown but signaled a willingness to talk some have called for a boycott in response to what has happened in tibet .
do you think that there would be any point ?
if there were to be a boycott of the olympic games , for example , that would not lead to any change in the policies of the chinese government .
and , secondly , it must be possible to communicate the sense of a boycott to those who are immediately affected by it .
the chinese people would not understand why they should now be punished because of tibet and why they have made all of the sacrifices for the olympic games for nothing .
i also do n't think it would even be possible .
the olympic games are a huge economic event .
i do not think it would be feasible to impose a boycott against the wishes of huge media concerns and adidas , nike , etc .
do you think the german government could do more ?
i hope that the chinese government should be told as often and as forcefully as possible to sit down and talk with the dalai lama .
he is the best that they can speak to .
the next generation is more impatient and prepared to use violence .
the dalai lama is not aiming for independence , but for wide-reaching autonomy .
if as many people as possible say we know him , he 's trustworthy , find a way of talking to him , then that would be extremely helpful . inverview : julie gregson send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

why is the west 's strategy against china so different than that , for example , wielded against burma ?
burma is not china .
it 's a big economic power that also has many links with other parts of the world .
china is needed in problem regions , north korea , sudan , afghanistan .
there 's a long list .
burma , in contrast , has nothing to offer .
many of the women in the burmese textile industry have lost their jobs as a result , but in burma nothing has changed -lrb- despite some economic sanctions -rrb- .
economic boycotts have very rarely worked in the past because they rely on everyone adhering to them .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the dalai lama has criticized the crackdown but signaled a willingness to talk some have called for a boycott in response to what has happened in tibet .
do you think that there would be any point ?
if there were to be a boycott of the olympic games , for example , that would not lead to any change in the policies of the chinese government .
and , secondly , it must be possible to communicate the sense of a boycott to those who are immediately affected by it .
the chinese people would not understand why they should now be punished because of tibet and why they have made all of the sacrifices for the olympic games for nothing .
i also do n't think it would even be possible .
the olympic games are a huge economic event .
i do not think it would be feasible to impose a boycott against the wishes of huge media concerns and adidas , nike , etc .
do you think the german government could do more ?
i hope that the chinese government should be told as often and as forcefully as possible to sit down and talk with the dalai lama .
he is the best that they can speak to .
the next generation is more impatient and prepared to use violence .
the dalai lama is not aiming for independence , but for wide-reaching autonomy .
if as many people as possible say we know him , he 's trustworthy , find a way of talking to him , then that would be extremely helpful . inverview : julie gregson send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

they are also voting in two referendums on membership of the united nations .
the bbc looks at the main issues .
what is the current situation ?
the nationalist party , or kuomintang , dominated taiwanese politics for more than 50 years .
but independence-leaning chen shui-bian of the democratic progressive party ended the kmt 's monopoly on power when he won elections in march 2000 .
during his time in office , he reinforced taiwan 's separate identity from china , angering the authorities in beijing .
but over his eight years in power , voters have become increasingly concerned about economic issues and have tired of the corruption scandals that have dogged mr chen and his aides .
the dpp suffered a crushing defeat in legislative elections in january , leaving the kmt in a strong position to regain power .
who is standing ?
mr chen has served two terms in office and must step down .
so the dpp candidate is frank hsieh , a former lawyer with strong democratic credentials , who has served as taiwanese premier in the past .
he is very popular in southern taiwan , where as mayor he revitalised the city of kaohsiung .
he faces a tough battle against kmt candidate ma ying-jeou , a harvard-educated lawyer who has risen rapidly through the party ranks .
telegenic and charming , mr ma ousted the current president as taipei mayor in 1998 .
what are the main issues for voters ?
the last elections , in march 2004 , were dominated by the island 's difficult relationship with china .
but this time it is economic and social issues that are resonating with voters .
inflation is rising , incomes have stagnated and there is a growing gap between rich and poor .
many voters feel that closer ties with china would revitalise the economy , and both mr hsieh and mr ma promise better cross-strait links .
both want to increase direct charter flights between the two sides and relax bilateral investment limits .
but mr ma wants to go further , calling for a " common market " with china that could at some point lead to an eu-style treaty .
so taiwan 's status is off the agenda ?
economic issues have certainly dominated in recent months , but this does not mean that the status issue has gone away .
beijing claims sovereignty over taiwan , and has threatened to use force if it declares independence .
and in the last few days , the violence in tibet has refocused attention on the candidates ' positions on political ties with beijing .
both the candidates have ruled out reunification .
mr ma , whose party traditionally leans more towards china , has said in the past that he favours a conditional peace deal with beijing at an unspecified point in the future .
mr hsieh , while more conciliatory towards beijing than the outspoken president chen , takes a tougher line .
since the protests in tibet , both candidates have upped their nationalist rhetoric .
" if elected , i would not let taiwan become tibetised , " mr ma told a rally days before the polls .
mr hsieh , meanwhile , has accused mr ma of flip-flopping on vital issues of national security .
so far the tibet crisis seems to be favouring mr hsieh 's campaign .
what about the referendums ?
the taiwanese people are also being asked to vote in two referendums , one by each party .
both ask whether the island should join the united nations .
taiwan currently has no seat at the un , having lost it to china in 1971 .
its many subsequent attempts to regain membership have been blocked by china .
the referendums will have no formal effect , even if they pass .
whatever the result , china will continue to block taiwan 's entry to the international body .
but beijing is extremely unhappy that they are taking place at all , perceiving endorsement of either as a move in the direction of formal independence .
approval " would deal a serious blow to cross-strait relations that would harm the fundamental interests of people on both sides " , chinese premier wen jiabao said on 18 march .

but independence-leaning chen shui-bian of the democratic progressive party ended the kmt 's monopoly on power when he won elections in march 2000 .
during his time in office , he reinforced taiwan 's separate identity from china , angering the authorities in beijing .
but over his eight years in power , voters have become increasingly concerned about economic issues and have tired of the corruption scandals that have dogged mr chen and his aides .
the dpp suffered a crushing defeat in legislative elections in january , leaving the kmt in a strong position to regain power .
who is standing ?
mr chen has served two terms in office and must step down .
so the dpp candidate is frank hsieh , a former lawyer with strong democratic credentials , who has served as taiwanese premier in the past .
he is very popular in southern taiwan , where as mayor he revitalised the city of kaohsiung .
he faces a tough battle against kmt candidate ma ying-jeou , a harvard-educated lawyer who has risen rapidly through the party ranks .
telegenic and charming , mr ma ousted the current president as taipei mayor in 1998 .
what are the main issues for voters ?
the last elections , in march 2004 , were dominated by the island 's difficult relationship with china .
but this time it is economic and social issues that are resonating with voters .
inflation is rising , incomes have stagnated and there is a growing gap between rich and poor .
many voters feel that closer ties with china would revitalise the economy , and both mr hsieh and mr ma promise better cross-strait links .
both want to increase direct charter flights between the two sides and relax bilateral investment limits .
but mr ma wants to go further , calling for a " common market " with china that could at some point lead to an eu-style treaty .
so taiwan 's status is off the agenda ?
economic issues have certainly dominated in recent months , but this does not mean that the status issue has gone away .
beijing claims sovereignty over taiwan , and has threatened to use force if it declares independence .
and in the last few days , the violence in tibet has refocused attention on the candidates ' positions on political ties with beijing .
both the candidates have ruled out reunification .
mr ma , whose party traditionally leans more towards china , has said in the past that he favours a conditional peace deal with beijing at an unspecified point in the future .
mr hsieh , while more conciliatory towards beijing than the outspoken president chen , takes a tougher line .
since the protests in tibet , both candidates have upped their nationalist rhetoric .
" if elected , i would not let taiwan become tibetised , " mr ma told a rally days before the polls .
mr hsieh , meanwhile , has accused mr ma of flip-flopping on vital issues of national security .
so far the tibet crisis seems to be favouring mr hsieh 's campaign .
what about the referendums ?
the taiwanese people are also being asked to vote in two referendums , one by each party .
both ask whether the island should join the united nations .
taiwan currently has no seat at the un , having lost it to china in 1971 .
its many subsequent attempts to regain membership have been blocked by china .
the referendums will have no formal effect , even if they pass .
whatever the result , china will continue to block taiwan 's entry to the international body .
but beijing is extremely unhappy that they are taking place at all , perceiving endorsement of either as a move in the direction of formal independence .
approval " would deal a serious blow to cross-strait relations that would harm the fundamental interests of people on both sides " , chinese premier wen jiabao said on 18 march .

in one town in gansu , a bbc journalist saw rows of armed soldiers and heard broadcasts telling people to surrender .
on thursday , china admitted for the first time that troops had shot and injured protesters during the unrest .
a senior us lawmaker , nancy pelosi , has called on the international community to denounce china 's rule in tibet .
ms pelosi is holding talks in northern india with the dalai lama , who chinese authorities accuse of inciting the violence .
as speaker of the us house of representatives , ms pelosi is outranked only by the president and the vice-president .
her visit to dharamsala was planned before the anti-china protests began .
" if freedom-loving people throughout the world do not speak out against china and the chinese in tibet , we have lost all moral authority to speak out on human rights , " ms pelosi told a crowd of thousands of cheering tibetans , including monks and schoolchildren .
rifles and bayonets anti-china protests began on 10 march in lhasa and gradually escalated , spreading to tibetan communities in neighbouring gansu , sichuan and qinghai provinces .
tibetan protests tibet : protests began in lhasa on 10 march , dozens reported dead over weekend gansu : unrest spread to machu , where tibetan government in exile says 19 died , and near hezuo , where protesters were filmed tearing down chinese flag sichuan : state media says four people ' shot and wounded ' by police in aba qinghai : other unrest reported key events and places tibet 's unsettled borders gansu streets deserted controlled life of monks china says 13 people were killed by rioters in lhasa .
the tibetan government-in-exile says at least 99 people have died in a crackdown by chinese troops .
china is not allowing foreign journalists into tibet .
troops have also sealed off towns in the surrounding areas where unrest has taken place , witnesses say .
but the bbc 's james reynolds spent 24 hours in hezuo in gansu , where earlier this week tibetan protesters tore down the chinese flag .
chinese security forces had overwhelmed the town and the streets were full of police cars , check points and military trucks .
on the southern entrance to hezuo there were rows of soldiers carrying ak47 rifles and bayonets , our correspondent said .
public notices and police broadcasts told protesters to surrender by midnight on 25 march or face arrest and punishment .
other witnesses have reported seeing hundreds of troop carriers heading for tibetan areas in recent days .
protesters shot on thursday chinese authorities admitted that members of the security forces had fired on tibetan protesters .
police wounded four protesters " in self-defence " last sunday in aba county , a tibetan area of sichuan province , xinhua news agency said .
an earlier xinhua report said police had shot the four dead , but it was quickly changed .
xinhua did not provide further details of the incident , but tibetan activists say at least eight people were killed at a demonstration against chinese rule near the kirti monastery in aba on sunday .
earlier this week , the tibetan centre for human rights and democracy circulated photos of bodies with apparent gunshot wounds , which it said were the result of police firing indiscriminately at protesters .
on thursday , us secretary of state condoleezza rice held telephone talks with her chinese counterpart , yang jiechi , in which she urged beijing to show restraint .
but mr yang told her that the protesters were trying to sabotage both the olympics and social stability - and reiterated china 's position that it blamed the dalai lama for the violence .
the dalai lama - who in 1989 won the nobel peace price for his commitment to non-violence in the quest for tibetan self-rule - has called for talks with chinese president hu jintao .

frank hsieh , of the ruling democratic progressive party , faces a tough battle against ma ying-jeou of the kuomintang .
both men advocate closer economic ties with china , but after the protests both have spoken out against beijing .
mr ma mooted an olympic boycott while mr hsieh warned that his rival could make taiwan a " second tibet " .
mr ma , whose party has traditionally taken a more conciliatory line towards beijing , has led consistently in taiwanese media opinion polls .
taiwanese share their views on the presidential race in pictures but analysts believe mr hsieh may have narrowed the gap by accusing his rival of being soft on china and portraying himself as the man best placed to defend taiwan 's interests .
china says that taiwan is part of its territory , although the two have been separately governed since 1949 .
it has threatened to use force if the island moves towards formal independence .
' resume dialogue ' before the protests in tibet began , election campaigning had focused primarily on economic issues .
many taiwanese think closer links with beijing would help revive the island 's faltering economy - but ties have been strained under president chen shui-bian because of his pro-independence stance .
profile : frank hsieh profile : ma ying-jeou q & a : taiwan elections speaking at a press conference in the taiwanese capital , taipei , mr hsieh promised talks with china if elected .
" i will resume dialogue , including with china , " he said .
" i will open up , and i will also defend taiwan 's sovereignty . "
" in the past the dpp was criticised for not opening up but i will be more compromising , i will do better .
that 's my pledge , " he said .
mr ma , who has called for the creation of a " common market " with china , said he " would adopt a flexible manner " to improve cross-strait ties .
earlier this week he talked of a possible olympic boycott if the situation in tibet deteriorated , but on friday he said he would not " push the issue to the extreme " .
the bbc 's caroline gluck , in taipei , says it is not clear what impact events in tibet will have on the electorate .
most have already made up their minds , our correspondent says , but the issue could sway the undecided voters .
polling begins at 0800 on saturday -lrb- 0000gmt -rrb- .

frank hsieh , of the ruling democratic progressive party , faces a tough battle against ma ying-jeou of the kuomintang .
both men advocate closer economic ties with china , but after the protests both have spoken out against beijing .
mr ma mooted an olympic boycott while mr hsieh warned that his rival could make taiwan a " second tibet " .
mr ma , whose party has traditionally taken a more conciliatory line towards beijing , has led consistently in taiwanese media opinion polls .
taiwanese share their views on the presidential race in pictures but analysts believe mr hsieh may have narrowed the gap by accusing his rival of being soft on china and portraying himself as the man best placed to defend taiwan 's interests .
china says that taiwan is part of its territory , although the two have been separately governed since 1949 .
it has threatened to use force if the island moves towards formal independence .
' resume dialogue ' before the protests in tibet began , election campaigning had focused primarily on economic issues .
many taiwanese think closer links with beijing would help revive the island 's faltering economy - but ties have been strained under president chen shui-bian because of his pro-independence stance .

" i will open up , and i will also defend taiwan 's sovereignty . "
" in the past the dpp was criticised for not opening up but i will be more compromising , i will do better .
that 's my pledge , " he said .
mr ma , who has called for the creation of a " common market " with china , said he " would adopt a flexible manner " to improve cross-strait ties .
earlier this week he talked of a possible olympic boycott if the situation in tibet deteriorated , but on friday he said he would not " push the issue to the extreme " .
the bbc 's caroline gluck , in taipei , says it is not clear what impact events in tibet will have on the electorate .

the treatment appears to fool the brain that it is their missing hand being massaged , california researchers say .
new scientist magazine reports that it harnesses nerve cells in the brain which become active when watching someone else carry out an action .
uk experts said this kind of therapy may help amputees , as long as they can go along with the illusion .
the patient has to accept that the illusion is real for it to work kate maciver , pain research institute , liverpool university mirror neurons in the brain fire up when a person performs an intentional action , such as waving , and also when they observe someone else performing the same action .
they are thought to help predict the intentions of others by simulating the action in the mind .
similar cells exist for touch , and become active both when a person is being touched and when they watch someone else being touched .
researchers at the university of california , san diego , say the reason people do not constantly feel what they observe happening to others is that a person 's sensory cells do not give the right signals , so they know it is not happening to them .
ex-soldiers tested in the study , vilayanur ramachandran tested the therapy on ex-soldiers .
his first test used a device called a mirror box , which he developed .
an amputee puts their remaining limb , in this case their hand , in front of the mirror and their brain is tricked into thinking the mirror image is actually another working limb .
two amputees had their normal hand touched while using the mirror box , and felt the sensation of being touched on their missing hand .
in a second experiment , when amputees watched a volunteer 's hand being stroked , they also began to experience a stroking sensation arising from their missing limb .
one even said their pain disappeared for between 10 and 15 minutes .
potential uses dr ramachandran suggested the amputees " felt " the actions of others because their missing limb provided no feedback to prevent their mirror neurons being stimulated , and therefore not telling them they were not " literally " being touched .
he said : " if an amputee experiences pain in their missing limb , they could watch a friend or partner rub their hand to get rid of it . "
but dr ramachandran said there could be other uses for the therapy , including helping people who have had strokes .
" if performed early enough , it may also be used to help stroke patients regain movements by watching others perform their lost actions . "
kate mciver , of the pain research institute at liverpool university , said work done there on helping amputees create mental images of pain-free limbs - which operated on the same basic principle as the us research - had also proved effective .
she said watching massage could help , but added : " with something external like this , the patient has to accept that the illusion is real for it to work . "
