an archive storing files on those persecuted and killed by the nazis officially opened in the german town of bad arolsen on wednesday , april 30 . the card index , which contains about 47 million documents containing the names of most concentration camp inmates , forced-labour victims and refugees left homeless after world war ii , had been the subject of an intense debate .
jewish groups had been pressing for open access to the collection , a storehouse of captured documents that began being assembled in 1946 . " most of the documents were drawn up by the nazis themselves , " said reto meister , the swiss red cross official now in charge of the files .
" we have documents here about a horrifyingly wide range of victims : jews and christians , eastern and western europeans , germans and non-germans , men and women .
there 's not one country where victims did not come from . " opening the archive bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the archive contains index cards on nazi victims .
previously , viewing the archive was limited only to survivors and close relations of the dead .
all of that changed last year , when the members of the 11-nation governing commission of the international tracing service of the international committee of the red cross agreed to provide greater access to the archives , ending a five-decade long debate over the victims ' rights to privacy . earlier this year , the archive opened to historians .
wednesday 's opening allows nearly anyone to search inside the archives , an especially important event for those friends and family members still searching for those unaccounted for after the war . meister also sees the files as the most potent answer to holocaust deniers : " anyone who wants to minimize the holocaust should come here .
we 'll show him documents by the million . " the " overwhelming scale " of the card index , meister said , was more persuasive than any debate . creating a digital archive in three capitals bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : yad vashem in jerusalem has received digital archives .
the its has also made digital copies of much of the archives and exported them to yad vashem memorial in jerusalem , the us holocaust memorial museum in washington and the national institute of remembrance in warsaw .
the images include both sides of 9 million incarceration documents , 21 million cards from its main name index and 3.5 million papers in its displaced persons index . another block of documents relating to forced labour will follow in the summer , bringing scanning to 70 percent of the paper documents .
the entire archival holdings are expected to be digitized by 2011 so that it can be mirrored in all three capitals . dw staff -lrb- cat -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de opinion -pipe- 30.04.2008 opinion : by bending principles , eu cracks open door for serbia großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : with parliamentary elections looming in serbia , the eu has done its best to pave the way for the country to enter eu accession talks – and rightly so , says dw ’ s bernd riegert . the goal is clear : serbia must be integrated in the european union , or else there is little chance for long-term stability in the balkans .
in order to reach this goal , the eu members are prepared to make vast concessions to the serbian government in its election .
apparently they will bend - not to mention stretch , pull and pummel - their principles till it hurts .
eu still waiting for war criminals the eu is loosening its until-now strict stance on serbia - despite the fact that it has long suspected that the serbian government could have delivered its remaining suspected war criminals to the international tribunal for the former yugoslavia , although it failed to do so .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : in luxemburg on april 29 , the eu signed the stabilisation and association agreement with serbia even though it did not fulfil the condition of complete cooperation with the tribunal - a condition that had been clear for months .
now , there appears to be no turning back on the path toward serbia 's eu membership .
after the eu stepped in for kosovo 's independence and made some demands on serbia , it is now time to meet serbia partway .
the pro-european camp in serbia shows a great deal of success and is getting desperately needed election help before voting takes place on may 11 .
it is good that the eu got up the courage to demonstrably strengthen pro-european powers in belgrade .
no good alternatives for europe there was also no especially good alternative : if the nationalistic parties win in serbia on may 11 , things will be looking grim for serbia and the western balkans .
nonetheless , at the urging of the netherlands , the eu left a backdoor open .
the netherlands , traumatized by the 1995 massacre of srebrinica in the bosnian war , which their blue-helmet soldiers failed to prevent , insists strongly upon prosecuting war criminals .
the dutch insisted that the stabilisation and association agreement only be applied when the eu council of ministers determines that serbia is fully cooperating with the tribunal .
luxemburg accord " no empty shell " serbia 's pro-european foreign minister immediately denied that this clause makes the agreement into an “ empty shell . ”
the important thing for the pro-european parties is the strong wind at their backs coming from the direction of luxemburg , he says .
the election on may 11 will be a kind of popular referendum on serbian closeness to europe versus serbian isolation .
with the stabilisation and association agreement , the european union has offered everything it has to offer .
the alternatives are clear .
now it is up to the serbs to decide .

in order to reach this goal , the eu members are prepared to make vast concessions to the serbian government in its election .
apparently they will bend - not to mention stretch , pull and pummel - their principles till it hurts .
eu still waiting for war criminals the eu is loosening its until-now strict stance on serbia - despite the fact that it has long suspected that the serbian government could have delivered its remaining suspected war criminals to the international tribunal for the former yugoslavia , although it failed to do so .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : in luxemburg on april 29 , the eu signed the stabilisation and association agreement with serbia even though it did not fulfil the condition of complete cooperation with the tribunal - a condition that had been clear for months .
now , there appears to be no turning back on the path toward serbia 's eu membership .
after the eu stepped in for kosovo 's independence and made some demands on serbia , it is now time to meet serbia partway .
the pro-european camp in serbia shows a great deal of success and is getting desperately needed election help before voting takes place on may 11 .
it is good that the eu got up the courage to demonstrably strengthen pro-european powers in belgrade .
no good alternatives for europe there was also no especially good alternative : if the nationalistic parties win in serbia on may 11 , things will be looking grim for serbia and the western balkans .
nonetheless , at the urging of the netherlands , the eu left a backdoor open .
the netherlands , traumatized by the 1995 massacre of srebrinica in the bosnian war , which their blue-helmet soldiers failed to prevent , insists strongly upon prosecuting war criminals .
the dutch insisted that the stabilisation and association agreement only be applied when the eu council of ministers determines that serbia is fully cooperating with the tribunal .
luxemburg accord " no empty shell " serbia 's pro-european foreign minister immediately denied that this clause makes the agreement into an “ empty shell . ”
the important thing for the pro-european parties is the strong wind at their backs coming from the direction of luxemburg , he says .
the election on may 11 will be a kind of popular referendum on serbian closeness to europe versus serbian isolation .
with the stabilisation and association agreement , the european union has offered everything it has to offer .
the alternatives are clear .
now it is up to the serbs to decide .

an archive storing files on those persecuted and killed by the nazis officially opened in the german town of bad arolsen on wednesday , april 30 . the card index , which contains about 47 million documents containing the names of most concentration camp inmates , forced-labour victims and refugees left homeless after world war ii , had been the subject of an intense debate .

wednesday 's opening allows nearly anyone to search inside the archives , an especially important event for those friends and family members still searching for those unaccounted for after the war . meister also sees the files as the most potent answer to holocaust deniers : " anyone who wants to minimize the holocaust should come here .

an archive storing files on those persecuted and killed by the nazis officially opened in the german town of bad arolsen on wednesday , april 30 . the card index , which contains about 47 million documents containing the names of most concentration camp inmates , forced-labour victims and refugees left homeless after world war ii , had been the subject of an intense debate .
jewish groups had been pressing for open access to the collection , a storehouse of captured documents that began being assembled in 1946 . " most of the documents were drawn up by the nazis themselves , " said reto meister , the swiss red cross official now in charge of the files .
" we have documents here about a horrifyingly wide range of victims : jews and christians , eastern and western europeans , germans and non-germans , men and women .
there 's not one country where victims did not come from . " opening the archive bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the archive contains index cards on nazi victims .
previously , viewing the archive was limited only to survivors and close relations of the dead .

wednesday 's opening allows nearly anyone to search inside the archives , an especially important event for those friends and family members still searching for those unaccounted for after the war . meister also sees the files as the most potent answer to holocaust deniers : " anyone who wants to minimize the holocaust should come here .
we 'll show him documents by the million .

the move stoked tensions with the former soviet republic and drew criticism from the eu . an undefined number of russian soldiers were sent to the caucasus territories on tuesday after moscow accused georgia of massing troops on the border to abkhazia and acquiring a large number of offensive weapons .

no , thanks " and " serbia - russia " serbian caretaker prime minister vojislav kostunica on wednesday , april 30 , dismissed the stabilization and association agreement with the european union as a " false document " which legalizes the secession of kosovo . " those who signed the tabilization and association agreement -lsb- saa -rsb- are fully responsible for it and they signed it in their own names and never in the name of serbia , " kostunica said in an interview with the daily vecernje novosti .
serbian president boris tadic and deputy prime minister bozidar djelic signed the saa , which legalizes the secession of serbia 's province of kosovo and is a precursor to eu membership talks , with the european union on tuesday , a move denounced by serbian nationalists as treason .
the nationalist majority in serbia heaped insults on the saa with the european union , calling its signing " lies and deceit , " " treason , " and " legally null and void . "
kostunica 's democratic party of serbia -lsb- dss -rsb- has said it will take legal action against the pro-europe bloc for signing the saa , while the ultra-nationalist opposition serbian radical party -lsb- srs -rsb- has said it will launch a case to remove tadic from office .
" without an saa there can be no possibility for a full integration of the western balkans into the european union , and without such integration there is no possibility for a final reconciliation amongst the people of the western balkans , " tadic said .
observers hope that the saa will boost the chances of the pro- european bloc , led by tadic , in snap parliamentary elections on may 11 .
rising nationalists challenge pro-europe parties bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : kostunica 's dss party and the radical party oppose the eu the latest surveys published wednesday showed that the anti- european bloc , led by the increasingly nationalist kostunica and ultra-nationalist opposition radical party , could win more seats in parliament than the pro-european parties .
the medium gallup and blic daily poll showed that the nationalists would win 137 seats out of 250 if elections were held right now , while the pro-european bloc would win 113 seats .
if kostunica forms a government with the radicals , that would cement serbia 's turn away from the eu towards russia .
the alternative would be for kostunica to form a coalition with tadic , as he did last year .
observers say that , either way , the process of forming a government will be long and very difficult followed by months of negotiations , political trading and blackmail .

the youngest european state was recognized by most eu member states and major western powers .
serbia , backed by its ally russia , opposes it .
the saa is a document setting out how an aspiring eu member should reform its political , economic and legal systems to come in line with eu norms , and how the eu should help it do so .
as its name suggests , it is designed to bring basic stability and prosperity to a region devastated by the conflict that erupted after the implosion of the former yugoslavia .
the ratification of serbia 's saa was made conditional on belgrade proving that it was cooperating fully with the international criminal tribunal for the former yugoslavia . dw staff / dpa -lrb- nda -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

meanwhile , investigators are looking into suspicions that fritzl may have had help in caring for and keeping secret the presence of a family living hidden in his basement . report claims son had cellar key a report by the women ’ s magazine brigitte has uncovered a claim that fritzl ’ s son and elisabeth ’ s brother , thomas , had a key to the cellar .
a couple who rented an upstairs room in the house , in the austrian town of amstetten , said that thomas called himself the house “ superintendent ” and made regular trips to the cellar to get things for minor repairs . the couple said they themselves were not allowed near the cellar , and were not allowed to rent a cellar storage room , although that his common practice in austria . police are also taking into account the fact that fritzl had made several trips to thailand , and are looking into how the captive family may have gotten food and other goods while he was away . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : investigators uncovered tiny hideaway authorities have also raised the question of who may have helped the man build a cellar that includes a 300 kilogram steel and cement door .

she seized the chance to speak privately to a doctor and explain her situation .
fritzl was arrested the same day . fritzl ’ s admission that he burned the body of the dead seventh child could prove pivotal when the case comes to trial , with a prosecutor saying he would face a life sentence if found guilty of manslaughter , as opposed to shorter prison terms for rape or incarceration . psychologist paulus hochgatterer , who is helping advise those counselling the family , told afp news service that the three children fritzl had kept underground are staying in a sequestered treatment container that could be locked from the inside . slow road to recovery ? safely shielded from the media circus that has set up camp in amstetten , he said their initial treatment could take several weeks .

one child had died . " astonishing " reunion austrian authorities said on tuesday , april 29 that members of the family terrorized by decades of incest and imprisonment had an “ astonishing ” reunion at a clinic , where psychiatrists are helping them cope . hospital officials said most of the seven children fritzl fathered over the past 24 years with the daughter he held captive in a windowless cell spent their first moments together sunday , april 27 - a day after those kept confined finally gained their freedom . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the case is a challenge for the mostviertel mental clinic clinic director berthold kepplinger told reporters tuesday the meeting also reunited the suspect 's wife with the daughter fritzl had led her to believe left home to join a religious cult , but instead was imprisoned in a cramped warren of secured and soundproofed cellar rooms . fritzl was remanded to court custody on tuesday .
meanwhile , investigators are looking into suspicions that fritzl may have had help in caring for and keeping secret the presence of a family living hidden in his basement . report claims son had cellar key a report by the women ’ s magazine brigitte has uncovered a claim that fritzl ’ s son and elisabeth ’ s brother , thomas , had a key to the cellar .
a couple who rented an upstairs room in the house , in the austrian town of amstetten , said that thomas called himself the house “ superintendent ” and made regular trips to the cellar to get things for minor repairs . the couple said they themselves were not allowed near the cellar , and were not allowed to rent a cellar storage room , although that his common practice in austria . police are also taking into account the fact that fritzl had made several trips to thailand , and are looking into how the captive family may have gotten food and other goods while he was away . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : investigators uncovered tiny hideaway authorities have also raised the question of who may have helped the man build a cellar that includes a 300 kilogram steel and cement door .
fritzl was given permission to build the cellar as a bomb shelter in the late 1970s . since the case came to light , fritzl ’ s 42 year old daughter , elisabeth , and her children have been carefully shielded from public glare , undergoing psychiatric counselling to help them try to adjust after their unimaginable ordeal . cult cover-story for adoptive " grandkids " fritzl had told his wife that their daughter had run away to join a cult .
in reality she was locked underground in the 60 square meter -lrb- 650 square feet -rrb- underground rooms . mother and daughter were reunited this week for the first time in a quarter century . fritzl explained the presence of three of the grandchildren whom he adopted to his wife and to the community by claiming elisabeth had given birth to them at the cult , and then delivered them to his doorstep for the older couple to care for . three other children – aged 19 , 18 and 5 - lived belowground with their mother in the cell .
they first saw daylight when they were rescued . daughter 's illness leads to family 's release one child , a twin , had died shortly after birth .
fritzl has admitted to burning the corpse in the house ’ s boiler . the decision on which children lived aboveground and which below depended on whether they were “ screaming babies ” and on their general halth , explained chief inspector leopold etz from the lower austrian criminal investigators office . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : a bathroom in the shocking home-prison the case came to light because one of the children , 19 year old kerstin , was severely ill .
her “ grandfather ” brought the child to the hospital , which started a search for the child ’ s mother in the hopes of finding out her medical history .
they televised an urgent call elisabeth to come back and save the daughter ’ s life . elisabeth saw the call on television , and was able to convince her father to let her go to the hospital .
she seized the chance to speak privately to a doctor and explain her situation .
fritzl was arrested the same day . fritzl ’ s admission that he burned the body of the dead seventh child could prove pivotal when the case comes to trial , with a prosecutor saying he would face a life sentence if found guilty of manslaughter , as opposed to shorter prison terms for rape or incarceration . psychologist paulus hochgatterer , who is helping advise those counselling the family , told afp news service that the three children fritzl had kept underground are staying in a sequestered treatment container that could be locked from the inside . slow road to recovery ? safely shielded from the media circus that has set up camp in amstetten , he said their initial treatment could take several weeks . " only very gradually are they being exposed to the outside world , " hochgatterer said , adding that " given the circumstances , they 're actually doing quite well . " the two sets of children are now tentatively beginning to get to know one another .
the youngest child , five years old , seems most able to adapt to his new life , his caretakers said . experts said the family is likely to need years of therapy . " it could take between five and eight years , " said max friedrich , the psychiatrist who looked after another sequestration victim , natascha kampusch , in an interview with the daily oesterreich . the head of the local social services , hans-heinz lenze , said a name-change had been suggested for the immediate victims , but fritzl 's other family as well , in order to give them a new start in life . long-term investigation expected " at the moment , all possibilities are being sounded out in closest consultation with the family .

moscow maintains the troops are serving in a peacekeeping mission . " it 's hard to believe that this is being done for the purposes of peacekeeping , it 's rather the beginning of full scale military aggression , " georgian foreign minister david bakradze told the afp news agency on wednesday , 30 april . russia has deployed additional troops to the break-away georgian territories of abkhazia and south ossetia .
the move stoked tensions with the former soviet republic and drew criticism from the eu . an undefined number of russian soldiers were sent to the caucasus territories on tuesday after moscow accused georgia of massing troops on the border to abkhazia and acquiring a large number of offensive weapons . " russia is not preparing for war , but we can cite a number of examples pointing to the fact that the georgian leadership might be pushing for a resolution of the abkhazian and south ossetian secession by force , " said russian foreign minister sergei lavrov . if it does so , " we will be forced to take retaliatory measures to protect the lives of our citizens , " he added . georgia has repeatedly accused russia of attempting to annex the two territories , which have had close ties with moscow since the mid-1990s .
many of the residents hold russian passports and reject georgian control .
russia has said the troops it has stationed in abkhazia are there for peacekeeping purposes . tensions between georgia and russia have heightened lately as tbilisi negotiates with nato over possible future membership , which moscow strongly opposes . georgia appeals to separatist region bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : abkhazian separatists do n't accept georgian rule georgian president mikheil saakashvili called on abkhazia and south ossetia to reject an " outrageous and irresponsible " force that is trying to provoke a conflict . rebel leaders in the two moscow-backed regions , however , immediately rejected saakashvili 's offer of solidarity . " the co-existence of abkhazia and georgia in a unified state is impossible , " said abkhaz leader sergei bagapsh . russian troops have been involved in the region since 1994 .
following separatist wars , the un brokered a peacekeeping agreement that stipulated russia 's presence in the territories , which had established close ties with moscow in the wake of the disintegration of the soviet union . eu calls russia 's move " unwise " the eu was critical of russia 's decision to enlarge its military force .
some 2,000 russian soldiers are already stationed in abkhazia and 1,000 in south ossetia . " it is not wise to increase the number of russian peacekeepers in georgia right now , " said eu foreign policy chief javier solana on tuesday at a joint press conference with russian foreign minister sergei lavrov . " we defend the territorial integrity of georgia , " solana added . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : saakashvili encouraged abkhazia and south ossetia to reject russia 's involvement lavrov declined to indicate how many additional soldiers would be sent to the region , saying it " remains in the limits foreseen . " earlier this month russia lifted a range of economic sanctions that had been in place for two years against georgia , including the complete closure of land , air and sea links . however , tensions have repeatedly flared since , including georgia 's accusation that a russian aircraft shot down an unmanned surveillance drone deployed over abkhazia . dw staff -lrb- kjb -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

other european countries , however , are stepping up the pressure . the european union had hoped a meeting of its foreign ministers in luxembourg would produce a green light for partnership talks with russia .
yet at the end of the meeting , it seemed unlikely that europe would be ready to begin talks at a summit in siberia planned for june .
" it is over for today , " luxembourg 's foreign minister jean asselborn told reporters as the eu foreign ministers ' talks ended on tuesday , april 29 .
" we are a bit blocked . "
lithuania was the main obstacle standing in the way of beginning partnership and cooperation agreement -lrb- pca -rrb- negotiations with russia .
the former soviet republic wanted russian assurances on energy supplies , judicial cooperation and regional security before agreeing to the talks .
the eu will try to push forward the partnership talks , which have been deadlocked for 18 months , at a meeting next week in brussels .
europe would like to have a mandate in place by a planned june summit with russia which will be held in siberia .
siberian summit cutting it close bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : lithuania had promised to block the talks lithuanian officials would not say whether they thought the june timeline remained possible .
" i do n't want to put any timeframe on the talks or the objectives , " lithuanian foreign minister petras vaitiekunas said .
" what is important is ... the quality of the objectives and the quality of the relations with russia . "
vilnius has a tense relationship with moscow .
lithuania objects to russia 's decision to shut-off of a pipeline supplying lithuania 's only oil refinery .
moscow has said a technical problem has led to the halt in energy deliveries .
lithuania is also unhappy about russia 's attitude toward judicial and international cooperation .
the baltic country also wants russia to change its stance on internal border conflicts in georgia and moldova .
russia has supported the territorial claims of breakaway republics in both countries .
europe eager for new energy policy bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the current eu-russia agreement was signed under yeltsin current relations between the eu and russia on issues ranging from energy to education are governed by a pca negotiated with the government of boris yeltsin in 1997 .
europe has found it difficult to negotiate a replacement agreement .
originally , it was poland that blocked talks to protest a russian import ban on polish meat and vegetable products .
the ban has since been lifted and poland agreed to the talks , leaving lithuania the only eu holdout .
any eu country can block negotiations with another country outside the bloc .
" of course , we share lithuania 's worries and the problems they listed , but we also see that it 's better to talk with the russians about all those problems to solve them , " estonian foreign minister urmas paet said .
most other 27 nations which make up the eu want a new agreement with energy-rich russia and have pressured lithuania to agree to the negotiations .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the eu is dependent on russian oil " there are very important interests -lsb- at stake -rsb- , " spanish secretary of state for european affairs diego lopez garrido said before the meeting , citing energy .
" it will be a long negotiation that should start as soon as possible . "
" we do believe that the eu should begin this process of a partnership and cooperation agreement , " added british europe minister jim murphy .

other european countries , however , are stepping up the pressure . the european union had hoped a meeting of its foreign ministers in luxembourg would produce a green light for partnership talks with russia .
yet at the end of the meeting , it seemed unlikely that europe would be ready to begin talks at a summit in siberia planned for june .
" it is over for today , " luxembourg 's foreign minister jean asselborn told reporters as the eu foreign ministers ' talks ended on tuesday , april 29 .
" we are a bit blocked . "
lithuania was the main obstacle standing in the way of beginning partnership and cooperation agreement -lrb- pca -rrb- negotiations with russia .
the former soviet republic wanted russian assurances on energy supplies , judicial cooperation and regional security before agreeing to the talks .
the eu will try to push forward the partnership talks , which have been deadlocked for 18 months , at a meeting next week in brussels .
europe would like to have a mandate in place by a planned june summit with russia which will be held in siberia .
siberian summit cutting it close bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : lithuania had promised to block the talks lithuanian officials would not say whether they thought the june timeline remained possible .
" i do n't want to put any timeframe on the talks or the objectives , " lithuanian foreign minister petras vaitiekunas said .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de in focus : israel turns 60 : the making of a country israel 's history : history of a conflict german jews keep up the culture in israel 's old folks homes german-israeli relations : the normality of abnormality israel remembers victims of holocaust in annual ceremony holocaust -pipe- 30.04.2008 " young germans have a responsibility to learn from history " großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : young germans become " professional grandsons " to elderly jewish survivors the action reconciliation service for peace - a grassroots volunteer group that promotes understanding between germany and israel - is celebrating its 50th anniversary on wednesday . the action reconciliation service for peace -lrb- asf -rrb- was founded by the synod of the evangelical church in germany in 1958 in response to nazi atrocities during world war ii .
since 1961 , action reconciliation has sent thousands of young germans to israel to volunteer in nursing homes , youth centers , hospitals and memorial sites .
the grassroots work of this social action group became the basis of a political rapprochement between germany and israel , when diplomatic relations were established in 1965 .
today , germany is among israel 's most important allies and trading partners in europe . dw-world.de spoke to philipp pohlmann , 25 , who spent a year volunteering in israel .
today , he is a regional spokesman for the group in the cologne area . dw-world.de : how did you wind up joining asf ? philipp pohlmann : in germany , young men are conscripted into military service after they graduate from high school , generally between the ages of 16-20 , but most get out of it nowadays .
some are disqualified because of a minor physical disability , but those who get a clean bill of health , like i did , can opt to do community service instead .
the third possibility is to fulfill the civil service requirement abroad , which is what i chose to do . why did you specifically choose asf ? their focus on germany 's historic responsibility to jews living in israel and all over the world appealed to me .
i wanted personally to meet the last survivors of auschwitz or other camps . it is one thing to learn about the nazi period through textbooks , which is an obligatory part of the german school curriculum , but it 's another to learn about the past in a personal way . so the way the nazi period is taught in schools is too cut and dry ? bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : anne frank 's diary is often not part of the school curriculum .
yes .
everyone learns about the facts - that 6 million european jews perished in the holocaust , for example .
we know the names of all the death camps - auschwitz , treblinka - it 's all very impersonal .
we did n't even read the " diary of anne frank " in school .
i read it on my own . the nazi period is such an important and compelling part of the history of this country , but many teachers never inspire the pupils or stimulate real interest in the subject .
there are many germans and jews who are still alive to talk personally about this period .
why do n't teachers simply invite survivors to speak about their experiences in class ? perhaps teachers are still grappling with how to teach the subject .
is there perhaps a sense of collective guilt or discomfort in dealing with this period ? one thing is clear : anyone who was too young during the war or born after the war can not be guilty of anything , but still , it is very important to know about the history of one 's own country and , with that awareness , to ensure that the genocide does not happen again in the future .
we , young germans , have a responsibility to learn from our past . have you talked about the nationalist socialist period with your own grandparents ? not really .
by the time my interest in this subject was awakened , they were too old or dead .
my paternal grandfather is almost 100 years old now .
he was a clockmaker from silesia -lsb- part of the german reich that became part of poland after the war -rsb- .
as a soldier on the eastern front , he was captured by the russians in 1941 and held prisoner of war until 1949 .
my grandparents had no nazi sympathies , as far as i know , and i have never heard them utter one bad word about the jews . what did you do as a volunteer for asf in tel aviv ? bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : a church official in cologne hands over a cheque to asf 's philipp pohlmann -lrb- 3rd from right -rrb- as part of the program , i spent one year at a home for the elderly , helping them run daily errands or visit doctors .
we talked a lot and played gin rummy .
they even gave me hebrew lessons , so i 've gotten to the point that i am conversationally fluent now . how did these elderly israelis , some of whom were holocaust survivors , react to you as a german ? this project has been ongoing in israel for decades , so they are used to german volunteers .
many of the elderly happen to be german jews , who often revert back to their mother tongue as they get older , so they were delighted to speak german with me .
they were also very interested in what 's happening in germany .
some residents even subscribed to a local weekly paper in the german language .
jacob bar-or , a frankfurt native in his 80s , who was one of the prosecutors in the adolf eichmann case , even kept abreast of news in germany by reading the frankfurter allgemeine zeitung newspaper on a regular basis . i never encountered any hostility in israel .
the survivors themselves have no problem with me being german .
they know that i 'm in my 20s and had nothing to do with the holocaust .
if anyone had a problem , and this was rare , it was younger people , the grandchildren of holocaust victims , who perhaps never got to know their forebears . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : germany is israel 's best friend in europe .
israel 's peres with germany 's merkel -lrb- right -rrb- can relations between german and israel ever be fully normal ? no , but that is not necessarily a bad thing .
because of the holocaust , the relationship will always be a special one . the holocaust made claims to a jewish state a moral necessity , but does that mean that the germans can not be critical of israel ? for germany , there can be no doubt about israel 's right to exist , but that does not mean we can not be critical of israeli policy , in particular when political leaders meet behind closed doors .
still , germany needs to tread carefully with regard to the israeli-palestinian conflict . was the arab-israeli conflict a part of your daily life in jerusalem or tel aviv ? no , even though i was there during two major suicide attacks in tel aviv in 2002 and 2003 .
this needs to be kept in perspective , though . israel is not the most dangerous place in the world , and most tourists would not even be aware of the presence of suicide bombers .
i 'm more afraid of driving at high speed on the german autobahns than living in israel . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : merkel laid a wreath during a march visit to the yad vashem memorial suicide bombers wo n't deter young germans from volunteering for asf , but what about scrapping military conscription and the civil alternative , which has been up for discussion for years now in germany ? it 's not a problem .
only one third of those who apply , get accepted into one of our programs abroad , simply because the funding is not there to provide more than 180 placements a year .
volunteers are mainly young people , but we 've got a sprinkling of older germans , too .
also , more than half of the volunteers are women , who do n't get drafted into military service anyway .
even among the young men , there are volunteers who are not necessarily doing this to fulfill their civic duty . i did this to avoid the bundeswehr and to fulfill my civic requirement , but as i see it now , i wound up gaining a year , not losing one on my career path as a lawyer .
whenever i go on interviews for jobs or internships , my year at asf has been a huge advantage for me .
every recruiter has asked me about the time i spent in israel . interview : diana fong send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de kosovo -pipe- 30.04.2008 serbian nationalists reject signing of eu agreement as treason großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : this nationalist grafitti in belgrade reads : " eu ?
no , thanks " and " serbia - russia " serbian caretaker prime minister vojislav kostunica on wednesday , april 30 , dismissed the stabilization and association agreement with the european union as a " false document " which legalizes the secession of kosovo . " those who signed the tabilization and association agreement -lsb- saa -rsb- are fully responsible for it and they signed it in their own names and never in the name of serbia , " kostunica said in an interview with the daily vecernje novosti .
serbian president boris tadic and deputy prime minister bozidar djelic signed the saa , which legalizes the secession of serbia 's province of kosovo and is a precursor to eu membership talks , with the european union on tuesday , a move denounced by serbian nationalists as treason .
the nationalist majority in serbia heaped insults on the saa with the european union , calling its signing " lies and deceit , " " treason , " and " legally null and void . "
kostunica 's democratic party of serbia -lsb- dss -rsb- has said it will take legal action against the pro-europe bloc for signing the saa , while the ultra-nationalist opposition serbian radical party -lsb- srs -rsb- has said it will launch a case to remove tadic from office .
" without an saa there can be no possibility for a full integration of the western balkans into the european union , and without such integration there is no possibility for a final reconciliation amongst the people of the western balkans , " tadic said .
observers hope that the saa will boost the chances of the pro- european bloc , led by tadic , in snap parliamentary elections on may 11 .
rising nationalists challenge pro-europe parties bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : kostunica 's dss party and the radical party oppose the eu the latest surveys published wednesday showed that the anti- european bloc , led by the increasingly nationalist kostunica and ultra-nationalist opposition radical party , could win more seats in parliament than the pro-european parties .
the medium gallup and blic daily poll showed that the nationalists would win 137 seats out of 250 if elections were held right now , while the pro-european bloc would win 113 seats .
if kostunica forms a government with the radicals , that would cement serbia 's turn away from the eu towards russia .

no , thanks " and " serbia - russia " serbian caretaker prime minister vojislav kostunica on wednesday , april 30 , dismissed the stabilization and association agreement with the european union as a " false document " which legalizes the secession of kosovo . " those who signed the tabilization and association agreement -lsb- saa -rsb- are fully responsible for it and they signed it in their own names and never in the name of serbia , " kostunica said in an interview with the daily vecernje novosti .
serbian president boris tadic and deputy prime minister bozidar djelic signed the saa , which legalizes the secession of serbia 's province of kosovo and is a precursor to eu membership talks , with the european union on tuesday , a move denounced by serbian nationalists as treason .
the nationalist majority in serbia heaped insults on the saa with the european union , calling its signing " lies and deceit , " " treason , " and " legally null and void . "
kostunica 's democratic party of serbia -lsb- dss -rsb- has said it will take legal action against the pro-europe bloc for signing the saa , while the ultra-nationalist opposition serbian radical party -lsb- srs -rsb- has said it will launch a case to remove tadic from office .
" without an saa there can be no possibility for a full integration of the western balkans into the european union , and without such integration there is no possibility for a final reconciliation amongst the people of the western balkans , " tadic said .
observers hope that the saa will boost the chances of the pro- european bloc , led by tadic , in snap parliamentary elections on may 11 .
rising nationalists challenge pro-europe parties bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : kostunica 's dss party and the radical party oppose the eu the latest surveys published wednesday showed that the anti- european bloc , led by the increasingly nationalist kostunica and ultra-nationalist opposition radical party , could win more seats in parliament than the pro-european parties .
the medium gallup and blic daily poll showed that the nationalists would win 137 seats out of 250 if elections were held right now , while the pro-european bloc would win 113 seats .
if kostunica forms a government with the radicals , that would cement serbia 's turn away from the eu towards russia .
the alternative would be for kostunica to form a coalition with tadic , as he did last year .
observers say that , either way , the process of forming a government will be long and very difficult followed by months of negotiations , political trading and blackmail .

one child had died . " astonishing " reunion austrian authorities said on tuesday , april 29 that members of the family terrorized by decades of incest and imprisonment had an “ astonishing ” reunion at a clinic , where psychiatrists are helping them cope . hospital officials said most of the seven children fritzl fathered over the past 24 years with the daughter he held captive in a windowless cell spent their first moments together sunday , april 27 - a day after those kept confined finally gained their freedom . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the case is a challenge for the mostviertel mental clinic clinic director berthold kepplinger told reporters tuesday the meeting also reunited the suspect 's wife with the daughter fritzl had led her to believe left home to join a religious cult , but instead was imprisoned in a cramped warren of secured and soundproofed cellar rooms . fritzl was remanded to court custody on tuesday .
meanwhile , investigators are looking into suspicions that fritzl may have had help in caring for and keeping secret the presence of a family living hidden in his basement . report claims son had cellar key a report by the women ’ s magazine brigitte has uncovered a claim that fritzl ’ s son and elisabeth ’ s brother , thomas , had a key to the cellar .
a couple who rented an upstairs room in the house , in the austrian town of amstetten , said that thomas called himself the house “ superintendent ” and made regular trips to the cellar to get things for minor repairs . the couple said they themselves were not allowed near the cellar , and were not allowed to rent a cellar storage room , although that his common practice in austria . police are also taking into account the fact that fritzl had made several trips to thailand , and are looking into how the captive family may have gotten food and other goods while he was away . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : investigators uncovered tiny hideaway authorities have also raised the question of who may have helped the man build a cellar that includes a 300 kilogram steel and cement door .
fritzl was given permission to build the cellar as a bomb shelter in the late 1970s . since the case came to light , fritzl ’ s 42 year old daughter , elisabeth , and her children have been carefully shielded from public glare , undergoing psychiatric counselling to help them try to adjust after their unimaginable ordeal . cult cover-story for adoptive " grandkids " fritzl had told his wife that their daughter had run away to join a cult .
in reality she was locked underground in the 60 square meter -lrb- 650 square feet -rrb- underground rooms . mother and daughter were reunited this week for the first time in a quarter century . fritzl explained the presence of three of the grandchildren whom he adopted to his wife and to the community by claiming elisabeth had given birth to them at the cult , and then delivered them to his doorstep for the older couple to care for . three other children – aged 19 , 18 and 5 - lived belowground with their mother in the cell .

she seized the chance to speak privately to a doctor and explain her situation .
fritzl was arrested the same day . fritzl ’ s admission that he burned the body of the dead seventh child could prove pivotal when the case comes to trial , with a prosecutor saying he would face a life sentence if found guilty of manslaughter , as opposed to shorter prison terms for rape or incarceration . psychologist paulus hochgatterer , who is helping advise those counselling the family , told afp news service that the three children fritzl had kept underground are staying in a sequestered treatment container that could be locked from the inside . slow road to recovery ? safely shielded from the media circus that has set up camp in amstetten , he said their initial treatment could take several weeks .

moscow maintains the troops are serving in a peacekeeping mission . " it 's hard to believe that this is being done for the purposes of peacekeeping , it 's rather the beginning of full scale military aggression , " georgian foreign minister david bakradze told the afp news agency on wednesday , 30 april . russia has deployed additional troops to the break-away georgian territories of abkhazia and south ossetia .
the move stoked tensions with the former soviet republic and drew criticism from the eu . an undefined number of russian soldiers were sent to the caucasus territories on tuesday after moscow accused georgia of massing troops on the border to abkhazia and acquiring a large number of offensive weapons . " russia is not preparing for war , but we can cite a number of examples pointing to the fact that the georgian leadership might be pushing for a resolution of the abkhazian and south ossetian secession by force , " said russian foreign minister sergei lavrov . if it does so , " we will be forced to take retaliatory measures to protect the lives of our citizens , " he added . georgia has repeatedly accused russia of attempting to annex the two territories , which have had close ties with moscow since the mid-1990s .
many of the residents hold russian passports and reject georgian control .
russia has said the troops it has stationed in abkhazia are there for peacekeeping purposes . tensions between georgia and russia have heightened lately as tbilisi negotiates with nato over possible future membership , which moscow strongly opposes . georgia appeals to separatist region bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : abkhazian separatists do n't accept georgian rule georgian president mikheil saakashvili called on abkhazia and south ossetia to reject an " outrageous and irresponsible " force that is trying to provoke a conflict . rebel leaders in the two moscow-backed regions , however , immediately rejected saakashvili 's offer of solidarity . " the co-existence of abkhazia and georgia in a unified state is impossible , " said abkhaz leader sergei bagapsh . russian troops have been involved in the region since 1994 .
following separatist wars , the un brokered a peacekeeping agreement that stipulated russia 's presence in the territories , which had established close ties with moscow in the wake of the disintegration of the soviet union . eu calls russia 's move " unwise " the eu was critical of russia 's decision to enlarge its military force .
some 2,000 russian soldiers are already stationed in abkhazia and 1,000 in south ossetia . " it is not wise to increase the number of russian peacekeepers in georgia right now , " said eu foreign policy chief javier solana on tuesday at a joint press conference with russian foreign minister sergei lavrov . " we defend the territorial integrity of georgia , " solana added . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : saakashvili encouraged abkhazia and south ossetia to reject russia 's involvement lavrov declined to indicate how many additional soldiers would be sent to the region , saying it " remains in the limits foreseen . " earlier this month russia lifted a range of economic sanctions that had been in place for two years against georgia , including the complete closure of land , air and sea links . however , tensions have repeatedly flared since , including georgia 's accusation that a russian aircraft shot down an unmanned surveillance drone deployed over abkhazia . dw staff -lrb- kjb -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

one child had died . " astonishing " reunion austrian authorities said on tuesday , april 29 that members of the family terrorized by decades of incest and imprisonment had an “ astonishing ” reunion at a clinic , where psychiatrists are helping them cope . hospital officials said most of the seven children fritzl fathered over the past 24 years with the daughter he held captive in a windowless cell spent their first moments together sunday , april 27 - a day after those kept confined finally gained their freedom . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the case is a challenge for the mostviertel mental clinic clinic director berthold kepplinger told reporters tuesday the meeting also reunited the suspect 's wife with the daughter fritzl had led her to believe left home to join a religious cult , but instead was imprisoned in a cramped warren of secured and soundproofed cellar rooms . fritzl was remanded to court custody on tuesday .
meanwhile , investigators are looking into suspicions that fritzl may have had help in caring for and keeping secret the presence of a family living hidden in his basement . report claims son had cellar key a report by the women ’ s magazine brigitte has uncovered a claim that fritzl ’ s son and elisabeth ’ s brother , thomas , had a key to the cellar .
a couple who rented an upstairs room in the house , in the austrian town of amstetten , said that thomas called himself the house “ superintendent ” and made regular trips to the cellar to get things for minor repairs . the couple said they themselves were not allowed near the cellar , and were not allowed to rent a cellar storage room , although that his common practice in austria . police are also taking into account the fact that fritzl had made several trips to thailand , and are looking into how the captive family may have gotten food and other goods while he was away . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : investigators uncovered tiny hideaway authorities have also raised the question of who may have helped the man build a cellar that includes a 300 kilogram steel and cement door .
fritzl was given permission to build the cellar as a bomb shelter in the late 1970s . since the case came to light , fritzl ’ s 42 year old daughter , elisabeth , and her children have been carefully shielded from public glare , undergoing psychiatric counselling to help them try to adjust after their unimaginable ordeal . cult cover-story for adoptive " grandkids " fritzl had told his wife that their daughter had run away to join a cult .
in reality she was locked underground in the 60 square meter -lrb- 650 square feet -rrb- underground rooms . mother and daughter were reunited this week for the first time in a quarter century . fritzl explained the presence of three of the grandchildren whom he adopted to his wife and to the community by claiming elisabeth had given birth to them at the cult , and then delivered them to his doorstep for the older couple to care for . three other children – aged 19 , 18 and 5 - lived belowground with their mother in the cell .
they first saw daylight when they were rescued . daughter 's illness leads to family 's release one child , a twin , had died shortly after birth .
fritzl has admitted to burning the corpse in the house ’ s boiler . the decision on which children lived aboveground and which below depended on whether they were “ screaming babies ” and on their general halth , explained chief inspector leopold etz from the lower austrian criminal investigators office . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : a bathroom in the shocking home-prison the case came to light because one of the children , 19 year old kerstin , was severely ill .
her “ grandfather ” brought the child to the hospital , which started a search for the child ’ s mother in the hopes of finding out her medical history .
they televised an urgent call elisabeth to come back and save the daughter ’ s life . elisabeth saw the call on television , and was able to convince her father to let her go to the hospital .
she seized the chance to speak privately to a doctor and explain her situation .
fritzl was arrested the same day . fritzl ’ s admission that he burned the body of the dead seventh child could prove pivotal when the case comes to trial , with a prosecutor saying he would face a life sentence if found guilty of manslaughter , as opposed to shorter prison terms for rape or incarceration . psychologist paulus hochgatterer , who is helping advise those counselling the family , told afp news service that the three children fritzl had kept underground are staying in a sequestered treatment container that could be locked from the inside . slow road to recovery ? safely shielded from the media circus that has set up camp in amstetten , he said their initial treatment could take several weeks . " only very gradually are they being exposed to the outside world , " hochgatterer said , adding that " given the circumstances , they 're actually doing quite well . " the two sets of children are now tentatively beginning to get to know one another .
the youngest child , five years old , seems most able to adapt to his new life , his caretakers said . experts said the family is likely to need years of therapy . " it could take between five and eight years , " said max friedrich , the psychiatrist who looked after another sequestration victim , natascha kampusch , in an interview with the daily oesterreich . the head of the local social services , hans-heinz lenze , said a name-change had been suggested for the immediate victims , but fritzl 's other family as well , in order to give them a new start in life . long-term investigation expected " at the moment , all possibilities are being sounded out in closest consultation with the family .
but a decision will only be reached in the coming weeks , " lenze told a news conference on tuesday . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : can officials look to the kampusch case for help ?
chief investigator franz polzer told austrian television that police might need " half a year " to complete their investigations .
he ruled out any suggestion fritzl might have had an accomplice . " as our investigations now stand , there were no accomplices .
but you can never be 100 percent certain . " doctors would determine when police would be allowed to question elisabeth fritzl and the children , but that was unlikely to be for several days . fritzl had officially adopted the three aboveground children , after showing authorities letters signed by elizabeth that said she could not care for them , and which asked that they try not to track her down for the sake of herself and her children . fritzl was allowed to adopt despite a reported conviction of attempted rape in the 1960s and of arson , but the records were wiped after a period of time set by austrian law . the district court in amstetten , which had greenlighted the adoptions , said it had followed protocol in the adoption proceedings and had had acted correctly . no sign of wife 's complicity " there were n't any doubts about his -lrb- fritzl 's -rrb- integrity .
why should i put the child in a foster home , when it could grow up in a family , " court president josef schoegl told the austria press agency . chief police investigator franz polzer said there was no sign that fritzl 's wife , who also had seven children with him , knew of the goings on in his locked dungeon . in the town of amstetten , more than 200 people including dozens of youngsters quietly held a candlelight vigil in the main square late tuesday , as the town of 23,000 sought to cast off the notoriety brought to their doorstep by fritzl . shocked residents react " shock , sadness , rage and perhaps also hatred have gripped us these last few days , " pastor peter boesendorfer told those gathered . " we must acknowledge that there is something in our town that we can not comprehend , " he said , calling on residents " to help and show solidarity so that a life will be possible " for the bewildered children and their scarred mother . amstetten mayor herbert katzengruber told the austrian news agency apa : " we want to show that amstetten is not a town for criminals .
but it 's mostly about showing solidarity and help to the victims .

since 1961 , action reconciliation has sent thousands of young germans to israel to volunteer in nursing homes , youth centers , hospitals and memorial sites .
the grassroots work of this social action group became the basis of a political rapprochement between germany and israel , when diplomatic relations were established in 1965 .
today , germany is among israel 's most important allies and trading partners in europe . dw-world.de spoke to philipp pohlmann , 25 , who spent a year volunteering in israel .
today , he is a regional spokesman for the group in the cologne area . dw-world.de : how did you wind up joining asf ? philipp pohlmann : in germany , young men are conscripted into military service after they graduate from high school , generally between the ages of 16-20 , but most get out of it nowadays .
some are disqualified because of a minor physical disability , but those who get a clean bill of health , like i did , can opt to do community service instead .
the third possibility is to fulfill the civil service requirement abroad , which is what i chose to do . why did you specifically choose asf ? their focus on germany 's historic responsibility to jews living in israel and all over the world appealed to me .
i wanted personally to meet the last survivors of auschwitz or other camps . it is one thing to learn about the nazi period through textbooks , which is an obligatory part of the german school curriculum , but it 's another to learn about the past in a personal way . so the way the nazi period is taught in schools is too cut and dry ? bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : anne frank 's diary is often not part of the school curriculum .
yes .
everyone learns about the facts - that 6 million european jews perished in the holocaust , for example .
we know the names of all the death camps - auschwitz , treblinka - it 's all very impersonal .
we did n't even read the " diary of anne frank " in school .
i read it on my own . the nazi period is such an important and compelling part of the history of this country , but many teachers never inspire the pupils or stimulate real interest in the subject .
there are many germans and jews who are still alive to talk personally about this period .
why do n't teachers simply invite survivors to speak about their experiences in class ? perhaps teachers are still grappling with how to teach the subject .
is there perhaps a sense of collective guilt or discomfort in dealing with this period ? one thing is clear : anyone who was too young during the war or born after the war can not be guilty of anything , but still , it is very important to know about the history of one 's own country and , with that awareness , to ensure that the genocide does not happen again in the future .
we , young germans , have a responsibility to learn from our past . have you talked about the nationalist socialist period with your own grandparents ? not really .
by the time my interest in this subject was awakened , they were too old or dead .
my paternal grandfather is almost 100 years old now .
he was a clockmaker from silesia -lsb- part of the german reich that became part of poland after the war -rsb- .
as a soldier on the eastern front , he was captured by the russians in 1941 and held prisoner of war until 1949 .
my grandparents had no nazi sympathies , as far as i know , and i have never heard them utter one bad word about the jews . what did you do as a volunteer for asf in tel aviv ? bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : a church official in cologne hands over a cheque to asf 's philipp pohlmann -lrb- 3rd from right -rrb- as part of the program , i spent one year at a home for the elderly , helping them run daily errands or visit doctors .
we talked a lot and played gin rummy .
they even gave me hebrew lessons , so i 've gotten to the point that i am conversationally fluent now . how did these elderly israelis , some of whom were holocaust survivors , react to you as a german ? this project has been ongoing in israel for decades , so they are used to german volunteers .
many of the elderly happen to be german jews , who often revert back to their mother tongue as they get older , so they were delighted to speak german with me .
they were also very interested in what 's happening in germany .
some residents even subscribed to a local weekly paper in the german language .
jacob bar-or , a frankfurt native in his 80s , who was one of the prosecutors in the adolf eichmann case , even kept abreast of news in germany by reading the frankfurter allgemeine zeitung newspaper on a regular basis . i never encountered any hostility in israel .
the survivors themselves have no problem with me being german .
they know that i 'm in my 20s and had nothing to do with the holocaust .
if anyone had a problem , and this was rare , it was younger people , the grandchildren of holocaust victims , who perhaps never got to know their forebears . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : germany is israel 's best friend in europe .
israel 's peres with germany 's merkel -lrb- right -rrb- can relations between german and israel ever be fully normal ? no , but that is not necessarily a bad thing .
because of the holocaust , the relationship will always be a special one . the holocaust made claims to a jewish state a moral necessity , but does that mean that the germans can not be critical of israel ? for germany , there can be no doubt about israel 's right to exist , but that does not mean we can not be critical of israeli policy , in particular when political leaders meet behind closed doors .
still , germany needs to tread carefully with regard to the israeli-palestinian conflict . was the arab-israeli conflict a part of your daily life in jerusalem or tel aviv ? no , even though i was there during two major suicide attacks in tel aviv in 2002 and 2003 .
this needs to be kept in perspective , though . israel is not the most dangerous place in the world , and most tourists would not even be aware of the presence of suicide bombers .
i 'm more afraid of driving at high speed on the german autobahns than living in israel . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : merkel laid a wreath during a march visit to the yad vashem memorial suicide bombers wo n't deter young germans from volunteering for asf , but what about scrapping military conscription and the civil alternative , which has been up for discussion for years now in germany ? it 's not a problem .
only one third of those who apply , get accepted into one of our programs abroad , simply because the funding is not there to provide more than 180 placements a year .
volunteers are mainly young people , but we 've got a sprinkling of older germans , too .
also , more than half of the volunteers are women , who do n't get drafted into military service anyway .
even among the young men , there are volunteers who are not necessarily doing this to fulfill their civic duty . i did this to avoid the bundeswehr and to fulfill my civic requirement , but as i see it now , i wound up gaining a year , not losing one on my career path as a lawyer .
whenever i go on interviews for jobs or internships , my year at asf has been a huge advantage for me .
every recruiter has asked me about the time i spent in israel . interview : diana fong send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

since 1961 , action reconciliation has sent thousands of young germans to israel to volunteer in nursing homes , youth centers , hospitals and memorial sites .
the grassroots work of this social action group became the basis of a political rapprochement between germany and israel , when diplomatic relations were established in 1965 .
today , germany is among israel 's most important allies and trading partners in europe . dw-world.de spoke to philipp pohlmann , 25 , who spent a year volunteering in israel .
today , he is a regional spokesman for the group in the cologne area . dw-world.de : how did you wind up joining asf ? philipp pohlmann : in germany , young men are conscripted into military service after they graduate from high school , generally between the ages of 16-20 , but most get out of it nowadays .
some are disqualified because of a minor physical disability , but those who get a clean bill of health , like i did , can opt to do community service instead .
the third possibility is to fulfill the civil service requirement abroad , which is what i chose to do . why did you specifically choose asf ? their focus on germany 's historic responsibility to jews living in israel and all over the world appealed to me .
i wanted personally to meet the last survivors of auschwitz or other camps . it is one thing to learn about the nazi period through textbooks , which is an obligatory part of the german school curriculum , but it 's another to learn about the past in a personal way . so the way the nazi period is taught in schools is too cut and dry ? bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : anne frank 's diary is often not part of the school curriculum .
yes .
everyone learns about the facts - that 6 million european jews perished in the holocaust , for example .
we know the names of all the death camps - auschwitz , treblinka - it 's all very impersonal .
we did n't even read the " diary of anne frank " in school .
i read it on my own . the nazi period is such an important and compelling part of the history of this country , but many teachers never inspire the pupils or stimulate real interest in the subject .
there are many germans and jews who are still alive to talk personally about this period .
why do n't teachers simply invite survivors to speak about their experiences in class ? perhaps teachers are still grappling with how to teach the subject .
is there perhaps a sense of collective guilt or discomfort in dealing with this period ? one thing is clear : anyone who was too young during the war or born after the war can not be guilty of anything , but still , it is very important to know about the history of one 's own country and , with that awareness , to ensure that the genocide does not happen again in the future .
we , young germans , have a responsibility to learn from our past . have you talked about the nationalist socialist period with your own grandparents ? not really .
by the time my interest in this subject was awakened , they were too old or dead .
my paternal grandfather is almost 100 years old now .
he was a clockmaker from silesia -lsb- part of the german reich that became part of poland after the war -rsb- .
as a soldier on the eastern front , he was captured by the russians in 1941 and held prisoner of war until 1949 .
my grandparents had no nazi sympathies , as far as i know , and i have never heard them utter one bad word about the jews . what did you do as a volunteer for asf in tel aviv ? bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : a church official in cologne hands over a cheque to asf 's philipp pohlmann -lrb- 3rd from right -rrb- as part of the program , i spent one year at a home for the elderly , helping them run daily errands or visit doctors .
we talked a lot and played gin rummy .
they even gave me hebrew lessons , so i 've gotten to the point that i am conversationally fluent now . how did these elderly israelis , some of whom were holocaust survivors , react to you as a german ? this project has been ongoing in israel for decades , so they are used to german volunteers .
many of the elderly happen to be german jews , who often revert back to their mother tongue as they get older , so they were delighted to speak german with me .
they were also very interested in what 's happening in germany .
some residents even subscribed to a local weekly paper in the german language .
jacob bar-or , a frankfurt native in his 80s , who was one of the prosecutors in the adolf eichmann case , even kept abreast of news in germany by reading the frankfurter allgemeine zeitung newspaper on a regular basis . i never encountered any hostility in israel .
the survivors themselves have no problem with me being german .
they know that i 'm in my 20s and had nothing to do with the holocaust .
if anyone had a problem , and this was rare , it was younger people , the grandchildren of holocaust victims , who perhaps never got to know their forebears . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : germany is israel 's best friend in europe .
israel 's peres with germany 's merkel -lrb- right -rrb- can relations between german and israel ever be fully normal ? no , but that is not necessarily a bad thing .
because of the holocaust , the relationship will always be a special one . the holocaust made claims to a jewish state a moral necessity , but does that mean that the germans can not be critical of israel ? for germany , there can be no doubt about israel 's right to exist , but that does not mean we can not be critical of israeli policy , in particular when political leaders meet behind closed doors .
still , germany needs to tread carefully with regard to the israeli-palestinian conflict . was the arab-israeli conflict a part of your daily life in jerusalem or tel aviv ? no , even though i was there during two major suicide attacks in tel aviv in 2002 and 2003 .
this needs to be kept in perspective , though . israel is not the most dangerous place in the world , and most tourists would not even be aware of the presence of suicide bombers .
i 'm more afraid of driving at high speed on the german autobahns than living in israel . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : merkel laid a wreath during a march visit to the yad vashem memorial suicide bombers wo n't deter young germans from volunteering for asf , but what about scrapping military conscription and the civil alternative , which has been up for discussion for years now in germany ? it 's not a problem .
only one third of those who apply , get accepted into one of our programs abroad , simply because the funding is not there to provide more than 180 placements a year .
volunteers are mainly young people , but we 've got a sprinkling of older germans , too .
also , more than half of the volunteers are women , who do n't get drafted into military service anyway .
even among the young men , there are volunteers who are not necessarily doing this to fulfill their civic duty . i did this to avoid the bundeswehr and to fulfill my civic requirement , but as i see it now , i wound up gaining a year , not losing one on my career path as a lawyer .
whenever i go on interviews for jobs or internships , my year at asf has been a huge advantage for me .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de russia -pipe- 30.04.2008 georgia accuses russia of military aggression großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : russia has accused georgia of building up troops at the abkhazian border georgia criticized russia 's plans to boost troops in two break-away georgian territories as the start of full scale military aggression .
moscow maintains the troops are serving in a peacekeeping mission . " it 's hard to believe that this is being done for the purposes of peacekeeping , it 's rather the beginning of full scale military aggression , " georgian foreign minister david bakradze told the afp news agency on wednesday , 30 april . russia has deployed additional troops to the break-away georgian territories of abkhazia and south ossetia .
the move stoked tensions with the former soviet republic and drew criticism from the eu . an undefined number of russian soldiers were sent to the caucasus territories on tuesday after moscow accused georgia of massing troops on the border to abkhazia and acquiring a large number of offensive weapons . " russia is not preparing for war , but we can cite a number of examples pointing to the fact that the georgian leadership might be pushing for a resolution of the abkhazian and south ossetian secession by force , " said russian foreign minister sergei lavrov . if it does so , " we will be forced to take retaliatory measures to protect the lives of our citizens , " he added . georgia has repeatedly accused russia of attempting to annex the two territories , which have had close ties with moscow since the mid-1990s .
many of the residents hold russian passports and reject georgian control .
russia has said the troops it has stationed in abkhazia are there for peacekeeping purposes . tensions between georgia and russia have heightened lately as tbilisi negotiates with nato over possible future membership , which moscow strongly opposes . georgia appeals to separatist region bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : abkhazian separatists do n't accept georgian rule georgian president mikheil saakashvili called on abkhazia and south ossetia to reject an " outrageous and irresponsible " force that is trying to provoke a conflict . rebel leaders in the two moscow-backed regions , however , immediately rejected saakashvili 's offer of solidarity . " the co-existence of abkhazia and georgia in a unified state is impossible , " said abkhaz leader sergei bagapsh . russian troops have been involved in the region since 1994 .
following separatist wars , the un brokered a peacekeeping agreement that stipulated russia 's presence in the territories , which had established close ties with moscow in the wake of the disintegration of the soviet union . eu calls russia 's move " unwise " the eu was critical of russia 's decision to enlarge its military force .
some 2,000 russian soldiers are already stationed in abkhazia and 1,000 in south ossetia . " it is not wise to increase the number of russian peacekeepers in georgia right now , " said eu foreign policy chief javier solana on tuesday at a joint press conference with russian foreign minister sergei lavrov . " we defend the territorial integrity of georgia , " solana added . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : saakashvili encouraged abkhazia and south ossetia to reject russia 's involvement lavrov declined to indicate how many additional soldiers would be sent to the region , saying it " remains in the limits foreseen . " earlier this month russia lifted a range of economic sanctions that had been in place for two years against georgia , including the complete closure of land , air and sea links . however , tensions have repeatedly flared since , including georgia 's accusation that a russian aircraft shot down an unmanned surveillance drone deployed over abkhazia . dw staff -lrb- kjb -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

one child had died . " astonishing " reunion austrian authorities said on tuesday , april 29 that members of the family terrorized by decades of incest and imprisonment had an “ astonishing ” reunion at a clinic , where psychiatrists are helping them cope . hospital officials said most of the seven children fritzl fathered over the past 24 years with the daughter he held captive in a windowless cell spent their first moments together sunday , april 27 - a day after those kept confined finally gained their freedom . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the case is a challenge for the mostviertel mental clinic clinic director berthold kepplinger told reporters tuesday the meeting also reunited the suspect 's wife with the daughter fritzl had led her to believe left home to join a religious cult , but instead was imprisoned in a cramped warren of secured and soundproofed cellar rooms . fritzl was remanded to court custody on tuesday .
meanwhile , investigators are looking into suspicions that fritzl may have had help in caring for and keeping secret the presence of a family living hidden in his basement . report claims son had cellar key a report by the women ’ s magazine brigitte has uncovered a claim that fritzl ’ s son and elisabeth ’ s brother , thomas , had a key to the cellar .
a couple who rented an upstairs room in the house , in the austrian town of amstetten , said that thomas called himself the house “ superintendent ” and made regular trips to the cellar to get things for minor repairs . the couple said they themselves were not allowed near the cellar , and were not allowed to rent a cellar storage room , although that his common practice in austria . police are also taking into account the fact that fritzl had made several trips to thailand , and are looking into how the captive family may have gotten food and other goods while he was away . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : investigators uncovered tiny hideaway authorities have also raised the question of who may have helped the man build a cellar that includes a 300 kilogram steel and cement door .
fritzl was given permission to build the cellar as a bomb shelter in the late 1970s . since the case came to light , fritzl ’ s 42 year old daughter , elisabeth , and her children have been carefully shielded from public glare , undergoing psychiatric counselling to help them try to adjust after their unimaginable ordeal . cult cover-story for adoptive " grandkids " fritzl had told his wife that their daughter had run away to join a cult .
in reality she was locked underground in the 60 square meter -lrb- 650 square feet -rrb- underground rooms . mother and daughter were reunited this week for the first time in a quarter century . fritzl explained the presence of three of the grandchildren whom he adopted to his wife and to the community by claiming elisabeth had given birth to them at the cult , and then delivered them to his doorstep for the older couple to care for . three other children – aged 19 , 18 and 5 - lived belowground with their mother in the cell .
they first saw daylight when they were rescued . daughter 's illness leads to family 's release one child , a twin , had died shortly after birth .
fritzl has admitted to burning the corpse in the house ’ s boiler . the decision on which children lived aboveground and which below depended on whether they were “ screaming babies ” and on their general halth , explained chief inspector leopold etz from the lower austrian criminal investigators office . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : a bathroom in the shocking home-prison the case came to light because one of the children , 19 year old kerstin , was severely ill .
her “ grandfather ” brought the child to the hospital , which started a search for the child ’ s mother in the hopes of finding out her medical history .
they televised an urgent call elisabeth to come back and save the daughter ’ s life . elisabeth saw the call on television , and was able to convince her father to let her go to the hospital .
she seized the chance to speak privately to a doctor and explain her situation .
fritzl was arrested the same day . fritzl ’ s admission that he burned the body of the dead seventh child could prove pivotal when the case comes to trial , with a prosecutor saying he would face a life sentence if found guilty of manslaughter , as opposed to shorter prison terms for rape or incarceration . psychologist paulus hochgatterer , who is helping advise those counselling the family , told afp news service that the three children fritzl had kept underground are staying in a sequestered treatment container that could be locked from the inside . slow road to recovery ? safely shielded from the media circus that has set up camp in amstetten , he said their initial treatment could take several weeks . " only very gradually are they being exposed to the outside world , " hochgatterer said , adding that " given the circumstances , they 're actually doing quite well . " the two sets of children are now tentatively beginning to get to know one another .
the youngest child , five years old , seems most able to adapt to his new life , his caretakers said . experts said the family is likely to need years of therapy . " it could take between five and eight years , " said max friedrich , the psychiatrist who looked after another sequestration victim , natascha kampusch , in an interview with the daily oesterreich . the head of the local social services , hans-heinz lenze , said a name-change had been suggested for the immediate victims , but fritzl 's other family as well , in order to give them a new start in life . long-term investigation expected " at the moment , all possibilities are being sounded out in closest consultation with the family .
but a decision will only be reached in the coming weeks , " lenze told a news conference on tuesday . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : can officials look to the kampusch case for help ?
chief investigator franz polzer told austrian television that police might need " half a year " to complete their investigations .
he ruled out any suggestion fritzl might have had an accomplice . " as our investigations now stand , there were no accomplices .
but you can never be 100 percent certain . " doctors would determine when police would be allowed to question elisabeth fritzl and the children , but that was unlikely to be for several days . fritzl had officially adopted the three aboveground children , after showing authorities letters signed by elizabeth that said she could not care for them , and which asked that they try not to track her down for the sake of herself and her children . fritzl was allowed to adopt despite a reported conviction of attempted rape in the 1960s and of arson , but the records were wiped after a period of time set by austrian law . the district court in amstetten , which had greenlighted the adoptions , said it had followed protocol in the adoption proceedings and had had acted correctly . no sign of wife 's complicity " there were n't any doubts about his -lrb- fritzl 's -rrb- integrity .
why should i put the child in a foster home , when it could grow up in a family , " court president josef schoegl told the austria press agency . chief police investigator franz polzer said there was no sign that fritzl 's wife , who also had seven children with him , knew of the goings on in his locked dungeon . in the town of amstetten , more than 200 people including dozens of youngsters quietly held a candlelight vigil in the main square late tuesday , as the town of 23,000 sought to cast off the notoriety brought to their doorstep by fritzl . shocked residents react " shock , sadness , rage and perhaps also hatred have gripped us these last few days , " pastor peter boesendorfer told those gathered . " we must acknowledge that there is something in our town that we can not comprehend , " he said , calling on residents " to help and show solidarity so that a life will be possible " for the bewildered children and their scarred mother . amstetten mayor herbert katzengruber told the austrian news agency apa : " we want to show that amstetten is not a town for criminals .
but it 's mostly about showing solidarity and help to the victims .

" astonishing " reunion austrian authorities said on tuesday , april 29 that members of the family terrorized by decades of incest and imprisonment had an “ astonishing ” reunion at a clinic , where psychiatrists are helping them cope . hospital officials said most of the seven children fritzl fathered over the past 24 years with the daughter he held captive in a windowless cell spent their first moments together sunday , april 27 - a day after those kept confined finally gained their freedom . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the case is a challenge for the mostviertel mental clinic clinic director berthold kepplinger told reporters tuesday the meeting also reunited the suspect 's wife with the daughter fritzl had led her to believe left home to join a religious cult , but instead was imprisoned in a cramped warren of secured and soundproofed cellar rooms . fritzl was remanded to court custody on tuesday .
meanwhile , investigators are looking into suspicions that fritzl may have had help in caring for and keeping secret the presence of a family living hidden in his basement . report claims son had cellar key a report by the women ’ s magazine brigitte has uncovered a claim that fritzl ’ s son and elisabeth ’ s brother , thomas , had a key to the cellar .
a couple who rented an upstairs room in the house , in the austrian town of amstetten , said that thomas called himself the house “ superintendent ” and made regular trips to the cellar to get things for minor repairs . the couple said they themselves were not allowed near the cellar , and were not allowed to rent a cellar storage room , although that his common practice in austria . police are also taking into account the fact that fritzl had made several trips to thailand , and are looking into how the captive family may have gotten food and other goods while he was away . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : investigators uncovered tiny hideaway authorities have also raised the question of who may have helped the man build a cellar that includes a 300 kilogram steel and cement door .
fritzl was given permission to build the cellar as a bomb shelter in the late 1970s . since the case came to light , fritzl ’ s 42 year old daughter , elisabeth , and her children have been carefully shielded from public glare , undergoing psychiatric counselling to help them try to adjust after their unimaginable ordeal . cult cover-story for adoptive " grandkids " fritzl had told his wife that their daughter had run away to join a cult .
in reality she was locked underground in the 60 square meter -lrb- 650 square feet -rrb- underground rooms . mother and daughter were reunited this week for the first time in a quarter century . fritzl explained the presence of three of the grandchildren whom he adopted to his wife and to the community by claiming elisabeth had given birth to them at the cult , and then delivered them to his doorstep for the older couple to care for . three other children – aged 19 , 18 and 5 - lived belowground with their mother in the cell .
they first saw daylight when they were rescued . daughter 's illness leads to family 's release one child , a twin , had died shortly after birth .
fritzl has admitted to burning the corpse in the house ’ s boiler . the decision on which children lived aboveground and which below depended on whether they were “ screaming babies ” and on their general halth , explained chief inspector leopold etz from the lower austrian criminal investigators office . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : a bathroom in the shocking home-prison the case came to light because one of the children , 19 year old kerstin , was severely ill .
her “ grandfather ” brought the child to the hospital , which started a search for the child ’ s mother in the hopes of finding out her medical history .
they televised an urgent call elisabeth to come back and save the daughter ’ s life . elisabeth saw the call on television , and was able to convince her father to let her go to the hospital .
she seized the chance to speak privately to a doctor and explain her situation .
fritzl was arrested the same day . fritzl ’ s admission that he burned the body of the dead seventh child could prove pivotal when the case comes to trial , with a prosecutor saying he would face a life sentence if found guilty of manslaughter , as opposed to shorter prison terms for rape or incarceration . psychologist paulus hochgatterer , who is helping advise those counselling the family , told afp news service that the three children fritzl had kept underground are staying in a sequestered treatment container that could be locked from the inside . slow road to recovery ? safely shielded from the media circus that has set up camp in amstetten , he said their initial treatment could take several weeks . " only very gradually are they being exposed to the outside world , " hochgatterer said , adding that " given the circumstances , they 're actually doing quite well . " the two sets of children are now tentatively beginning to get to know one another .
the youngest child , five years old , seems most able to adapt to his new life , his caretakers said . experts said the family is likely to need years of therapy . " it could take between five and eight years , " said max friedrich , the psychiatrist who looked after another sequestration victim , natascha kampusch , in an interview with the daily oesterreich . the head of the local social services , hans-heinz lenze , said a name-change had been suggested for the immediate victims , but fritzl 's other family as well , in order to give them a new start in life . long-term investigation expected " at the moment , all possibilities are being sounded out in closest consultation with the family .
but a decision will only be reached in the coming weeks , " lenze told a news conference on tuesday . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : can officials look to the kampusch case for help ?
chief investigator franz polzer told austrian television that police might need " half a year " to complete their investigations .
he ruled out any suggestion fritzl might have had an accomplice . " as our investigations now stand , there were no accomplices .
but you can never be 100 percent certain . " doctors would determine when police would be allowed to question elisabeth fritzl and the children , but that was unlikely to be for several days . fritzl had officially adopted the three aboveground children , after showing authorities letters signed by elizabeth that said she could not care for them , and which asked that they try not to track her down for the sake of herself and her children . fritzl was allowed to adopt despite a reported conviction of attempted rape in the 1960s and of arson , but the records were wiped after a period of time set by austrian law . the district court in amstetten , which had greenlighted the adoptions , said it had followed protocol in the adoption proceedings and had had acted correctly . no sign of wife 's complicity " there were n't any doubts about his -lrb- fritzl 's -rrb- integrity .
why should i put the child in a foster home , when it could grow up in a family , " court president josef schoegl told the austria press agency . chief police investigator franz polzer said there was no sign that fritzl 's wife , who also had seven children with him , knew of the goings on in his locked dungeon . in the town of amstetten , more than 200 people including dozens of youngsters quietly held a candlelight vigil in the main square late tuesday , as the town of 23,000 sought to cast off the notoriety brought to their doorstep by fritzl . shocked residents react " shock , sadness , rage and perhaps also hatred have gripped us these last few days , " pastor peter boesendorfer told those gathered . " we must acknowledge that there is something in our town that we can not comprehend , " he said , calling on residents " to help and show solidarity so that a life will be possible " for the bewildered children and their scarred mother . amstetten mayor herbert katzengruber told the austrian news agency apa : " we want to show that amstetten is not a town for criminals .
but it 's mostly about showing solidarity and help to the victims .

other european countries , however , are stepping up the pressure . the european union had hoped a meeting of its foreign ministers in luxembourg would produce a green light for partnership talks with russia .
yet at the end of the meeting , it seemed unlikely that europe would be ready to begin talks at a summit in siberia planned for june .
" it is over for today , " luxembourg 's foreign minister jean asselborn told reporters as the eu foreign ministers ' talks ended on tuesday , april 29 .
" we are a bit blocked . "
lithuania was the main obstacle standing in the way of beginning partnership and cooperation agreement -lrb- pca -rrb- negotiations with russia .
the former soviet republic wanted russian assurances on energy supplies , judicial cooperation and regional security before agreeing to the talks .
the eu will try to push forward the partnership talks , which have been deadlocked for 18 months , at a meeting next week in brussels .
europe would like to have a mandate in place by a planned june summit with russia which will be held in siberia .
siberian summit cutting it close bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : lithuania had promised to block the talks lithuanian officials would not say whether they thought the june timeline remained possible .
" i do n't want to put any timeframe on the talks or the objectives , " lithuanian foreign minister petras vaitiekunas said .
" what is important is ... the quality of the objectives and the quality of the relations with russia . "
vilnius has a tense relationship with moscow .
lithuania objects to russia 's decision to shut-off of a pipeline supplying lithuania 's only oil refinery .
moscow has said a technical problem has led to the halt in energy deliveries .
lithuania is also unhappy about russia 's attitude toward judicial and international cooperation .
the baltic country also wants russia to change its stance on internal border conflicts in georgia and moldova .
russia has supported the territorial claims of breakaway republics in both countries .
europe eager for new energy policy bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the current eu-russia agreement was signed under yeltsin current relations between the eu and russia on issues ranging from energy to education are governed by a pca negotiated with the government of boris yeltsin in 1997 .
europe has found it difficult to negotiate a replacement agreement .
originally , it was poland that blocked talks to protest a russian import ban on polish meat and vegetable products .
the ban has since been lifted and poland agreed to the talks , leaving lithuania the only eu holdout .
any eu country can block negotiations with another country outside the bloc .
" of course , we share lithuania 's worries and the problems they listed , but we also see that it 's better to talk with the russians about all those problems to solve them , " estonian foreign minister urmas paet said .
most other 27 nations which make up the eu want a new agreement with energy-rich russia and have pressured lithuania to agree to the negotiations .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the eu is dependent on russian oil " there are very important interests -lsb- at stake -rsb- , " spanish secretary of state for european affairs diego lopez garrido said before the meeting , citing energy .
" it will be a long negotiation that should start as soon as possible . "

moscow maintains the troops are serving in a peacekeeping mission . " it 's hard to believe that this is being done for the purposes of peacekeeping , it 's rather the beginning of full scale military aggression , " georgian foreign minister david bakradze told the afp news agency on wednesday , 30 april . russia has deployed additional troops to the break-away georgian territories of abkhazia and south ossetia .
the move stoked tensions with the former soviet republic and drew criticism from the eu . an undefined number of russian soldiers were sent to the caucasus territories on tuesday after moscow accused georgia of massing troops on the border to abkhazia and acquiring a large number of offensive weapons . " russia is not preparing for war , but we can cite a number of examples pointing to the fact that the georgian leadership might be pushing for a resolution of the abkhazian and south ossetian secession by force , " said russian foreign minister sergei lavrov . if it does so , " we will be forced to take retaliatory measures to protect the lives of our citizens , " he added . georgia has repeatedly accused russia of attempting to annex the two territories , which have had close ties with moscow since the mid-1990s .
many of the residents hold russian passports and reject georgian control .
russia has said the troops it has stationed in abkhazia are there for peacekeeping purposes . tensions between georgia and russia have heightened lately as tbilisi negotiates with nato over possible future membership , which moscow strongly opposes . georgia appeals to separatist region bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : abkhazian separatists do n't accept georgian rule georgian president mikheil saakashvili called on abkhazia and south ossetia to reject an " outrageous and irresponsible " force that is trying to provoke a conflict . rebel leaders in the two moscow-backed regions , however , immediately rejected saakashvili 's offer of solidarity . " the co-existence of abkhazia and georgia in a unified state is impossible , " said abkhaz leader sergei bagapsh . russian troops have been involved in the region since 1994 .
following separatist wars , the un brokered a peacekeeping agreement that stipulated russia 's presence in the territories , which had established close ties with moscow in the wake of the disintegration of the soviet union . eu calls russia 's move " unwise " the eu was critical of russia 's decision to enlarge its military force .
some 2,000 russian soldiers are already stationed in abkhazia and 1,000 in south ossetia . " it is not wise to increase the number of russian peacekeepers in georgia right now , " said eu foreign policy chief javier solana on tuesday at a joint press conference with russian foreign minister sergei lavrov . " we defend the territorial integrity of georgia , " solana added . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : saakashvili encouraged abkhazia and south ossetia to reject russia 's involvement lavrov declined to indicate how many additional soldiers would be sent to the region , saying it " remains in the limits foreseen . " earlier this month russia lifted a range of economic sanctions that had been in place for two years against georgia , including the complete closure of land , air and sea links . however , tensions have repeatedly flared since , including georgia 's accusation that a russian aircraft shot down an unmanned surveillance drone deployed over abkhazia . dw staff -lrb- kjb -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

moscow maintains the troops are serving in a peacekeeping mission .

one child had died . " astonishing " reunion austrian authorities said on tuesday , april 29 that members of the family terrorized by decades of incest and imprisonment had an “ astonishing ” reunion at a clinic , where psychiatrists are helping them cope . hospital officials said most of the seven children fritzl fathered over the past 24 years with the daughter he held captive in a windowless cell spent their first moments together sunday , april 27 - a day after those kept confined finally gained their freedom . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the case is a challenge for the mostviertel mental clinic clinic director berthold kepplinger told reporters tuesday the meeting also reunited the suspect 's wife with the daughter fritzl had led her to believe left home to join a religious cult , but instead was imprisoned in a cramped warren of secured and soundproofed cellar rooms . fritzl was remanded to court custody on tuesday .
meanwhile , investigators are looking into suspicions that fritzl may have had help in caring for and keeping secret the presence of a family living hidden in his basement . report claims son had cellar key a report by the women ’ s magazine brigitte has uncovered a claim that fritzl ’ s son and elisabeth ’ s brother , thomas , had a key to the cellar .
a couple who rented an upstairs room in the house , in the austrian town of amstetten , said that thomas called himself the house “ superintendent ” and made regular trips to the cellar to get things for minor repairs . the couple said they themselves were not allowed near the cellar , and were not allowed to rent a cellar storage room , although that his common practice in austria . police are also taking into account the fact that fritzl had made several trips to thailand , and are looking into how the captive family may have gotten food and other goods while he was away . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : investigators uncovered tiny hideaway authorities have also raised the question of who may have helped the man build a cellar that includes a 300 kilogram steel and cement door .
fritzl was given permission to build the cellar as a bomb shelter in the late 1970s . since the case came to light , fritzl ’ s 42 year old daughter , elisabeth , and her children have been carefully shielded from public glare , undergoing psychiatric counselling to help them try to adjust after their unimaginable ordeal . cult cover-story for adoptive " grandkids " fritzl had told his wife that their daughter had run away to join a cult .
in reality she was locked underground in the 60 square meter -lrb- 650 square feet -rrb- underground rooms . mother and daughter were reunited this week for the first time in a quarter century . fritzl explained the presence of three of the grandchildren whom he adopted to his wife and to the community by claiming elisabeth had given birth to them at the cult , and then delivered them to his doorstep for the older couple to care for . three other children – aged 19 , 18 and 5 - lived belowground with their mother in the cell .
they first saw daylight when they were rescued . daughter 's illness leads to family 's release one child , a twin , had died shortly after birth .
fritzl has admitted to burning the corpse in the house ’ s boiler . the decision on which children lived aboveground and which below depended on whether they were “ screaming babies ” and on their general halth , explained chief inspector leopold etz from the lower austrian criminal investigators office . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : a bathroom in the shocking home-prison the case came to light because one of the children , 19 year old kerstin , was severely ill .
her “ grandfather ” brought the child to the hospital , which started a search for the child ’ s mother in the hopes of finding out her medical history .
they televised an urgent call elisabeth to come back and save the daughter ’ s life . elisabeth saw the call on television , and was able to convince her father to let her go to the hospital .
she seized the chance to speak privately to a doctor and explain her situation .
fritzl was arrested the same day . fritzl ’ s admission that he burned the body of the dead seventh child could prove pivotal when the case comes to trial , with a prosecutor saying he would face a life sentence if found guilty of manslaughter , as opposed to shorter prison terms for rape or incarceration . psychologist paulus hochgatterer , who is helping advise those counselling the family , told afp news service that the three children fritzl had kept underground are staying in a sequestered treatment container that could be locked from the inside . slow road to recovery ? safely shielded from the media circus that has set up camp in amstetten , he said their initial treatment could take several weeks . " only very gradually are they being exposed to the outside world , " hochgatterer said , adding that " given the circumstances , they 're actually doing quite well . " the two sets of children are now tentatively beginning to get to know one another .
the youngest child , five years old , seems most able to adapt to his new life , his caretakers said . experts said the family is likely to need years of therapy . " it could take between five and eight years , " said max friedrich , the psychiatrist who looked after another sequestration victim , natascha kampusch , in an interview with the daily oesterreich . the head of the local social services , hans-heinz lenze , said a name-change had been suggested for the immediate victims , but fritzl 's other family as well , in order to give them a new start in life . long-term investigation expected " at the moment , all possibilities are being sounded out in closest consultation with the family .
but a decision will only be reached in the coming weeks , " lenze told a news conference on tuesday . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : can officials look to the kampusch case for help ?
chief investigator franz polzer told austrian television that police might need " half a year " to complete their investigations .
he ruled out any suggestion fritzl might have had an accomplice . " as our investigations now stand , there were no accomplices .
but you can never be 100 percent certain . " doctors would determine when police would be allowed to question elisabeth fritzl and the children , but that was unlikely to be for several days . fritzl had officially adopted the three aboveground children , after showing authorities letters signed by elizabeth that said she could not care for them , and which asked that they try not to track her down for the sake of herself and her children . fritzl was allowed to adopt despite a reported conviction of attempted rape in the 1960s and of arson , but the records were wiped after a period of time set by austrian law . the district court in amstetten , which had greenlighted the adoptions , said it had followed protocol in the adoption proceedings and had had acted correctly . no sign of wife 's complicity " there were n't any doubts about his -lrb- fritzl 's -rrb- integrity .
why should i put the child in a foster home , when it could grow up in a family , " court president josef schoegl told the austria press agency . chief police investigator franz polzer said there was no sign that fritzl 's wife , who also had seven children with him , knew of the goings on in his locked dungeon . in the town of amstetten , more than 200 people including dozens of youngsters quietly held a candlelight vigil in the main square late tuesday , as the town of 23,000 sought to cast off the notoriety brought to their doorstep by fritzl . shocked residents react " shock , sadness , rage and perhaps also hatred have gripped us these last few days , " pastor peter boesendorfer told those gathered . " we must acknowledge that there is something in our town that we can not comprehend , " he said , calling on residents " to help and show solidarity so that a life will be possible " for the bewildered children and their scarred mother . amstetten mayor herbert katzengruber told the austrian news agency apa : " we want to show that amstetten is not a town for criminals .
but it 's mostly about showing solidarity and help to the victims .

but a decision will only be reached in the coming weeks , " lenze told a news conference on tuesday . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : can officials look to the kampusch case for help ?
chief investigator franz polzer told austrian television that police might need " half a year " to complete their investigations .
he ruled out any suggestion fritzl might have had an accomplice . " as our investigations now stand , there were no accomplices .
but you can never be 100 percent certain . " doctors would determine when police would be allowed to question elisabeth fritzl and the children , but that was unlikely to be for several days . fritzl had officially adopted the three aboveground children , after showing authorities letters signed by elizabeth that said she could not care for them , and which asked that they try not to track her down for the sake of herself and her children . fritzl was allowed to adopt despite a reported conviction of attempted rape in the 1960s and of arson , but the records were wiped after a period of time set by austrian law . the district court in amstetten , which had greenlighted the adoptions , said it had followed protocol in the adoption proceedings and had had acted correctly . no sign of wife 's complicity " there were n't any doubts about his -lrb- fritzl 's -rrb- integrity .
why should i put the child in a foster home , when it could grow up in a family , " court president josef schoegl told the austria press agency . chief police investigator franz polzer said there was no sign that fritzl 's wife , who also had seven children with him , knew of the goings on in his locked dungeon . in the town of amstetten , more than 200 people including dozens of youngsters quietly held a candlelight vigil in the main square late tuesday , as the town of 23,000 sought to cast off the notoriety brought to their doorstep by fritzl . shocked residents react " shock , sadness , rage and perhaps also hatred have gripped us these last few days , " pastor peter boesendorfer told those gathered . " we must acknowledge that there is something in our town that we can not comprehend , " he said , calling on residents " to help and show solidarity so that a life will be possible " for the bewildered children and their scarred mother . amstetten mayor herbert katzengruber told the austrian news agency apa : " we want to show that amstetten is not a town for criminals .
but it 's mostly about showing solidarity and help to the victims .

other european countries , however , are stepping up the pressure . the european union had hoped a meeting of its foreign ministers in luxembourg would produce a green light for partnership talks with russia .
yet at the end of the meeting , it seemed unlikely that europe would be ready to begin talks at a summit in siberia planned for june .
" it is over for today , " luxembourg 's foreign minister jean asselborn told reporters as the eu foreign ministers ' talks ended on tuesday , april 29 .
" we are a bit blocked . "
lithuania was the main obstacle standing in the way of beginning partnership and cooperation agreement -lrb- pca -rrb- negotiations with russia .
the former soviet republic wanted russian assurances on energy supplies , judicial cooperation and regional security before agreeing to the talks .
the eu will try to push forward the partnership talks , which have been deadlocked for 18 months , at a meeting next week in brussels .
europe would like to have a mandate in place by a planned june summit with russia which will be held in siberia .
siberian summit cutting it close bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : lithuania had promised to block the talks lithuanian officials would not say whether they thought the june timeline remained possible .
" i do n't want to put any timeframe on the talks or the objectives , " lithuanian foreign minister petras vaitiekunas said .
" what is important is ... the quality of the objectives and the quality of the relations with russia . "
vilnius has a tense relationship with moscow .
lithuania objects to russia 's decision to shut-off of a pipeline supplying lithuania 's only oil refinery .
moscow has said a technical problem has led to the halt in energy deliveries .
lithuania is also unhappy about russia 's attitude toward judicial and international cooperation .
the baltic country also wants russia to change its stance on internal border conflicts in georgia and moldova .
russia has supported the territorial claims of breakaway republics in both countries .
europe eager for new energy policy bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the current eu-russia agreement was signed under yeltsin current relations between the eu and russia on issues ranging from energy to education are governed by a pca negotiated with the government of boris yeltsin in 1997 .
europe has found it difficult to negotiate a replacement agreement .
originally , it was poland that blocked talks to protest a russian import ban on polish meat and vegetable products .
the ban has since been lifted and poland agreed to the talks , leaving lithuania the only eu holdout .
any eu country can block negotiations with another country outside the bloc .
" of course , we share lithuania 's worries and the problems they listed , but we also see that it 's better to talk with the russians about all those problems to solve them , " estonian foreign minister urmas paet said .
most other 27 nations which make up the eu want a new agreement with energy-rich russia and have pressured lithuania to agree to the negotiations .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the eu is dependent on russian oil " there are very important interests -lsb- at stake -rsb- , " spanish secretary of state for european affairs diego lopez garrido said before the meeting , citing energy .
" it will be a long negotiation that should start as soon as possible . "
" we do believe that the eu should begin this process of a partnership and cooperation agreement , " added british europe minister jim murphy .

no , thanks " and " serbia - russia " serbian caretaker prime minister vojislav kostunica on wednesday , april 30 , dismissed the stabilization and association agreement with the european union as a " false document " which legalizes the secession of kosovo . " those who signed the tabilization and association agreement -lsb- saa -rsb- are fully responsible for it and they signed it in their own names and never in the name of serbia , " kostunica said in an interview with the daily vecernje novosti .
serbian president boris tadic and deputy prime minister bozidar djelic signed the saa , which legalizes the secession of serbia 's province of kosovo and is a precursor to eu membership talks , with the european union on tuesday , a move denounced by serbian nationalists as treason .
the nationalist majority in serbia heaped insults on the saa with the european union , calling its signing " lies and deceit , " " treason , " and " legally null and void . "
kostunica 's democratic party of serbia -lsb- dss -rsb- has said it will take legal action against the pro-europe bloc for signing the saa , while the ultra-nationalist opposition serbian radical party -lsb- srs -rsb- has said it will launch a case to remove tadic from office .
" without an saa there can be no possibility for a full integration of the western balkans into the european union , and without such integration there is no possibility for a final reconciliation amongst the people of the western balkans , " tadic said .

the medium gallup and blic daily poll showed that the nationalists would win 137 seats out of 250 if elections were held right now , while the pro-european bloc would win 113 seats .
if kostunica forms a government with the radicals , that would cement serbia 's turn away from the eu towards russia .
the alternative would be for kostunica to form a coalition with tadic , as he did last year .

one child had died . " astonishing " reunion austrian authorities said on tuesday , april 29 that members of the family terrorized by decades of incest and imprisonment had an “ astonishing ” reunion at a clinic , where psychiatrists are helping them cope . hospital officials said most of the seven children fritzl fathered over the past 24 years with the daughter he held captive in a windowless cell spent their first moments together sunday , april 27 - a day after those kept confined finally gained their freedom . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the case is a challenge for the mostviertel mental clinic clinic director berthold kepplinger told reporters tuesday the meeting also reunited the suspect 's wife with the daughter fritzl had led her to believe left home to join a religious cult , but instead was imprisoned in a cramped warren of secured and soundproofed cellar rooms . fritzl was remanded to court custody on tuesday .
meanwhile , investigators are looking into suspicions that fritzl may have had help in caring for and keeping secret the presence of a family living hidden in his basement . report claims son had cellar key a report by the women ’ s magazine brigitte has uncovered a claim that fritzl ’ s son and elisabeth ’ s brother , thomas , had a key to the cellar .
a couple who rented an upstairs room in the house , in the austrian town of amstetten , said that thomas called himself the house “ superintendent ” and made regular trips to the cellar to get things for minor repairs . the couple said they themselves were not allowed near the cellar , and were not allowed to rent a cellar storage room , although that his common practice in austria . police are also taking into account the fact that fritzl had made several trips to thailand , and are looking into how the captive family may have gotten food and other goods while he was away . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : investigators uncovered tiny hideaway authorities have also raised the question of who may have helped the man build a cellar that includes a 300 kilogram steel and cement door .
fritzl was given permission to build the cellar as a bomb shelter in the late 1970s . since the case came to light , fritzl ’ s 42 year old daughter , elisabeth , and her children have been carefully shielded from public glare , undergoing psychiatric counselling to help them try to adjust after their unimaginable ordeal . cult cover-story for adoptive " grandkids " fritzl had told his wife that their daughter had run away to join a cult .
in reality she was locked underground in the 60 square meter -lrb- 650 square feet -rrb- underground rooms . mother and daughter were reunited this week for the first time in a quarter century . fritzl explained the presence of three of the grandchildren whom he adopted to his wife and to the community by claiming elisabeth had given birth to them at the cult , and then delivered them to his doorstep for the older couple to care for . three other children – aged 19 , 18 and 5 - lived belowground with their mother in the cell .
they first saw daylight when they were rescued . daughter 's illness leads to family 's release one child , a twin , had died shortly after birth .
fritzl has admitted to burning the corpse in the house ’ s boiler . the decision on which children lived aboveground and which below depended on whether they were “ screaming babies ” and on their general halth , explained chief inspector leopold etz from the lower austrian criminal investigators office . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : a bathroom in the shocking home-prison the case came to light because one of the children , 19 year old kerstin , was severely ill .
her “ grandfather ” brought the child to the hospital , which started a search for the child ’ s mother in the hopes of finding out her medical history .
they televised an urgent call elisabeth to come back and save the daughter ’ s life . elisabeth saw the call on television , and was able to convince her father to let her go to the hospital .
she seized the chance to speak privately to a doctor and explain her situation .
fritzl was arrested the same day . fritzl ’ s admission that he burned the body of the dead seventh child could prove pivotal when the case comes to trial , with a prosecutor saying he would face a life sentence if found guilty of manslaughter , as opposed to shorter prison terms for rape or incarceration . psychologist paulus hochgatterer , who is helping advise those counselling the family , told afp news service that the three children fritzl had kept underground are staying in a sequestered treatment container that could be locked from the inside . slow road to recovery ? safely shielded from the media circus that has set up camp in amstetten , he said their initial treatment could take several weeks . " only very gradually are they being exposed to the outside world , " hochgatterer said , adding that " given the circumstances , they 're actually doing quite well . " the two sets of children are now tentatively beginning to get to know one another .
the youngest child , five years old , seems most able to adapt to his new life , his caretakers said . experts said the family is likely to need years of therapy . " it could take between five and eight years , " said max friedrich , the psychiatrist who looked after another sequestration victim , natascha kampusch , in an interview with the daily oesterreich . the head of the local social services , hans-heinz lenze , said a name-change had been suggested for the immediate victims , but fritzl 's other family as well , in order to give them a new start in life . long-term investigation expected " at the moment , all possibilities are being sounded out in closest consultation with the family .
but a decision will only be reached in the coming weeks , " lenze told a news conference on tuesday . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : can officials look to the kampusch case for help ?
chief investigator franz polzer told austrian television that police might need " half a year " to complete their investigations .
he ruled out any suggestion fritzl might have had an accomplice . " as our investigations now stand , there were no accomplices .
but you can never be 100 percent certain . " doctors would determine when police would be allowed to question elisabeth fritzl and the children , but that was unlikely to be for several days . fritzl had officially adopted the three aboveground children , after showing authorities letters signed by elizabeth that said she could not care for them , and which asked that they try not to track her down for the sake of herself and her children . fritzl was allowed to adopt despite a reported conviction of attempted rape in the 1960s and of arson , but the records were wiped after a period of time set by austrian law . the district court in amstetten , which had greenlighted the adoptions , said it had followed protocol in the adoption proceedings and had had acted correctly . no sign of wife 's complicity " there were n't any doubts about his -lrb- fritzl 's -rrb- integrity .
why should i put the child in a foster home , when it could grow up in a family , " court president josef schoegl told the austria press agency . chief police investigator franz polzer said there was no sign that fritzl 's wife , who also had seven children with him , knew of the goings on in his locked dungeon . in the town of amstetten , more than 200 people including dozens of youngsters quietly held a candlelight vigil in the main square late tuesday , as the town of 23,000 sought to cast off the notoriety brought to their doorstep by fritzl . shocked residents react " shock , sadness , rage and perhaps also hatred have gripped us these last few days , " pastor peter boesendorfer told those gathered . " we must acknowledge that there is something in our town that we can not comprehend , " he said , calling on residents " to help and show solidarity so that a life will be possible " for the bewildered children and their scarred mother . amstetten mayor herbert katzengruber told the austrian news agency apa : " we want to show that amstetten is not a town for criminals .
but it 's mostly about showing solidarity and help to the victims .

since 1961 , action reconciliation has sent thousands of young germans to israel to volunteer in nursing homes , youth centers , hospitals and memorial sites .
the grassroots work of this social action group became the basis of a political rapprochement between germany and israel , when diplomatic relations were established in 1965 .
today , germany is among israel 's most important allies and trading partners in europe . dw-world.de spoke to philipp pohlmann , 25 , who spent a year volunteering in israel .
today , he is a regional spokesman for the group in the cologne area . dw-world.de : how did you wind up joining asf ? philipp pohlmann : in germany , young men are conscripted into military service after they graduate from high school , generally between the ages of 16-20 , but most get out of it nowadays .
some are disqualified because of a minor physical disability , but those who get a clean bill of health , like i did , can opt to do community service instead .
the third possibility is to fulfill the civil service requirement abroad , which is what i chose to do . why did you specifically choose asf ? their focus on germany 's historic responsibility to jews living in israel and all over the world appealed to me .
i wanted personally to meet the last survivors of auschwitz or other camps . it is one thing to learn about the nazi period through textbooks , which is an obligatory part of the german school curriculum , but it 's another to learn about the past in a personal way . so the way the nazi period is taught in schools is too cut and dry ? bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : anne frank 's diary is often not part of the school curriculum .
yes .
everyone learns about the facts - that 6 million european jews perished in the holocaust , for example .
we know the names of all the death camps - auschwitz , treblinka - it 's all very impersonal .
we did n't even read the " diary of anne frank " in school .
i read it on my own . the nazi period is such an important and compelling part of the history of this country , but many teachers never inspire the pupils or stimulate real interest in the subject .
there are many germans and jews who are still alive to talk personally about this period .
why do n't teachers simply invite survivors to speak about their experiences in class ? perhaps teachers are still grappling with how to teach the subject .
is there perhaps a sense of collective guilt or discomfort in dealing with this period ? one thing is clear : anyone who was too young during the war or born after the war can not be guilty of anything , but still , it is very important to know about the history of one 's own country and , with that awareness , to ensure that the genocide does not happen again in the future .
we , young germans , have a responsibility to learn from our past . have you talked about the nationalist socialist period with your own grandparents ? not really .
by the time my interest in this subject was awakened , they were too old or dead .
my paternal grandfather is almost 100 years old now .
he was a clockmaker from silesia -lsb- part of the german reich that became part of poland after the war -rsb- .
as a soldier on the eastern front , he was captured by the russians in 1941 and held prisoner of war until 1949 .
my grandparents had no nazi sympathies , as far as i know , and i have never heard them utter one bad word about the jews . what did you do as a volunteer for asf in tel aviv ? bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : a church official in cologne hands over a cheque to asf 's philipp pohlmann -lrb- 3rd from right -rrb- as part of the program , i spent one year at a home for the elderly , helping them run daily errands or visit doctors .
we talked a lot and played gin rummy .
they even gave me hebrew lessons , so i 've gotten to the point that i am conversationally fluent now . how did these elderly israelis , some of whom were holocaust survivors , react to you as a german ? this project has been ongoing in israel for decades , so they are used to german volunteers .
many of the elderly happen to be german jews , who often revert back to their mother tongue as they get older , so they were delighted to speak german with me .
they were also very interested in what 's happening in germany .
some residents even subscribed to a local weekly paper in the german language .
jacob bar-or , a frankfurt native in his 80s , who was one of the prosecutors in the adolf eichmann case , even kept abreast of news in germany by reading the frankfurter allgemeine zeitung newspaper on a regular basis . i never encountered any hostility in israel .
the survivors themselves have no problem with me being german .
they know that i 'm in my 20s and had nothing to do with the holocaust .
if anyone had a problem , and this was rare , it was younger people , the grandchildren of holocaust victims , who perhaps never got to know their forebears . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : germany is israel 's best friend in europe .
israel 's peres with germany 's merkel -lrb- right -rrb- can relations between german and israel ever be fully normal ? no , but that is not necessarily a bad thing .
because of the holocaust , the relationship will always be a special one . the holocaust made claims to a jewish state a moral necessity , but does that mean that the germans can not be critical of israel ? for germany , there can be no doubt about israel 's right to exist , but that does not mean we can not be critical of israeli policy , in particular when political leaders meet behind closed doors .
still , germany needs to tread carefully with regard to the israeli-palestinian conflict . was the arab-israeli conflict a part of your daily life in jerusalem or tel aviv ? no , even though i was there during two major suicide attacks in tel aviv in 2002 and 2003 .
this needs to be kept in perspective , though . israel is not the most dangerous place in the world , and most tourists would not even be aware of the presence of suicide bombers .
i 'm more afraid of driving at high speed on the german autobahns than living in israel . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : merkel laid a wreath during a march visit to the yad vashem memorial suicide bombers wo n't deter young germans from volunteering for asf , but what about scrapping military conscription and the civil alternative , which has been up for discussion for years now in germany ? it 's not a problem .
only one third of those who apply , get accepted into one of our programs abroad , simply because the funding is not there to provide more than 180 placements a year .
volunteers are mainly young people , but we 've got a sprinkling of older germans , too .
also , more than half of the volunteers are women , who do n't get drafted into military service anyway .
even among the young men , there are volunteers who are not necessarily doing this to fulfill their civic duty . i did this to avoid the bundeswehr and to fulfill my civic requirement , but as i see it now , i wound up gaining a year , not losing one on my career path as a lawyer .
whenever i go on interviews for jobs or internships , my year at asf has been a huge advantage for me .

since 1961 , action reconciliation has sent thousands of young germans to israel to volunteer in nursing homes , youth centers , hospitals and memorial sites .

other european countries , however , are stepping up the pressure . the european union had hoped a meeting of its foreign ministers in luxembourg would produce a green light for partnership talks with russia .
yet at the end of the meeting , it seemed unlikely that europe would be ready to begin talks at a summit in siberia planned for june .
" it is over for today , " luxembourg 's foreign minister jean asselborn told reporters as the eu foreign ministers ' talks ended on tuesday , april 29 .
" we are a bit blocked . "
lithuania was the main obstacle standing in the way of beginning partnership and cooperation agreement -lrb- pca -rrb- negotiations with russia .
the former soviet republic wanted russian assurances on energy supplies , judicial cooperation and regional security before agreeing to the talks .
the eu will try to push forward the partnership talks , which have been deadlocked for 18 months , at a meeting next week in brussels .
europe would like to have a mandate in place by a planned june summit with russia which will be held in siberia .
siberian summit cutting it close bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : lithuania had promised to block the talks lithuanian officials would not say whether they thought the june timeline remained possible .
" i do n't want to put any timeframe on the talks or the objectives , " lithuanian foreign minister petras vaitiekunas said .
" what is important is ... the quality of the objectives and the quality of the relations with russia . "
vilnius has a tense relationship with moscow .
lithuania objects to russia 's decision to shut-off of a pipeline supplying lithuania 's only oil refinery .
moscow has said a technical problem has led to the halt in energy deliveries .
lithuania is also unhappy about russia 's attitude toward judicial and international cooperation .
the baltic country also wants russia to change its stance on internal border conflicts in georgia and moldova .
russia has supported the territorial claims of breakaway republics in both countries .
europe eager for new energy policy bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the current eu-russia agreement was signed under yeltsin current relations between the eu and russia on issues ranging from energy to education are governed by a pca negotiated with the government of boris yeltsin in 1997 .
europe has found it difficult to negotiate a replacement agreement .
originally , it was poland that blocked talks to protest a russian import ban on polish meat and vegetable products .
the ban has since been lifted and poland agreed to the talks , leaving lithuania the only eu holdout .
any eu country can block negotiations with another country outside the bloc .
" of course , we share lithuania 's worries and the problems they listed , but we also see that it 's better to talk with the russians about all those problems to solve them , " estonian foreign minister urmas paet said .
most other 27 nations which make up the eu want a new agreement with energy-rich russia and have pressured lithuania to agree to the negotiations .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the eu is dependent on russian oil " there are very important interests -lsb- at stake -rsb- , " spanish secretary of state for european affairs diego lopez garrido said before the meeting , citing energy .
" it will be a long negotiation that should start as soon as possible . "
" we do believe that the eu should begin this process of a partnership and cooperation agreement , " added british europe minister jim murphy .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de kosovo -pipe- 30.04.2008 serbian nationalists reject signing of eu agreement as treason großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : this nationalist grafitti in belgrade reads : " eu ?
no , thanks " and " serbia - russia " serbian caretaker prime minister vojislav kostunica on wednesday , april 30 , dismissed the stabilization and association agreement with the european union as a " false document " which legalizes the secession of kosovo . " those who signed the tabilization and association agreement -lsb- saa -rsb- are fully responsible for it and they signed it in their own names and never in the name of serbia , " kostunica said in an interview with the daily vecernje novosti .
serbian president boris tadic and deputy prime minister bozidar djelic signed the saa , which legalizes the secession of serbia 's province of kosovo and is a precursor to eu membership talks , with the european union on tuesday , a move denounced by serbian nationalists as treason .
the nationalist majority in serbia heaped insults on the saa with the european union , calling its signing " lies and deceit , " " treason , " and " legally null and void . "
kostunica 's democratic party of serbia -lsb- dss -rsb- has said it will take legal action against the pro-europe bloc for signing the saa , while the ultra-nationalist opposition serbian radical party -lsb- srs -rsb- has said it will launch a case to remove tadic from office .
" without an saa there can be no possibility for a full integration of the western balkans into the european union , and without such integration there is no possibility for a final reconciliation amongst the people of the western balkans , " tadic said .
observers hope that the saa will boost the chances of the pro- european bloc , led by tadic , in snap parliamentary elections on may 11 .
rising nationalists challenge pro-europe parties bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : kostunica 's dss party and the radical party oppose the eu the latest surveys published wednesday showed that the anti- european bloc , led by the increasingly nationalist kostunica and ultra-nationalist opposition radical party , could win more seats in parliament than the pro-european parties .

other european countries , however , are stepping up the pressure . the european union had hoped a meeting of its foreign ministers in luxembourg would produce a green light for partnership talks with russia .
yet at the end of the meeting , it seemed unlikely that europe would be ready to begin talks at a summit in siberia planned for june .
" it is over for today , " luxembourg 's foreign minister jean asselborn told reporters as the eu foreign ministers ' talks ended on tuesday , april 29 .
" we are a bit blocked . "
lithuania was the main obstacle standing in the way of beginning partnership and cooperation agreement -lrb- pca -rrb- negotiations with russia .
the former soviet republic wanted russian assurances on energy supplies , judicial cooperation and regional security before agreeing to the talks .
the eu will try to push forward the partnership talks , which have been deadlocked for 18 months , at a meeting next week in brussels .
europe would like to have a mandate in place by a planned june summit with russia which will be held in siberia .
siberian summit cutting it close bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : lithuania had promised to block the talks lithuanian officials would not say whether they thought the june timeline remained possible .
" i do n't want to put any timeframe on the talks or the objectives , " lithuanian foreign minister petras vaitiekunas said .
" what is important is ... the quality of the objectives and the quality of the relations with russia . "
vilnius has a tense relationship with moscow .
lithuania objects to russia 's decision to shut-off of a pipeline supplying lithuania 's only oil refinery .
moscow has said a technical problem has led to the halt in energy deliveries .
lithuania is also unhappy about russia 's attitude toward judicial and international cooperation .
the baltic country also wants russia to change its stance on internal border conflicts in georgia and moldova .
russia has supported the territorial claims of breakaway republics in both countries .
europe eager for new energy policy bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the current eu-russia agreement was signed under yeltsin current relations between the eu and russia on issues ranging from energy to education are governed by a pca negotiated with the government of boris yeltsin in 1997 .
europe has found it difficult to negotiate a replacement agreement .
originally , it was poland that blocked talks to protest a russian import ban on polish meat and vegetable products .
the ban has since been lifted and poland agreed to the talks , leaving lithuania the only eu holdout .
any eu country can block negotiations with another country outside the bloc .
" of course , we share lithuania 's worries and the problems they listed , but we also see that it 's better to talk with the russians about all those problems to solve them , " estonian foreign minister urmas paet said .
most other 27 nations which make up the eu want a new agreement with energy-rich russia and have pressured lithuania to agree to the negotiations .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the eu is dependent on russian oil " there are very important interests -lsb- at stake -rsb- , " spanish secretary of state for european affairs diego lopez garrido said before the meeting , citing energy .
" it will be a long negotiation that should start as soon as possible . "
" we do believe that the eu should begin this process of a partnership and cooperation agreement , " added british europe minister jim murphy .

other european countries , however , are stepping up the pressure . the european union had hoped a meeting of its foreign ministers in luxembourg would produce a green light for partnership talks with russia .
yet at the end of the meeting , it seemed unlikely that europe would be ready to begin talks at a summit in siberia planned for june .
" it is over for today , " luxembourg 's foreign minister jean asselborn told reporters as the eu foreign ministers ' talks ended on tuesday , april 29 .
" we are a bit blocked . "
lithuania was the main obstacle standing in the way of beginning partnership and cooperation agreement -lrb- pca -rrb- negotiations with russia .
the former soviet republic wanted russian assurances on energy supplies , judicial cooperation and regional security before agreeing to the talks .
the eu will try to push forward the partnership talks , which have been deadlocked for 18 months , at a meeting next week in brussels .
europe would like to have a mandate in place by a planned june summit with russia which will be held in siberia .
siberian summit cutting it close bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : lithuania had promised to block the talks lithuanian officials would not say whether they thought the june timeline remained possible .
" i do n't want to put any timeframe on the talks or the objectives , " lithuanian foreign minister petras vaitiekunas said .
" what is important is ... the quality of the objectives and the quality of the relations with russia . "
vilnius has a tense relationship with moscow .
lithuania objects to russia 's decision to shut-off of a pipeline supplying lithuania 's only oil refinery .
moscow has said a technical problem has led to the halt in energy deliveries .
lithuania is also unhappy about russia 's attitude toward judicial and international cooperation .
the baltic country also wants russia to change its stance on internal border conflicts in georgia and moldova .
russia has supported the territorial claims of breakaway republics in both countries .
europe eager for new energy policy bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the current eu-russia agreement was signed under yeltsin current relations between the eu and russia on issues ranging from energy to education are governed by a pca negotiated with the government of boris yeltsin in 1997 .
europe has found it difficult to negotiate a replacement agreement .
originally , it was poland that blocked talks to protest a russian import ban on polish meat and vegetable products .
the ban has since been lifted and poland agreed to the talks , leaving lithuania the only eu holdout .
any eu country can block negotiations with another country outside the bloc .
" of course , we share lithuania 's worries and the problems they listed , but we also see that it 's better to talk with the russians about all those problems to solve them , " estonian foreign minister urmas paet said .
most other 27 nations which make up the eu want a new agreement with energy-rich russia and have pressured lithuania to agree to the negotiations .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the eu is dependent on russian oil " there are very important interests -lsb- at stake -rsb- , " spanish secretary of state for european affairs diego lopez garrido said before the meeting , citing energy .
" it will be a long negotiation that should start as soon as possible . "
" we do believe that the eu should begin this process of a partnership and cooperation agreement , " added british europe minister jim murphy .

an archive storing files on those persecuted and killed by the nazis officially opened in the german town of bad arolsen on wednesday , april 30 . the card index , which contains about 47 million documents containing the names of most concentration camp inmates , forced-labour victims and refugees left homeless after world war ii , had been the subject of an intense debate .
jewish groups had been pressing for open access to the collection , a storehouse of captured documents that began being assembled in 1946 . " most of the documents were drawn up by the nazis themselves , " said reto meister , the swiss red cross official now in charge of the files .
" we have documents here about a horrifyingly wide range of victims : jews and christians , eastern and western europeans , germans and non-germans , men and women .
there 's not one country where victims did not come from . " opening the archive bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the archive contains index cards on nazi victims .
previously , viewing the archive was limited only to survivors and close relations of the dead .
all of that changed last year , when the members of the 11-nation governing commission of the international tracing service of the international committee of the red cross agreed to provide greater access to the archives , ending a five-decade long debate over the victims ' rights to privacy . earlier this year , the archive opened to historians .
wednesday 's opening allows nearly anyone to search inside the archives , an especially important event for those friends and family members still searching for those unaccounted for after the war . meister also sees the files as the most potent answer to holocaust deniers : " anyone who wants to minimize the holocaust should come here .
we 'll show him documents by the million . " the " overwhelming scale " of the card index , meister said , was more persuasive than any debate . creating a digital archive in three capitals bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : yad vashem in jerusalem has received digital archives .
the its has also made digital copies of much of the archives and exported them to yad vashem memorial in jerusalem , the us holocaust memorial museum in washington and the national institute of remembrance in warsaw .
the images include both sides of 9 million incarceration documents , 21 million cards from its main name index and 3.5 million papers in its displaced persons index . another block of documents relating to forced labour will follow in the summer , bringing scanning to 70 percent of the paper documents .
the entire archival holdings are expected to be digitized by 2011 so that it can be mirrored in all three capitals . dw staff -lrb- cat -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

since 1961 , action reconciliation has sent thousands of young germans to israel to volunteer in nursing homes , youth centers , hospitals and memorial sites .
the grassroots work of this social action group became the basis of a political rapprochement between germany and israel , when diplomatic relations were established in 1965 .
today , germany is among israel 's most important allies and trading partners in europe . dw-world.de spoke to philipp pohlmann , 25 , who spent a year volunteering in israel .
today , he is a regional spokesman for the group in the cologne area . dw-world.de : how did you wind up joining asf ? philipp pohlmann : in germany , young men are conscripted into military service after they graduate from high school , generally between the ages of 16-20 , but most get out of it nowadays .
some are disqualified because of a minor physical disability , but those who get a clean bill of health , like i did , can opt to do community service instead .
the third possibility is to fulfill the civil service requirement abroad , which is what i chose to do . why did you specifically choose asf ? their focus on germany 's historic responsibility to jews living in israel and all over the world appealed to me .
i wanted personally to meet the last survivors of auschwitz or other camps . it is one thing to learn about the nazi period through textbooks , which is an obligatory part of the german school curriculum , but it 's another to learn about the past in a personal way . so the way the nazi period is taught in schools is too cut and dry ? bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : anne frank 's diary is often not part of the school curriculum .
yes .
everyone learns about the facts - that 6 million european jews perished in the holocaust , for example .
we know the names of all the death camps - auschwitz , treblinka - it 's all very impersonal .
we did n't even read the " diary of anne frank " in school .
i read it on my own . the nazi period is such an important and compelling part of the history of this country , but many teachers never inspire the pupils or stimulate real interest in the subject .
there are many germans and jews who are still alive to talk personally about this period .
why do n't teachers simply invite survivors to speak about their experiences in class ? perhaps teachers are still grappling with how to teach the subject .
is there perhaps a sense of collective guilt or discomfort in dealing with this period ? one thing is clear : anyone who was too young during the war or born after the war can not be guilty of anything , but still , it is very important to know about the history of one 's own country and , with that awareness , to ensure that the genocide does not happen again in the future .
we , young germans , have a responsibility to learn from our past . have you talked about the nationalist socialist period with your own grandparents ? not really .
by the time my interest in this subject was awakened , they were too old or dead .
my paternal grandfather is almost 100 years old now .
he was a clockmaker from silesia -lsb- part of the german reich that became part of poland after the war -rsb- .
as a soldier on the eastern front , he was captured by the russians in 1941 and held prisoner of war until 1949 .
my grandparents had no nazi sympathies , as far as i know , and i have never heard them utter one bad word about the jews . what did you do as a volunteer for asf in tel aviv ? bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : a church official in cologne hands over a cheque to asf 's philipp pohlmann -lrb- 3rd from right -rrb- as part of the program , i spent one year at a home for the elderly , helping them run daily errands or visit doctors .
we talked a lot and played gin rummy .
they even gave me hebrew lessons , so i 've gotten to the point that i am conversationally fluent now . how did these elderly israelis , some of whom were holocaust survivors , react to you as a german ? this project has been ongoing in israel for decades , so they are used to german volunteers .
many of the elderly happen to be german jews , who often revert back to their mother tongue as they get older , so they were delighted to speak german with me .
they were also very interested in what 's happening in germany .
some residents even subscribed to a local weekly paper in the german language .
jacob bar-or , a frankfurt native in his 80s , who was one of the prosecutors in the adolf eichmann case , even kept abreast of news in germany by reading the frankfurter allgemeine zeitung newspaper on a regular basis . i never encountered any hostility in israel .
the survivors themselves have no problem with me being german .
they know that i 'm in my 20s and had nothing to do with the holocaust .
if anyone had a problem , and this was rare , it was younger people , the grandchildren of holocaust victims , who perhaps never got to know their forebears . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : germany is israel 's best friend in europe .
israel 's peres with germany 's merkel -lrb- right -rrb- can relations between german and israel ever be fully normal ? no , but that is not necessarily a bad thing .
because of the holocaust , the relationship will always be a special one . the holocaust made claims to a jewish state a moral necessity , but does that mean that the germans can not be critical of israel ? for germany , there can be no doubt about israel 's right to exist , but that does not mean we can not be critical of israeli policy , in particular when political leaders meet behind closed doors .
still , germany needs to tread carefully with regard to the israeli-palestinian conflict . was the arab-israeli conflict a part of your daily life in jerusalem or tel aviv ? no , even though i was there during two major suicide attacks in tel aviv in 2002 and 2003 .
this needs to be kept in perspective , though . israel is not the most dangerous place in the world , and most tourists would not even be aware of the presence of suicide bombers .
i 'm more afraid of driving at high speed on the german autobahns than living in israel . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : merkel laid a wreath during a march visit to the yad vashem memorial suicide bombers wo n't deter young germans from volunteering for asf , but what about scrapping military conscription and the civil alternative , which has been up for discussion for years now in germany ? it 's not a problem .
only one third of those who apply , get accepted into one of our programs abroad , simply because the funding is not there to provide more than 180 placements a year .
volunteers are mainly young people , but we 've got a sprinkling of older germans , too .
also , more than half of the volunteers are women , who do n't get drafted into military service anyway .
even among the young men , there are volunteers who are not necessarily doing this to fulfill their civic duty . i did this to avoid the bundeswehr and to fulfill my civic requirement , but as i see it now , i wound up gaining a year , not losing one on my career path as a lawyer .
whenever i go on interviews for jobs or internships , my year at asf has been a huge advantage for me .
every recruiter has asked me about the time i spent in israel . interview : diana fong send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

one child had died . " astonishing " reunion austrian authorities said on tuesday , april 29 that members of the family terrorized by decades of incest and imprisonment had an “ astonishing ” reunion at a clinic , where psychiatrists are helping them cope . hospital officials said most of the seven children fritzl fathered over the past 24 years with the daughter he held captive in a windowless cell spent their first moments together sunday , april 27 - a day after those kept confined finally gained their freedom . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the case is a challenge for the mostviertel mental clinic clinic director berthold kepplinger told reporters tuesday the meeting also reunited the suspect 's wife with the daughter fritzl had led her to believe left home to join a religious cult , but instead was imprisoned in a cramped warren of secured and soundproofed cellar rooms . fritzl was remanded to court custody on tuesday .
meanwhile , investigators are looking into suspicions that fritzl may have had help in caring for and keeping secret the presence of a family living hidden in his basement . report claims son had cellar key a report by the women ’ s magazine brigitte has uncovered a claim that fritzl ’ s son and elisabeth ’ s brother , thomas , had a key to the cellar .
a couple who rented an upstairs room in the house , in the austrian town of amstetten , said that thomas called himself the house “ superintendent ” and made regular trips to the cellar to get things for minor repairs . the couple said they themselves were not allowed near the cellar , and were not allowed to rent a cellar storage room , although that his common practice in austria . police are also taking into account the fact that fritzl had made several trips to thailand , and are looking into how the captive family may have gotten food and other goods while he was away . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : investigators uncovered tiny hideaway authorities have also raised the question of who may have helped the man build a cellar that includes a 300 kilogram steel and cement door .
fritzl was given permission to build the cellar as a bomb shelter in the late 1970s . since the case came to light , fritzl ’ s 42 year old daughter , elisabeth , and her children have been carefully shielded from public glare , undergoing psychiatric counselling to help them try to adjust after their unimaginable ordeal . cult cover-story for adoptive " grandkids " fritzl had told his wife that their daughter had run away to join a cult .
in reality she was locked underground in the 60 square meter -lrb- 650 square feet -rrb- underground rooms . mother and daughter were reunited this week for the first time in a quarter century . fritzl explained the presence of three of the grandchildren whom he adopted to his wife and to the community by claiming elisabeth had given birth to them at the cult , and then delivered them to his doorstep for the older couple to care for . three other children – aged 19 , 18 and 5 - lived belowground with their mother in the cell .
they first saw daylight when they were rescued . daughter 's illness leads to family 's release one child , a twin , had died shortly after birth .
fritzl has admitted to burning the corpse in the house ’ s boiler . the decision on which children lived aboveground and which below depended on whether they were “ screaming babies ” and on their general halth , explained chief inspector leopold etz from the lower austrian criminal investigators office . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : a bathroom in the shocking home-prison the case came to light because one of the children , 19 year old kerstin , was severely ill .
her “ grandfather ” brought the child to the hospital , which started a search for the child ’ s mother in the hopes of finding out her medical history .
they televised an urgent call elisabeth to come back and save the daughter ’ s life . elisabeth saw the call on television , and was able to convince her father to let her go to the hospital .
she seized the chance to speak privately to a doctor and explain her situation .
fritzl was arrested the same day . fritzl ’ s admission that he burned the body of the dead seventh child could prove pivotal when the case comes to trial , with a prosecutor saying he would face a life sentence if found guilty of manslaughter , as opposed to shorter prison terms for rape or incarceration . psychologist paulus hochgatterer , who is helping advise those counselling the family , told afp news service that the three children fritzl had kept underground are staying in a sequestered treatment container that could be locked from the inside . slow road to recovery ? safely shielded from the media circus that has set up camp in amstetten , he said their initial treatment could take several weeks . " only very gradually are they being exposed to the outside world , " hochgatterer said , adding that " given the circumstances , they 're actually doing quite well . " the two sets of children are now tentatively beginning to get to know one another .
the youngest child , five years old , seems most able to adapt to his new life , his caretakers said . experts said the family is likely to need years of therapy . " it could take between five and eight years , " said max friedrich , the psychiatrist who looked after another sequestration victim , natascha kampusch , in an interview with the daily oesterreich . the head of the local social services , hans-heinz lenze , said a name-change had been suggested for the immediate victims , but fritzl 's other family as well , in order to give them a new start in life . long-term investigation expected " at the moment , all possibilities are being sounded out in closest consultation with the family .
but a decision will only be reached in the coming weeks , " lenze told a news conference on tuesday . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : can officials look to the kampusch case for help ?
chief investigator franz polzer told austrian television that police might need " half a year " to complete their investigations .
he ruled out any suggestion fritzl might have had an accomplice . " as our investigations now stand , there were no accomplices .
but you can never be 100 percent certain . " doctors would determine when police would be allowed to question elisabeth fritzl and the children , but that was unlikely to be for several days . fritzl had officially adopted the three aboveground children , after showing authorities letters signed by elizabeth that said she could not care for them , and which asked that they try not to track her down for the sake of herself and her children . fritzl was allowed to adopt despite a reported conviction of attempted rape in the 1960s and of arson , but the records were wiped after a period of time set by austrian law . the district court in amstetten , which had greenlighted the adoptions , said it had followed protocol in the adoption proceedings and had had acted correctly . no sign of wife 's complicity " there were n't any doubts about his -lrb- fritzl 's -rrb- integrity .
why should i put the child in a foster home , when it could grow up in a family , " court president josef schoegl told the austria press agency . chief police investigator franz polzer said there was no sign that fritzl 's wife , who also had seven children with him , knew of the goings on in his locked dungeon . in the town of amstetten , more than 200 people including dozens of youngsters quietly held a candlelight vigil in the main square late tuesday , as the town of 23,000 sought to cast off the notoriety brought to their doorstep by fritzl . shocked residents react " shock , sadness , rage and perhaps also hatred have gripped us these last few days , " pastor peter boesendorfer told those gathered . " we must acknowledge that there is something in our town that we can not comprehend , " he said , calling on residents " to help and show solidarity so that a life will be possible " for the bewildered children and their scarred mother . amstetten mayor herbert katzengruber told the austrian news agency apa : " we want to show that amstetten is not a town for criminals .

an archive storing files on those persecuted and killed by the nazis officially opened in the german town of bad arolsen on wednesday , april 30 . the card index , which contains about 47 million documents containing the names of most concentration camp inmates , forced-labour victims and refugees left homeless after world war ii , had been the subject of an intense debate .
jewish groups had been pressing for open access to the collection , a storehouse of captured documents that began being assembled in 1946 . " most of the documents were drawn up by the nazis themselves , " said reto meister , the swiss red cross official now in charge of the files .

previously , viewing the archive was limited only to survivors and close relations of the dead .
all of that changed last year , when the members of the 11-nation governing commission of the international tracing service of the international committee of the red cross agreed to provide greater access to the archives , ending a five-decade long debate over the victims ' rights to privacy . earlier this year , the archive opened to historians .
wednesday 's opening allows nearly anyone to search inside the archives , an especially important event for those friends and family members still searching for those unaccounted for after the war . meister also sees the files as the most potent answer to holocaust deniers : " anyone who wants to minimize the holocaust should come here .

since 1961 , action reconciliation has sent thousands of young germans to israel to volunteer in nursing homes , youth centers , hospitals and memorial sites .
the grassroots work of this social action group became the basis of a political rapprochement between germany and israel , when diplomatic relations were established in 1965 .
today , germany is among israel 's most important allies and trading partners in europe . dw-world.de spoke to philipp pohlmann , 25 , who spent a year volunteering in israel .
today , he is a regional spokesman for the group in the cologne area . dw-world.de : how did you wind up joining asf ? philipp pohlmann : in germany , young men are conscripted into military service after they graduate from high school , generally between the ages of 16-20 , but most get out of it nowadays .
some are disqualified because of a minor physical disability , but those who get a clean bill of health , like i did , can opt to do community service instead .
the third possibility is to fulfill the civil service requirement abroad , which is what i chose to do . why did you specifically choose asf ? their focus on germany 's historic responsibility to jews living in israel and all over the world appealed to me .
i wanted personally to meet the last survivors of auschwitz or other camps . it is one thing to learn about the nazi period through textbooks , which is an obligatory part of the german school curriculum , but it 's another to learn about the past in a personal way . so the way the nazi period is taught in schools is too cut and dry ? bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : anne frank 's diary is often not part of the school curriculum .
yes .
everyone learns about the facts - that 6 million european jews perished in the holocaust , for example .
we know the names of all the death camps - auschwitz , treblinka - it 's all very impersonal .
we did n't even read the " diary of anne frank " in school .
i read it on my own . the nazi period is such an important and compelling part of the history of this country , but many teachers never inspire the pupils or stimulate real interest in the subject .
there are many germans and jews who are still alive to talk personally about this period .
why do n't teachers simply invite survivors to speak about their experiences in class ? perhaps teachers are still grappling with how to teach the subject .
is there perhaps a sense of collective guilt or discomfort in dealing with this period ? one thing is clear : anyone who was too young during the war or born after the war can not be guilty of anything , but still , it is very important to know about the history of one 's own country and , with that awareness , to ensure that the genocide does not happen again in the future .
we , young germans , have a responsibility to learn from our past . have you talked about the nationalist socialist period with your own grandparents ? not really .
by the time my interest in this subject was awakened , they were too old or dead .
my paternal grandfather is almost 100 years old now .
he was a clockmaker from silesia -lsb- part of the german reich that became part of poland after the war -rsb- .
as a soldier on the eastern front , he was captured by the russians in 1941 and held prisoner of war until 1949 .
my grandparents had no nazi sympathies , as far as i know , and i have never heard them utter one bad word about the jews . what did you do as a volunteer for asf in tel aviv ? bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : a church official in cologne hands over a cheque to asf 's philipp pohlmann -lrb- 3rd from right -rrb- as part of the program , i spent one year at a home for the elderly , helping them run daily errands or visit doctors .
we talked a lot and played gin rummy .
they even gave me hebrew lessons , so i 've gotten to the point that i am conversationally fluent now . how did these elderly israelis , some of whom were holocaust survivors , react to you as a german ? this project has been ongoing in israel for decades , so they are used to german volunteers .
many of the elderly happen to be german jews , who often revert back to their mother tongue as they get older , so they were delighted to speak german with me .
they were also very interested in what 's happening in germany .
some residents even subscribed to a local weekly paper in the german language .
jacob bar-or , a frankfurt native in his 80s , who was one of the prosecutors in the adolf eichmann case , even kept abreast of news in germany by reading the frankfurter allgemeine zeitung newspaper on a regular basis . i never encountered any hostility in israel .
the survivors themselves have no problem with me being german .
they know that i 'm in my 20s and had nothing to do with the holocaust .
if anyone had a problem , and this was rare , it was younger people , the grandchildren of holocaust victims , who perhaps never got to know their forebears . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : germany is israel 's best friend in europe .
israel 's peres with germany 's merkel -lrb- right -rrb- can relations between german and israel ever be fully normal ? no , but that is not necessarily a bad thing .
because of the holocaust , the relationship will always be a special one . the holocaust made claims to a jewish state a moral necessity , but does that mean that the germans can not be critical of israel ? for germany , there can be no doubt about israel 's right to exist , but that does not mean we can not be critical of israeli policy , in particular when political leaders meet behind closed doors .
still , germany needs to tread carefully with regard to the israeli-palestinian conflict . was the arab-israeli conflict a part of your daily life in jerusalem or tel aviv ? no , even though i was there during two major suicide attacks in tel aviv in 2002 and 2003 .
this needs to be kept in perspective , though . israel is not the most dangerous place in the world , and most tourists would not even be aware of the presence of suicide bombers .
i 'm more afraid of driving at high speed on the german autobahns than living in israel . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : merkel laid a wreath during a march visit to the yad vashem memorial suicide bombers wo n't deter young germans from volunteering for asf , but what about scrapping military conscription and the civil alternative , which has been up for discussion for years now in germany ? it 's not a problem .
only one third of those who apply , get accepted into one of our programs abroad , simply because the funding is not there to provide more than 180 placements a year .
volunteers are mainly young people , but we 've got a sprinkling of older germans , too .
also , more than half of the volunteers are women , who do n't get drafted into military service anyway .
even among the young men , there are volunteers who are not necessarily doing this to fulfill their civic duty . i did this to avoid the bundeswehr and to fulfill my civic requirement , but as i see it now , i wound up gaining a year , not losing one on my career path as a lawyer .
whenever i go on interviews for jobs or internships , my year at asf has been a huge advantage for me .
every recruiter has asked me about the time i spent in israel . interview : diana fong send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

jacob bar-or , a frankfurt native in his 80s , who was one of the prosecutors in the adolf eichmann case , even kept abreast of news in germany by reading the frankfurter allgemeine zeitung newspaper on a regular basis . i never encountered any hostility in israel .
the survivors themselves have no problem with me being german .
they know that i 'm in my 20s and had nothing to do with the holocaust .
if anyone had a problem , and this was rare , it was younger people , the grandchildren of holocaust victims , who perhaps never got to know their forebears . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : germany is israel 's best friend in europe .
israel 's peres with germany 's merkel -lrb- right -rrb- can relations between german and israel ever be fully normal ? no , but that is not necessarily a bad thing .
because of the holocaust , the relationship will always be a special one . the holocaust made claims to a jewish state a moral necessity , but does that mean that the germans can not be critical of israel ? for germany , there can be no doubt about israel 's right to exist , but that does not mean we can not be critical of israeli policy , in particular when political leaders meet behind closed doors .
still , germany needs to tread carefully with regard to the israeli-palestinian conflict . was the arab-israeli conflict a part of your daily life in jerusalem or tel aviv ? no , even though i was there during two major suicide attacks in tel aviv in 2002 and 2003 .
this needs to be kept in perspective , though . israel is not the most dangerous place in the world , and most tourists would not even be aware of the presence of suicide bombers .
i 'm more afraid of driving at high speed on the german autobahns than living in israel . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : merkel laid a wreath during a march visit to the yad vashem memorial suicide bombers wo n't deter young germans from volunteering for asf , but what about scrapping military conscription and the civil alternative , which has been up for discussion for years now in germany ? it 's not a problem .
only one third of those who apply , get accepted into one of our programs abroad , simply because the funding is not there to provide more than 180 placements a year .
volunteers are mainly young people , but we 've got a sprinkling of older germans , too .
also , more than half of the volunteers are women , who do n't get drafted into military service anyway .
even among the young men , there are volunteers who are not necessarily doing this to fulfill their civic duty . i did this to avoid the bundeswehr and to fulfill my civic requirement , but as i see it now , i wound up gaining a year , not losing one on my career path as a lawyer .
whenever i go on interviews for jobs or internships , my year at asf has been a huge advantage for me .
every recruiter has asked me about the time i spent in israel . interview : diana fong send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

other european countries , however , are stepping up the pressure . the european union had hoped a meeting of its foreign ministers in luxembourg would produce a green light for partnership talks with russia .
yet at the end of the meeting , it seemed unlikely that europe would be ready to begin talks at a summit in siberia planned for june .
" it is over for today , " luxembourg 's foreign minister jean asselborn told reporters as the eu foreign ministers ' talks ended on tuesday , april 29 .
" we are a bit blocked . "
lithuania was the main obstacle standing in the way of beginning partnership and cooperation agreement -lrb- pca -rrb- negotiations with russia .
the former soviet republic wanted russian assurances on energy supplies , judicial cooperation and regional security before agreeing to the talks .
the eu will try to push forward the partnership talks , which have been deadlocked for 18 months , at a meeting next week in brussels .
europe would like to have a mandate in place by a planned june summit with russia which will be held in siberia .
siberian summit cutting it close bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : lithuania had promised to block the talks lithuanian officials would not say whether they thought the june timeline remained possible .
" i do n't want to put any timeframe on the talks or the objectives , " lithuanian foreign minister petras vaitiekunas said .
" what is important is ... the quality of the objectives and the quality of the relations with russia . "
vilnius has a tense relationship with moscow .
lithuania objects to russia 's decision to shut-off of a pipeline supplying lithuania 's only oil refinery .
moscow has said a technical problem has led to the halt in energy deliveries .
lithuania is also unhappy about russia 's attitude toward judicial and international cooperation .
the baltic country also wants russia to change its stance on internal border conflicts in georgia and moldova .
russia has supported the territorial claims of breakaway republics in both countries .
europe eager for new energy policy bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the current eu-russia agreement was signed under yeltsin current relations between the eu and russia on issues ranging from energy to education are governed by a pca negotiated with the government of boris yeltsin in 1997 .
europe has found it difficult to negotiate a replacement agreement .
originally , it was poland that blocked talks to protest a russian import ban on polish meat and vegetable products .
the ban has since been lifted and poland agreed to the talks , leaving lithuania the only eu holdout .
any eu country can block negotiations with another country outside the bloc .
" of course , we share lithuania 's worries and the problems they listed , but we also see that it 's better to talk with the russians about all those problems to solve them , " estonian foreign minister urmas paet said .
most other 27 nations which make up the eu want a new agreement with energy-rich russia and have pressured lithuania to agree to the negotiations .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the eu is dependent on russian oil " there are very important interests -lsb- at stake -rsb- , " spanish secretary of state for european affairs diego lopez garrido said before the meeting , citing energy .
" it will be a long negotiation that should start as soon as possible . "
" we do believe that the eu should begin this process of a partnership and cooperation agreement , " added british europe minister jim murphy .

the move stoked tensions with the former soviet republic and drew criticism from the eu . an undefined number of russian soldiers were sent to the caucasus territories on tuesday after moscow accused georgia of massing troops on the border to abkhazia and acquiring a large number of offensive weapons .

other european countries , however , are stepping up the pressure . the european union had hoped a meeting of its foreign ministers in luxembourg would produce a green light for partnership talks with russia .
yet at the end of the meeting , it seemed unlikely that europe would be ready to begin talks at a summit in siberia planned for june .
" it is over for today , " luxembourg 's foreign minister jean asselborn told reporters as the eu foreign ministers ' talks ended on tuesday , april 29 .
" we are a bit blocked . "
lithuania was the main obstacle standing in the way of beginning partnership and cooperation agreement -lrb- pca -rrb- negotiations with russia .
the former soviet republic wanted russian assurances on energy supplies , judicial cooperation and regional security before agreeing to the talks .
the eu will try to push forward the partnership talks , which have been deadlocked for 18 months , at a meeting next week in brussels .
europe would like to have a mandate in place by a planned june summit with russia which will be held in siberia .
siberian summit cutting it close bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : lithuania had promised to block the talks lithuanian officials would not say whether they thought the june timeline remained possible .
" i do n't want to put any timeframe on the talks or the objectives , " lithuanian foreign minister petras vaitiekunas said .
" what is important is ... the quality of the objectives and the quality of the relations with russia . "
vilnius has a tense relationship with moscow .
lithuania objects to russia 's decision to shut-off of a pipeline supplying lithuania 's only oil refinery .
moscow has said a technical problem has led to the halt in energy deliveries .
lithuania is also unhappy about russia 's attitude toward judicial and international cooperation .
the baltic country also wants russia to change its stance on internal border conflicts in georgia and moldova .
russia has supported the territorial claims of breakaway republics in both countries .
europe eager for new energy policy bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the current eu-russia agreement was signed under yeltsin current relations between the eu and russia on issues ranging from energy to education are governed by a pca negotiated with the government of boris yeltsin in 1997 .
europe has found it difficult to negotiate a replacement agreement .
originally , it was poland that blocked talks to protest a russian import ban on polish meat and vegetable products .
the ban has since been lifted and poland agreed to the talks , leaving lithuania the only eu holdout .
any eu country can block negotiations with another country outside the bloc .
" of course , we share lithuania 's worries and the problems they listed , but we also see that it 's better to talk with the russians about all those problems to solve them , " estonian foreign minister urmas paet said .
most other 27 nations which make up the eu want a new agreement with energy-rich russia and have pressured lithuania to agree to the negotiations .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the eu is dependent on russian oil " there are very important interests -lsb- at stake -rsb- , " spanish secretary of state for european affairs diego lopez garrido said before the meeting , citing energy .
" it will be a long negotiation that should start as soon as possible . "
" we do believe that the eu should begin this process of a partnership and cooperation agreement , " added british europe minister jim murphy .

one child had died . " astonishing " reunion austrian authorities said on tuesday , april 29 that members of the family terrorized by decades of incest and imprisonment had an “ astonishing ” reunion at a clinic , where psychiatrists are helping them cope . hospital officials said most of the seven children fritzl fathered over the past 24 years with the daughter he held captive in a windowless cell spent their first moments together sunday , april 27 - a day after those kept confined finally gained their freedom . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the case is a challenge for the mostviertel mental clinic clinic director berthold kepplinger told reporters tuesday the meeting also reunited the suspect 's wife with the daughter fritzl had led her to believe left home to join a religious cult , but instead was imprisoned in a cramped warren of secured and soundproofed cellar rooms . fritzl was remanded to court custody on tuesday .
meanwhile , investigators are looking into suspicions that fritzl may have had help in caring for and keeping secret the presence of a family living hidden in his basement . report claims son had cellar key a report by the women ’ s magazine brigitte has uncovered a claim that fritzl ’ s son and elisabeth ’ s brother , thomas , had a key to the cellar .
a couple who rented an upstairs room in the house , in the austrian town of amstetten , said that thomas called himself the house “ superintendent ” and made regular trips to the cellar to get things for minor repairs . the couple said they themselves were not allowed near the cellar , and were not allowed to rent a cellar storage room , although that his common practice in austria . police are also taking into account the fact that fritzl had made several trips to thailand , and are looking into how the captive family may have gotten food and other goods while he was away . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : investigators uncovered tiny hideaway authorities have also raised the question of who may have helped the man build a cellar that includes a 300 kilogram steel and cement door .
fritzl was given permission to build the cellar as a bomb shelter in the late 1970s . since the case came to light , fritzl ’ s 42 year old daughter , elisabeth , and her children have been carefully shielded from public glare , undergoing psychiatric counselling to help them try to adjust after their unimaginable ordeal . cult cover-story for adoptive " grandkids " fritzl had told his wife that their daughter had run away to join a cult .
in reality she was locked underground in the 60 square meter -lrb- 650 square feet -rrb- underground rooms . mother and daughter were reunited this week for the first time in a quarter century . fritzl explained the presence of three of the grandchildren whom he adopted to his wife and to the community by claiming elisabeth had given birth to them at the cult , and then delivered them to his doorstep for the older couple to care for . three other children – aged 19 , 18 and 5 - lived belowground with their mother in the cell .
they first saw daylight when they were rescued . daughter 's illness leads to family 's release one child , a twin , had died shortly after birth .
fritzl has admitted to burning the corpse in the house ’ s boiler . the decision on which children lived aboveground and which below depended on whether they were “ screaming babies ” and on their general halth , explained chief inspector leopold etz from the lower austrian criminal investigators office . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : a bathroom in the shocking home-prison the case came to light because one of the children , 19 year old kerstin , was severely ill .
her “ grandfather ” brought the child to the hospital , which started a search for the child ’ s mother in the hopes of finding out her medical history .
they televised an urgent call elisabeth to come back and save the daughter ’ s life . elisabeth saw the call on television , and was able to convince her father to let her go to the hospital .
she seized the chance to speak privately to a doctor and explain her situation .
fritzl was arrested the same day . fritzl ’ s admission that he burned the body of the dead seventh child could prove pivotal when the case comes to trial , with a prosecutor saying he would face a life sentence if found guilty of manslaughter , as opposed to shorter prison terms for rape or incarceration . psychologist paulus hochgatterer , who is helping advise those counselling the family , told afp news service that the three children fritzl had kept underground are staying in a sequestered treatment container that could be locked from the inside . slow road to recovery ? safely shielded from the media circus that has set up camp in amstetten , he said their initial treatment could take several weeks . " only very gradually are they being exposed to the outside world , " hochgatterer said , adding that " given the circumstances , they 're actually doing quite well . " the two sets of children are now tentatively beginning to get to know one another .
the youngest child , five years old , seems most able to adapt to his new life , his caretakers said . experts said the family is likely to need years of therapy . " it could take between five and eight years , " said max friedrich , the psychiatrist who looked after another sequestration victim , natascha kampusch , in an interview with the daily oesterreich . the head of the local social services , hans-heinz lenze , said a name-change had been suggested for the immediate victims , but fritzl 's other family as well , in order to give them a new start in life . long-term investigation expected " at the moment , all possibilities are being sounded out in closest consultation with the family .
but a decision will only be reached in the coming weeks , " lenze told a news conference on tuesday . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : can officials look to the kampusch case for help ?
chief investigator franz polzer told austrian television that police might need " half a year " to complete their investigations .
he ruled out any suggestion fritzl might have had an accomplice . " as our investigations now stand , there were no accomplices .
but you can never be 100 percent certain . " doctors would determine when police would be allowed to question elisabeth fritzl and the children , but that was unlikely to be for several days . fritzl had officially adopted the three aboveground children , after showing authorities letters signed by elizabeth that said she could not care for them , and which asked that they try not to track her down for the sake of herself and her children . fritzl was allowed to adopt despite a reported conviction of attempted rape in the 1960s and of arson , but the records were wiped after a period of time set by austrian law . the district court in amstetten , which had greenlighted the adoptions , said it had followed protocol in the adoption proceedings and had had acted correctly . no sign of wife 's complicity " there were n't any doubts about his -lrb- fritzl 's -rrb- integrity .
why should i put the child in a foster home , when it could grow up in a family , " court president josef schoegl told the austria press agency . chief police investigator franz polzer said there was no sign that fritzl 's wife , who also had seven children with him , knew of the goings on in his locked dungeon . in the town of amstetten , more than 200 people including dozens of youngsters quietly held a candlelight vigil in the main square late tuesday , as the town of 23,000 sought to cast off the notoriety brought to their doorstep by fritzl . shocked residents react " shock , sadness , rage and perhaps also hatred have gripped us these last few days , " pastor peter boesendorfer told those gathered . " we must acknowledge that there is something in our town that we can not comprehend , " he said , calling on residents " to help and show solidarity so that a life will be possible " for the bewildered children and their scarred mother . amstetten mayor herbert katzengruber told the austrian news agency apa : " we want to show that amstetten is not a town for criminals .
but it 's mostly about showing solidarity and help to the victims .

an archive storing files on those persecuted and killed by the nazis officially opened in the german town of bad arolsen on wednesday , april 30 . the card index , which contains about 47 million documents containing the names of most concentration camp inmates , forced-labour victims and refugees left homeless after world war ii , had been the subject of an intense debate .
jewish groups had been pressing for open access to the collection , a storehouse of captured documents that began being assembled in 1946 . " most of the documents were drawn up by the nazis themselves , " said reto meister , the swiss red cross official now in charge of the files .
" we have documents here about a horrifyingly wide range of victims : jews and christians , eastern and western europeans , germans and non-germans , men and women .
there 's not one country where victims did not come from . " opening the archive bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the archive contains index cards on nazi victims .
previously , viewing the archive was limited only to survivors and close relations of the dead .
all of that changed last year , when the members of the 11-nation governing commission of the international tracing service of the international committee of the red cross agreed to provide greater access to the archives , ending a five-decade long debate over the victims ' rights to privacy . earlier this year , the archive opened to historians .
wednesday 's opening allows nearly anyone to search inside the archives , an especially important event for those friends and family members still searching for those unaccounted for after the war . meister also sees the files as the most potent answer to holocaust deniers : " anyone who wants to minimize the holocaust should come here .
we 'll show him documents by the million . " the " overwhelming scale " of the card index , meister said , was more persuasive than any debate . creating a digital archive in three capitals bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : yad vashem in jerusalem has received digital archives .
the its has also made digital copies of much of the archives and exported them to yad vashem memorial in jerusalem , the us holocaust memorial museum in washington and the national institute of remembrance in warsaw .
the images include both sides of 9 million incarceration documents , 21 million cards from its main name index and 3.5 million papers in its displaced persons index . another block of documents relating to forced labour will follow in the summer , bringing scanning to 70 percent of the paper documents .
the entire archival holdings are expected to be digitized by 2011 so that it can be mirrored in all three capitals . dw staff -lrb- cat -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

an archive storing files on those persecuted and killed by the nazis officially opened in the german town of bad arolsen on wednesday , april 30 . the card index , which contains about 47 million documents containing the names of most concentration camp inmates , forced-labour victims and refugees left homeless after world war ii , had been the subject of an intense debate .
jewish groups had been pressing for open access to the collection , a storehouse of captured documents that began being assembled in 1946 . " most of the documents were drawn up by the nazis themselves , " said reto meister , the swiss red cross official now in charge of the files .
" we have documents here about a horrifyingly wide range of victims : jews and christians , eastern and western europeans , germans and non-germans , men and women .
there 's not one country where victims did not come from . " opening the archive bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the archive contains index cards on nazi victims .
previously , viewing the archive was limited only to survivors and close relations of the dead .
all of that changed last year , when the members of the 11-nation governing commission of the international tracing service of the international committee of the red cross agreed to provide greater access to the archives , ending a five-decade long debate over the victims ' rights to privacy . earlier this year , the archive opened to historians .
wednesday 's opening allows nearly anyone to search inside the archives , an especially important event for those friends and family members still searching for those unaccounted for after the war . meister also sees the files as the most potent answer to holocaust deniers : " anyone who wants to minimize the holocaust should come here .
we 'll show him documents by the million . " the " overwhelming scale " of the card index , meister said , was more persuasive than any debate . creating a digital archive in three capitals bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : yad vashem in jerusalem has received digital archives .
the its has also made digital copies of much of the archives and exported them to yad vashem memorial in jerusalem , the us holocaust memorial museum in washington and the national institute of remembrance in warsaw .
the images include both sides of 9 million incarceration documents , 21 million cards from its main name index and 3.5 million papers in its displaced persons index . another block of documents relating to forced labour will follow in the summer , bringing scanning to 70 percent of the paper documents .
the entire archival holdings are expected to be digitized by 2011 so that it can be mirrored in all three capitals . dw staff -lrb- cat -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

since 1961 , action reconciliation has sent thousands of young germans to israel to volunteer in nursing homes , youth centers , hospitals and memorial sites .
the grassroots work of this social action group became the basis of a political rapprochement between germany and israel , when diplomatic relations were established in 1965 .
today , germany is among israel 's most important allies and trading partners in europe . dw-world.de spoke to philipp pohlmann , 25 , who spent a year volunteering in israel .
today , he is a regional spokesman for the group in the cologne area . dw-world.de : how did you wind up joining asf ? philipp pohlmann : in germany , young men are conscripted into military service after they graduate from high school , generally between the ages of 16-20 , but most get out of it nowadays .
some are disqualified because of a minor physical disability , but those who get a clean bill of health , like i did , can opt to do community service instead .
the third possibility is to fulfill the civil service requirement abroad , which is what i chose to do . why did you specifically choose asf ? their focus on germany 's historic responsibility to jews living in israel and all over the world appealed to me .
i wanted personally to meet the last survivors of auschwitz or other camps . it is one thing to learn about the nazi period through textbooks , which is an obligatory part of the german school curriculum , but it 's another to learn about the past in a personal way . so the way the nazi period is taught in schools is too cut and dry ? bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : anne frank 's diary is often not part of the school curriculum .
yes .
everyone learns about the facts - that 6 million european jews perished in the holocaust , for example .
we know the names of all the death camps - auschwitz , treblinka - it 's all very impersonal .
we did n't even read the " diary of anne frank " in school .
i read it on my own . the nazi period is such an important and compelling part of the history of this country , but many teachers never inspire the pupils or stimulate real interest in the subject .
there are many germans and jews who are still alive to talk personally about this period .
why do n't teachers simply invite survivors to speak about their experiences in class ? perhaps teachers are still grappling with how to teach the subject .
is there perhaps a sense of collective guilt or discomfort in dealing with this period ? one thing is clear : anyone who was too young during the war or born after the war can not be guilty of anything , but still , it is very important to know about the history of one 's own country and , with that awareness , to ensure that the genocide does not happen again in the future .
we , young germans , have a responsibility to learn from our past . have you talked about the nationalist socialist period with your own grandparents ? not really .
by the time my interest in this subject was awakened , they were too old or dead .
my paternal grandfather is almost 100 years old now .
he was a clockmaker from silesia -lsb- part of the german reich that became part of poland after the war -rsb- .
as a soldier on the eastern front , he was captured by the russians in 1941 and held prisoner of war until 1949 .
my grandparents had no nazi sympathies , as far as i know , and i have never heard them utter one bad word about the jews . what did you do as a volunteer for asf in tel aviv ? bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : a church official in cologne hands over a cheque to asf 's philipp pohlmann -lrb- 3rd from right -rrb- as part of the program , i spent one year at a home for the elderly , helping them run daily errands or visit doctors .
we talked a lot and played gin rummy .
they even gave me hebrew lessons , so i 've gotten to the point that i am conversationally fluent now . how did these elderly israelis , some of whom were holocaust survivors , react to you as a german ? this project has been ongoing in israel for decades , so they are used to german volunteers .
many of the elderly happen to be german jews , who often revert back to their mother tongue as they get older , so they were delighted to speak german with me .
they were also very interested in what 's happening in germany .
some residents even subscribed to a local weekly paper in the german language .
jacob bar-or , a frankfurt native in his 80s , who was one of the prosecutors in the adolf eichmann case , even kept abreast of news in germany by reading the frankfurter allgemeine zeitung newspaper on a regular basis . i never encountered any hostility in israel .
the survivors themselves have no problem with me being german .
they know that i 'm in my 20s and had nothing to do with the holocaust .
if anyone had a problem , and this was rare , it was younger people , the grandchildren of holocaust victims , who perhaps never got to know their forebears . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : germany is israel 's best friend in europe .
israel 's peres with germany 's merkel -lrb- right -rrb- can relations between german and israel ever be fully normal ? no , but that is not necessarily a bad thing .
because of the holocaust , the relationship will always be a special one . the holocaust made claims to a jewish state a moral necessity , but does that mean that the germans can not be critical of israel ? for germany , there can be no doubt about israel 's right to exist , but that does not mean we can not be critical of israeli policy , in particular when political leaders meet behind closed doors .
still , germany needs to tread carefully with regard to the israeli-palestinian conflict . was the arab-israeli conflict a part of your daily life in jerusalem or tel aviv ? no , even though i was there during two major suicide attacks in tel aviv in 2002 and 2003 .
this needs to be kept in perspective , though . israel is not the most dangerous place in the world , and most tourists would not even be aware of the presence of suicide bombers .
i 'm more afraid of driving at high speed on the german autobahns than living in israel . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : merkel laid a wreath during a march visit to the yad vashem memorial suicide bombers wo n't deter young germans from volunteering for asf , but what about scrapping military conscription and the civil alternative , which has been up for discussion for years now in germany ? it 's not a problem .
only one third of those who apply , get accepted into one of our programs abroad , simply because the funding is not there to provide more than 180 placements a year .
volunteers are mainly young people , but we 've got a sprinkling of older germans , too .
also , more than half of the volunteers are women , who do n't get drafted into military service anyway .
even among the young men , there are volunteers who are not necessarily doing this to fulfill their civic duty . i did this to avoid the bundeswehr and to fulfill my civic requirement , but as i see it now , i wound up gaining a year , not losing one on my career path as a lawyer .
whenever i go on interviews for jobs or internships , my year at asf has been a huge advantage for me .

faced with enormous losses , german bank westlb got a bit of help wednesday , april 30 , when the european union approved a state-backed rescue package . the bailout , worth 5 billion euros -lsb- $ 7.8 billion -rsb- , was funded in part by the state of north rhine-westphalia , which holds direct and indirect stakes in the bank totalling around 38 percent .
german officials had registered the rescue package with brussels on march 27 as part of the eu 's regulations requiring the examination of state support . eu commissioner for competition neelie kroes said the decision to aid a bank in crisis came quickly .
she also noted that approval is contingent on the creation of a restructuring program that germany must introduce by august 8 . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : eu commissioner for competition neelie kroes .
" i 'm confident that the restructuring of westlb will continue in cooperation with the german public authorities , " kroes said . in line with eu regulations officials at the eu deemed the risk shield to amount to state aid .
a statement they released noted that the support fell " in line with eu rules on rescue aid because strict conditions ensure that the aid is limited in time and reversible . " news of the rescue package 's approval comes just one month after westlb posted a net loss of 1.6 billion euros for 2007 .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de opinion -pipe- 30.04.2008 opinion : by bending principles , eu cracks open door for serbia großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : with parliamentary elections looming in serbia , the eu has done its best to pave the way for the country to enter eu accession talks – and rightly so , says dw ’ s bernd riegert . the goal is clear : serbia must be integrated in the european union , or else there is little chance for long-term stability in the balkans .
in order to reach this goal , the eu members are prepared to make vast concessions to the serbian government in its election .
apparently they will bend - not to mention stretch , pull and pummel - their principles till it hurts .
eu still waiting for war criminals the eu is loosening its until-now strict stance on serbia - despite the fact that it has long suspected that the serbian government could have delivered its remaining suspected war criminals to the international tribunal for the former yugoslavia , although it failed to do so .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : in luxemburg on april 29 , the eu signed the stabilisation and association agreement with serbia even though it did not fulfil the condition of complete cooperation with the tribunal - a condition that had been clear for months .
now , there appears to be no turning back on the path toward serbia 's eu membership .
after the eu stepped in for kosovo 's independence and made some demands on serbia , it is now time to meet serbia partway .
the pro-european camp in serbia shows a great deal of success and is getting desperately needed election help before voting takes place on may 11 .
it is good that the eu got up the courage to demonstrably strengthen pro-european powers in belgrade .
no good alternatives for europe there was also no especially good alternative : if the nationalistic parties win in serbia on may 11 , things will be looking grim for serbia and the western balkans .
nonetheless , at the urging of the netherlands , the eu left a backdoor open .
the netherlands , traumatized by the 1995 massacre of srebrinica in the bosnian war , which their blue-helmet soldiers failed to prevent , insists strongly upon prosecuting war criminals .
the dutch insisted that the stabilisation and association agreement only be applied when the eu council of ministers determines that serbia is fully cooperating with the tribunal .
luxemburg accord " no empty shell " serbia 's pro-european foreign minister immediately denied that this clause makes the agreement into an “ empty shell . ”
the important thing for the pro-european parties is the strong wind at their backs coming from the direction of luxemburg , he says .
the election on may 11 will be a kind of popular referendum on serbian closeness to europe versus serbian isolation .
with the stabilisation and association agreement , the european union has offered everything it has to offer .
the alternatives are clear .
now it is up to the serbs to decide .

since 1961 , action reconciliation has sent thousands of young germans to israel to volunteer in nursing homes , youth centers , hospitals and memorial sites .
the grassroots work of this social action group became the basis of a political rapprochement between germany and israel , when diplomatic relations were established in 1965 .
today , germany is among israel 's most important allies and trading partners in europe . dw-world.de spoke to philipp pohlmann , 25 , who spent a year volunteering in israel .
today , he is a regional spokesman for the group in the cologne area . dw-world.de : how did you wind up joining asf ? philipp pohlmann : in germany , young men are conscripted into military service after they graduate from high school , generally between the ages of 16-20 , but most get out of it nowadays .
some are disqualified because of a minor physical disability , but those who get a clean bill of health , like i did , can opt to do community service instead .
the third possibility is to fulfill the civil service requirement abroad , which is what i chose to do . why did you specifically choose asf ? their focus on germany 's historic responsibility to jews living in israel and all over the world appealed to me .
i wanted personally to meet the last survivors of auschwitz or other camps . it is one thing to learn about the nazi period through textbooks , which is an obligatory part of the german school curriculum , but it 's another to learn about the past in a personal way . so the way the nazi period is taught in schools is too cut and dry ? bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : anne frank 's diary is often not part of the school curriculum .
yes .
everyone learns about the facts - that 6 million european jews perished in the holocaust , for example .
we know the names of all the death camps - auschwitz , treblinka - it 's all very impersonal .
we did n't even read the " diary of anne frank " in school .
i read it on my own . the nazi period is such an important and compelling part of the history of this country , but many teachers never inspire the pupils or stimulate real interest in the subject .
there are many germans and jews who are still alive to talk personally about this period .
why do n't teachers simply invite survivors to speak about their experiences in class ? perhaps teachers are still grappling with how to teach the subject .
is there perhaps a sense of collective guilt or discomfort in dealing with this period ? one thing is clear : anyone who was too young during the war or born after the war can not be guilty of anything , but still , it is very important to know about the history of one 's own country and , with that awareness , to ensure that the genocide does not happen again in the future .
we , young germans , have a responsibility to learn from our past . have you talked about the nationalist socialist period with your own grandparents ? not really .
by the time my interest in this subject was awakened , they were too old or dead .
my paternal grandfather is almost 100 years old now .
he was a clockmaker from silesia -lsb- part of the german reich that became part of poland after the war -rsb- .
as a soldier on the eastern front , he was captured by the russians in 1941 and held prisoner of war until 1949 .
my grandparents had no nazi sympathies , as far as i know , and i have never heard them utter one bad word about the jews . what did you do as a volunteer for asf in tel aviv ? bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : a church official in cologne hands over a cheque to asf 's philipp pohlmann -lrb- 3rd from right -rrb- as part of the program , i spent one year at a home for the elderly , helping them run daily errands or visit doctors .
we talked a lot and played gin rummy .
they even gave me hebrew lessons , so i 've gotten to the point that i am conversationally fluent now . how did these elderly israelis , some of whom were holocaust survivors , react to you as a german ? this project has been ongoing in israel for decades , so they are used to german volunteers .
many of the elderly happen to be german jews , who often revert back to their mother tongue as they get older , so they were delighted to speak german with me .
they were also very interested in what 's happening in germany .
some residents even subscribed to a local weekly paper in the german language .
jacob bar-or , a frankfurt native in his 80s , who was one of the prosecutors in the adolf eichmann case , even kept abreast of news in germany by reading the frankfurter allgemeine zeitung newspaper on a regular basis . i never encountered any hostility in israel .
the survivors themselves have no problem with me being german .
they know that i 'm in my 20s and had nothing to do with the holocaust .
if anyone had a problem , and this was rare , it was younger people , the grandchildren of holocaust victims , who perhaps never got to know their forebears . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : germany is israel 's best friend in europe .
israel 's peres with germany 's merkel -lrb- right -rrb- can relations between german and israel ever be fully normal ? no , but that is not necessarily a bad thing .
because of the holocaust , the relationship will always be a special one . the holocaust made claims to a jewish state a moral necessity , but does that mean that the germans can not be critical of israel ? for germany , there can be no doubt about israel 's right to exist , but that does not mean we can not be critical of israeli policy , in particular when political leaders meet behind closed doors .
still , germany needs to tread carefully with regard to the israeli-palestinian conflict . was the arab-israeli conflict a part of your daily life in jerusalem or tel aviv ? no , even though i was there during two major suicide attacks in tel aviv in 2002 and 2003 .
this needs to be kept in perspective , though . israel is not the most dangerous place in the world , and most tourists would not even be aware of the presence of suicide bombers .
i 'm more afraid of driving at high speed on the german autobahns than living in israel . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : merkel laid a wreath during a march visit to the yad vashem memorial suicide bombers wo n't deter young germans from volunteering for asf , but what about scrapping military conscription and the civil alternative , which has been up for discussion for years now in germany ? it 's not a problem .
only one third of those who apply , get accepted into one of our programs abroad , simply because the funding is not there to provide more than 180 placements a year .
volunteers are mainly young people , but we 've got a sprinkling of older germans , too .
also , more than half of the volunteers are women , who do n't get drafted into military service anyway .
even among the young men , there are volunteers who are not necessarily doing this to fulfill their civic duty . i did this to avoid the bundeswehr and to fulfill my civic requirement , but as i see it now , i wound up gaining a year , not losing one on my career path as a lawyer .
whenever i go on interviews for jobs or internships , my year at asf has been a huge advantage for me .
every recruiter has asked me about the time i spent in israel . interview : diana fong send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

one child had died . " astonishing " reunion austrian authorities said on tuesday , april 29 that members of the family terrorized by decades of incest and imprisonment had an “ astonishing ” reunion at a clinic , where psychiatrists are helping them cope . hospital officials said most of the seven children fritzl fathered over the past 24 years with the daughter he held captive in a windowless cell spent their first moments together sunday , april 27 - a day after those kept confined finally gained their freedom . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the case is a challenge for the mostviertel mental clinic clinic director berthold kepplinger told reporters tuesday the meeting also reunited the suspect 's wife with the daughter fritzl had led her to believe left home to join a religious cult , but instead was imprisoned in a cramped warren of secured and soundproofed cellar rooms . fritzl was remanded to court custody on tuesday .
meanwhile , investigators are looking into suspicions that fritzl may have had help in caring for and keeping secret the presence of a family living hidden in his basement . report claims son had cellar key a report by the women ’ s magazine brigitte has uncovered a claim that fritzl ’ s son and elisabeth ’ s brother , thomas , had a key to the cellar .
a couple who rented an upstairs room in the house , in the austrian town of amstetten , said that thomas called himself the house “ superintendent ” and made regular trips to the cellar to get things for minor repairs . the couple said they themselves were not allowed near the cellar , and were not allowed to rent a cellar storage room , although that his common practice in austria . police are also taking into account the fact that fritzl had made several trips to thailand , and are looking into how the captive family may have gotten food and other goods while he was away . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : investigators uncovered tiny hideaway authorities have also raised the question of who may have helped the man build a cellar that includes a 300 kilogram steel and cement door .
fritzl was given permission to build the cellar as a bomb shelter in the late 1970s . since the case came to light , fritzl ’ s 42 year old daughter , elisabeth , and her children have been carefully shielded from public glare , undergoing psychiatric counselling to help them try to adjust after their unimaginable ordeal . cult cover-story for adoptive " grandkids " fritzl had told his wife that their daughter had run away to join a cult .
in reality she was locked underground in the 60 square meter -lrb- 650 square feet -rrb- underground rooms . mother and daughter were reunited this week for the first time in a quarter century . fritzl explained the presence of three of the grandchildren whom he adopted to his wife and to the community by claiming elisabeth had given birth to them at the cult , and then delivered them to his doorstep for the older couple to care for . three other children – aged 19 , 18 and 5 - lived belowground with their mother in the cell .
they first saw daylight when they were rescued . daughter 's illness leads to family 's release one child , a twin , had died shortly after birth .
fritzl has admitted to burning the corpse in the house ’ s boiler . the decision on which children lived aboveground and which below depended on whether they were “ screaming babies ” and on their general halth , explained chief inspector leopold etz from the lower austrian criminal investigators office . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : a bathroom in the shocking home-prison the case came to light because one of the children , 19 year old kerstin , was severely ill .
her “ grandfather ” brought the child to the hospital , which started a search for the child ’ s mother in the hopes of finding out her medical history .
they televised an urgent call elisabeth to come back and save the daughter ’ s life . elisabeth saw the call on television , and was able to convince her father to let her go to the hospital .
she seized the chance to speak privately to a doctor and explain her situation .
fritzl was arrested the same day . fritzl ’ s admission that he burned the body of the dead seventh child could prove pivotal when the case comes to trial , with a prosecutor saying he would face a life sentence if found guilty of manslaughter , as opposed to shorter prison terms for rape or incarceration . psychologist paulus hochgatterer , who is helping advise those counselling the family , told afp news service that the three children fritzl had kept underground are staying in a sequestered treatment container that could be locked from the inside . slow road to recovery ? safely shielded from the media circus that has set up camp in amstetten , he said their initial treatment could take several weeks . " only very gradually are they being exposed to the outside world , " hochgatterer said , adding that " given the circumstances , they 're actually doing quite well . " the two sets of children are now tentatively beginning to get to know one another .
the youngest child , five years old , seems most able to adapt to his new life , his caretakers said . experts said the family is likely to need years of therapy . " it could take between five and eight years , " said max friedrich , the psychiatrist who looked after another sequestration victim , natascha kampusch , in an interview with the daily oesterreich . the head of the local social services , hans-heinz lenze , said a name-change had been suggested for the immediate victims , but fritzl 's other family as well , in order to give them a new start in life . long-term investigation expected " at the moment , all possibilities are being sounded out in closest consultation with the family .
but a decision will only be reached in the coming weeks , " lenze told a news conference on tuesday . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : can officials look to the kampusch case for help ?
chief investigator franz polzer told austrian television that police might need " half a year " to complete their investigations .
he ruled out any suggestion fritzl might have had an accomplice . " as our investigations now stand , there were no accomplices .
but you can never be 100 percent certain . " doctors would determine when police would be allowed to question elisabeth fritzl and the children , but that was unlikely to be for several days . fritzl had officially adopted the three aboveground children , after showing authorities letters signed by elizabeth that said she could not care for them , and which asked that they try not to track her down for the sake of herself and her children . fritzl was allowed to adopt despite a reported conviction of attempted rape in the 1960s and of arson , but the records were wiped after a period of time set by austrian law . the district court in amstetten , which had greenlighted the adoptions , said it had followed protocol in the adoption proceedings and had had acted correctly . no sign of wife 's complicity " there were n't any doubts about his -lrb- fritzl 's -rrb- integrity .
why should i put the child in a foster home , when it could grow up in a family , " court president josef schoegl told the austria press agency . chief police investigator franz polzer said there was no sign that fritzl 's wife , who also had seven children with him , knew of the goings on in his locked dungeon . in the town of amstetten , more than 200 people including dozens of youngsters quietly held a candlelight vigil in the main square late tuesday , as the town of 23,000 sought to cast off the notoriety brought to their doorstep by fritzl . shocked residents react " shock , sadness , rage and perhaps also hatred have gripped us these last few days , " pastor peter boesendorfer told those gathered . " we must acknowledge that there is something in our town that we can not comprehend , " he said , calling on residents " to help and show solidarity so that a life will be possible " for the bewildered children and their scarred mother . amstetten mayor herbert katzengruber told the austrian news agency apa : " we want to show that amstetten is not a town for criminals .
but it 's mostly about showing solidarity and help to the victims .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de opinion -pipe- 30.04.2008 opinion : by bending principles , eu cracks open door for serbia großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : with parliamentary elections looming in serbia , the eu has done its best to pave the way for the country to enter eu accession talks – and rightly so , says dw ’ s bernd riegert . the goal is clear : serbia must be integrated in the european union , or else there is little chance for long-term stability in the balkans .
in order to reach this goal , the eu members are prepared to make vast concessions to the serbian government in its election .
apparently they will bend - not to mention stretch , pull and pummel - their principles till it hurts .
eu still waiting for war criminals the eu is loosening its until-now strict stance on serbia - despite the fact that it has long suspected that the serbian government could have delivered its remaining suspected war criminals to the international tribunal for the former yugoslavia , although it failed to do so .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : in luxemburg on april 29 , the eu signed the stabilisation and association agreement with serbia even though it did not fulfil the condition of complete cooperation with the tribunal - a condition that had been clear for months .
now , there appears to be no turning back on the path toward serbia 's eu membership .
after the eu stepped in for kosovo 's independence and made some demands on serbia , it is now time to meet serbia partway .
the pro-european camp in serbia shows a great deal of success and is getting desperately needed election help before voting takes place on may 11 .
it is good that the eu got up the courage to demonstrably strengthen pro-european powers in belgrade .
no good alternatives for europe there was also no especially good alternative : if the nationalistic parties win in serbia on may 11 , things will be looking grim for serbia and the western balkans .
nonetheless , at the urging of the netherlands , the eu left a backdoor open .
the netherlands , traumatized by the 1995 massacre of srebrinica in the bosnian war , which their blue-helmet soldiers failed to prevent , insists strongly upon prosecuting war criminals .
the dutch insisted that the stabilisation and association agreement only be applied when the eu council of ministers determines that serbia is fully cooperating with the tribunal .
luxemburg accord " no empty shell " serbia 's pro-european foreign minister immediately denied that this clause makes the agreement into an “ empty shell . ”
the important thing for the pro-european parties is the strong wind at their backs coming from the direction of luxemburg , he says .
the election on may 11 will be a kind of popular referendum on serbian closeness to europe versus serbian isolation .
with the stabilisation and association agreement , the european union has offered everything it has to offer .
the alternatives are clear .
now it is up to the serbs to decide .

in order to reach this goal , the eu members are prepared to make vast concessions to the serbian government in its election .
apparently they will bend - not to mention stretch , pull and pummel - their principles till it hurts .

after the eu stepped in for kosovo 's independence and made some demands on serbia , it is now time to meet serbia partway .

one child had died . " astonishing " reunion austrian authorities said on tuesday , april 29 that members of the family terrorized by decades of incest and imprisonment had an “ astonishing ” reunion at a clinic , where psychiatrists are helping them cope . hospital officials said most of the seven children fritzl fathered over the past 24 years with the daughter he held captive in a windowless cell spent their first moments together sunday , april 27 - a day after those kept confined finally gained their freedom . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the case is a challenge for the mostviertel mental clinic clinic director berthold kepplinger told reporters tuesday the meeting also reunited the suspect 's wife with the daughter fritzl had led her to believe left home to join a religious cult , but instead was imprisoned in a cramped warren of secured and soundproofed cellar rooms . fritzl was remanded to court custody on tuesday .
meanwhile , investigators are looking into suspicions that fritzl may have had help in caring for and keeping secret the presence of a family living hidden in his basement . report claims son had cellar key a report by the women ’ s magazine brigitte has uncovered a claim that fritzl ’ s son and elisabeth ’ s brother , thomas , had a key to the cellar .
a couple who rented an upstairs room in the house , in the austrian town of amstetten , said that thomas called himself the house “ superintendent ” and made regular trips to the cellar to get things for minor repairs . the couple said they themselves were not allowed near the cellar , and were not allowed to rent a cellar storage room , although that his common practice in austria . police are also taking into account the fact that fritzl had made several trips to thailand , and are looking into how the captive family may have gotten food and other goods while he was away . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : investigators uncovered tiny hideaway authorities have also raised the question of who may have helped the man build a cellar that includes a 300 kilogram steel and cement door .
fritzl was given permission to build the cellar as a bomb shelter in the late 1970s . since the case came to light , fritzl ’ s 42 year old daughter , elisabeth , and her children have been carefully shielded from public glare , undergoing psychiatric counselling to help them try to adjust after their unimaginable ordeal . cult cover-story for adoptive " grandkids " fritzl had told his wife that their daughter had run away to join a cult .
in reality she was locked underground in the 60 square meter -lrb- 650 square feet -rrb- underground rooms . mother and daughter were reunited this week for the first time in a quarter century . fritzl explained the presence of three of the grandchildren whom he adopted to his wife and to the community by claiming elisabeth had given birth to them at the cult , and then delivered them to his doorstep for the older couple to care for . three other children – aged 19 , 18 and 5 - lived belowground with their mother in the cell .
they first saw daylight when they were rescued . daughter 's illness leads to family 's release one child , a twin , had died shortly after birth .
fritzl has admitted to burning the corpse in the house ’ s boiler . the decision on which children lived aboveground and which below depended on whether they were “ screaming babies ” and on their general halth , explained chief inspector leopold etz from the lower austrian criminal investigators office . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : a bathroom in the shocking home-prison the case came to light because one of the children , 19 year old kerstin , was severely ill .
her “ grandfather ” brought the child to the hospital , which started a search for the child ’ s mother in the hopes of finding out her medical history .
they televised an urgent call elisabeth to come back and save the daughter ’ s life . elisabeth saw the call on television , and was able to convince her father to let her go to the hospital .
she seized the chance to speak privately to a doctor and explain her situation .
fritzl was arrested the same day . fritzl ’ s admission that he burned the body of the dead seventh child could prove pivotal when the case comes to trial , with a prosecutor saying he would face a life sentence if found guilty of manslaughter , as opposed to shorter prison terms for rape or incarceration . psychologist paulus hochgatterer , who is helping advise those counselling the family , told afp news service that the three children fritzl had kept underground are staying in a sequestered treatment container that could be locked from the inside . slow road to recovery ? safely shielded from the media circus that has set up camp in amstetten , he said their initial treatment could take several weeks . " only very gradually are they being exposed to the outside world , " hochgatterer said , adding that " given the circumstances , they 're actually doing quite well . " the two sets of children are now tentatively beginning to get to know one another .
the youngest child , five years old , seems most able to adapt to his new life , his caretakers said . experts said the family is likely to need years of therapy . " it could take between five and eight years , " said max friedrich , the psychiatrist who looked after another sequestration victim , natascha kampusch , in an interview with the daily oesterreich . the head of the local social services , hans-heinz lenze , said a name-change had been suggested for the immediate victims , but fritzl 's other family as well , in order to give them a new start in life . long-term investigation expected " at the moment , all possibilities are being sounded out in closest consultation with the family .
but a decision will only be reached in the coming weeks , " lenze told a news conference on tuesday . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : can officials look to the kampusch case for help ?
chief investigator franz polzer told austrian television that police might need " half a year " to complete their investigations .
he ruled out any suggestion fritzl might have had an accomplice . " as our investigations now stand , there were no accomplices .
but you can never be 100 percent certain . " doctors would determine when police would be allowed to question elisabeth fritzl and the children , but that was unlikely to be for several days . fritzl had officially adopted the three aboveground children , after showing authorities letters signed by elizabeth that said she could not care for them , and which asked that they try not to track her down for the sake of herself and her children . fritzl was allowed to adopt despite a reported conviction of attempted rape in the 1960s and of arson , but the records were wiped after a period of time set by austrian law . the district court in amstetten , which had greenlighted the adoptions , said it had followed protocol in the adoption proceedings and had had acted correctly . no sign of wife 's complicity " there were n't any doubts about his -lrb- fritzl 's -rrb- integrity .
why should i put the child in a foster home , when it could grow up in a family , " court president josef schoegl told the austria press agency . chief police investigator franz polzer said there was no sign that fritzl 's wife , who also had seven children with him , knew of the goings on in his locked dungeon . in the town of amstetten , more than 200 people including dozens of youngsters quietly held a candlelight vigil in the main square late tuesday , as the town of 23,000 sought to cast off the notoriety brought to their doorstep by fritzl . shocked residents react " shock , sadness , rage and perhaps also hatred have gripped us these last few days , " pastor peter boesendorfer told those gathered . " we must acknowledge that there is something in our town that we can not comprehend , " he said , calling on residents " to help and show solidarity so that a life will be possible " for the bewildered children and their scarred mother . amstetten mayor herbert katzengruber told the austrian news agency apa : " we want to show that amstetten is not a town for criminals .

no , thanks " and " serbia - russia " serbian caretaker prime minister vojislav kostunica on wednesday , april 30 , dismissed the stabilization and association agreement with the european union as a " false document " which legalizes the secession of kosovo . " those who signed the tabilization and association agreement -lsb- saa -rsb- are fully responsible for it and they signed it in their own names and never in the name of serbia , " kostunica said in an interview with the daily vecernje novosti .
serbian president boris tadic and deputy prime minister bozidar djelic signed the saa , which legalizes the secession of serbia 's province of kosovo and is a precursor to eu membership talks , with the european union on tuesday , a move denounced by serbian nationalists as treason .
the nationalist majority in serbia heaped insults on the saa with the european union , calling its signing " lies and deceit , " " treason , " and " legally null and void . "
kostunica 's democratic party of serbia -lsb- dss -rsb- has said it will take legal action against the pro-europe bloc for signing the saa , while the ultra-nationalist opposition serbian radical party -lsb- srs -rsb- has said it will launch a case to remove tadic from office .
" without an saa there can be no possibility for a full integration of the western balkans into the european union , and without such integration there is no possibility for a final reconciliation amongst the people of the western balkans , " tadic said .

the medium gallup and blic daily poll showed that the nationalists would win 137 seats out of 250 if elections were held right now , while the pro-european bloc would win 113 seats .
if kostunica forms a government with the radicals , that would cement serbia 's turn away from the eu towards russia .
the alternative would be for kostunica to form a coalition with tadic , as he did last year .

no , thanks " and " serbia - russia " serbian caretaker prime minister vojislav kostunica on wednesday , april 30 , dismissed the stabilization and association agreement with the european union as a " false document " which legalizes the secession of kosovo . " those who signed the tabilization and association agreement -lsb- saa -rsb- are fully responsible for it and they signed it in their own names and never in the name of serbia , " kostunica said in an interview with the daily vecernje novosti .
serbian president boris tadic and deputy prime minister bozidar djelic signed the saa , which legalizes the secession of serbia 's province of kosovo and is a precursor to eu membership talks , with the european union on tuesday , a move denounced by serbian nationalists as treason .
the nationalist majority in serbia heaped insults on the saa with the european union , calling its signing " lies and deceit , " " treason , " and " legally null and void . "
kostunica 's democratic party of serbia -lsb- dss -rsb- has said it will take legal action against the pro-europe bloc for signing the saa , while the ultra-nationalist opposition serbian radical party -lsb- srs -rsb- has said it will launch a case to remove tadic from office .
" without an saa there can be no possibility for a full integration of the western balkans into the european union , and without such integration there is no possibility for a final reconciliation amongst the people of the western balkans , " tadic said .
observers hope that the saa will boost the chances of the pro- european bloc , led by tadic , in snap parliamentary elections on may 11 .
rising nationalists challenge pro-europe parties bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : kostunica 's dss party and the radical party oppose the eu the latest surveys published wednesday showed that the anti- european bloc , led by the increasingly nationalist kostunica and ultra-nationalist opposition radical party , could win more seats in parliament than the pro-european parties .
the medium gallup and blic daily poll showed that the nationalists would win 137 seats out of 250 if elections were held right now , while the pro-european bloc would win 113 seats .
if kostunica forms a government with the radicals , that would cement serbia 's turn away from the eu towards russia .
the alternative would be for kostunica to form a coalition with tadic , as he did last year .
observers say that , either way , the process of forming a government will be long and very difficult followed by months of negotiations , political trading and blackmail .
a door to eu membership and stability bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the signing of the accord is seen as a prelude to accession kosovo declared independence from serbia in february .
the youngest european state was recognized by most eu member states and major western powers .
serbia , backed by its ally russia , opposes it .
the saa is a document setting out how an aspiring eu member should reform its political , economic and legal systems to come in line with eu norms , and how the eu should help it do so .
as its name suggests , it is designed to bring basic stability and prosperity to a region devastated by the conflict that erupted after the implosion of the former yugoslavia .
the ratification of serbia 's saa was made conditional on belgrade proving that it was cooperating fully with the international criminal tribunal for the former yugoslavia . dw staff / dpa -lrb- nda -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

in order to reach this goal , the eu members are prepared to make vast concessions to the serbian government in its election .
apparently they will bend - not to mention stretch , pull and pummel - their principles till it hurts .
eu still waiting for war criminals the eu is loosening its until-now strict stance on serbia - despite the fact that it has long suspected that the serbian government could have delivered its remaining suspected war criminals to the international tribunal for the former yugoslavia , although it failed to do so .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : in luxemburg on april 29 , the eu signed the stabilisation and association agreement with serbia even though it did not fulfil the condition of complete cooperation with the tribunal - a condition that had been clear for months .
now , there appears to be no turning back on the path toward serbia 's eu membership .
after the eu stepped in for kosovo 's independence and made some demands on serbia , it is now time to meet serbia partway .
the pro-european camp in serbia shows a great deal of success and is getting desperately needed election help before voting takes place on may 11 .
it is good that the eu got up the courage to demonstrably strengthen pro-european powers in belgrade .
no good alternatives for europe there was also no especially good alternative : if the nationalistic parties win in serbia on may 11 , things will be looking grim for serbia and the western balkans .
nonetheless , at the urging of the netherlands , the eu left a backdoor open .
the netherlands , traumatized by the 1995 massacre of srebrinica in the bosnian war , which their blue-helmet soldiers failed to prevent , insists strongly upon prosecuting war criminals .
the dutch insisted that the stabilisation and association agreement only be applied when the eu council of ministers determines that serbia is fully cooperating with the tribunal .
luxemburg accord " no empty shell " serbia 's pro-european foreign minister immediately denied that this clause makes the agreement into an “ empty shell . ”
the important thing for the pro-european parties is the strong wind at their backs coming from the direction of luxemburg , he says .
the election on may 11 will be a kind of popular referendum on serbian closeness to europe versus serbian isolation .
with the stabilisation and association agreement , the european union has offered everything it has to offer .
the alternatives are clear .
now it is up to the serbs to decide .

an archive storing files on those persecuted and killed by the nazis officially opened in the german town of bad arolsen on wednesday , april 30 . the card index , which contains about 47 million documents containing the names of most concentration camp inmates , forced-labour victims and refugees left homeless after world war ii , had been the subject of an intense debate .
jewish groups had been pressing for open access to the collection , a storehouse of captured documents that began being assembled in 1946 . " most of the documents were drawn up by the nazis themselves , " said reto meister , the swiss red cross official now in charge of the files .

no , thanks " and " serbia - russia " serbian caretaker prime minister vojislav kostunica on wednesday , april 30 , dismissed the stabilization and association agreement with the european union as a " false document " which legalizes the secession of kosovo . " those who signed the tabilization and association agreement -lsb- saa -rsb- are fully responsible for it and they signed it in their own names and never in the name of serbia , " kostunica said in an interview with the daily vecernje novosti .
serbian president boris tadic and deputy prime minister bozidar djelic signed the saa , which legalizes the secession of serbia 's province of kosovo and is a precursor to eu membership talks , with the european union on tuesday , a move denounced by serbian nationalists as treason .
the nationalist majority in serbia heaped insults on the saa with the european union , calling its signing " lies and deceit , " " treason , " and " legally null and void . "
kostunica 's democratic party of serbia -lsb- dss -rsb- has said it will take legal action against the pro-europe bloc for signing the saa , while the ultra-nationalist opposition serbian radical party -lsb- srs -rsb- has said it will launch a case to remove tadic from office .
" without an saa there can be no possibility for a full integration of the western balkans into the european union , and without such integration there is no possibility for a final reconciliation amongst the people of the western balkans , " tadic said .
observers hope that the saa will boost the chances of the pro- european bloc , led by tadic , in snap parliamentary elections on may 11 .
rising nationalists challenge pro-europe parties bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : kostunica 's dss party and the radical party oppose the eu the latest surveys published wednesday showed that the anti- european bloc , led by the increasingly nationalist kostunica and ultra-nationalist opposition radical party , could win more seats in parliament than the pro-european parties .
the medium gallup and blic daily poll showed that the nationalists would win 137 seats out of 250 if elections were held right now , while the pro-european bloc would win 113 seats .
if kostunica forms a government with the radicals , that would cement serbia 's turn away from the eu towards russia .
the alternative would be for kostunica to form a coalition with tadic , as he did last year .
observers say that , either way , the process of forming a government will be long and very difficult followed by months of negotiations , political trading and blackmail .
a door to eu membership and stability bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the signing of the accord is seen as a prelude to accession kosovo declared independence from serbia in february .
the youngest european state was recognized by most eu member states and major western powers .
serbia , backed by its ally russia , opposes it .
the saa is a document setting out how an aspiring eu member should reform its political , economic and legal systems to come in line with eu norms , and how the eu should help it do so .
as its name suggests , it is designed to bring basic stability and prosperity to a region devastated by the conflict that erupted after the implosion of the former yugoslavia .
the ratification of serbia 's saa was made conditional on belgrade proving that it was cooperating fully with the international criminal tribunal for the former yugoslavia . dw staff / dpa -lrb- nda -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

no , thanks " and " serbia - russia " serbian caretaker prime minister vojislav kostunica on wednesday , april 30 , dismissed the stabilization and association agreement with the european union as a " false document " which legalizes the secession of kosovo . " those who signed the tabilization and association agreement -lsb- saa -rsb- are fully responsible for it and they signed it in their own names and never in the name of serbia , " kostunica said in an interview with the daily vecernje novosti .
serbian president boris tadic and deputy prime minister bozidar djelic signed the saa , which legalizes the secession of serbia 's province of kosovo and is a precursor to eu membership talks , with the european union on tuesday , a move denounced by serbian nationalists as treason .
the nationalist majority in serbia heaped insults on the saa with the european union , calling its signing " lies and deceit , " " treason , " and " legally null and void . "
kostunica 's democratic party of serbia -lsb- dss -rsb- has said it will take legal action against the pro-europe bloc for signing the saa , while the ultra-nationalist opposition serbian radical party -lsb- srs -rsb- has said it will launch a case to remove tadic from office .
" without an saa there can be no possibility for a full integration of the western balkans into the european union , and without such integration there is no possibility for a final reconciliation amongst the people of the western balkans , " tadic said .
observers hope that the saa will boost the chances of the pro- european bloc , led by tadic , in snap parliamentary elections on may 11 .

the medium gallup and blic daily poll showed that the nationalists would win 137 seats out of 250 if elections were held right now , while the pro-european bloc would win 113 seats .
if kostunica forms a government with the radicals , that would cement serbia 's turn away from the eu towards russia .
the alternative would be for kostunica to form a coalition with tadic , as he did last year .
observers say that , either way , the process of forming a government will be long and very difficult followed by months of negotiations , political trading and blackmail .

moscow maintains the troops are serving in a peacekeeping mission . " it 's hard to believe that this is being done for the purposes of peacekeeping , it 's rather the beginning of full scale military aggression , " georgian foreign minister david bakradze told the afp news agency on wednesday , 30 april . russia has deployed additional troops to the break-away georgian territories of abkhazia and south ossetia .
the move stoked tensions with the former soviet republic and drew criticism from the eu . an undefined number of russian soldiers were sent to the caucasus territories on tuesday after moscow accused georgia of massing troops on the border to abkhazia and acquiring a large number of offensive weapons . " russia is not preparing for war , but we can cite a number of examples pointing to the fact that the georgian leadership might be pushing for a resolution of the abkhazian and south ossetian secession by force , " said russian foreign minister sergei lavrov . if it does so , " we will be forced to take retaliatory measures to protect the lives of our citizens , " he added . georgia has repeatedly accused russia of attempting to annex the two territories , which have had close ties with moscow since the mid-1990s .
many of the residents hold russian passports and reject georgian control .
russia has said the troops it has stationed in abkhazia are there for peacekeeping purposes . tensions between georgia and russia have heightened lately as tbilisi negotiates with nato over possible future membership , which moscow strongly opposes . georgia appeals to separatist region bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : abkhazian separatists do n't accept georgian rule georgian president mikheil saakashvili called on abkhazia and south ossetia to reject an " outrageous and irresponsible " force that is trying to provoke a conflict . rebel leaders in the two moscow-backed regions , however , immediately rejected saakashvili 's offer of solidarity . " the co-existence of abkhazia and georgia in a unified state is impossible , " said abkhaz leader sergei bagapsh . russian troops have been involved in the region since 1994 .
following separatist wars , the un brokered a peacekeeping agreement that stipulated russia 's presence in the territories , which had established close ties with moscow in the wake of the disintegration of the soviet union . eu calls russia 's move " unwise " the eu was critical of russia 's decision to enlarge its military force .
some 2,000 russian soldiers are already stationed in abkhazia and 1,000 in south ossetia . " it is not wise to increase the number of russian peacekeepers in georgia right now , " said eu foreign policy chief javier solana on tuesday at a joint press conference with russian foreign minister sergei lavrov . " we defend the territorial integrity of georgia , " solana added . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : saakashvili encouraged abkhazia and south ossetia to reject russia 's involvement lavrov declined to indicate how many additional soldiers would be sent to the region , saying it " remains in the limits foreseen . " earlier this month russia lifted a range of economic sanctions that had been in place for two years against georgia , including the complete closure of land , air and sea links . however , tensions have repeatedly flared since , including georgia 's accusation that a russian aircraft shot down an unmanned surveillance drone deployed over abkhazia . dw staff -lrb- kjb -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

turkey 's far-right nationalist movement party -lrb- mhp -rrb- accused the government of betraying the country 's identity , and instead pandering to eu demands that it reform laws prohibiting turks from insulting their nation .
the pro-kurdish democratic society party , whose members often end up in court for expressing views on the kurdish separatist movement , wanted to abolish the article .
before the parliament voted , mhp leader devlet bahceli told party members that reforming the law would be a " historic mistake . "
" slandering turkey 's honorable history , insulting the turkish nation and the values of turkishness has become a habit with the ak party 's political thinking , which lacks a sense of identity , " he said . dw staff -lrb- sms -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

other european countries , however , are stepping up the pressure . the european union had hoped a meeting of its foreign ministers in luxembourg would produce a green light for partnership talks with russia .
yet at the end of the meeting , it seemed unlikely that europe would be ready to begin talks at a summit in siberia planned for june .
" it is over for today , " luxembourg 's foreign minister jean asselborn told reporters as the eu foreign ministers ' talks ended on tuesday , april 29 .
" we are a bit blocked . "
lithuania was the main obstacle standing in the way of beginning partnership and cooperation agreement -lrb- pca -rrb- negotiations with russia .
the former soviet republic wanted russian assurances on energy supplies , judicial cooperation and regional security before agreeing to the talks .
the eu will try to push forward the partnership talks , which have been deadlocked for 18 months , at a meeting next week in brussels .
europe would like to have a mandate in place by a planned june summit with russia which will be held in siberia .
siberian summit cutting it close bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : lithuania had promised to block the talks lithuanian officials would not say whether they thought the june timeline remained possible .
" i do n't want to put any timeframe on the talks or the objectives , " lithuanian foreign minister petras vaitiekunas said .
" what is important is ... the quality of the objectives and the quality of the relations with russia . "
vilnius has a tense relationship with moscow .
lithuania objects to russia 's decision to shut-off of a pipeline supplying lithuania 's only oil refinery .
moscow has said a technical problem has led to the halt in energy deliveries .
lithuania is also unhappy about russia 's attitude toward judicial and international cooperation .
the baltic country also wants russia to change its stance on internal border conflicts in georgia and moldova .
russia has supported the territorial claims of breakaway republics in both countries .
europe eager for new energy policy bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the current eu-russia agreement was signed under yeltsin current relations between the eu and russia on issues ranging from energy to education are governed by a pca negotiated with the government of boris yeltsin in 1997 .
europe has found it difficult to negotiate a replacement agreement .
originally , it was poland that blocked talks to protest a russian import ban on polish meat and vegetable products .
the ban has since been lifted and poland agreed to the talks , leaving lithuania the only eu holdout .
any eu country can block negotiations with another country outside the bloc .
" of course , we share lithuania 's worries and the problems they listed , but we also see that it 's better to talk with the russians about all those problems to solve them , " estonian foreign minister urmas paet said .
most other 27 nations which make up the eu want a new agreement with energy-rich russia and have pressured lithuania to agree to the negotiations .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the eu is dependent on russian oil " there are very important interests -lsb- at stake -rsb- , " spanish secretary of state for european affairs diego lopez garrido said before the meeting , citing energy .
" it will be a long negotiation that should start as soon as possible . "
" we do believe that the eu should begin this process of a partnership and cooperation agreement , " added british europe minister jim murphy .

other european countries , however , are stepping up the pressure . the european union had hoped a meeting of its foreign ministers in luxembourg would produce a green light for partnership talks with russia .
yet at the end of the meeting , it seemed unlikely that europe would be ready to begin talks at a summit in siberia planned for june .
" it is over for today , " luxembourg 's foreign minister jean asselborn told reporters as the eu foreign ministers ' talks ended on tuesday , april 29 .
" we are a bit blocked . "
lithuania was the main obstacle standing in the way of beginning partnership and cooperation agreement -lrb- pca -rrb- negotiations with russia .
the former soviet republic wanted russian assurances on energy supplies , judicial cooperation and regional security before agreeing to the talks .
the eu will try to push forward the partnership talks , which have been deadlocked for 18 months , at a meeting next week in brussels .
europe would like to have a mandate in place by a planned june summit with russia which will be held in siberia .
siberian summit cutting it close bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : lithuania had promised to block the talks lithuanian officials would not say whether they thought the june timeline remained possible .
" i do n't want to put any timeframe on the talks or the objectives , " lithuanian foreign minister petras vaitiekunas said .
" what is important is ... the quality of the objectives and the quality of the relations with russia . "
vilnius has a tense relationship with moscow .
lithuania objects to russia 's decision to shut-off of a pipeline supplying lithuania 's only oil refinery .
moscow has said a technical problem has led to the halt in energy deliveries .
lithuania is also unhappy about russia 's attitude toward judicial and international cooperation .
the baltic country also wants russia to change its stance on internal border conflicts in georgia and moldova .
russia has supported the territorial claims of breakaway republics in both countries .
europe eager for new energy policy bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the current eu-russia agreement was signed under yeltsin current relations between the eu and russia on issues ranging from energy to education are governed by a pca negotiated with the government of boris yeltsin in 1997 .
europe has found it difficult to negotiate a replacement agreement .
originally , it was poland that blocked talks to protest a russian import ban on polish meat and vegetable products .
the ban has since been lifted and poland agreed to the talks , leaving lithuania the only eu holdout .
any eu country can block negotiations with another country outside the bloc .
" of course , we share lithuania 's worries and the problems they listed , but we also see that it 's better to talk with the russians about all those problems to solve them , " estonian foreign minister urmas paet said .
most other 27 nations which make up the eu want a new agreement with energy-rich russia and have pressured lithuania to agree to the negotiations .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the eu is dependent on russian oil " there are very important interests -lsb- at stake -rsb- , " spanish secretary of state for european affairs diego lopez garrido said before the meeting , citing energy .
" it will be a long negotiation that should start as soon as possible . "
" we do believe that the eu should begin this process of a partnership and cooperation agreement , " added british europe minister jim murphy .

since 1961 , action reconciliation has sent thousands of young germans to israel to volunteer in nursing homes , youth centers , hospitals and memorial sites .
the grassroots work of this social action group became the basis of a political rapprochement between germany and israel , when diplomatic relations were established in 1965 .
today , germany is among israel 's most important allies and trading partners in europe . dw-world.de spoke to philipp pohlmann , 25 , who spent a year volunteering in israel .
today , he is a regional spokesman for the group in the cologne area . dw-world.de : how did you wind up joining asf ? philipp pohlmann : in germany , young men are conscripted into military service after they graduate from high school , generally between the ages of 16-20 , but most get out of it nowadays .
some are disqualified because of a minor physical disability , but those who get a clean bill of health , like i did , can opt to do community service instead .
the third possibility is to fulfill the civil service requirement abroad , which is what i chose to do . why did you specifically choose asf ? their focus on germany 's historic responsibility to jews living in israel and all over the world appealed to me .
i wanted personally to meet the last survivors of auschwitz or other camps . it is one thing to learn about the nazi period through textbooks , which is an obligatory part of the german school curriculum , but it 's another to learn about the past in a personal way . so the way the nazi period is taught in schools is too cut and dry ? bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : anne frank 's diary is often not part of the school curriculum .
yes .
everyone learns about the facts - that 6 million european jews perished in the holocaust , for example .
we know the names of all the death camps - auschwitz , treblinka - it 's all very impersonal .
we did n't even read the " diary of anne frank " in school .
i read it on my own . the nazi period is such an important and compelling part of the history of this country , but many teachers never inspire the pupils or stimulate real interest in the subject .
there are many germans and jews who are still alive to talk personally about this period .
why do n't teachers simply invite survivors to speak about their experiences in class ? perhaps teachers are still grappling with how to teach the subject .
is there perhaps a sense of collective guilt or discomfort in dealing with this period ? one thing is clear : anyone who was too young during the war or born after the war can not be guilty of anything , but still , it is very important to know about the history of one 's own country and , with that awareness , to ensure that the genocide does not happen again in the future .
we , young germans , have a responsibility to learn from our past . have you talked about the nationalist socialist period with your own grandparents ? not really .
by the time my interest in this subject was awakened , they were too old or dead .
my paternal grandfather is almost 100 years old now .
he was a clockmaker from silesia -lsb- part of the german reich that became part of poland after the war -rsb- .
as a soldier on the eastern front , he was captured by the russians in 1941 and held prisoner of war until 1949 .
my grandparents had no nazi sympathies , as far as i know , and i have never heard them utter one bad word about the jews . what did you do as a volunteer for asf in tel aviv ? bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : a church official in cologne hands over a cheque to asf 's philipp pohlmann -lrb- 3rd from right -rrb- as part of the program , i spent one year at a home for the elderly , helping them run daily errands or visit doctors .
we talked a lot and played gin rummy .
they even gave me hebrew lessons , so i 've gotten to the point that i am conversationally fluent now . how did these elderly israelis , some of whom were holocaust survivors , react to you as a german ? this project has been ongoing in israel for decades , so they are used to german volunteers .
many of the elderly happen to be german jews , who often revert back to their mother tongue as they get older , so they were delighted to speak german with me .
they were also very interested in what 's happening in germany .
some residents even subscribed to a local weekly paper in the german language .
jacob bar-or , a frankfurt native in his 80s , who was one of the prosecutors in the adolf eichmann case , even kept abreast of news in germany by reading the frankfurter allgemeine zeitung newspaper on a regular basis . i never encountered any hostility in israel .
the survivors themselves have no problem with me being german .
they know that i 'm in my 20s and had nothing to do with the holocaust .
if anyone had a problem , and this was rare , it was younger people , the grandchildren of holocaust victims , who perhaps never got to know their forebears . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : germany is israel 's best friend in europe .
israel 's peres with germany 's merkel -lrb- right -rrb- can relations between german and israel ever be fully normal ? no , but that is not necessarily a bad thing .
because of the holocaust , the relationship will always be a special one . the holocaust made claims to a jewish state a moral necessity , but does that mean that the germans can not be critical of israel ? for germany , there can be no doubt about israel 's right to exist , but that does not mean we can not be critical of israeli policy , in particular when political leaders meet behind closed doors .
still , germany needs to tread carefully with regard to the israeli-palestinian conflict . was the arab-israeli conflict a part of your daily life in jerusalem or tel aviv ? no , even though i was there during two major suicide attacks in tel aviv in 2002 and 2003 .
this needs to be kept in perspective , though . israel is not the most dangerous place in the world , and most tourists would not even be aware of the presence of suicide bombers .
i 'm more afraid of driving at high speed on the german autobahns than living in israel . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : merkel laid a wreath during a march visit to the yad vashem memorial suicide bombers wo n't deter young germans from volunteering for asf , but what about scrapping military conscription and the civil alternative , which has been up for discussion for years now in germany ? it 's not a problem .
only one third of those who apply , get accepted into one of our programs abroad , simply because the funding is not there to provide more than 180 placements a year .
volunteers are mainly young people , but we 've got a sprinkling of older germans , too .
also , more than half of the volunteers are women , who do n't get drafted into military service anyway .
even among the young men , there are volunteers who are not necessarily doing this to fulfill their civic duty . i did this to avoid the bundeswehr and to fulfill my civic requirement , but as i see it now , i wound up gaining a year , not losing one on my career path as a lawyer .
whenever i go on interviews for jobs or internships , my year at asf has been a huge advantage for me .
every recruiter has asked me about the time i spent in israel . interview : diana fong send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

many of the elderly happen to be german jews , who often revert back to their mother tongue as they get older , so they were delighted to speak german with me .

since 1961 , action reconciliation has sent thousands of young germans to israel to volunteer in nursing homes , youth centers , hospitals and memorial sites .
the grassroots work of this social action group became the basis of a political rapprochement between germany and israel , when diplomatic relations were established in 1965 .
today , germany is among israel 's most important allies and trading partners in europe . dw-world.de spoke to philipp pohlmann , 25 , who spent a year volunteering in israel .
today , he is a regional spokesman for the group in the cologne area . dw-world.de : how did you wind up joining asf ? philipp pohlmann : in germany , young men are conscripted into military service after they graduate from high school , generally between the ages of 16-20 , but most get out of it nowadays .
some are disqualified because of a minor physical disability , but those who get a clean bill of health , like i did , can opt to do community service instead .
the third possibility is to fulfill the civil service requirement abroad , which is what i chose to do . why did you specifically choose asf ? their focus on germany 's historic responsibility to jews living in israel and all over the world appealed to me .
i wanted personally to meet the last survivors of auschwitz or other camps . it is one thing to learn about the nazi period through textbooks , which is an obligatory part of the german school curriculum , but it 's another to learn about the past in a personal way . so the way the nazi period is taught in schools is too cut and dry ? bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : anne frank 's diary is often not part of the school curriculum .
yes .
everyone learns about the facts - that 6 million european jews perished in the holocaust , for example .
we know the names of all the death camps - auschwitz , treblinka - it 's all very impersonal .
we did n't even read the " diary of anne frank " in school .
i read it on my own . the nazi period is such an important and compelling part of the history of this country , but many teachers never inspire the pupils or stimulate real interest in the subject .
there are many germans and jews who are still alive to talk personally about this period .
why do n't teachers simply invite survivors to speak about their experiences in class ? perhaps teachers are still grappling with how to teach the subject .
is there perhaps a sense of collective guilt or discomfort in dealing with this period ? one thing is clear : anyone who was too young during the war or born after the war can not be guilty of anything , but still , it is very important to know about the history of one 's own country and , with that awareness , to ensure that the genocide does not happen again in the future .
we , young germans , have a responsibility to learn from our past . have you talked about the nationalist socialist period with your own grandparents ? not really .
by the time my interest in this subject was awakened , they were too old or dead .
my paternal grandfather is almost 100 years old now .
he was a clockmaker from silesia -lsb- part of the german reich that became part of poland after the war -rsb- .
as a soldier on the eastern front , he was captured by the russians in 1941 and held prisoner of war until 1949 .

other european countries , however , are stepping up the pressure . the european union had hoped a meeting of its foreign ministers in luxembourg would produce a green light for partnership talks with russia .
yet at the end of the meeting , it seemed unlikely that europe would be ready to begin talks at a summit in siberia planned for june .
" it is over for today , " luxembourg 's foreign minister jean asselborn told reporters as the eu foreign ministers ' talks ended on tuesday , april 29 .
" we are a bit blocked . "
lithuania was the main obstacle standing in the way of beginning partnership and cooperation agreement -lrb- pca -rrb- negotiations with russia .
the former soviet republic wanted russian assurances on energy supplies , judicial cooperation and regional security before agreeing to the talks .
the eu will try to push forward the partnership talks , which have been deadlocked for 18 months , at a meeting next week in brussels .
europe would like to have a mandate in place by a planned june summit with russia which will be held in siberia .
siberian summit cutting it close bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : lithuania had promised to block the talks lithuanian officials would not say whether they thought the june timeline remained possible .
" i do n't want to put any timeframe on the talks or the objectives , " lithuanian foreign minister petras vaitiekunas said .
" what is important is ... the quality of the objectives and the quality of the relations with russia . "
vilnius has a tense relationship with moscow .
lithuania objects to russia 's decision to shut-off of a pipeline supplying lithuania 's only oil refinery .
moscow has said a technical problem has led to the halt in energy deliveries .
lithuania is also unhappy about russia 's attitude toward judicial and international cooperation .
the baltic country also wants russia to change its stance on internal border conflicts in georgia and moldova .
russia has supported the territorial claims of breakaway republics in both countries .
europe eager for new energy policy bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the current eu-russia agreement was signed under yeltsin current relations between the eu and russia on issues ranging from energy to education are governed by a pca negotiated with the government of boris yeltsin in 1997 .
europe has found it difficult to negotiate a replacement agreement .
originally , it was poland that blocked talks to protest a russian import ban on polish meat and vegetable products .
the ban has since been lifted and poland agreed to the talks , leaving lithuania the only eu holdout .
any eu country can block negotiations with another country outside the bloc .
" of course , we share lithuania 's worries and the problems they listed , but we also see that it 's better to talk with the russians about all those problems to solve them , " estonian foreign minister urmas paet said .
most other 27 nations which make up the eu want a new agreement with energy-rich russia and have pressured lithuania to agree to the negotiations .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the eu is dependent on russian oil " there are very important interests -lsb- at stake -rsb- , " spanish secretary of state for european affairs diego lopez garrido said before the meeting , citing energy .
" it will be a long negotiation that should start as soon as possible . "

since 1961 , action reconciliation has sent thousands of young germans to israel to volunteer in nursing homes , youth centers , hospitals and memorial sites .
the grassroots work of this social action group became the basis of a political rapprochement between germany and israel , when diplomatic relations were established in 1965 .
today , germany is among israel 's most important allies and trading partners in europe . dw-world.de spoke to philipp pohlmann , 25 , who spent a year volunteering in israel .
today , he is a regional spokesman for the group in the cologne area . dw-world.de : how did you wind up joining asf ? philipp pohlmann : in germany , young men are conscripted into military service after they graduate from high school , generally between the ages of 16-20 , but most get out of it nowadays .
some are disqualified because of a minor physical disability , but those who get a clean bill of health , like i did , can opt to do community service instead .
the third possibility is to fulfill the civil service requirement abroad , which is what i chose to do . why did you specifically choose asf ? their focus on germany 's historic responsibility to jews living in israel and all over the world appealed to me .
i wanted personally to meet the last survivors of auschwitz or other camps . it is one thing to learn about the nazi period through textbooks , which is an obligatory part of the german school curriculum , but it 's another to learn about the past in a personal way . so the way the nazi period is taught in schools is too cut and dry ? bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : anne frank 's diary is often not part of the school curriculum .
yes .
everyone learns about the facts - that 6 million european jews perished in the holocaust , for example .
we know the names of all the death camps - auschwitz , treblinka - it 's all very impersonal .
we did n't even read the " diary of anne frank " in school .
i read it on my own . the nazi period is such an important and compelling part of the history of this country , but many teachers never inspire the pupils or stimulate real interest in the subject .
there are many germans and jews who are still alive to talk personally about this period .
why do n't teachers simply invite survivors to speak about their experiences in class ? perhaps teachers are still grappling with how to teach the subject .
is there perhaps a sense of collective guilt or discomfort in dealing with this period ? one thing is clear : anyone who was too young during the war or born after the war can not be guilty of anything , but still , it is very important to know about the history of one 's own country and , with that awareness , to ensure that the genocide does not happen again in the future .
we , young germans , have a responsibility to learn from our past . have you talked about the nationalist socialist period with your own grandparents ? not really .
by the time my interest in this subject was awakened , they were too old or dead .
my paternal grandfather is almost 100 years old now .
he was a clockmaker from silesia -lsb- part of the german reich that became part of poland after the war -rsb- .
as a soldier on the eastern front , he was captured by the russians in 1941 and held prisoner of war until 1949 .
my grandparents had no nazi sympathies , as far as i know , and i have never heard them utter one bad word about the jews . what did you do as a volunteer for asf in tel aviv ? bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : a church official in cologne hands over a cheque to asf 's philipp pohlmann -lrb- 3rd from right -rrb- as part of the program , i spent one year at a home for the elderly , helping them run daily errands or visit doctors .
we talked a lot and played gin rummy .
they even gave me hebrew lessons , so i 've gotten to the point that i am conversationally fluent now . how did these elderly israelis , some of whom were holocaust survivors , react to you as a german ? this project has been ongoing in israel for decades , so they are used to german volunteers .
many of the elderly happen to be german jews , who often revert back to their mother tongue as they get older , so they were delighted to speak german with me .
they were also very interested in what 's happening in germany .
some residents even subscribed to a local weekly paper in the german language .
jacob bar-or , a frankfurt native in his 80s , who was one of the prosecutors in the adolf eichmann case , even kept abreast of news in germany by reading the frankfurter allgemeine zeitung newspaper on a regular basis . i never encountered any hostility in israel .
the survivors themselves have no problem with me being german .
they know that i 'm in my 20s and had nothing to do with the holocaust .
if anyone had a problem , and this was rare , it was younger people , the grandchildren of holocaust victims , who perhaps never got to know their forebears . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : germany is israel 's best friend in europe .
israel 's peres with germany 's merkel -lrb- right -rrb- can relations between german and israel ever be fully normal ? no , but that is not necessarily a bad thing .
because of the holocaust , the relationship will always be a special one . the holocaust made claims to a jewish state a moral necessity , but does that mean that the germans can not be critical of israel ? for germany , there can be no doubt about israel 's right to exist , but that does not mean we can not be critical of israeli policy , in particular when political leaders meet behind closed doors .
still , germany needs to tread carefully with regard to the israeli-palestinian conflict . was the arab-israeli conflict a part of your daily life in jerusalem or tel aviv ? no , even though i was there during two major suicide attacks in tel aviv in 2002 and 2003 .
this needs to be kept in perspective , though . israel is not the most dangerous place in the world , and most tourists would not even be aware of the presence of suicide bombers .
i 'm more afraid of driving at high speed on the german autobahns than living in israel . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : merkel laid a wreath during a march visit to the yad vashem memorial suicide bombers wo n't deter young germans from volunteering for asf , but what about scrapping military conscription and the civil alternative , which has been up for discussion for years now in germany ? it 's not a problem .
only one third of those who apply , get accepted into one of our programs abroad , simply because the funding is not there to provide more than 180 placements a year .
volunteers are mainly young people , but we 've got a sprinkling of older germans , too .
also , more than half of the volunteers are women , who do n't get drafted into military service anyway .
even among the young men , there are volunteers who are not necessarily doing this to fulfill their civic duty . i did this to avoid the bundeswehr and to fulfill my civic requirement , but as i see it now , i wound up gaining a year , not losing one on my career path as a lawyer .
whenever i go on interviews for jobs or internships , my year at asf has been a huge advantage for me .

today , germany is among israel 's most important allies and trading partners in europe . dw-world.de spoke to philipp pohlmann , 25 , who spent a year volunteering in israel .
today , he is a regional spokesman for the group in the cologne area . dw-world.de : how did you wind up joining asf ? philipp pohlmann : in germany , young men are conscripted into military service after they graduate from high school , generally between the ages of 16-20 , but most get out of it nowadays .
some are disqualified because of a minor physical disability , but those who get a clean bill of health , like i did , can opt to do community service instead .
the third possibility is to fulfill the civil service requirement abroad , which is what i chose to do . why did you specifically choose asf ? their focus on germany 's historic responsibility to jews living in israel and all over the world appealed to me .
i wanted personally to meet the last survivors of auschwitz or other camps . it is one thing to learn about the nazi period through textbooks , which is an obligatory part of the german school curriculum , but it 's another to learn about the past in a personal way . so the way the nazi period is taught in schools is too cut and dry ? bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : anne frank 's diary is often not part of the school curriculum .
yes .
everyone learns about the facts - that 6 million european jews perished in the holocaust , for example .
we know the names of all the death camps - auschwitz , treblinka - it 's all very impersonal .
we did n't even read the " diary of anne frank " in school .
i read it on my own . the nazi period is such an important and compelling part of the history of this country , but many teachers never inspire the pupils or stimulate real interest in the subject .
there are many germans and jews who are still alive to talk personally about this period .
why do n't teachers simply invite survivors to speak about their experiences in class ? perhaps teachers are still grappling with how to teach the subject .
is there perhaps a sense of collective guilt or discomfort in dealing with this period ? one thing is clear : anyone who was too young during the war or born after the war can not be guilty of anything , but still , it is very important to know about the history of one 's own country and , with that awareness , to ensure that the genocide does not happen again in the future .
we , young germans , have a responsibility to learn from our past . have you talked about the nationalist socialist period with your own grandparents ? not really .
by the time my interest in this subject was awakened , they were too old or dead .
my paternal grandfather is almost 100 years old now .
he was a clockmaker from silesia -lsb- part of the german reich that became part of poland after the war -rsb- .
as a soldier on the eastern front , he was captured by the russians in 1941 and held prisoner of war until 1949 .
my grandparents had no nazi sympathies , as far as i know , and i have never heard them utter one bad word about the jews . what did you do as a volunteer for asf in tel aviv ? bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : a church official in cologne hands over a cheque to asf 's philipp pohlmann -lrb- 3rd from right -rrb- as part of the program , i spent one year at a home for the elderly , helping them run daily errands or visit doctors .
we talked a lot and played gin rummy .
they even gave me hebrew lessons , so i 've gotten to the point that i am conversationally fluent now . how did these elderly israelis , some of whom were holocaust survivors , react to you as a german ? this project has been ongoing in israel for decades , so they are used to german volunteers .
many of the elderly happen to be german jews , who often revert back to their mother tongue as they get older , so they were delighted to speak german with me .
they were also very interested in what 's happening in germany .
some residents even subscribed to a local weekly paper in the german language .
jacob bar-or , a frankfurt native in his 80s , who was one of the prosecutors in the adolf eichmann case , even kept abreast of news in germany by reading the frankfurter allgemeine zeitung newspaper on a regular basis . i never encountered any hostility in israel .
the survivors themselves have no problem with me being german .
they know that i 'm in my 20s and had nothing to do with the holocaust .
if anyone had a problem , and this was rare , it was younger people , the grandchildren of holocaust victims , who perhaps never got to know their forebears . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : germany is israel 's best friend in europe .
israel 's peres with germany 's merkel -lrb- right -rrb- can relations between german and israel ever be fully normal ? no , but that is not necessarily a bad thing .
because of the holocaust , the relationship will always be a special one . the holocaust made claims to a jewish state a moral necessity , but does that mean that the germans can not be critical of israel ? for germany , there can be no doubt about israel 's right to exist , but that does not mean we can not be critical of israeli policy , in particular when political leaders meet behind closed doors .
still , germany needs to tread carefully with regard to the israeli-palestinian conflict . was the arab-israeli conflict a part of your daily life in jerusalem or tel aviv ? no , even though i was there during two major suicide attacks in tel aviv in 2002 and 2003 .
this needs to be kept in perspective , though . israel is not the most dangerous place in the world , and most tourists would not even be aware of the presence of suicide bombers .
i 'm more afraid of driving at high speed on the german autobahns than living in israel . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : merkel laid a wreath during a march visit to the yad vashem memorial suicide bombers wo n't deter young germans from volunteering for asf , but what about scrapping military conscription and the civil alternative , which has been up for discussion for years now in germany ? it 's not a problem .
only one third of those who apply , get accepted into one of our programs abroad , simply because the funding is not there to provide more than 180 placements a year .
volunteers are mainly young people , but we 've got a sprinkling of older germans , too .
also , more than half of the volunteers are women , who do n't get drafted into military service anyway .
even among the young men , there are volunteers who are not necessarily doing this to fulfill their civic duty . i did this to avoid the bundeswehr and to fulfill my civic requirement , but as i see it now , i wound up gaining a year , not losing one on my career path as a lawyer .
whenever i go on interviews for jobs or internships , my year at asf has been a huge advantage for me .

other european countries , however , are stepping up the pressure . the european union had hoped a meeting of its foreign ministers in luxembourg would produce a green light for partnership talks with russia .
yet at the end of the meeting , it seemed unlikely that europe would be ready to begin talks at a summit in siberia planned for june .
" it is over for today , " luxembourg 's foreign minister jean asselborn told reporters as the eu foreign ministers ' talks ended on tuesday , april 29 .

no , thanks " and " serbia - russia " serbian caretaker prime minister vojislav kostunica on wednesday , april 30 , dismissed the stabilization and association agreement with the european union as a " false document " which legalizes the secession of kosovo . " those who signed the tabilization and association agreement -lsb- saa -rsb- are fully responsible for it and they signed it in their own names and never in the name of serbia , " kostunica said in an interview with the daily vecernje novosti .
serbian president boris tadic and deputy prime minister bozidar djelic signed the saa , which legalizes the secession of serbia 's province of kosovo and is a precursor to eu membership talks , with the european union on tuesday , a move denounced by serbian nationalists as treason .
the nationalist majority in serbia heaped insults on the saa with the european union , calling its signing " lies and deceit , " " treason , " and " legally null and void . "
kostunica 's democratic party of serbia -lsb- dss -rsb- has said it will take legal action against the pro-europe bloc for signing the saa , while the ultra-nationalist opposition serbian radical party -lsb- srs -rsb- has said it will launch a case to remove tadic from office .
" without an saa there can be no possibility for a full integration of the western balkans into the european union , and without such integration there is no possibility for a final reconciliation amongst the people of the western balkans , " tadic said .
observers hope that the saa will boost the chances of the pro- european bloc , led by tadic , in snap parliamentary elections on may 11 .
rising nationalists challenge pro-europe parties bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : kostunica 's dss party and the radical party oppose the eu the latest surveys published wednesday showed that the anti- european bloc , led by the increasingly nationalist kostunica and ultra-nationalist opposition radical party , could win more seats in parliament than the pro-european parties .
the medium gallup and blic daily poll showed that the nationalists would win 137 seats out of 250 if elections were held right now , while the pro-european bloc would win 113 seats .
if kostunica forms a government with the radicals , that would cement serbia 's turn away from the eu towards russia .
the alternative would be for kostunica to form a coalition with tadic , as he did last year .
observers say that , either way , the process of forming a government will be long and very difficult followed by months of negotiations , political trading and blackmail .
a door to eu membership and stability bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the signing of the accord is seen as a prelude to accession kosovo declared independence from serbia in february .
the youngest european state was recognized by most eu member states and major western powers .
serbia , backed by its ally russia , opposes it .
the saa is a document setting out how an aspiring eu member should reform its political , economic and legal systems to come in line with eu norms , and how the eu should help it do so .
as its name suggests , it is designed to bring basic stability and prosperity to a region devastated by the conflict that erupted after the implosion of the former yugoslavia .
the ratification of serbia 's saa was made conditional on belgrade proving that it was cooperating fully with the international criminal tribunal for the former yugoslavia . dw staff / dpa -lrb- nda -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

kostunica 's democratic party of serbia -lsb- dss -rsb- has said it will take legal action against the pro-europe bloc for signing the saa , while the ultra-nationalist opposition serbian radical party -lsb- srs -rsb- has said it will launch a case to remove tadic from office .
" without an saa there can be no possibility for a full integration of the western balkans into the european union , and without such integration there is no possibility for a final reconciliation amongst the people of the western balkans , " tadic said .
observers hope that the saa will boost the chances of the pro- european bloc , led by tadic , in snap parliamentary elections on may 11 .

the medium gallup and blic daily poll showed that the nationalists would win 137 seats out of 250 if elections were held right now , while the pro-european bloc would win 113 seats .
if kostunica forms a government with the radicals , that would cement serbia 's turn away from the eu towards russia .
the alternative would be for kostunica to form a coalition with tadic , as he did last year .
observers say that , either way , the process of forming a government will be long and very difficult followed by months of negotiations , political trading and blackmail .

apparently they will bend - not to mention stretch , pull and pummel - their principles till it hurts .
eu still waiting for war criminals the eu is loosening its until-now strict stance on serbia - despite the fact that it has long suspected that the serbian government could have delivered its remaining suspected war criminals to the international tribunal for the former yugoslavia , although it failed to do so .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : in luxemburg on april 29 , the eu signed the stabilisation and association agreement with serbia even though it did not fulfil the condition of complete cooperation with the tribunal - a condition that had been clear for months .
now , there appears to be no turning back on the path toward serbia 's eu membership .
after the eu stepped in for kosovo 's independence and made some demands on serbia , it is now time to meet serbia partway .
the pro-european camp in serbia shows a great deal of success and is getting desperately needed election help before voting takes place on may 11 .
it is good that the eu got up the courage to demonstrably strengthen pro-european powers in belgrade .
no good alternatives for europe there was also no especially good alternative : if the nationalistic parties win in serbia on may 11 , things will be looking grim for serbia and the western balkans .
nonetheless , at the urging of the netherlands , the eu left a backdoor open .
the netherlands , traumatized by the 1995 massacre of srebrinica in the bosnian war , which their blue-helmet soldiers failed to prevent , insists strongly upon prosecuting war criminals .
the dutch insisted that the stabilisation and association agreement only be applied when the eu council of ministers determines that serbia is fully cooperating with the tribunal .
luxemburg accord " no empty shell " serbia 's pro-european foreign minister immediately denied that this clause makes the agreement into an “ empty shell . ”
the important thing for the pro-european parties is the strong wind at their backs coming from the direction of luxemburg , he says .
the election on may 11 will be a kind of popular referendum on serbian closeness to europe versus serbian isolation .
with the stabilisation and association agreement , the european union has offered everything it has to offer .
the alternatives are clear .
now it is up to the serbs to decide .

now , there appears to be no turning back on the path toward serbia 's eu membership .
after the eu stepped in for kosovo 's independence and made some demands on serbia , it is now time to meet serbia partway .
the pro-european camp in serbia shows a great deal of success and is getting desperately needed election help before voting takes place on may 11 .
it is good that the eu got up the courage to demonstrably strengthen pro-european powers in belgrade .
no good alternatives for europe there was also no especially good alternative : if the nationalistic parties win in serbia on may 11 , things will be looking grim for serbia and the western balkans .
nonetheless , at the urging of the netherlands , the eu left a backdoor open .
the netherlands , traumatized by the 1995 massacre of srebrinica in the bosnian war , which their blue-helmet soldiers failed to prevent , insists strongly upon prosecuting war criminals .
the dutch insisted that the stabilisation and association agreement only be applied when the eu council of ministers determines that serbia is fully cooperating with the tribunal .
luxemburg accord " no empty shell " serbia 's pro-european foreign minister immediately denied that this clause makes the agreement into an “ empty shell . ”
the important thing for the pro-european parties is the strong wind at their backs coming from the direction of luxemburg , he says .
the election on may 11 will be a kind of popular referendum on serbian closeness to europe versus serbian isolation .
with the stabilisation and association agreement , the european union has offered everything it has to offer .
the alternatives are clear .
now it is up to the serbs to decide .

an archive storing files on those persecuted and killed by the nazis officially opened in the german town of bad arolsen on wednesday , april 30 . the card index , which contains about 47 million documents containing the names of most concentration camp inmates , forced-labour victims and refugees left homeless after world war ii , had been the subject of an intense debate .

wednesday 's opening allows nearly anyone to search inside the archives , an especially important event for those friends and family members still searching for those unaccounted for after the war . meister also sees the files as the most potent answer to holocaust deniers : " anyone who wants to minimize the holocaust should come here .

an archive storing files on those persecuted and killed by the nazis officially opened in the german town of bad arolsen on wednesday , april 30 . the card index , which contains about 47 million documents containing the names of most concentration camp inmates , forced-labour victims and refugees left homeless after world war ii , had been the subject of an intense debate .
jewish groups had been pressing for open access to the collection , a storehouse of captured documents that began being assembled in 1946 . " most of the documents were drawn up by the nazis themselves , " said reto meister , the swiss red cross official now in charge of the files .
" we have documents here about a horrifyingly wide range of victims : jews and christians , eastern and western europeans , germans and non-germans , men and women .
there 's not one country where victims did not come from . " opening the archive bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the archive contains index cards on nazi victims .
previously , viewing the archive was limited only to survivors and close relations of the dead .
all of that changed last year , when the members of the 11-nation governing commission of the international tracing service of the international committee of the red cross agreed to provide greater access to the archives , ending a five-decade long debate over the victims ' rights to privacy . earlier this year , the archive opened to historians .
wednesday 's opening allows nearly anyone to search inside the archives , an especially important event for those friends and family members still searching for those unaccounted for after the war . meister also sees the files as the most potent answer to holocaust deniers : " anyone who wants to minimize the holocaust should come here .
we 'll show him documents by the million .

no , thanks " and " serbia - russia " serbian caretaker prime minister vojislav kostunica on wednesday , april 30 , dismissed the stabilization and association agreement with the european union as a " false document " which legalizes the secession of kosovo . " those who signed the tabilization and association agreement -lsb- saa -rsb- are fully responsible for it and they signed it in their own names and never in the name of serbia , " kostunica said in an interview with the daily vecernje novosti .
serbian president boris tadic and deputy prime minister bozidar djelic signed the saa , which legalizes the secession of serbia 's province of kosovo and is a precursor to eu membership talks , with the european union on tuesday , a move denounced by serbian nationalists as treason .
the nationalist majority in serbia heaped insults on the saa with the european union , calling its signing " lies and deceit , " " treason , " and " legally null and void . "
kostunica 's democratic party of serbia -lsb- dss -rsb- has said it will take legal action against the pro-europe bloc for signing the saa , while the ultra-nationalist opposition serbian radical party -lsb- srs -rsb- has said it will launch a case to remove tadic from office .
" without an saa there can be no possibility for a full integration of the western balkans into the european union , and without such integration there is no possibility for a final reconciliation amongst the people of the western balkans , " tadic said .
observers hope that the saa will boost the chances of the pro- european bloc , led by tadic , in snap parliamentary elections on may 11 .
rising nationalists challenge pro-europe parties bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : kostunica 's dss party and the radical party oppose the eu the latest surveys published wednesday showed that the anti- european bloc , led by the increasingly nationalist kostunica and ultra-nationalist opposition radical party , could win more seats in parliament than the pro-european parties .
the medium gallup and blic daily poll showed that the nationalists would win 137 seats out of 250 if elections were held right now , while the pro-european bloc would win 113 seats .
if kostunica forms a government with the radicals , that would cement serbia 's turn away from the eu towards russia .
the alternative would be for kostunica to form a coalition with tadic , as he did last year .
observers say that , either way , the process of forming a government will be long and very difficult followed by months of negotiations , political trading and blackmail .
a door to eu membership and stability bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the signing of the accord is seen as a prelude to accession kosovo declared independence from serbia in february .
the youngest european state was recognized by most eu member states and major western powers .
serbia , backed by its ally russia , opposes it .
the saa is a document setting out how an aspiring eu member should reform its political , economic and legal systems to come in line with eu norms , and how the eu should help it do so .
as its name suggests , it is designed to bring basic stability and prosperity to a region devastated by the conflict that erupted after the implosion of the former yugoslavia .
the ratification of serbia 's saa was made conditional on belgrade proving that it was cooperating fully with the international criminal tribunal for the former yugoslavia . dw staff / dpa -lrb- nda -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

other european countries , however , are stepping up the pressure . the european union had hoped a meeting of its foreign ministers in luxembourg would produce a green light for partnership talks with russia .
yet at the end of the meeting , it seemed unlikely that europe would be ready to begin talks at a summit in siberia planned for june .
" it is over for today , " luxembourg 's foreign minister jean asselborn told reporters as the eu foreign ministers ' talks ended on tuesday , april 29 .
" we are a bit blocked . "
lithuania was the main obstacle standing in the way of beginning partnership and cooperation agreement -lrb- pca -rrb- negotiations with russia .
the former soviet republic wanted russian assurances on energy supplies , judicial cooperation and regional security before agreeing to the talks .
the eu will try to push forward the partnership talks , which have been deadlocked for 18 months , at a meeting next week in brussels .
europe would like to have a mandate in place by a planned june summit with russia which will be held in siberia .
siberian summit cutting it close bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : lithuania had promised to block the talks lithuanian officials would not say whether they thought the june timeline remained possible .
" i do n't want to put any timeframe on the talks or the objectives , " lithuanian foreign minister petras vaitiekunas said .
" what is important is ... the quality of the objectives and the quality of the relations with russia . "
vilnius has a tense relationship with moscow .
lithuania objects to russia 's decision to shut-off of a pipeline supplying lithuania 's only oil refinery .
moscow has said a technical problem has led to the halt in energy deliveries .
lithuania is also unhappy about russia 's attitude toward judicial and international cooperation .
the baltic country also wants russia to change its stance on internal border conflicts in georgia and moldova .
russia has supported the territorial claims of breakaway republics in both countries .
europe eager for new energy policy bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the current eu-russia agreement was signed under yeltsin current relations between the eu and russia on issues ranging from energy to education are governed by a pca negotiated with the government of boris yeltsin in 1997 .
europe has found it difficult to negotiate a replacement agreement .
originally , it was poland that blocked talks to protest a russian import ban on polish meat and vegetable products .
the ban has since been lifted and poland agreed to the talks , leaving lithuania the only eu holdout .

no , thanks " and " serbia - russia " serbian caretaker prime minister vojislav kostunica on wednesday , april 30 , dismissed the stabilization and association agreement with the european union as a " false document " which legalizes the secession of kosovo . " those who signed the tabilization and association agreement -lsb- saa -rsb- are fully responsible for it and they signed it in their own names and never in the name of serbia , " kostunica said in an interview with the daily vecernje novosti .
serbian president boris tadic and deputy prime minister bozidar djelic signed the saa , which legalizes the secession of serbia 's province of kosovo and is a precursor to eu membership talks , with the european union on tuesday , a move denounced by serbian nationalists as treason .
the nationalist majority in serbia heaped insults on the saa with the european union , calling its signing " lies and deceit , " " treason , " and " legally null and void . "
kostunica 's democratic party of serbia -lsb- dss -rsb- has said it will take legal action against the pro-europe bloc for signing the saa , while the ultra-nationalist opposition serbian radical party -lsb- srs -rsb- has said it will launch a case to remove tadic from office .
" without an saa there can be no possibility for a full integration of the western balkans into the european union , and without such integration there is no possibility for a final reconciliation amongst the people of the western balkans , " tadic said .
observers hope that the saa will boost the chances of the pro- european bloc , led by tadic , in snap parliamentary elections on may 11 .
rising nationalists challenge pro-europe parties bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : kostunica 's dss party and the radical party oppose the eu the latest surveys published wednesday showed that the anti- european bloc , led by the increasingly nationalist kostunica and ultra-nationalist opposition radical party , could win more seats in parliament than the pro-european parties .
the medium gallup and blic daily poll showed that the nationalists would win 137 seats out of 250 if elections were held right now , while the pro-european bloc would win 113 seats .
if kostunica forms a government with the radicals , that would cement serbia 's turn away from the eu towards russia .
the alternative would be for kostunica to form a coalition with tadic , as he did last year .
observers say that , either way , the process of forming a government will be long and very difficult followed by months of negotiations , political trading and blackmail .
a door to eu membership and stability bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the signing of the accord is seen as a prelude to accession kosovo declared independence from serbia in february .
the youngest european state was recognized by most eu member states and major western powers .
serbia , backed by its ally russia , opposes it .
the saa is a document setting out how an aspiring eu member should reform its political , economic and legal systems to come in line with eu norms , and how the eu should help it do so .
as its name suggests , it is designed to bring basic stability and prosperity to a region devastated by the conflict that erupted after the implosion of the former yugoslavia .
the ratification of serbia 's saa was made conditional on belgrade proving that it was cooperating fully with the international criminal tribunal for the former yugoslavia . dw staff / dpa -lrb- nda -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

other european countries , however , are stepping up the pressure . the european union had hoped a meeting of its foreign ministers in luxembourg would produce a green light for partnership talks with russia .
yet at the end of the meeting , it seemed unlikely that europe would be ready to begin talks at a summit in siberia planned for june .
" it is over for today , " luxembourg 's foreign minister jean asselborn told reporters as the eu foreign ministers ' talks ended on tuesday , april 29 .
" we are a bit blocked . "
lithuania was the main obstacle standing in the way of beginning partnership and cooperation agreement -lrb- pca -rrb- negotiations with russia .
the former soviet republic wanted russian assurances on energy supplies , judicial cooperation and regional security before agreeing to the talks .
the eu will try to push forward the partnership talks , which have been deadlocked for 18 months , at a meeting next week in brussels .
europe would like to have a mandate in place by a planned june summit with russia which will be held in siberia .
siberian summit cutting it close bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : lithuania had promised to block the talks lithuanian officials would not say whether they thought the june timeline remained possible .
" i do n't want to put any timeframe on the talks or the objectives , " lithuanian foreign minister petras vaitiekunas said .
" what is important is ... the quality of the objectives and the quality of the relations with russia . "
vilnius has a tense relationship with moscow .
lithuania objects to russia 's decision to shut-off of a pipeline supplying lithuania 's only oil refinery .
moscow has said a technical problem has led to the halt in energy deliveries .
lithuania is also unhappy about russia 's attitude toward judicial and international cooperation .
the baltic country also wants russia to change its stance on internal border conflicts in georgia and moldova .
russia has supported the territorial claims of breakaway republics in both countries .
europe eager for new energy policy bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the current eu-russia agreement was signed under yeltsin current relations between the eu and russia on issues ranging from energy to education are governed by a pca negotiated with the government of boris yeltsin in 1997 .
europe has found it difficult to negotiate a replacement agreement .
originally , it was poland that blocked talks to protest a russian import ban on polish meat and vegetable products .
the ban has since been lifted and poland agreed to the talks , leaving lithuania the only eu holdout .
any eu country can block negotiations with another country outside the bloc .
" of course , we share lithuania 's worries and the problems they listed , but we also see that it 's better to talk with the russians about all those problems to solve them , " estonian foreign minister urmas paet said .
most other 27 nations which make up the eu want a new agreement with energy-rich russia and have pressured lithuania to agree to the negotiations .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the eu is dependent on russian oil " there are very important interests -lsb- at stake -rsb- , " spanish secretary of state for european affairs diego lopez garrido said before the meeting , citing energy .
" it will be a long negotiation that should start as soon as possible . "
" we do believe that the eu should begin this process of a partnership and cooperation agreement , " added british europe minister jim murphy .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de opinion -pipe- 30.04.2008 opinion : by bending principles , eu cracks open door for serbia großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : with parliamentary elections looming in serbia , the eu has done its best to pave the way for the country to enter eu accession talks – and rightly so , says dw ’ s bernd riegert . the goal is clear : serbia must be integrated in the european union , or else there is little chance for long-term stability in the balkans .
in order to reach this goal , the eu members are prepared to make vast concessions to the serbian government in its election .
apparently they will bend - not to mention stretch , pull and pummel - their principles till it hurts .
eu still waiting for war criminals the eu is loosening its until-now strict stance on serbia - despite the fact that it has long suspected that the serbian government could have delivered its remaining suspected war criminals to the international tribunal for the former yugoslavia , although it failed to do so .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : in luxemburg on april 29 , the eu signed the stabilisation and association agreement with serbia even though it did not fulfil the condition of complete cooperation with the tribunal - a condition that had been clear for months .
now , there appears to be no turning back on the path toward serbia 's eu membership .
after the eu stepped in for kosovo 's independence and made some demands on serbia , it is now time to meet serbia partway .
the pro-european camp in serbia shows a great deal of success and is getting desperately needed election help before voting takes place on may 11 .
it is good that the eu got up the courage to demonstrably strengthen pro-european powers in belgrade .
no good alternatives for europe there was also no especially good alternative : if the nationalistic parties win in serbia on may 11 , things will be looking grim for serbia and the western balkans .
nonetheless , at the urging of the netherlands , the eu left a backdoor open .
the netherlands , traumatized by the 1995 massacre of srebrinica in the bosnian war , which their blue-helmet soldiers failed to prevent , insists strongly upon prosecuting war criminals .
the dutch insisted that the stabilisation and association agreement only be applied when the eu council of ministers determines that serbia is fully cooperating with the tribunal .
luxemburg accord " no empty shell " serbia 's pro-european foreign minister immediately denied that this clause makes the agreement into an “ empty shell . ”
the important thing for the pro-european parties is the strong wind at their backs coming from the direction of luxemburg , he says .
the election on may 11 will be a kind of popular referendum on serbian closeness to europe versus serbian isolation .
with the stabilisation and association agreement , the european union has offered everything it has to offer .
the alternatives are clear .
now it is up to the serbs to decide .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de opinion -pipe- 30.04.2008 opinion : by bending principles , eu cracks open door for serbia großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : with parliamentary elections looming in serbia , the eu has done its best to pave the way for the country to enter eu accession talks – and rightly so , says dw ’ s bernd riegert . the goal is clear : serbia must be integrated in the european union , or else there is little chance for long-term stability in the balkans .
in order to reach this goal , the eu members are prepared to make vast concessions to the serbian government in its election .
apparently they will bend - not to mention stretch , pull and pummel - their principles till it hurts .
eu still waiting for war criminals the eu is loosening its until-now strict stance on serbia - despite the fact that it has long suspected that the serbian government could have delivered its remaining suspected war criminals to the international tribunal for the former yugoslavia , although it failed to do so .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : in luxemburg on april 29 , the eu signed the stabilisation and association agreement with serbia even though it did not fulfil the condition of complete cooperation with the tribunal - a condition that had been clear for months .
now , there appears to be no turning back on the path toward serbia 's eu membership .
after the eu stepped in for kosovo 's independence and made some demands on serbia , it is now time to meet serbia partway .
the pro-european camp in serbia shows a great deal of success and is getting desperately needed election help before voting takes place on may 11 .
it is good that the eu got up the courage to demonstrably strengthen pro-european powers in belgrade .
no good alternatives for europe there was also no especially good alternative : if the nationalistic parties win in serbia on may 11 , things will be looking grim for serbia and the western balkans .
nonetheless , at the urging of the netherlands , the eu left a backdoor open .
the netherlands , traumatized by the 1995 massacre of srebrinica in the bosnian war , which their blue-helmet soldiers failed to prevent , insists strongly upon prosecuting war criminals .
the dutch insisted that the stabilisation and association agreement only be applied when the eu council of ministers determines that serbia is fully cooperating with the tribunal .
luxemburg accord " no empty shell " serbia 's pro-european foreign minister immediately denied that this clause makes the agreement into an “ empty shell . ”
the important thing for the pro-european parties is the strong wind at their backs coming from the direction of luxemburg , he says .
the election on may 11 will be a kind of popular referendum on serbian closeness to europe versus serbian isolation .
with the stabilisation and association agreement , the european union has offered everything it has to offer .
the alternatives are clear .
now it is up to the serbs to decide .

dw-world.de serbian nationalists reject signing of eu agreement as treason serbian caretaker prime minister vojislav kostunica on wednesday dismissed the stabilization and association agreement with the european union as a " false document " which legalizes the secession of kosovo .
-lrb- 30.04.2008 -rrb- serbia steps closer to eu with signing of long-delayed pact serbia has signed a key agreement that will bring it closer to coveted european union membership .
but the balkan country will have to convince its eu partners and its own countrymen that it 's ready to join the bloc .
-lrb- 29.04.2008 -rrb- divided eu seeks to boost pro-european parties in serbia after belgium and the netherlands gave a conditional green light to a serbia-eu pact , the 27-member bloc will try to agree on a gesture of support to pro-western parties in serbia before elections on may 11 .

one child had died . " astonishing " reunion austrian authorities said on tuesday , april 29 that members of the family terrorized by decades of incest and imprisonment had an “ astonishing ” reunion at a clinic , where psychiatrists are helping them cope . hospital officials said most of the seven children fritzl fathered over the past 24 years with the daughter he held captive in a windowless cell spent their first moments together sunday , april 27 - a day after those kept confined finally gained their freedom . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the case is a challenge for the mostviertel mental clinic clinic director berthold kepplinger told reporters tuesday the meeting also reunited the suspect 's wife with the daughter fritzl had led her to believe left home to join a religious cult , but instead was imprisoned in a cramped warren of secured and soundproofed cellar rooms . fritzl was remanded to court custody on tuesday .
meanwhile , investigators are looking into suspicions that fritzl may have had help in caring for and keeping secret the presence of a family living hidden in his basement . report claims son had cellar key a report by the women ’ s magazine brigitte has uncovered a claim that fritzl ’ s son and elisabeth ’ s brother , thomas , had a key to the cellar .
a couple who rented an upstairs room in the house , in the austrian town of amstetten , said that thomas called himself the house “ superintendent ” and made regular trips to the cellar to get things for minor repairs . the couple said they themselves were not allowed near the cellar , and were not allowed to rent a cellar storage room , although that his common practice in austria . police are also taking into account the fact that fritzl had made several trips to thailand , and are looking into how the captive family may have gotten food and other goods while he was away . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : investigators uncovered tiny hideaway authorities have also raised the question of who may have helped the man build a cellar that includes a 300 kilogram steel and cement door .
fritzl was given permission to build the cellar as a bomb shelter in the late 1970s . since the case came to light , fritzl ’ s 42 year old daughter , elisabeth , and her children have been carefully shielded from public glare , undergoing psychiatric counselling to help them try to adjust after their unimaginable ordeal . cult cover-story for adoptive " grandkids " fritzl had told his wife that their daughter had run away to join a cult .
in reality she was locked underground in the 60 square meter -lrb- 650 square feet -rrb- underground rooms . mother and daughter were reunited this week for the first time in a quarter century . fritzl explained the presence of three of the grandchildren whom he adopted to his wife and to the community by claiming elisabeth had given birth to them at the cult , and then delivered them to his doorstep for the older couple to care for . three other children – aged 19 , 18 and 5 - lived belowground with their mother in the cell .
they first saw daylight when they were rescued . daughter 's illness leads to family 's release one child , a twin , had died shortly after birth .
fritzl has admitted to burning the corpse in the house ’ s boiler . the decision on which children lived aboveground and which below depended on whether they were “ screaming babies ” and on their general halth , explained chief inspector leopold etz from the lower austrian criminal investigators office . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : a bathroom in the shocking home-prison the case came to light because one of the children , 19 year old kerstin , was severely ill .

they televised an urgent call elisabeth to come back and save the daughter ’ s life . elisabeth saw the call on television , and was able to convince her father to let her go to the hospital .
she seized the chance to speak privately to a doctor and explain her situation .
fritzl was arrested the same day . fritzl ’ s admission that he burned the body of the dead seventh child could prove pivotal when the case comes to trial , with a prosecutor saying he would face a life sentence if found guilty of manslaughter , as opposed to shorter prison terms for rape or incarceration . psychologist paulus hochgatterer , who is helping advise those counselling the family , told afp news service that the three children fritzl had kept underground are staying in a sequestered treatment container that could be locked from the inside . slow road to recovery ? safely shielded from the media circus that has set up camp in amstetten , he said their initial treatment could take several weeks . " only very gradually are they being exposed to the outside world , " hochgatterer said , adding that " given the circumstances , they 're actually doing quite well . " the two sets of children are now tentatively beginning to get to know one another .
the youngest child , five years old , seems most able to adapt to his new life , his caretakers said . experts said the family is likely to need years of therapy . " it could take between five and eight years , " said max friedrich , the psychiatrist who looked after another sequestration victim , natascha kampusch , in an interview with the daily oesterreich . the head of the local social services , hans-heinz lenze , said a name-change had been suggested for the immediate victims , but fritzl 's other family as well , in order to give them a new start in life . long-term investigation expected " at the moment , all possibilities are being sounded out in closest consultation with the family .

chief investigator franz polzer told austrian television that police might need " half a year " to complete their investigations .
he ruled out any suggestion fritzl might have had an accomplice . " as our investigations now stand , there were no accomplices .
but you can never be 100 percent certain . " doctors would determine when police would be allowed to question elisabeth fritzl and the children , but that was unlikely to be for several days . fritzl had officially adopted the three aboveground children , after showing authorities letters signed by elizabeth that said she could not care for them , and which asked that they try not to track her down for the sake of herself and her children . fritzl was allowed to adopt despite a reported conviction of attempted rape in the 1960s and of arson , but the records were wiped after a period of time set by austrian law . the district court in amstetten , which had greenlighted the adoptions , said it had followed protocol in the adoption proceedings and had had acted correctly . no sign of wife 's complicity " there were n't any doubts about his -lrb- fritzl 's -rrb- integrity .
why should i put the child in a foster home , when it could grow up in a family , " court president josef schoegl told the austria press agency . chief police investigator franz polzer said there was no sign that fritzl 's wife , who also had seven children with him , knew of the goings on in his locked dungeon . in the town of amstetten , more than 200 people including dozens of youngsters quietly held a candlelight vigil in the main square late tuesday , as the town of 23,000 sought to cast off the notoriety brought to their doorstep by fritzl . shocked residents react " shock , sadness , rage and perhaps also hatred have gripped us these last few days , " pastor peter boesendorfer told those gathered .

in order to reach this goal , the eu members are prepared to make vast concessions to the serbian government in its election .
apparently they will bend - not to mention stretch , pull and pummel - their principles till it hurts .
eu still waiting for war criminals the eu is loosening its until-now strict stance on serbia - despite the fact that it has long suspected that the serbian government could have delivered its remaining suspected war criminals to the international tribunal for the former yugoslavia , although it failed to do so .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : in luxemburg on april 29 , the eu signed the stabilisation and association agreement with serbia even though it did not fulfil the condition of complete cooperation with the tribunal - a condition that had been clear for months .
now , there appears to be no turning back on the path toward serbia 's eu membership .
after the eu stepped in for kosovo 's independence and made some demands on serbia , it is now time to meet serbia partway .
the pro-european camp in serbia shows a great deal of success and is getting desperately needed election help before voting takes place on may 11 .
it is good that the eu got up the courage to demonstrably strengthen pro-european powers in belgrade .
no good alternatives for europe there was also no especially good alternative : if the nationalistic parties win in serbia on may 11 , things will be looking grim for serbia and the western balkans .
nonetheless , at the urging of the netherlands , the eu left a backdoor open .
the netherlands , traumatized by the 1995 massacre of srebrinica in the bosnian war , which their blue-helmet soldiers failed to prevent , insists strongly upon prosecuting war criminals .
the dutch insisted that the stabilisation and association agreement only be applied when the eu council of ministers determines that serbia is fully cooperating with the tribunal .
luxemburg accord " no empty shell " serbia 's pro-european foreign minister immediately denied that this clause makes the agreement into an “ empty shell . ”
the important thing for the pro-european parties is the strong wind at their backs coming from the direction of luxemburg , he says .
the election on may 11 will be a kind of popular referendum on serbian closeness to europe versus serbian isolation .
with the stabilisation and association agreement , the european union has offered everything it has to offer .
the alternatives are clear .
now it is up to the serbs to decide .

other european countries , however , are stepping up the pressure . the european union had hoped a meeting of its foreign ministers in luxembourg would produce a green light for partnership talks with russia .
yet at the end of the meeting , it seemed unlikely that europe would be ready to begin talks at a summit in siberia planned for june .
" it is over for today , " luxembourg 's foreign minister jean asselborn told reporters as the eu foreign ministers ' talks ended on tuesday , april 29 .
" we are a bit blocked . "
lithuania was the main obstacle standing in the way of beginning partnership and cooperation agreement -lrb- pca -rrb- negotiations with russia .
the former soviet republic wanted russian assurances on energy supplies , judicial cooperation and regional security before agreeing to the talks .
the eu will try to push forward the partnership talks , which have been deadlocked for 18 months , at a meeting next week in brussels .
europe would like to have a mandate in place by a planned june summit with russia which will be held in siberia .
siberian summit cutting it close bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : lithuania had promised to block the talks lithuanian officials would not say whether they thought the june timeline remained possible .
" i do n't want to put any timeframe on the talks or the objectives , " lithuanian foreign minister petras vaitiekunas said .
" what is important is ... the quality of the objectives and the quality of the relations with russia . "
vilnius has a tense relationship with moscow .
lithuania objects to russia 's decision to shut-off of a pipeline supplying lithuania 's only oil refinery .
moscow has said a technical problem has led to the halt in energy deliveries .
lithuania is also unhappy about russia 's attitude toward judicial and international cooperation .
the baltic country also wants russia to change its stance on internal border conflicts in georgia and moldova .
russia has supported the territorial claims of breakaway republics in both countries .
europe eager for new energy policy bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the current eu-russia agreement was signed under yeltsin current relations between the eu and russia on issues ranging from energy to education are governed by a pca negotiated with the government of boris yeltsin in 1997 .
europe has found it difficult to negotiate a replacement agreement .
originally , it was poland that blocked talks to protest a russian import ban on polish meat and vegetable products .
the ban has since been lifted and poland agreed to the talks , leaving lithuania the only eu holdout .
any eu country can block negotiations with another country outside the bloc .
" of course , we share lithuania 's worries and the problems they listed , but we also see that it 's better to talk with the russians about all those problems to solve them , " estonian foreign minister urmas paet said .
most other 27 nations which make up the eu want a new agreement with energy-rich russia and have pressured lithuania to agree to the negotiations .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the eu is dependent on russian oil " there are very important interests -lsb- at stake -rsb- , " spanish secretary of state for european affairs diego lopez garrido said before the meeting , citing energy .
" it will be a long negotiation that should start as soon as possible . "
" we do believe that the eu should begin this process of a partnership and cooperation agreement , " added british europe minister jim murphy .

in order to reach this goal , the eu members are prepared to make vast concessions to the serbian government in its election .
apparently they will bend - not to mention stretch , pull and pummel - their principles till it hurts .
eu still waiting for war criminals the eu is loosening its until-now strict stance on serbia - despite the fact that it has long suspected that the serbian government could have delivered its remaining suspected war criminals to the international tribunal for the former yugoslavia , although it failed to do so .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : in luxemburg on april 29 , the eu signed the stabilisation and association agreement with serbia even though it did not fulfil the condition of complete cooperation with the tribunal - a condition that had been clear for months .
now , there appears to be no turning back on the path toward serbia 's eu membership .
after the eu stepped in for kosovo 's independence and made some demands on serbia , it is now time to meet serbia partway .
the pro-european camp in serbia shows a great deal of success and is getting desperately needed election help before voting takes place on may 11 .
it is good that the eu got up the courage to demonstrably strengthen pro-european powers in belgrade .

nonetheless , at the urging of the netherlands , the eu left a backdoor open .
the netherlands , traumatized by the 1995 massacre of srebrinica in the bosnian war , which their blue-helmet soldiers failed to prevent , insists strongly upon prosecuting war criminals .

other european countries , however , are stepping up the pressure . the european union had hoped a meeting of its foreign ministers in luxembourg would produce a green light for partnership talks with russia .
yet at the end of the meeting , it seemed unlikely that europe would be ready to begin talks at a summit in siberia planned for june .
" it is over for today , " luxembourg 's foreign minister jean asselborn told reporters as the eu foreign ministers ' talks ended on tuesday , april 29 .
" we are a bit blocked . "
lithuania was the main obstacle standing in the way of beginning partnership and cooperation agreement -lrb- pca -rrb- negotiations with russia .
the former soviet republic wanted russian assurances on energy supplies , judicial cooperation and regional security before agreeing to the talks .
the eu will try to push forward the partnership talks , which have been deadlocked for 18 months , at a meeting next week in brussels .
europe would like to have a mandate in place by a planned june summit with russia which will be held in siberia .
siberian summit cutting it close bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : lithuania had promised to block the talks lithuanian officials would not say whether they thought the june timeline remained possible .
" i do n't want to put any timeframe on the talks or the objectives , " lithuanian foreign minister petras vaitiekunas said .
" what is important is ... the quality of the objectives and the quality of the relations with russia . "
vilnius has a tense relationship with moscow .
lithuania objects to russia 's decision to shut-off of a pipeline supplying lithuania 's only oil refinery .
moscow has said a technical problem has led to the halt in energy deliveries .
lithuania is also unhappy about russia 's attitude toward judicial and international cooperation .
the baltic country also wants russia to change its stance on internal border conflicts in georgia and moldova .
russia has supported the territorial claims of breakaway republics in both countries .
europe eager for new energy policy bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the current eu-russia agreement was signed under yeltsin current relations between the eu and russia on issues ranging from energy to education are governed by a pca negotiated with the government of boris yeltsin in 1997 .
europe has found it difficult to negotiate a replacement agreement .
originally , it was poland that blocked talks to protest a russian import ban on polish meat and vegetable products .
the ban has since been lifted and poland agreed to the talks , leaving lithuania the only eu holdout .
any eu country can block negotiations with another country outside the bloc .
" of course , we share lithuania 's worries and the problems they listed , but we also see that it 's better to talk with the russians about all those problems to solve them , " estonian foreign minister urmas paet said .
most other 27 nations which make up the eu want a new agreement with energy-rich russia and have pressured lithuania to agree to the negotiations .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the eu is dependent on russian oil " there are very important interests -lsb- at stake -rsb- , " spanish secretary of state for european affairs diego lopez garrido said before the meeting , citing energy .
" it will be a long negotiation that should start as soon as possible . "

no , thanks " and " serbia - russia " serbian caretaker prime minister vojislav kostunica on wednesday , april 30 , dismissed the stabilization and association agreement with the european union as a " false document " which legalizes the secession of kosovo . " those who signed the tabilization and association agreement -lsb- saa -rsb- are fully responsible for it and they signed it in their own names and never in the name of serbia , " kostunica said in an interview with the daily vecernje novosti .
serbian president boris tadic and deputy prime minister bozidar djelic signed the saa , which legalizes the secession of serbia 's province of kosovo and is a precursor to eu membership talks , with the european union on tuesday , a move denounced by serbian nationalists as treason .
the nationalist majority in serbia heaped insults on the saa with the european union , calling its signing " lies and deceit , " " treason , " and " legally null and void . "
kostunica 's democratic party of serbia -lsb- dss -rsb- has said it will take legal action against the pro-europe bloc for signing the saa , while the ultra-nationalist opposition serbian radical party -lsb- srs -rsb- has said it will launch a case to remove tadic from office .
" without an saa there can be no possibility for a full integration of the western balkans into the european union , and without such integration there is no possibility for a final reconciliation amongst the people of the western balkans , " tadic said .
observers hope that the saa will boost the chances of the pro- european bloc , led by tadic , in snap parliamentary elections on may 11 .
rising nationalists challenge pro-europe parties bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : kostunica 's dss party and the radical party oppose the eu the latest surveys published wednesday showed that the anti- european bloc , led by the increasingly nationalist kostunica and ultra-nationalist opposition radical party , could win more seats in parliament than the pro-european parties .
the medium gallup and blic daily poll showed that the nationalists would win 137 seats out of 250 if elections were held right now , while the pro-european bloc would win 113 seats .
if kostunica forms a government with the radicals , that would cement serbia 's turn away from the eu towards russia .
the alternative would be for kostunica to form a coalition with tadic , as he did last year .
observers say that , either way , the process of forming a government will be long and very difficult followed by months of negotiations , political trading and blackmail .
a door to eu membership and stability bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the signing of the accord is seen as a prelude to accession kosovo declared independence from serbia in february .
the youngest european state was recognized by most eu member states and major western powers .
serbia , backed by its ally russia , opposes it .
the saa is a document setting out how an aspiring eu member should reform its political , economic and legal systems to come in line with eu norms , and how the eu should help it do so .
as its name suggests , it is designed to bring basic stability and prosperity to a region devastated by the conflict that erupted after the implosion of the former yugoslavia .
the ratification of serbia 's saa was made conditional on belgrade proving that it was cooperating fully with the international criminal tribunal for the former yugoslavia . dw staff / dpa -lrb- nda -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

no , thanks " and " serbia - russia " serbian caretaker prime minister vojislav kostunica on wednesday , april 30 , dismissed the stabilization and association agreement with the european union as a " false document " which legalizes the secession of kosovo . " those who signed the tabilization and association agreement -lsb- saa -rsb- are fully responsible for it and they signed it in their own names and never in the name of serbia , " kostunica said in an interview with the daily vecernje novosti .
serbian president boris tadic and deputy prime minister bozidar djelic signed the saa , which legalizes the secession of serbia 's province of kosovo and is a precursor to eu membership talks , with the european union on tuesday , a move denounced by serbian nationalists as treason .
the nationalist majority in serbia heaped insults on the saa with the european union , calling its signing " lies and deceit , " " treason , " and " legally null and void . "
kostunica 's democratic party of serbia -lsb- dss -rsb- has said it will take legal action against the pro-europe bloc for signing the saa , while the ultra-nationalist opposition serbian radical party -lsb- srs -rsb- has said it will launch a case to remove tadic from office .
" without an saa there can be no possibility for a full integration of the western balkans into the european union , and without such integration there is no possibility for a final reconciliation amongst the people of the western balkans , " tadic said .
observers hope that the saa will boost the chances of the pro- european bloc , led by tadic , in snap parliamentary elections on may 11 .

the medium gallup and blic daily poll showed that the nationalists would win 137 seats out of 250 if elections were held right now , while the pro-european bloc would win 113 seats .
if kostunica forms a government with the radicals , that would cement serbia 's turn away from the eu towards russia .
the alternative would be for kostunica to form a coalition with tadic , as he did last year .
observers say that , either way , the process of forming a government will be long and very difficult followed by months of negotiations , political trading and blackmail .

moscow maintains the troops are serving in a peacekeeping mission .

one child had died . " astonishing " reunion austrian authorities said on tuesday , april 29 that members of the family terrorized by decades of incest and imprisonment had an “ astonishing ” reunion at a clinic , where psychiatrists are helping them cope . hospital officials said most of the seven children fritzl fathered over the past 24 years with the daughter he held captive in a windowless cell spent their first moments together sunday , april 27 - a day after those kept confined finally gained their freedom . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the case is a challenge for the mostviertel mental clinic clinic director berthold kepplinger told reporters tuesday the meeting also reunited the suspect 's wife with the daughter fritzl had led her to believe left home to join a religious cult , but instead was imprisoned in a cramped warren of secured and soundproofed cellar rooms . fritzl was remanded to court custody on tuesday .
meanwhile , investigators are looking into suspicions that fritzl may have had help in caring for and keeping secret the presence of a family living hidden in his basement . report claims son had cellar key a report by the women ’ s magazine brigitte has uncovered a claim that fritzl ’ s son and elisabeth ’ s brother , thomas , had a key to the cellar .
a couple who rented an upstairs room in the house , in the austrian town of amstetten , said that thomas called himself the house “ superintendent ” and made regular trips to the cellar to get things for minor repairs . the couple said they themselves were not allowed near the cellar , and were not allowed to rent a cellar storage room , although that his common practice in austria . police are also taking into account the fact that fritzl had made several trips to thailand , and are looking into how the captive family may have gotten food and other goods while he was away . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : investigators uncovered tiny hideaway authorities have also raised the question of who may have helped the man build a cellar that includes a 300 kilogram steel and cement door .
fritzl was given permission to build the cellar as a bomb shelter in the late 1970s . since the case came to light , fritzl ’ s 42 year old daughter , elisabeth , and her children have been carefully shielded from public glare , undergoing psychiatric counselling to help them try to adjust after their unimaginable ordeal . cult cover-story for adoptive " grandkids " fritzl had told his wife that their daughter had run away to join a cult .
in reality she was locked underground in the 60 square meter -lrb- 650 square feet -rrb- underground rooms . mother and daughter were reunited this week for the first time in a quarter century . fritzl explained the presence of three of the grandchildren whom he adopted to his wife and to the community by claiming elisabeth had given birth to them at the cult , and then delivered them to his doorstep for the older couple to care for . three other children – aged 19 , 18 and 5 - lived belowground with their mother in the cell .
they first saw daylight when they were rescued . daughter 's illness leads to family 's release one child , a twin , had died shortly after birth .
fritzl has admitted to burning the corpse in the house ’ s boiler . the decision on which children lived aboveground and which below depended on whether they were “ screaming babies ” and on their general halth , explained chief inspector leopold etz from the lower austrian criminal investigators office . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : a bathroom in the shocking home-prison the case came to light because one of the children , 19 year old kerstin , was severely ill .
her “ grandfather ” brought the child to the hospital , which started a search for the child ’ s mother in the hopes of finding out her medical history .
they televised an urgent call elisabeth to come back and save the daughter ’ s life . elisabeth saw the call on television , and was able to convince her father to let her go to the hospital .
she seized the chance to speak privately to a doctor and explain her situation .
fritzl was arrested the same day . fritzl ’ s admission that he burned the body of the dead seventh child could prove pivotal when the case comes to trial , with a prosecutor saying he would face a life sentence if found guilty of manslaughter , as opposed to shorter prison terms for rape or incarceration . psychologist paulus hochgatterer , who is helping advise those counselling the family , told afp news service that the three children fritzl had kept underground are staying in a sequestered treatment container that could be locked from the inside . slow road to recovery ? safely shielded from the media circus that has set up camp in amstetten , he said their initial treatment could take several weeks . " only very gradually are they being exposed to the outside world , " hochgatterer said , adding that " given the circumstances , they 're actually doing quite well . " the two sets of children are now tentatively beginning to get to know one another .
the youngest child , five years old , seems most able to adapt to his new life , his caretakers said . experts said the family is likely to need years of therapy . " it could take between five and eight years , " said max friedrich , the psychiatrist who looked after another sequestration victim , natascha kampusch , in an interview with the daily oesterreich . the head of the local social services , hans-heinz lenze , said a name-change had been suggested for the immediate victims , but fritzl 's other family as well , in order to give them a new start in life . long-term investigation expected " at the moment , all possibilities are being sounded out in closest consultation with the family .
but a decision will only be reached in the coming weeks , " lenze told a news conference on tuesday . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : can officials look to the kampusch case for help ?
chief investigator franz polzer told austrian television that police might need " half a year " to complete their investigations .
he ruled out any suggestion fritzl might have had an accomplice . " as our investigations now stand , there were no accomplices .
but you can never be 100 percent certain . " doctors would determine when police would be allowed to question elisabeth fritzl and the children , but that was unlikely to be for several days . fritzl had officially adopted the three aboveground children , after showing authorities letters signed by elizabeth that said she could not care for them , and which asked that they try not to track her down for the sake of herself and her children . fritzl was allowed to adopt despite a reported conviction of attempted rape in the 1960s and of arson , but the records were wiped after a period of time set by austrian law . the district court in amstetten , which had greenlighted the adoptions , said it had followed protocol in the adoption proceedings and had had acted correctly . no sign of wife 's complicity " there were n't any doubts about his -lrb- fritzl 's -rrb- integrity .
why should i put the child in a foster home , when it could grow up in a family , " court president josef schoegl told the austria press agency . chief police investigator franz polzer said there was no sign that fritzl 's wife , who also had seven children with him , knew of the goings on in his locked dungeon . in the town of amstetten , more than 200 people including dozens of youngsters quietly held a candlelight vigil in the main square late tuesday , as the town of 23,000 sought to cast off the notoriety brought to their doorstep by fritzl . shocked residents react " shock , sadness , rage and perhaps also hatred have gripped us these last few days , " pastor peter boesendorfer told those gathered . " we must acknowledge that there is something in our town that we can not comprehend , " he said , calling on residents " to help and show solidarity so that a life will be possible " for the bewildered children and their scarred mother . amstetten mayor herbert katzengruber told the austrian news agency apa : " we want to show that amstetten is not a town for criminals .
but it 's mostly about showing solidarity and help to the victims .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de in focus : israel turns 60 : the making of a country israel 's history : history of a conflict german jews keep up the culture in israel 's old folks homes german-israeli relations : the normality of abnormality israel remembers victims of holocaust in annual ceremony holocaust -pipe- 30.04.2008 " young germans have a responsibility to learn from history " großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : young germans become " professional grandsons " to elderly jewish survivors the action reconciliation service for peace - a grassroots volunteer group that promotes understanding between germany and israel - is celebrating its 50th anniversary on wednesday . the action reconciliation service for peace -lrb- asf -rrb- was founded by the synod of the evangelical church in germany in 1958 in response to nazi atrocities during world war ii .
since 1961 , action reconciliation has sent thousands of young germans to israel to volunteer in nursing homes , youth centers , hospitals and memorial sites .
the grassroots work of this social action group became the basis of a political rapprochement between germany and israel , when diplomatic relations were established in 1965 .
today , germany is among israel 's most important allies and trading partners in europe . dw-world.de spoke to philipp pohlmann , 25 , who spent a year volunteering in israel .
today , he is a regional spokesman for the group in the cologne area . dw-world.de : how did you wind up joining asf ? philipp pohlmann : in germany , young men are conscripted into military service after they graduate from high school , generally between the ages of 16-20 , but most get out of it nowadays .
some are disqualified because of a minor physical disability , but those who get a clean bill of health , like i did , can opt to do community service instead .
the third possibility is to fulfill the civil service requirement abroad , which is what i chose to do . why did you specifically choose asf ? their focus on germany 's historic responsibility to jews living in israel and all over the world appealed to me .
i wanted personally to meet the last survivors of auschwitz or other camps . it is one thing to learn about the nazi period through textbooks , which is an obligatory part of the german school curriculum , but it 's another to learn about the past in a personal way . so the way the nazi period is taught in schools is too cut and dry ? bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : anne frank 's diary is often not part of the school curriculum .
yes .
everyone learns about the facts - that 6 million european jews perished in the holocaust , for example .
we know the names of all the death camps - auschwitz , treblinka - it 's all very impersonal .
we did n't even read the " diary of anne frank " in school .
i read it on my own . the nazi period is such an important and compelling part of the history of this country , but many teachers never inspire the pupils or stimulate real interest in the subject .
there are many germans and jews who are still alive to talk personally about this period .
why do n't teachers simply invite survivors to speak about their experiences in class ? perhaps teachers are still grappling with how to teach the subject .
is there perhaps a sense of collective guilt or discomfort in dealing with this period ? one thing is clear : anyone who was too young during the war or born after the war can not be guilty of anything , but still , it is very important to know about the history of one 's own country and , with that awareness , to ensure that the genocide does not happen again in the future .
we , young germans , have a responsibility to learn from our past . have you talked about the nationalist socialist period with your own grandparents ? not really .
by the time my interest in this subject was awakened , they were too old or dead .
my paternal grandfather is almost 100 years old now .
he was a clockmaker from silesia -lsb- part of the german reich that became part of poland after the war -rsb- .
as a soldier on the eastern front , he was captured by the russians in 1941 and held prisoner of war until 1949 .
my grandparents had no nazi sympathies , as far as i know , and i have never heard them utter one bad word about the jews . what did you do as a volunteer for asf in tel aviv ? bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : a church official in cologne hands over a cheque to asf 's philipp pohlmann -lrb- 3rd from right -rrb- as part of the program , i spent one year at a home for the elderly , helping them run daily errands or visit doctors .
we talked a lot and played gin rummy .
they even gave me hebrew lessons , so i 've gotten to the point that i am conversationally fluent now . how did these elderly israelis , some of whom were holocaust survivors , react to you as a german ? this project has been ongoing in israel for decades , so they are used to german volunteers .
many of the elderly happen to be german jews , who often revert back to their mother tongue as they get older , so they were delighted to speak german with me .
they were also very interested in what 's happening in germany .
some residents even subscribed to a local weekly paper in the german language .
jacob bar-or , a frankfurt native in his 80s , who was one of the prosecutors in the adolf eichmann case , even kept abreast of news in germany by reading the frankfurter allgemeine zeitung newspaper on a regular basis . i never encountered any hostility in israel .
the survivors themselves have no problem with me being german .
they know that i 'm in my 20s and had nothing to do with the holocaust .
if anyone had a problem , and this was rare , it was younger people , the grandchildren of holocaust victims , who perhaps never got to know their forebears . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : germany is israel 's best friend in europe .
israel 's peres with germany 's merkel -lrb- right -rrb- can relations between german and israel ever be fully normal ? no , but that is not necessarily a bad thing .
because of the holocaust , the relationship will always be a special one . the holocaust made claims to a jewish state a moral necessity , but does that mean that the germans can not be critical of israel ? for germany , there can be no doubt about israel 's right to exist , but that does not mean we can not be critical of israeli policy , in particular when political leaders meet behind closed doors .
still , germany needs to tread carefully with regard to the israeli-palestinian conflict . was the arab-israeli conflict a part of your daily life in jerusalem or tel aviv ? no , even though i was there during two major suicide attacks in tel aviv in 2002 and 2003 .
this needs to be kept in perspective , though . israel is not the most dangerous place in the world , and most tourists would not even be aware of the presence of suicide bombers .
i 'm more afraid of driving at high speed on the german autobahns than living in israel . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : merkel laid a wreath during a march visit to the yad vashem memorial suicide bombers wo n't deter young germans from volunteering for asf , but what about scrapping military conscription and the civil alternative , which has been up for discussion for years now in germany ? it 's not a problem .
only one third of those who apply , get accepted into one of our programs abroad , simply because the funding is not there to provide more than 180 placements a year .

since 1961 , action reconciliation has sent thousands of young germans to israel to volunteer in nursing homes , youth centers , hospitals and memorial sites .
the grassroots work of this social action group became the basis of a political rapprochement between germany and israel , when diplomatic relations were established in 1965 .
today , germany is among israel 's most important allies and trading partners in europe . dw-world.de spoke to philipp pohlmann , 25 , who spent a year volunteering in israel .
today , he is a regional spokesman for the group in the cologne area . dw-world.de : how did you wind up joining asf ? philipp pohlmann : in germany , young men are conscripted into military service after they graduate from high school , generally between the ages of 16-20 , but most get out of it nowadays .
some are disqualified because of a minor physical disability , but those who get a clean bill of health , like i did , can opt to do community service instead .
the third possibility is to fulfill the civil service requirement abroad , which is what i chose to do . why did you specifically choose asf ? their focus on germany 's historic responsibility to jews living in israel and all over the world appealed to me .
i wanted personally to meet the last survivors of auschwitz or other camps . it is one thing to learn about the nazi period through textbooks , which is an obligatory part of the german school curriculum , but it 's another to learn about the past in a personal way . so the way the nazi period is taught in schools is too cut and dry ? bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : anne frank 's diary is often not part of the school curriculum .
yes .
everyone learns about the facts - that 6 million european jews perished in the holocaust , for example .
we know the names of all the death camps - auschwitz , treblinka - it 's all very impersonal .
we did n't even read the " diary of anne frank " in school .
i read it on my own . the nazi period is such an important and compelling part of the history of this country , but many teachers never inspire the pupils or stimulate real interest in the subject .
there are many germans and jews who are still alive to talk personally about this period .
why do n't teachers simply invite survivors to speak about their experiences in class ? perhaps teachers are still grappling with how to teach the subject .
is there perhaps a sense of collective guilt or discomfort in dealing with this period ? one thing is clear : anyone who was too young during the war or born after the war can not be guilty of anything , but still , it is very important to know about the history of one 's own country and , with that awareness , to ensure that the genocide does not happen again in the future .
we , young germans , have a responsibility to learn from our past . have you talked about the nationalist socialist period with your own grandparents ? not really .
by the time my interest in this subject was awakened , they were too old or dead .
my paternal grandfather is almost 100 years old now .
he was a clockmaker from silesia -lsb- part of the german reich that became part of poland after the war -rsb- .
as a soldier on the eastern front , he was captured by the russians in 1941 and held prisoner of war until 1949 .
my grandparents had no nazi sympathies , as far as i know , and i have never heard them utter one bad word about the jews . what did you do as a volunteer for asf in tel aviv ? bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : a church official in cologne hands over a cheque to asf 's philipp pohlmann -lrb- 3rd from right -rrb- as part of the program , i spent one year at a home for the elderly , helping them run daily errands or visit doctors .
we talked a lot and played gin rummy .
they even gave me hebrew lessons , so i 've gotten to the point that i am conversationally fluent now . how did these elderly israelis , some of whom were holocaust survivors , react to you as a german ? this project has been ongoing in israel for decades , so they are used to german volunteers .
many of the elderly happen to be german jews , who often revert back to their mother tongue as they get older , so they were delighted to speak german with me .
they were also very interested in what 's happening in germany .
some residents even subscribed to a local weekly paper in the german language .
jacob bar-or , a frankfurt native in his 80s , who was one of the prosecutors in the adolf eichmann case , even kept abreast of news in germany by reading the frankfurter allgemeine zeitung newspaper on a regular basis . i never encountered any hostility in israel .
the survivors themselves have no problem with me being german .
they know that i 'm in my 20s and had nothing to do with the holocaust .
if anyone had a problem , and this was rare , it was younger people , the grandchildren of holocaust victims , who perhaps never got to know their forebears . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : germany is israel 's best friend in europe .
israel 's peres with germany 's merkel -lrb- right -rrb- can relations between german and israel ever be fully normal ? no , but that is not necessarily a bad thing .
because of the holocaust , the relationship will always be a special one . the holocaust made claims to a jewish state a moral necessity , but does that mean that the germans can not be critical of israel ? for germany , there can be no doubt about israel 's right to exist , but that does not mean we can not be critical of israeli policy , in particular when political leaders meet behind closed doors .
still , germany needs to tread carefully with regard to the israeli-palestinian conflict . was the arab-israeli conflict a part of your daily life in jerusalem or tel aviv ? no , even though i was there during two major suicide attacks in tel aviv in 2002 and 2003 .
this needs to be kept in perspective , though . israel is not the most dangerous place in the world , and most tourists would not even be aware of the presence of suicide bombers .
i 'm more afraid of driving at high speed on the german autobahns than living in israel . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : merkel laid a wreath during a march visit to the yad vashem memorial suicide bombers wo n't deter young germans from volunteering for asf , but what about scrapping military conscription and the civil alternative , which has been up for discussion for years now in germany ? it 's not a problem .
only one third of those who apply , get accepted into one of our programs abroad , simply because the funding is not there to provide more than 180 placements a year .
volunteers are mainly young people , but we 've got a sprinkling of older germans , too .
also , more than half of the volunteers are women , who do n't get drafted into military service anyway .
even among the young men , there are volunteers who are not necessarily doing this to fulfill their civic duty . i did this to avoid the bundeswehr and to fulfill my civic requirement , but as i see it now , i wound up gaining a year , not losing one on my career path as a lawyer .

since 1961 , action reconciliation has sent thousands of young germans to israel to volunteer in nursing homes , youth centers , hospitals and memorial sites .
the grassroots work of this social action group became the basis of a political rapprochement between germany and israel , when diplomatic relations were established in 1965 .
today , germany is among israel 's most important allies and trading partners in europe . dw-world.de spoke to philipp pohlmann , 25 , who spent a year volunteering in israel .
today , he is a regional spokesman for the group in the cologne area . dw-world.de : how did you wind up joining asf ? philipp pohlmann : in germany , young men are conscripted into military service after they graduate from high school , generally between the ages of 16-20 , but most get out of it nowadays .
some are disqualified because of a minor physical disability , but those who get a clean bill of health , like i did , can opt to do community service instead .
the third possibility is to fulfill the civil service requirement abroad , which is what i chose to do . why did you specifically choose asf ? their focus on germany 's historic responsibility to jews living in israel and all over the world appealed to me .
i wanted personally to meet the last survivors of auschwitz or other camps . it is one thing to learn about the nazi period through textbooks , which is an obligatory part of the german school curriculum , but it 's another to learn about the past in a personal way . so the way the nazi period is taught in schools is too cut and dry ? bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : anne frank 's diary is often not part of the school curriculum .
yes .
everyone learns about the facts - that 6 million european jews perished in the holocaust , for example .
we know the names of all the death camps - auschwitz , treblinka - it 's all very impersonal .
we did n't even read the " diary of anne frank " in school .
i read it on my own . the nazi period is such an important and compelling part of the history of this country , but many teachers never inspire the pupils or stimulate real interest in the subject .
there are many germans and jews who are still alive to talk personally about this period .
why do n't teachers simply invite survivors to speak about their experiences in class ? perhaps teachers are still grappling with how to teach the subject .
is there perhaps a sense of collective guilt or discomfort in dealing with this period ? one thing is clear : anyone who was too young during the war or born after the war can not be guilty of anything , but still , it is very important to know about the history of one 's own country and , with that awareness , to ensure that the genocide does not happen again in the future .
we , young germans , have a responsibility to learn from our past . have you talked about the nationalist socialist period with your own grandparents ? not really .
by the time my interest in this subject was awakened , they were too old or dead .
my paternal grandfather is almost 100 years old now .
he was a clockmaker from silesia -lsb- part of the german reich that became part of poland after the war -rsb- .
as a soldier on the eastern front , he was captured by the russians in 1941 and held prisoner of war until 1949 .
my grandparents had no nazi sympathies , as far as i know , and i have never heard them utter one bad word about the jews . what did you do as a volunteer for asf in tel aviv ? bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : a church official in cologne hands over a cheque to asf 's philipp pohlmann -lrb- 3rd from right -rrb- as part of the program , i spent one year at a home for the elderly , helping them run daily errands or visit doctors .
we talked a lot and played gin rummy .
they even gave me hebrew lessons , so i 've gotten to the point that i am conversationally fluent now . how did these elderly israelis , some of whom were holocaust survivors , react to you as a german ? this project has been ongoing in israel for decades , so they are used to german volunteers .
many of the elderly happen to be german jews , who often revert back to their mother tongue as they get older , so they were delighted to speak german with me .
they were also very interested in what 's happening in germany .
some residents even subscribed to a local weekly paper in the german language .
jacob bar-or , a frankfurt native in his 80s , who was one of the prosecutors in the adolf eichmann case , even kept abreast of news in germany by reading the frankfurter allgemeine zeitung newspaper on a regular basis . i never encountered any hostility in israel .
the survivors themselves have no problem with me being german .
they know that i 'm in my 20s and had nothing to do with the holocaust .
if anyone had a problem , and this was rare , it was younger people , the grandchildren of holocaust victims , who perhaps never got to know their forebears . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : germany is israel 's best friend in europe .
israel 's peres with germany 's merkel -lrb- right -rrb- can relations between german and israel ever be fully normal ? no , but that is not necessarily a bad thing .
because of the holocaust , the relationship will always be a special one . the holocaust made claims to a jewish state a moral necessity , but does that mean that the germans can not be critical of israel ? for germany , there can be no doubt about israel 's right to exist , but that does not mean we can not be critical of israeli policy , in particular when political leaders meet behind closed doors .
still , germany needs to tread carefully with regard to the israeli-palestinian conflict . was the arab-israeli conflict a part of your daily life in jerusalem or tel aviv ? no , even though i was there during two major suicide attacks in tel aviv in 2002 and 2003 .
this needs to be kept in perspective , though . israel is not the most dangerous place in the world , and most tourists would not even be aware of the presence of suicide bombers .
i 'm more afraid of driving at high speed on the german autobahns than living in israel . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : merkel laid a wreath during a march visit to the yad vashem memorial suicide bombers wo n't deter young germans from volunteering for asf , but what about scrapping military conscription and the civil alternative , which has been up for discussion for years now in germany ? it 's not a problem .

no , thanks " and " serbia - russia " serbian caretaker prime minister vojislav kostunica on wednesday , april 30 , dismissed the stabilization and association agreement with the european union as a " false document " which legalizes the secession of kosovo . " those who signed the tabilization and association agreement -lsb- saa -rsb- are fully responsible for it and they signed it in their own names and never in the name of serbia , " kostunica said in an interview with the daily vecernje novosti .
serbian president boris tadic and deputy prime minister bozidar djelic signed the saa , which legalizes the secession of serbia 's province of kosovo and is a precursor to eu membership talks , with the european union on tuesday , a move denounced by serbian nationalists as treason .
the nationalist majority in serbia heaped insults on the saa with the european union , calling its signing " lies and deceit , " " treason , " and " legally null and void . "
kostunica 's democratic party of serbia -lsb- dss -rsb- has said it will take legal action against the pro-europe bloc for signing the saa , while the ultra-nationalist opposition serbian radical party -lsb- srs -rsb- has said it will launch a case to remove tadic from office .
" without an saa there can be no possibility for a full integration of the western balkans into the european union , and without such integration there is no possibility for a final reconciliation amongst the people of the western balkans , " tadic said .
observers hope that the saa will boost the chances of the pro- european bloc , led by tadic , in snap parliamentary elections on may 11 .
rising nationalists challenge pro-europe parties bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : kostunica 's dss party and the radical party oppose the eu the latest surveys published wednesday showed that the anti- european bloc , led by the increasingly nationalist kostunica and ultra-nationalist opposition radical party , could win more seats in parliament than the pro-european parties .
the medium gallup and blic daily poll showed that the nationalists would win 137 seats out of 250 if elections were held right now , while the pro-european bloc would win 113 seats .
if kostunica forms a government with the radicals , that would cement serbia 's turn away from the eu towards russia .
the alternative would be for kostunica to form a coalition with tadic , as he did last year .
observers say that , either way , the process of forming a government will be long and very difficult followed by months of negotiations , political trading and blackmail .
a door to eu membership and stability bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the signing of the accord is seen as a prelude to accession kosovo declared independence from serbia in february .
the youngest european state was recognized by most eu member states and major western powers .
serbia , backed by its ally russia , opposes it .
the saa is a document setting out how an aspiring eu member should reform its political , economic and legal systems to come in line with eu norms , and how the eu should help it do so .
as its name suggests , it is designed to bring basic stability and prosperity to a region devastated by the conflict that erupted after the implosion of the former yugoslavia .
the ratification of serbia 's saa was made conditional on belgrade proving that it was cooperating fully with the international criminal tribunal for the former yugoslavia . dw staff / dpa -lrb- nda -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

an archive storing files on those persecuted and killed by the nazis officially opened in the german town of bad arolsen on wednesday , april 30 . the card index , which contains about 47 million documents containing the names of most concentration camp inmates , forced-labour victims and refugees left homeless after world war ii , had been the subject of an intense debate .
jewish groups had been pressing for open access to the collection , a storehouse of captured documents that began being assembled in 1946 . " most of the documents were drawn up by the nazis themselves , " said reto meister , the swiss red cross official now in charge of the files .
" we have documents here about a horrifyingly wide range of victims : jews and christians , eastern and western europeans , germans and non-germans , men and women .
there 's not one country where victims did not come from . " opening the archive bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the archive contains index cards on nazi victims .
previously , viewing the archive was limited only to survivors and close relations of the dead .
all of that changed last year , when the members of the 11-nation governing commission of the international tracing service of the international committee of the red cross agreed to provide greater access to the archives , ending a five-decade long debate over the victims ' rights to privacy . earlier this year , the archive opened to historians .
wednesday 's opening allows nearly anyone to search inside the archives , an especially important event for those friends and family members still searching for those unaccounted for after the war . meister also sees the files as the most potent answer to holocaust deniers : " anyone who wants to minimize the holocaust should come here .
we 'll show him documents by the million . " the " overwhelming scale " of the card index , meister said , was more persuasive than any debate . creating a digital archive in three capitals bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : yad vashem in jerusalem has received digital archives .
the its has also made digital copies of much of the archives and exported them to yad vashem memorial in jerusalem , the us holocaust memorial museum in washington and the national institute of remembrance in warsaw .
the images include both sides of 9 million incarceration documents , 21 million cards from its main name index and 3.5 million papers in its displaced persons index . another block of documents relating to forced labour will follow in the summer , bringing scanning to 70 percent of the paper documents .
the entire archival holdings are expected to be digitized by 2011 so that it can be mirrored in all three capitals . dw staff -lrb- cat -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

since 1961 , action reconciliation has sent thousands of young germans to israel to volunteer in nursing homes , youth centers , hospitals and memorial sites .
the grassroots work of this social action group became the basis of a political rapprochement between germany and israel , when diplomatic relations were established in 1965 .
today , germany is among israel 's most important allies and trading partners in europe . dw-world.de spoke to philipp pohlmann , 25 , who spent a year volunteering in israel .
today , he is a regional spokesman for the group in the cologne area . dw-world.de : how did you wind up joining asf ? philipp pohlmann : in germany , young men are conscripted into military service after they graduate from high school , generally between the ages of 16-20 , but most get out of it nowadays .
some are disqualified because of a minor physical disability , but those who get a clean bill of health , like i did , can opt to do community service instead .
the third possibility is to fulfill the civil service requirement abroad , which is what i chose to do . why did you specifically choose asf ? their focus on germany 's historic responsibility to jews living in israel and all over the world appealed to me .
i wanted personally to meet the last survivors of auschwitz or other camps . it is one thing to learn about the nazi period through textbooks , which is an obligatory part of the german school curriculum , but it 's another to learn about the past in a personal way . so the way the nazi period is taught in schools is too cut and dry ? bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : anne frank 's diary is often not part of the school curriculum .
yes .
everyone learns about the facts - that 6 million european jews perished in the holocaust , for example .
we know the names of all the death camps - auschwitz , treblinka - it 's all very impersonal .
we did n't even read the " diary of anne frank " in school .
i read it on my own . the nazi period is such an important and compelling part of the history of this country , but many teachers never inspire the pupils or stimulate real interest in the subject .
there are many germans and jews who are still alive to talk personally about this period .
why do n't teachers simply invite survivors to speak about their experiences in class ? perhaps teachers are still grappling with how to teach the subject .
is there perhaps a sense of collective guilt or discomfort in dealing with this period ? one thing is clear : anyone who was too young during the war or born after the war can not be guilty of anything , but still , it is very important to know about the history of one 's own country and , with that awareness , to ensure that the genocide does not happen again in the future .
we , young germans , have a responsibility to learn from our past . have you talked about the nationalist socialist period with your own grandparents ? not really .
by the time my interest in this subject was awakened , they were too old or dead .
my paternal grandfather is almost 100 years old now .
he was a clockmaker from silesia -lsb- part of the german reich that became part of poland after the war -rsb- .
as a soldier on the eastern front , he was captured by the russians in 1941 and held prisoner of war until 1949 .
my grandparents had no nazi sympathies , as far as i know , and i have never heard them utter one bad word about the jews . what did you do as a volunteer for asf in tel aviv ? bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : a church official in cologne hands over a cheque to asf 's philipp pohlmann -lrb- 3rd from right -rrb- as part of the program , i spent one year at a home for the elderly , helping them run daily errands or visit doctors .
we talked a lot and played gin rummy .
they even gave me hebrew lessons , so i 've gotten to the point that i am conversationally fluent now . how did these elderly israelis , some of whom were holocaust survivors , react to you as a german ? this project has been ongoing in israel for decades , so they are used to german volunteers .
many of the elderly happen to be german jews , who often revert back to their mother tongue as they get older , so they were delighted to speak german with me .
they were also very interested in what 's happening in germany .
some residents even subscribed to a local weekly paper in the german language .
jacob bar-or , a frankfurt native in his 80s , who was one of the prosecutors in the adolf eichmann case , even kept abreast of news in germany by reading the frankfurter allgemeine zeitung newspaper on a regular basis . i never encountered any hostility in israel .
the survivors themselves have no problem with me being german .
they know that i 'm in my 20s and had nothing to do with the holocaust .
if anyone had a problem , and this was rare , it was younger people , the grandchildren of holocaust victims , who perhaps never got to know their forebears . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : germany is israel 's best friend in europe .
israel 's peres with germany 's merkel -lrb- right -rrb- can relations between german and israel ever be fully normal ? no , but that is not necessarily a bad thing .
because of the holocaust , the relationship will always be a special one . the holocaust made claims to a jewish state a moral necessity , but does that mean that the germans can not be critical of israel ? for germany , there can be no doubt about israel 's right to exist , but that does not mean we can not be critical of israeli policy , in particular when political leaders meet behind closed doors .
still , germany needs to tread carefully with regard to the israeli-palestinian conflict . was the arab-israeli conflict a part of your daily life in jerusalem or tel aviv ? no , even though i was there during two major suicide attacks in tel aviv in 2002 and 2003 .
this needs to be kept in perspective , though . israel is not the most dangerous place in the world , and most tourists would not even be aware of the presence of suicide bombers .
i 'm more afraid of driving at high speed on the german autobahns than living in israel . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : merkel laid a wreath during a march visit to the yad vashem memorial suicide bombers wo n't deter young germans from volunteering for asf , but what about scrapping military conscription and the civil alternative , which has been up for discussion for years now in germany ? it 's not a problem .
only one third of those who apply , get accepted into one of our programs abroad , simply because the funding is not there to provide more than 180 placements a year .
volunteers are mainly young people , but we 've got a sprinkling of older germans , too .
also , more than half of the volunteers are women , who do n't get drafted into military service anyway .
even among the young men , there are volunteers who are not necessarily doing this to fulfill their civic duty . i did this to avoid the bundeswehr and to fulfill my civic requirement , but as i see it now , i wound up gaining a year , not losing one on my career path as a lawyer .
whenever i go on interviews for jobs or internships , my year at asf has been a huge advantage for me .
every recruiter has asked me about the time i spent in israel . interview : diana fong send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

bbc news -pipe- uk -pipe- contrasting views on eu migration bbc news / uk graphics version bbc sport home news front page -pipe- africa -pipe- americas -pipe- asia-pacific -pipe- europe -pipe- middle east -pipe- south asia -pipe- uk -pipe- business -pipe- health -pipe- science & environment -pipe- technology -pipe- entertainment -pipe- also in the news -pipe- have your say -pipe- uk contents : england -pipe- northern ireland -pipe- scotland -pipe- wales -pipe- uk politics -pipe- education -pipe- magazine 04:22 gmt , wednesday , 30 april 2008 05:22 uk contrasting views on eu migration by mark easton home editor , bbc news two apparently contradictory stories are emerging from the immigration debate .
in graphics : ippr report the first is a political and social argument : that britain needs to do more to limit the numbers of migrants who are coming here because of pressures on public services and community cohesion .
the second is an economic argument : that key industries - construction , hospitality and agriculture - need the government to encourage more migrant workers to come because of labour shortages .
the report from the institute for public policy research -lrb- ippr -rrb- , a left-leaning think tank which has been broadly positive about immigration , attempts to provide a statistical basis on which to hang the arguments .
it has looked at the impact of east european migration since the so-called a8 countries joined the eu in 2004 .
the analysis is based on existing uk data and surveys and focus groups conducted in poland .
migrant labour the ippr 's conclusions may provide solace to those who fear immigration is too high but will be greeted with alarm by some businesses who currently rely on migrant labour .
the headline figure of one million arrivals from eastern europe is much higher than the government 's original estimate .
whitehall officials thought only about 60,000 would have come by now .
maps of migration across uk but the ippr also estimates that half a million of those have already moved elsewhere and many more will go soon .
immigration figures are notoriously difficult to assess because the uk does not count everyone in and everyone out .
however , the analysis has been discussed by official and independent statisticians who have not challenged the methodology .
the signs are , says the ippr report , that arrivals from countries like poland have begun to " slow substantially " and there are good reasons for thinking there will be an increase in the numbers returning .
as the british economy slows down , countries like poland are seeing rapid growth .
other european countries which have restricted migrant workers are now opening their doors .
and the weak pound against currencies like the polish zloty means pay rates here are much less attractive .
a recent survey by the communities and local government department has identified places where social cohesion appears fragile .
six of the 10 areas with the worst community relations have seen large numbers of east european migrants , including boston , in lincolnshire , fenland and nearby south holland .
immigration and race relations are at the top of voters ' concerns and such tensions have prompted ministers to try to restrict numbers coming to live and work in the uk . "
we are trying our utmost to keep our people " donald allan crerar hotels but go to perthshire and it is a very different story .
here too they worry about immigration .
not that there are too many migrants , but that there are not enough .
pitlochry , for instance , is a town whose economy has become reliant on east european workers .
at the local scotland 's hotel , the haggis is cooked by a polish chef and served by a hungarian .
the bedrooms are cleaned by young czechs .
but with almost full employment locally , managers fear they will be left high and dry if supplies of migrant workers dry up .
donald allan , from the crerar hotels group , is worried .
" we are trying our utmost to keep our people , " he says .
" if they go home , currently i do n't know where we will replace our european colleagues . "
the tourism industry has expanded thanks to overseas labour and there are fears it could contract as quickly .
fruit and vegetable farmers in the area are also worried about labour shortages , with some blaming government immigration policies for threatening their livelihoods .
at west haugh farm , near blairgowrie , peter thompson fears his crops of soft fruit , promised to the supermarkets , could rot in the fields because the home office has cut the number of seasonal workers allowed to come to the uk .
consequences " if we ca n't pick it that 's what will happen " he says .
" last september-october we just struggled through but given that we have a lot fewer applicants this year we envisage a lot more problems . "
what the ippr report reflects is the complexity of the immigration debate .
the figures can only be best guesses , but the trends seem clear enough .
britain is likely to see a significant fall in the numbers of eastern europeans coming here .
some will argue that is a good thing .
but for businesses in scotland and beyond , the consequences could be very serious .

the institute for public policy research examined their impact on the uk after eu expansion in 2004 and 2007 .
it said even areas which had not traditionally attracted migrants , such as scotland and south-west england , had noticed a " significant " influx .
poles are now the largest foreign national group in the uk .
they had been the 13th largest group in early 2004 , the report said , but had replaced people born in india , many of whom now have uk citizenship , as the biggest group .
regular visits home the research , released to the bbc , looked at migrants who came from eight countries that joined the european union in may 2004 - poland , the czech republic , estonia , hungary , latvia , lithuania , slovakia and slovenia .
in graphics : ippr report poland entices its workers home send us your comments it also included migrants from romania and bulgaria , which joined the eu in 2007 .
the research by the ippr , a labour-leaning british think tank , estimated that about one million migrant workers had come to the uk from 2004 accession countries , but that about half this group had already left the uk .
the ippr also said post-enlargement migration was " very different " from previous migration to britain .
" in contrast to previous migrants , it is financially and logistically possible for migrants from the new eu member states to come to the uk on a temporary or seasonal basis , and to regularly visit home while living in britain , " it said .
the ippr looked at the labour force survey , national insurance number applications , the workers registration scheme - applicants are required to register on the scheme as soon as they start working in the uk - and the international passenger survey .
it also surveyed poles who had returned to their homeland after working in the uk , as well as applying its own projections .
while the highest number of national insurance applications by migrants since 2004 was in london and south-east england , all regions had received significant numbers of post-enlargement migrants , the ippr said .
poles ' everywhere ' " in 2007 polish -lsb- national insurance number -rsb- recipients were registered in every local authority in britain . "
in the highlands , perth and kinross , edinburgh and glasgow between 5,000 and 20,000 workers had registered in each area since 2004 - although not every worker has to register , so it is not an accurate figure of current worker numbers .
the ippr estimated there were between 10 and 29 eastern european workers per 1,000 local residents in those scottish areas . "
ippr 's conclusions may provide solace to those who fear immigration is too high but will be greeted with alarm by some businesses " mark easton , bbc news home editor mark easton 's analysis parts of norfolk and lincolnshire have attracted many migrant workers , with boston having an estimated 90 workers per 1,000 local population , according to ippr estimates , second only to the city of london at 307 eu workers per 1,000 .
but when it came to reasons for coming or going , the report said " the vast majority of polish migrants come to the uk for economic reasons , but leave because they miss home or want to be with their friends and family in poland " .
other findings included : three-quarters of all nationals from the 10 countries resident in the uk in 2007 were aged 16 to 39 at 84 % , the employment rate among post-enlargement migrants is among the highest of all immigrant groups , and is nine percentage points higher than the uk-born average very few post-enlargement migrants claim state benefits -lrb- only 2.4 % of those registering for national insurance numbers between may 2004 and december 2007 did so in order to claim benefits -rrb- east european migrants work on average four hours longer per week than uk-born workers -lrb- 46 hours compared with 42 hours -rrb- accession has also had an impact at the pub - before 2004 , polish beers were not widely available in the uk .

according to the research , there were 665,000 nationals from all 10 countries living in the uk in the last quarter of 2007 .
this was an increase of 548,000 since the first quarter of 2004 , just prior to the first eight countries joining the eu .
the government had underestimated the number of migrants post-expansion , saying that between 5,000 and 13,000 would arrive after 2004 .

in graphics : ippr report the first is a political and social argument : that britain needs to do more to limit the numbers of migrants who are coming here because of pressures on public services and community cohesion .
the second is an economic argument : that key industries - construction , hospitality and agriculture - need the government to encourage more migrant workers to come because of labour shortages .
the report from the institute for public policy research -lrb- ippr -rrb- , a left-leaning think tank which has been broadly positive about immigration , attempts to provide a statistical basis on which to hang the arguments .
it has looked at the impact of east european migration since the so-called a8 countries joined the eu in 2004 .
the analysis is based on existing uk data and surveys and focus groups conducted in poland .
migrant labour the ippr 's conclusions may provide solace to those who fear immigration is too high but will be greeted with alarm by some businesses who currently rely on migrant labour .
the headline figure of one million arrivals from eastern europe is much higher than the government 's original estimate .
whitehall officials thought only about 60,000 would have come by now .
maps of migration across uk but the ippr also estimates that half a million of those have already moved elsewhere and many more will go soon .
immigration figures are notoriously difficult to assess because the uk does not count everyone in and everyone out .
however , the analysis has been discussed by official and independent statisticians who have not challenged the methodology .
the signs are , says the ippr report , that arrivals from countries like poland have begun to " slow substantially " and there are good reasons for thinking there will be an increase in the numbers returning .
as the british economy slows down , countries like poland are seeing rapid growth .
other european countries which have restricted migrant workers are now opening their doors .
and the weak pound against currencies like the polish zloty means pay rates here are much less attractive .
a recent survey by the communities and local government department has identified places where social cohesion appears fragile .
six of the 10 areas with the worst community relations have seen large numbers of east european migrants , including boston , in lincolnshire , fenland and nearby south holland .
immigration and race relations are at the top of voters ' concerns and such tensions have prompted ministers to try to restrict numbers coming to live and work in the uk .
we are trying our utmost to keep our people donald allan crerar hotels but go to perthshire and it is a very different story .
here too they worry about immigration .
not that there are too many migrants , but that there are not enough .
pitlochry , for instance , is a town whose economy has become reliant on east european workers .
at the local scotland 's hotel , the haggis is cooked by a polish chef and served by a hungarian .
the bedrooms are cleaned by young czechs .
but with almost full employment locally , managers fear they will be left high and dry if supplies of migrant workers dry up .
donald allan , from the crerar hotels group , is worried .
" we are trying our utmost to keep our people , " he says .
" if they go home , currently i do n't know where we will replace our european colleagues . "
the tourism industry has expanded thanks to overseas labour and there are fears it could contract as quickly .
fruit and vegetable farmers in the area are also worried about labour shortages , with some blaming government immigration policies for threatening their livelihoods .
at west haugh farm , near blairgowrie , peter thompson fears his crops of soft fruit , promised to the supermarkets , could rot in the fields because the home office has cut the number of seasonal workers allowed to come to the uk .
consequences " if we ca n't pick it that 's what will happen " he says .
" last september-october we just struggled through but given that we have a lot fewer applicants this year we envisage a lot more problems . "
what the ippr report reflects is the complexity of the immigration debate .
the figures can only be best guesses , but the trends seem clear enough .
britain is likely to see a significant fall in the numbers of eastern europeans coming here .
some will argue that is a good thing .
but for businesses in scotland and beyond , the consequences could be very serious .

in graphics : ippr report the first is a political and social argument : that britain needs to do more to limit the numbers of migrants who are coming here because of pressures on public services and community cohesion .
the second is an economic argument : that key industries - construction , hospitality and agriculture - need the government to encourage more migrant workers to come because of labour shortages .
the report from the institute for public policy research -lrb- ippr -rrb- , a left-leaning think tank which has been broadly positive about immigration , attempts to provide a statistical basis on which to hang the arguments .
it has looked at the impact of east european migration since the so-called a8 countries joined the eu in 2004 .
the analysis is based on existing uk data and surveys and focus groups conducted in poland .
migrant labour the ippr 's conclusions may provide solace to those who fear immigration is too high but will be greeted with alarm by some businesses who currently rely on migrant labour .
the headline figure of one million arrivals from eastern europe is much higher than the government 's original estimate .
whitehall officials thought only about 60,000 would have come by now .
maps of migration across uk but the ippr also estimates that half a million of those have already moved elsewhere and many more will go soon .
immigration figures are notoriously difficult to assess because the uk does not count everyone in and everyone out .
however , the analysis has been discussed by official and independent statisticians who have not challenged the methodology .
the signs are , says the ippr report , that arrivals from countries like poland have begun to " slow substantially " and there are good reasons for thinking there will be an increase in the numbers returning .
as the british economy slows down , countries like poland are seeing rapid growth .
other european countries which have restricted migrant workers are now opening their doors .
and the weak pound against currencies like the polish zloty means pay rates here are much less attractive .
a recent survey by the communities and local government department has identified places where social cohesion appears fragile .
six of the 10 areas with the worst community relations have seen large numbers of east european migrants , including boston , in lincolnshire , fenland and nearby south holland .
immigration and race relations are at the top of voters ' concerns and such tensions have prompted ministers to try to restrict numbers coming to live and work in the uk .
we are trying our utmost to keep our people donald allan crerar hotels but go to perthshire and it is a very different story .
here too they worry about immigration .
not that there are too many migrants , but that there are not enough .
pitlochry , for instance , is a town whose economy has become reliant on east european workers .
at the local scotland 's hotel , the haggis is cooked by a polish chef and served by a hungarian .
the bedrooms are cleaned by young czechs .
but with almost full employment locally , managers fear they will be left high and dry if supplies of migrant workers dry up .
donald allan , from the crerar hotels group , is worried .
" we are trying our utmost to keep our people , " he says .
" if they go home , currently i do n't know where we will replace our european colleagues . "
the tourism industry has expanded thanks to overseas labour and there are fears it could contract as quickly .

in graphics : ippr report the first is a political and social argument : that britain needs to do more to limit the numbers of migrants who are coming here because of pressures on public services and community cohesion .
the second is an economic argument : that key industries - construction , hospitality and agriculture - need the government to encourage more migrant workers to come because of labour shortages .
the report from the institute for public policy research -lrb- ippr -rrb- , a left-leaning think tank which has been broadly positive about immigration , attempts to provide a statistical basis on which to hang the arguments .
it has looked at the impact of east european migration since the so-called a8 countries joined the eu in 2004 .
the analysis is based on existing uk data and surveys and focus groups conducted in poland .
migrant labour the ippr 's conclusions may provide solace to those who fear immigration is too high but will be greeted with alarm by some businesses who currently rely on migrant labour .
the headline figure of one million arrivals from eastern europe is much higher than the government 's original estimate .
whitehall officials thought only about 60,000 would have come by now .
maps of migration across uk but the ippr also estimates that half a million of those have already moved elsewhere and many more will go soon .
immigration figures are notoriously difficult to assess because the uk does not count everyone in and everyone out .
however , the analysis has been discussed by official and independent statisticians who have not challenged the methodology .
the signs are , says the ippr report , that arrivals from countries like poland have begun to " slow substantially " and there are good reasons for thinking there will be an increase in the numbers returning .
as the british economy slows down , countries like poland are seeing rapid growth .
other european countries which have restricted migrant workers are now opening their doors .
and the weak pound against currencies like the polish zloty means pay rates here are much less attractive .
a recent survey by the communities and local government department has identified places where social cohesion appears fragile .
six of the 10 areas with the worst community relations have seen large numbers of east european migrants , including boston , in lincolnshire , fenland and nearby south holland .
immigration and race relations are at the top of voters ' concerns and such tensions have prompted ministers to try to restrict numbers coming to live and work in the uk .
we are trying our utmost to keep our people donald allan crerar hotels but go to perthshire and it is a very different story .
here too they worry about immigration .
not that there are too many migrants , but that there are not enough .
pitlochry , for instance , is a town whose economy has become reliant on east european workers .
at the local scotland 's hotel , the haggis is cooked by a polish chef and served by a hungarian .
the bedrooms are cleaned by young czechs .
but with almost full employment locally , managers fear they will be left high and dry if supplies of migrant workers dry up .
donald allan , from the crerar hotels group , is worried .
" we are trying our utmost to keep our people , " he says .
" if they go home , currently i do n't know where we will replace our european colleagues . "
the tourism industry has expanded thanks to overseas labour and there are fears it could contract as quickly .
fruit and vegetable farmers in the area are also worried about labour shortages , with some blaming government immigration policies for threatening their livelihoods .
at west haugh farm , near blairgowrie , peter thompson fears his crops of soft fruit , promised to the supermarkets , could rot in the fields because the home office has cut the number of seasonal workers allowed to come to the uk .
consequences " if we ca n't pick it that 's what will happen " he says .
" last september-october we just struggled through but given that we have a lot fewer applicants this year we envisage a lot more problems . "
what the ippr report reflects is the complexity of the immigration debate .
the figures can only be best guesses , but the trends seem clear enough .
britain is likely to see a significant fall in the numbers of eastern europeans coming here .
some will argue that is a good thing .
but for businesses in scotland and beyond , the consequences could be very serious .

the report from the institute for public policy research -lrb- ippr -rrb- , a left-leaning think tank which has been broadly positive about immigration , attempts to provide a statistical basis on which to hang the arguments .
it has looked at the impact of east european migration since the so-called a8 countries joined the eu in 2004 .
the analysis is based on existing uk data and surveys and focus groups conducted in poland .
migrant labour the ippr 's conclusions may provide solace to those who fear immigration is too high but will be greeted with alarm by some businesses who currently rely on migrant labour .
the headline figure of one million arrivals from eastern europe is much higher than the government 's original estimate .
whitehall officials thought only about 60,000 would have come by now .
maps of migration across uk but the ippr also estimates that half a million of those have already moved elsewhere and many more will go soon .
immigration figures are notoriously difficult to assess because the uk does not count everyone in and everyone out .
however , the analysis has been discussed by official and independent statisticians who have not challenged the methodology .
the signs are , says the ippr report , that arrivals from countries like poland have begun to " slow substantially " and there are good reasons for thinking there will be an increase in the numbers returning .
as the british economy slows down , countries like poland are seeing rapid growth .
other european countries which have restricted migrant workers are now opening their doors .
and the weak pound against currencies like the polish zloty means pay rates here are much less attractive .
a recent survey by the communities and local government department has identified places where social cohesion appears fragile .
six of the 10 areas with the worst community relations have seen large numbers of east european migrants , including boston , in lincolnshire , fenland and nearby south holland .
immigration and race relations are at the top of voters ' concerns and such tensions have prompted ministers to try to restrict numbers coming to live and work in the uk .
we are trying our utmost to keep our people donald allan crerar hotels but go to perthshire and it is a very different story .
here too they worry about immigration .
not that there are too many migrants , but that there are not enough .
pitlochry , for instance , is a town whose economy has become reliant on east european workers .
at the local scotland 's hotel , the haggis is cooked by a polish chef and served by a hungarian .
the bedrooms are cleaned by young czechs .
but with almost full employment locally , managers fear they will be left high and dry if supplies of migrant workers dry up .
donald allan , from the crerar hotels group , is worried .
" we are trying our utmost to keep our people , " he says .
" if they go home , currently i do n't know where we will replace our european colleagues . "
the tourism industry has expanded thanks to overseas labour and there are fears it could contract as quickly .
fruit and vegetable farmers in the area are also worried about labour shortages , with some blaming government immigration policies for threatening their livelihoods .
at west haugh farm , near blairgowrie , peter thompson fears his crops of soft fruit , promised to the supermarkets , could rot in the fields because the home office has cut the number of seasonal workers allowed to come to the uk .
consequences " if we ca n't pick it that 's what will happen " he says .
" last september-october we just struggled through but given that we have a lot fewer applicants this year we envisage a lot more problems . "
what the ippr report reflects is the complexity of the immigration debate .
the figures can only be best guesses , but the trends seem clear enough .
britain is likely to see a significant fall in the numbers of eastern europeans coming here .
some will argue that is a good thing .
but for businesses in scotland and beyond , the consequences could be very serious .

this has caused a widespread lack of confidence in governments , companies and world stock markets .
one effect has been that the income obtainable from company loans - corporate bonds - has become substantially bigger for investors .
it is these investments that insurance companies largely use to pay annuities .
today 's annuity rates are now at a five-year-high .
high point at some point , a person will want to convert their personal pension savings into an income stream and most will do so by choosing an annuity that will pay an agreed amount of money for the rest of their life .
as the income - also known as the yield - from corporate bonds has become much higher , the corresponding annuity rates that are offered have soared .
a 65 year old man can purchase an annuity providing a 7.66 % annual return on his pension fund .
this is almost 11 % more than what could have been bought just two years ago .
a 65 year old woman will get a 7.18 % yearly return .
this is likely to affect large numbers of people as there some 464,000 annuities were bought in 2007 .
frenzied rising investment returns have sparked a price battle in the most competitive parts of the annuity market . "
this rate war is seemingly becoming even more frenzied " insurance companies know that the best priced annuity is likely to attract the largest chunk of business from people who shop around .
the companies are desperate to grab their share of the market , and rate changes are occurring at unprecedented levels .
there have already been 40 annuity rate changes this year - that 's almost two every week .
this rate war is seemingly becoming even more frenzied .
there have been 17 rate changes in the last month alone , 15 of them upwards .
for ever the important point to note is that the annuity rate you buy today will remain payable at that level for the rest of your life , no matter how long that is .
it will not matter if subsequent annuity rates fall in the coming months ; you are locked into the rate forever .
given that the average 65 year old man is likely to live until almost his 86th birthday , and a 65 year old woman until she 's over 88 , that is a pretty good return .
an annuity never runs out ; it will keep on paying , whilst you live .
no other investment will guarantee to do this .
this provides a lot of peace of mind when you consider that there is a 42 % chance of a 65 year old living until his 90th birthday and a one-in-five probability of seeing his 95th birthday .
longevity but for two main reasons this increase in the return that annuities are currently offering may not continue . "
this will typically tend to have a knock on effect on lowering annuity rates " firstly , the prices of corporate bonds are at historic low levels .
the financial markets have already priced an awful lot of further bad news into their price , thus pushing up the income stream for corporate bond investors .
there are many commentators who think that corporate bond prices are now more likely to rise , which in turn will cause their yield to fall .
this will typically tend to have a knock on effect on lowering annuity rates .
however , if inflation does rise , this could have the opposite effect .
secondly , we continue to live longer .
life expectancy has been increasing rapidly in the uk for a number of years and this trend seems to be set to continue .
insurers are taking account of the fact that annuity payments will have to be paid out for a number of additional years - so there is a strong downward pressure on annuity rates in the long term .
buying an annuity is a once-off decision and whilst there are no guarantees that rates have peaked , lots of retiring investors are deciding that now is the time they want to buy their annuity .

there local authorities can force companies to bid for a package of services .

" what we could work towards with these powers are , first of all , integrated timetables , integrated ticket systems between buses and trains , " mr lewis said .
" we could aim eventually towards a wales oyster card , that sees you through public transport ticketing problems from bangor to cowbridge , right across the county . "
according to mr lewis , companies in wales can currently cherry-pick the most profitable routes , leaving some areas with a poor or non-existent service .

welsh assembly government permanent secretary sir jon shortridge is retiring after nine years in office .
he said the issue on devolution was " not whether it should continue but how far and how fast it should develop " .
sir jon will be replaced by dame gillian morgan , moving from her post as nhs confederation chief executive .
he said he wanted his successor to gain experience before first minister rhodri morgan 's likely departure in 2009 .
he became welsh office permanent secretary in march 1999 and continued when the assembly began two months on .
he said he was proud of the organisation 's achievements , including the government of wales act 2006 .
it conferred new legislative responsibilities on the assembly government and he described it as an " innovative piece of legislation " .
sir jon also said he was please with the assembly government 's recent announcement on tackling bovine tb with a " targeted cull " of badgers .
' better service ' knighted in 2002 , he led the civil service through the changes created by devolution .
" what we have now is a system of government in wales , which is much , much better than it ever was , " sir jon said .
" it is much more closely aligned to the needs of the people of wales and we 've got ministers and elected members who are genuinely representing the interests of the people of wales .
" obviously that connects with us as officials and we 're in a much better position to provide a better service , " he added .
" devolution in wales is now a done deal and the issue is not whether it should continue but how far and how fast it should develop . "
mr morgan paid tribute to his work and thanked him for " leading the civil service through exceptional and unparalleled change " .
he said : " jon has played a key role in supporting the establishment of what is a very different system of government in wales " .
" he leaves behind him a strong administrative machine firmly embedded within welsh civic life , and giving the strongest possible support to ministers as they undertake their enhanced responsibilities . "
rhondda-born dame gillian was part of the team led by sir jeremy beecham in 2006 which advised the assembly government on public service reforms .

welsh assembly government permanent secretary sir jon shortridge is retiring after nine years in office .
he said the issue on devolution was " not whether it should continue but how far and how fast it should develop " .
sir jon will be replaced by dame gillian morgan , moving from her post as nhs confederation chief executive .
he said he wanted his successor to gain experience before first minister rhodri morgan 's likely departure in 2009 .
he became welsh office permanent secretary in march 1999 and continued when the assembly began two months on .
he said he was proud of the organisation 's achievements , including the government of wales act 2006 .
it conferred new legislative responsibilities on the assembly government and he described it as an " innovative piece of legislation " .
sir jon also said he was please with the assembly government 's recent announcement on tackling bovine tb with a " targeted cull " of badgers .
' better service ' knighted in 2002 , he led the civil service through the changes created by devolution .
" what we have now is a system of government in wales , which is much , much better than it ever was , " sir jon said .
" it is much more closely aligned to the needs of the people of wales and we 've got ministers and elected members who are genuinely representing the interests of the people of wales .
" obviously that connects with us as officials and we 're in a much better position to provide a better service , " he added .
" devolution in wales is now a done deal and the issue is not whether it should continue but how far and how fast it should develop . "
mr morgan paid tribute to his work and thanked him for " leading the civil service through exceptional and unparalleled change " .
he said : " jon has played a key role in supporting the establishment of what is a very different system of government in wales " .
" he leaves behind him a strong administrative machine firmly embedded within welsh civic life , and giving the strongest possible support to ministers as they undertake their enhanced responsibilities . "
rhondda-born dame gillian was part of the team led by sir jeremy beecham in 2006 which advised the assembly government on public service reforms .

inactivating the itk protein which is involved in the immune response blocks many steps of hiv replication , studies in the laboratory show .
most current hiv drugs attack the virus itself which is liable to mutate and become resistant to treatment .
hiv experts said the results were promising but any drug would take a long time to get to the clinic .
itk is involved in activating a type of immune cell called a t cell in the presence of infection .
itk had an effect on hiv replication at several stages which if you add them up seems to be a profound effect dr pamela schwartzberg , study leader hiv works by infecting t cells , taking them over so they can replicate and create large quantities of the virus , compromising the whole immune system .
the team at the us national institutes of health realised that many of the pathways regulated by itk were also needed for hiv to take hold in the body .
tests in human cells in the laboratory showed that removing or inactivating itk could , as predicted , block many different steps in the ability of hiv to enter a cell , spread and replicate , the study in proceedings of the national academy of sciences showed .
drug development dr pamela schwartzberg said each of the steps only had a small effect but together they were significant .
what remains to be seen is how effective targeting itk would be compared to existing drugs she said .
but due to other research looking at the role of itk in immune responses in asthma , there are already potential drugs in development .

professor david back , an expert in hiv pharmacology at the university of liverpool said development of drug resistance was the main problem with current therapy .
" there is no question that we need new drugs acting on existing targets but also new drugs acting on new targets .
" consequently any glimmer that a target protein may be less susceptible to mutational changes is an exciting prospect - this study on itk looks just that . "
however , he said there is a long road between proof of concept and a drug molecule ready for use in the clinic .

inactivating the itk protein which is involved in the immune response blocks many steps of hiv replication , studies in the laboratory show .
most current hiv drugs attack the virus itself which is liable to mutate and become resistant to treatment .
hiv experts said the results were promising but any drug would take a long time to get to the clinic .
itk is involved in activating a type of immune cell called a t cell in the presence of infection .
itk had an effect on hiv replication at several stages which if you add them up seems to be a profound effect dr pamela schwartzberg , study leader hiv works by infecting t cells , taking them over so they can replicate and create large quantities of the virus , compromising the whole immune system .
the team at the us national institutes of health realised that many of the pathways regulated by itk were also needed for hiv to take hold in the body .
tests in human cells in the laboratory showed that removing or inactivating itk could , as predicted , block many different steps in the ability of hiv to enter a cell , spread and replicate , the study in proceedings of the national academy of sciences showed .
drug development dr pamela schwartzberg said each of the steps only had a small effect but together they were significant .
what remains to be seen is how effective targeting itk would be compared to existing drugs she said .
but due to other research looking at the role of itk in immune responses in asthma , there are already potential drugs in development .
" currently we have multiple options for treating hiv and we use multi-drug regimens but most of these therapies are directed against viral proteins which are subject to rapid changes allowing mutations to develop .
" our own cellular machinery is less prone to making mistakes .
" itk had an effect on hiv replication at several stages which if you add them up seems to be a profound effect . "
professor david back , an expert in hiv pharmacology at the university of liverpool said development of drug resistance was the main problem with current therapy .
" there is no question that we need new drugs acting on existing targets but also new drugs acting on new targets .
" consequently any glimmer that a target protein may be less susceptible to mutational changes is an exciting prospect - this study on itk looks just that . "
however , he said there is a long road between proof of concept and a drug molecule ready for use in the clinic .

us bishop gene robinson , who has received death threats , said rowan williams 's handling of rhetoric against gay anglicans could endanger them .
he said god was " very disappointed " in the way dr williams had failed to confront nigeria 's archbishop akinola .
he also said dr williams had criticised the us church but not others .
bbc correspondent robert pigott said the archbishop has , in fact , spoken out against inflammatory language .
earlier this month , dr williams denounced what he called disgraceful death threats against members of a gay anglican group , he said .
bullet-proof vest but in an interview with bbc news hardtalk programme , bishop robinson said he believed god would be disappointed with dr williams , the nominal head of the worldwide communion .
gene robinson , an openly-gay divorced father-of-two , was elected bishop of new hampshire in 2003 , but his appointment was heavily criticised .
he says that since then numerous death threats have been made against him and he now wears a bullet-proof vest for some public appearances .
one of the gay bishop 's fiercest critics is archbishop peter akinola , chairman of the council of anglican provinces in africa , which claims 37 million members .
asked why he thought dr williams had not held archbishop akinola to account , bishop robinson said : " well , you have to ask him that - and i think he will have to answer to god about that .
" i believe -lsb- dr williams ' -rsb- unwillingness to confront peter akinola and others like him who 've made statements that i think any reasonable person would find over the edge - i believe god is very disappointed in that . "
he also said dr williams should be more consistent , saying he had criticised the episcopal church but not given his views on other churches .
in the interview to be broadcast later on wednesday , bishop robinson added that the rhetoric used by the us religious right against gay and lesbian people was treating them " as if we are sub-human " .

us bishop gene robinson , who has received death threats , said rowan williams 's handling of rhetoric against gay anglicans could endanger them .
he said god was " very disappointed " in the way dr williams had failed to confront nigeria 's archbishop akinola .
he also said dr williams had criticised the us church but not others .
bbc correspondent robert pigott said the archbishop has , in fact , spoken out against inflammatory language .
earlier this month , dr williams denounced what he called disgraceful death threats against members of a gay anglican group , he said .
bullet-proof vest but in an interview with bbc news hardtalk programme , bishop robinson said he believed god would be disappointed with dr williams , the nominal head of the worldwide communion .
gene robinson , an openly-gay divorced father-of-two , was elected bishop of new hampshire in 2003 , but his appointment was heavily criticised .
he says that since then numerous death threats have been made against him and he now wears a bullet-proof vest for some public appearances .
one of the gay bishop 's fiercest critics is archbishop peter akinola , chairman of the council of anglican provinces in africa , which claims 37 million members .
asked why he thought dr williams had not held archbishop akinola to account , bishop robinson said : " well , you have to ask him that - and i think he will have to answer to god about that .
" i believe -lsb- dr williams ' -rsb- unwillingness to confront peter akinola and others like him who 've made statements that i think any reasonable person would find over the edge - i believe god is very disappointed in that . "
he also said dr williams should be more consistent , saying he had criticised the episcopal church but not given his views on other churches .
