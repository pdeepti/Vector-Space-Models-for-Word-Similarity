" the higher emissions resulting from the phase-out of nuclear energy -lsb- and the resulting reliance on other forms of energy -rsb- must be considered by the european union in the total budget of emissions trading , " said glos , according to the handelsblatt . glos also pointed to sweden as a forerunner in the effort to gain allowances .
he said sweden was able to achieve such special treatment from the eu at the end of the 1990s - setting a precedent , said glos , from which germany could now benefit . during negotiations about how to share the burden of meeting emissions cuts among eu countries in trying to fulfill the requirements of the kyoto protocol , sweden at the time pointed to its efforts to phase out the use of nuclear energy .
the country was then permitted to raise its co2 emissions output by four percent from 1990 to 2012 . long-term emissions cuts bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : germany has agreed to significantly curtail its emissions germany is required to reduce its emissions by 21 percent during that same period , while eu countries as a whole have aimed to reduce emissions by eight percent . currently , the european commission is hammering out a plan to implement the resolutions regarding energy and climate change which were agreed on at an eu summit in march 2007 . in the plan , the eu wants to define what its contribution should be in the next international agreement for protecting the environment , which is to replace the kyoto protocol when its requirements expire at the end of 2012 .
the eu aims to reduce co2 emissions by 20 percent by 2020 , compared to 1990 levels . according to the handelsblatt , the german environment ministry has not yet responded to glos ' request , but told the paper that higher emissions in the sectors involved in emissions trading " would have to be balanced out by additional emissions reduction in other areas , such as the private household or transportation sectors , if germany is to achieve the climate protection targets laid out in eu agreements .

his views are at odds with the police who say crime has risen . break-ins and thefts have risen considerably in germany 's border regions since the passport-free schengen area added nine new central and eastern european members on dec .
21 , 2007 , klaus jansen , chairmen of the federation of german detectives , told deutschlandfunk public radio on tuesday , april 1 . jansen criticized german interior minister wolfgang schaeuble for not adequately preparing police for the move .
promised reinforcements have n't yet been made available and the interior ministry failed to provide police with appropriate training and mobile tracing equipment , he said . mobile patrols in the border regions replaced stationary border checks after the expansion . minister says no reason to worry bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : poles and germans celebrated on the eve of the schengen expansion schaeuble , however , said on tuesday in the saxon city of zittau that " the concerns of the people in the border regions have not proven true . "
the interior minister had been a major proponent of opening the schengen area late last year , a move that critics said was premature and could lead to increased crime rates in germany . schaeuble 's czech and polish counterparts echoed his sentiments . " the feared scenarios have n't occurred , " said czech interior minister ivan langer .
poland 's state secretary witold drodz called police cooperation between the three countries " exemplary . " since the border posts on the german-polish and german-czech borders were symbolically removed just before christmas last year , 1,128 people have been detained for illegal entry into germany .
713 of these have already been deported back to their home countries . schaeuble said the number of illegal entry attempts was particularly high in december and january , but has sunk dramatically since then . matthias seeger , who heads the federal police district responsible for guarding the border to poland , said the visible presence of the federal police in the 1,300-kilometer -lrb- 800-mile -rrb- border region continued to ensure greater security for the people there . borders dismantled in new schengen countries bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : border controls such as these have been dismantled in new schengen members on sunday , passport controls in airports were lifted in the nine new member countries - estonia , the czech republic , lithuania , hungary , latvia , malta , poland , slovakia and slovenia .
the abolishment of the air borders had been postponed to coincide with the airlines ' bi-yearly flight schedule changes . " it all went very smoothly , " said friso roscam abbing , spokesman for the eu 's justice , freedom and security commission . the schengen area is now made up of 22 eu countries plus norway and iceland .

the applications from ukraine and georgia have met skepticism within the alliance as well as open opposition from russia . " the time is not ripe " both germany and france , backed by several smaller countries , strongly oppose bush 's membership action plan -lrb- map -rrb- for the two nations , arguing that georgia and ukraine do not meet nato 's criteria and the decision would be an unnecessary provocation to russia before president-elect dmirty medvedev takes office . german chancellor angela merkel said in bucharest that both georgia and ukraine should have a long-term prospect of nato membership , " but there is one difference with the united states : we believe the time for map is not ripe . " earlier , german foreign minister frank-walter steinmeier said in an interview europe should try to avoid further damaging its relationship with russia . it is clear " that we have reached the limit in foreign policy in relations with russia , " steinmeier regional daily leipziger volkszeitung in an interview . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : steinmeier wants better relations with russia steinmeier pointed to russia 's anger over kosovo as a recent example of deteriorating relations .
russia is likewise strongly opposed to georgia and ukraine becomign nato members .
and steinmeier said he could see " no convincing reason ... to create more tension . " steinmeier stressed that germany does not oppose georgia and ukraine joining nato out of deference to russia .
the german government feels the countries need better internal stability and more internal support for nato before beginning a membership process . expansion disagreements nato leaders are meeting in bucharest to discuss the eastwards expansion of the 26-member alliance as well as its involvement in afghanistan and strategies for the future . georgia and ukraine are hoping to be offered a membership action plan -lrb- map -rrb- , a key step to full membership .
russia opposes the bids on grounds that nato is intruding on its sphere of influence . " the membership action plan marks the point of no return , in our opinion , " moscow 's envoy to nato , dmitry rogozin , told interfax news agency .
" if map is granted to georgia and ukraine ... our relations would take a dramatic turn . " us president george w. bush , who is in eastern europe on a week-long visit , is expected to tell his counterparts that the alliance must remain open to all european democracies looking to join , according to excerpts of his speech made available by the white house . afghanistan prominent on agenda military troop numbers in afghanistan are also likely to dominate the two-day meeting in romania .
at a session on thursday , nato allies and other troop contributors will also meet un secretary-general ban ki-moon and afghan president hamid karzai to discuss better coordination of military , civilian , development and humanitarian efforts . earlier this week , bush toned down demands that germany take on a combat role in southern afghanistan , but he is still expected to ask for europeans to increase their troop contingents . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : protesters at the us embassy in moscow do n't want nato to expand east germany currently has around 3,250 troops based in the capital , kabul , and the relatively peaceful north , where they are engaged in provincial reconstruction missions .
german defense minister franz josef jung said tuesday that the number of bundeswehr troops in afghanistan would not surpass the 3,500 limit set by parliament . french president nicholas sarkozy has said his country was considering beefing up its deployment to afghanistan and prime minister francois fillon said paris may send " a few hundred " extra troops to afghanistan .
france currently has about 2,200 troops stationed in afghanistan . the move has , however , led members of the french opposition to threaten a no confidence vote if sarkozy goes through with his plan . next year 's plans german chancellor angela merkel is expected to use the meeting in bucharest to launch an initiative with sarkozy to stage a summit early next year marking the 60th anniversary of nato 's founding . " with this gesture , sarkozy and merkel want to underline the german-franco friendship , european reconciliation " and the importance of the transatlantic alliance , german government spokesman ulrich wilhelm . wilhelm said the summit would be held jointly in the french city of strasbourg and across the river rhine in the german city of kehl . dw staff -lrb- sms / th -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

but fc schalke 04 looked intimidated by fc barcelona on tuesday , april 1 , admitted coach mirko slomka . slomka said his team , which lost 0-1 , was not aggressive enough against the spanish soccer giants . " when you play barcelona , you have to respect them , but i think we gave them too much respect today -lrb- tuesday -rrb- , " slomka said . barcelona 's 17-year-old striker bojan krkic scored the game 's only goal 12 minutes into the first half and schalke was unable to respond despite numerous chances .

to make it worse , schalke " did n't have enough courage to attack them , " the coach said . " in the second half we had our chances to force an equalizer , but unfortunately we did n't take them , " he said .
" we had talked about the danger of conceding an early goal , unfortunately manuel neuer did n't hold onto the ball and that was an error . " the germans had plenty of chances to even out the score , with fabian ernst and halil altintop both having shots on the goal close to the midway point of the second half .
schalke 's soren larsen then squandered a free header and marcelo bordon brought a fingertip save from victor valdes in the match 's final moments . down , but not out bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : next week barcelona will play at home if schalke ever was going to beat barcelona , tuesday at their home field in gelsenkirchen was the night .
the catalans lost four of their seven games in march .
and when the teams meet for the second leg of the quarterfinal match on april 9 , barcelona will have home-field advantage . " in the champions league you have to capitalize on chances like the ones we had , " slomka said . barcelona coach frank rijkaard admitted his side coasted during the second half , but praised his players for their tough playing . " it was a very hard match , " he said .
" schalke showed how strong they are and what team spirit they have . " semi-finals on the horizon bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : which team will make it to the semi-finals ? the winner of next week 's quarter-final second leg of the champions league will likely face manchester united in the semi-finals . schalke 's slomka said his players would not repeat the errors next week .

his views are at odds with the police who say crime has risen . break-ins and thefts have risen considerably in germany 's border regions since the passport-free schengen area added nine new central and eastern european members on dec .
21 , 2007 , klaus jansen , chairmen of the federation of german detectives , told deutschlandfunk public radio on tuesday , april 1 . jansen criticized german interior minister wolfgang schaeuble for not adequately preparing police for the move .
promised reinforcements have n't yet been made available and the interior ministry failed to provide police with appropriate training and mobile tracing equipment , he said . mobile patrols in the border regions replaced stationary border checks after the expansion . minister says no reason to worry bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : poles and germans celebrated on the eve of the schengen expansion schaeuble , however , said on tuesday in the saxon city of zittau that " the concerns of the people in the border regions have not proven true . "
the interior minister had been a major proponent of opening the schengen area late last year , a move that critics said was premature and could lead to increased crime rates in germany . schaeuble 's czech and polish counterparts echoed his sentiments . " the feared scenarios have n't occurred , " said czech interior minister ivan langer .
poland 's state secretary witold drodz called police cooperation between the three countries " exemplary . " since the border posts on the german-polish and german-czech borders were symbolically removed just before christmas last year , 1,128 people have been detained for illegal entry into germany .
713 of these have already been deported back to their home countries . schaeuble said the number of illegal entry attempts was particularly high in december and january , but has sunk dramatically since then . matthias seeger , who heads the federal police district responsible for guarding the border to poland , said the visible presence of the federal police in the 1,300-kilometer -lrb- 800-mile -rrb- border region continued to ensure greater security for the people there . borders dismantled in new schengen countries bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : border controls such as these have been dismantled in new schengen members on sunday , passport controls in airports were lifted in the nine new member countries - estonia , the czech republic , lithuania , hungary , latvia , malta , poland , slovakia and slovenia .
the abolishment of the air borders had been postponed to coincide with the airlines ' bi-yearly flight schedule changes .

" the higher emissions resulting from the phase-out of nuclear energy -lsb- and the resulting reliance on other forms of energy -rsb- must be considered by the european union in the total budget of emissions trading , " said glos , according to the handelsblatt . glos also pointed to sweden as a forerunner in the effort to gain allowances .
he said sweden was able to achieve such special treatment from the eu at the end of the 1990s - setting a precedent , said glos , from which germany could now benefit . during negotiations about how to share the burden of meeting emissions cuts among eu countries in trying to fulfill the requirements of the kyoto protocol , sweden at the time pointed to its efforts to phase out the use of nuclear energy .
the country was then permitted to raise its co2 emissions output by four percent from 1990 to 2012 . long-term emissions cuts bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : germany has agreed to significantly curtail its emissions germany is required to reduce its emissions by 21 percent during that same period , while eu countries as a whole have aimed to reduce emissions by eight percent . currently , the european commission is hammering out a plan to implement the resolutions regarding energy and climate change which were agreed on at an eu summit in march 2007 . in the plan , the eu wants to define what its contribution should be in the next international agreement for protecting the environment , which is to replace the kyoto protocol when its requirements expire at the end of 2012 .
the eu aims to reduce co2 emissions by 20 percent by 2020 , compared to 1990 levels . according to the handelsblatt , the german environment ministry has not yet responded to glos ' request , but told the paper that higher emissions in the sectors involved in emissions trading " would have to be balanced out by additional emissions reduction in other areas , such as the private household or transportation sectors , if germany is to achieve the climate protection targets laid out in eu agreements .

" the higher emissions resulting from the phase-out of nuclear energy -lsb- and the resulting reliance on other forms of energy -rsb- must be considered by the european union in the total budget of emissions trading , " said glos , according to the handelsblatt . glos also pointed to sweden as a forerunner in the effort to gain allowances .
he said sweden was able to achieve such special treatment from the eu at the end of the 1990s - setting a precedent , said glos , from which germany could now benefit . during negotiations about how to share the burden of meeting emissions cuts among eu countries in trying to fulfill the requirements of the kyoto protocol , sweden at the time pointed to its efforts to phase out the use of nuclear energy .
the country was then permitted to raise its co2 emissions output by four percent from 1990 to 2012 . long-term emissions cuts bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : germany has agreed to significantly curtail its emissions germany is required to reduce its emissions by 21 percent during that same period , while eu countries as a whole have aimed to reduce emissions by eight percent . currently , the european commission is hammering out a plan to implement the resolutions regarding energy and climate change which were agreed on at an eu summit in march 2007 . in the plan , the eu wants to define what its contribution should be in the next international agreement for protecting the environment , which is to replace the kyoto protocol when its requirements expire at the end of 2012 .
the eu aims to reduce co2 emissions by 20 percent by 2020 , compared to 1990 levels . according to the handelsblatt , the german environment ministry has not yet responded to glos ' request , but told the paper that higher emissions in the sectors involved in emissions trading " would have to be balanced out by additional emissions reduction in other areas , such as the private household or transportation sectors , if germany is to achieve the climate protection targets laid out in eu agreements .

his views are at odds with the police who say crime has risen . break-ins and thefts have risen considerably in germany 's border regions since the passport-free schengen area added nine new central and eastern european members on dec .
21 , 2007 , klaus jansen , chairmen of the federation of german detectives , told deutschlandfunk public radio on tuesday , april 1 . jansen criticized german interior minister wolfgang schaeuble for not adequately preparing police for the move .
promised reinforcements have n't yet been made available and the interior ministry failed to provide police with appropriate training and mobile tracing equipment , he said . mobile patrols in the border regions replaced stationary border checks after the expansion . minister says no reason to worry bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : poles and germans celebrated on the eve of the schengen expansion schaeuble , however , said on tuesday in the saxon city of zittau that " the concerns of the people in the border regions have not proven true . "
the interior minister had been a major proponent of opening the schengen area late last year , a move that critics said was premature and could lead to increased crime rates in germany . schaeuble 's czech and polish counterparts echoed his sentiments . " the feared scenarios have n't occurred , " said czech interior minister ivan langer .
poland 's state secretary witold drodz called police cooperation between the three countries " exemplary . " since the border posts on the german-polish and german-czech borders were symbolically removed just before christmas last year , 1,128 people have been detained for illegal entry into germany .
713 of these have already been deported back to their home countries . schaeuble said the number of illegal entry attempts was particularly high in december and january , but has sunk dramatically since then . matthias seeger , who heads the federal police district responsible for guarding the border to poland , said the visible presence of the federal police in the 1,300-kilometer -lrb- 800-mile -rrb- border region continued to ensure greater security for the people there . borders dismantled in new schengen countries bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : border controls such as these have been dismantled in new schengen members on sunday , passport controls in airports were lifted in the nine new member countries - estonia , the czech republic , lithuania , hungary , latvia , malta , poland , slovakia and slovenia .
the abolishment of the air borders had been postponed to coincide with the airlines ' bi-yearly flight schedule changes . " it all went very smoothly , " said friso roscam abbing , spokesman for the eu 's justice , freedom and security commission . the schengen area is now made up of 22 eu countries plus norway and iceland .

it has inked a deal to dispose of up to 160,000 tons of neapolitan waste - for a tidy price . italian representatives closed the deal with germany 's state environment ministries , according to a report in the frankfurter allgemeine zeitung .
up to 60,000 tons of trash will be removed from the streets of naples and shipped to germany for incineration ; another 100,000 tons will be made up of household waste . hamburg 's commercial waste disposal service srh has already agreed to take 30,000 tons at a price of 150 euros -lrb- $ 235 -rrb- per ton .
north rhine-westphalia , germany 's most populous state , will handle 54,000 tons . including transport , the cost of removal could add up to 200 to 230 euros per ton , faz reported , putting a price tag of up to 37 million euros on the whole deal . the eastern german state of saxony and the northern port city of bremerhaven previously made separate trash disposal agreements before the last deal . help in a pinch bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : dioxins found in italian mozzarella was linked to waste contamination a spokesman for the federal environment ministry told the paper that germany was the only eu country with the capacity to dispose of mass quantities of italian waste , but emphasized that it was an emergency and not a long-term arrangement . " it will and should not turn into a permanent situation that italy disposes of waste in germany , " the spokesman said . italy 's rubbish crisis peaked in december when campania 's landfill sites were declared full and trash began to pile up on the streets .
the italian government then gave former police chief gianni de gennaro a 120-day mandate to clean up the mess which has led to sagging tourist rates . while the streets in downtown naples have been cleared , the suburbs are reportedly still littered with garbage . dw staff -lrb- kjb -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de banking -pipe- 02.04.2008 european officials warn banking woes set to continue großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : europe 's banking industry is n't out of the woods yet even as investors seemed ready to put the banking crisis behind them , top european officials warned that more bad news was likely .
on wednesday , a german regional public bank bank posted a massive 2007 net loss . european and us investors were unfazed after the tuesday announcement from two of europe 's largest banks - swiss bank ubs and germany 's deutsche bank - of enormous first quarter losses .
there was a sense that things could n't get much worse and that the bad news could actually set the beleaguered banking industry down the road to recovery . but the celebrations might prove premature .
german banks are estimated to have about 200 billion euros -lrb- $ 312 billion -rrb- in bad credit on their books , according to a study by ernst & young released wednesday . world-wide , us loan defaults that sparked the crisis could cause losses in the financial industry of up to $ 600 billion , according to spiegel magazine , citing an internal study by german financial supervisory body bafin .
the 16-page paper was a worse-case scenario which bafin stressed might not happen . thus far , financial institutions have publicly admitted to losses of $ 295 billion .
german banks were believed to be exposed to about 10 percent of the total , according to the federal regulator .
calls for transparency bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : weber warned that the crisis of confidence is n't over european central bank -lrb- ecb -rrb- governor axel weber also warned that more bad news is sure to come . " the crisis of confidence is not over yet .
as long as the price decline in the us property market continues , further turbulences have to be expected , " weber said in an interview with the german newspaper bild , which appeared wednesday . european union economic and monetary affairs commissioner joachin almunia echoed the ecb concern that further bad news could come . " we do not yet have an overview of the level of losses , banks do not yet inspire trust , " almunia said in an interview with the frankfurter rundshau newspaper . weber reiterated the need for more transparency in the banking sector , calling on banks which have taken great risks to " disclose their losses . " grim outlook for westlb bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : investors have hoped that the worst is over one such disclosure came wednesday .
while no one expected there to be any good news from the troubled german westlb bank , the news was even worse than expected . westlb announced that the global financial turmoil and stock trading losses would leave it 1.6 billion euros -lrb- $ 2.5 billion -rrb- in the red for 2007 .
the bank had previously estimated a loss of 1 billion euros . " westlb has seen one of the most difficult situations in its history , " said bank head alexander stuhlmann . on monday , the german state of north-rhine westphalia promised a 5 billion euro bailout for the regional bank .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de nato -pipe- 02.04.2008 nato 's eastward expansion rift to dominate summit großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : merkel with romanian president basescu and nato secretary-general de hoop scheffer the membership bids of two former soviet republics , georgia and ukraine , backed strongly by us president bush , are set to overshadow a nato summit in romania - much to the displeasure of germany . us president george w bush urged his european allies to set the two former soviet republics , georgia and ukraine , on a path to nato membership , setting the tone for a potentially tense summit of the 26-member alliance which opens on wednesday , april 2 , in romania . the nato meeting will consider full membership for three countries , albania , croatia and macedonia , and plans for potential membership for ukraine and georgia .
the applications from ukraine and georgia have met skepticism within the alliance as well as open opposition from russia . " the time is not ripe " both germany and france , backed by several smaller countries , strongly oppose bush 's membership action plan -lrb- map -rrb- for the two nations , arguing that georgia and ukraine do not meet nato 's criteria and the decision would be an unnecessary provocation to russia before president-elect dmirty medvedev takes office . german chancellor angela merkel said in bucharest that both georgia and ukraine should have a long-term prospect of nato membership , " but there is one difference with the united states : we believe the time for map is not ripe . " earlier , german foreign minister frank-walter steinmeier said in an interview europe should try to avoid further damaging its relationship with russia . it is clear " that we have reached the limit in foreign policy in relations with russia , " steinmeier regional daily leipziger volkszeitung in an interview . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : steinmeier wants better relations with russia steinmeier pointed to russia 's anger over kosovo as a recent example of deteriorating relations .
russia is likewise strongly opposed to georgia and ukraine becomign nato members .
and steinmeier said he could see " no convincing reason ... to create more tension . " steinmeier stressed that germany does not oppose georgia and ukraine joining nato out of deference to russia .
the german government feels the countries need better internal stability and more internal support for nato before beginning a membership process . expansion disagreements nato leaders are meeting in bucharest to discuss the eastwards expansion of the 26-member alliance as well as its involvement in afghanistan and strategies for the future . georgia and ukraine are hoping to be offered a membership action plan -lrb- map -rrb- , a key step to full membership .
russia opposes the bids on grounds that nato is intruding on its sphere of influence . " the membership action plan marks the point of no return , in our opinion , " moscow 's envoy to nato , dmitry rogozin , told interfax news agency .
" if map is granted to georgia and ukraine ... our relations would take a dramatic turn . " us president george w. bush , who is in eastern europe on a week-long visit , is expected to tell his counterparts that the alliance must remain open to all european democracies looking to join , according to excerpts of his speech made available by the white house . afghanistan prominent on agenda military troop numbers in afghanistan are also likely to dominate the two-day meeting in romania .
at a session on thursday , nato allies and other troop contributors will also meet un secretary-general ban ki-moon and afghan president hamid karzai to discuss better coordination of military , civilian , development and humanitarian efforts . earlier this week , bush toned down demands that germany take on a combat role in southern afghanistan , but he is still expected to ask for europeans to increase their troop contingents . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : protesters at the us embassy in moscow do n't want nato to expand east germany currently has around 3,250 troops based in the capital , kabul , and the relatively peaceful north , where they are engaged in provincial reconstruction missions .
german defense minister franz josef jung said tuesday that the number of bundeswehr troops in afghanistan would not surpass the 3,500 limit set by parliament . french president nicholas sarkozy has said his country was considering beefing up its deployment to afghanistan and prime minister francois fillon said paris may send " a few hundred " extra troops to afghanistan .
france currently has about 2,200 troops stationed in afghanistan . the move has , however , led members of the french opposition to threaten a no confidence vote if sarkozy goes through with his plan . next year 's plans german chancellor angela merkel is expected to use the meeting in bucharest to launch an initiative with sarkozy to stage a summit early next year marking the 60th anniversary of nato 's founding . " with this gesture , sarkozy and merkel want to underline the german-franco friendship , european reconciliation " and the importance of the transatlantic alliance , german government spokesman ulrich wilhelm . wilhelm said the summit would be held jointly in the french city of strasbourg and across the river rhine in the german city of kehl . dw staff -lrb- sms / th -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

the applications from ukraine and georgia have met skepticism within the alliance as well as open opposition from russia . " the time is not ripe " both germany and france , backed by several smaller countries , strongly oppose bush 's membership action plan -lrb- map -rrb- for the two nations , arguing that georgia and ukraine do not meet nato 's criteria and the decision would be an unnecessary provocation to russia before president-elect dmirty medvedev takes office . german chancellor angela merkel said in bucharest that both georgia and ukraine should have a long-term prospect of nato membership , " but there is one difference with the united states : we believe the time for map is not ripe .

russia is likewise strongly opposed to georgia and ukraine becomign nato members .
and steinmeier said he could see " no convincing reason ... to create more tension . " steinmeier stressed that germany does not oppose georgia and ukraine joining nato out of deference to russia .
the german government feels the countries need better internal stability and more internal support for nato before beginning a membership process . expansion disagreements nato leaders are meeting in bucharest to discuss the eastwards expansion of the 26-member alliance as well as its involvement in afghanistan and strategies for the future . georgia and ukraine are hoping to be offered a membership action plan -lrb- map -rrb- , a key step to full membership .
russia opposes the bids on grounds that nato is intruding on its sphere of influence . " the membership action plan marks the point of no return , in our opinion , " moscow 's envoy to nato , dmitry rogozin , told interfax news agency .
" if map is granted to georgia and ukraine ... our relations would take a dramatic turn .

at a session on thursday , nato allies and other troop contributors will also meet un secretary-general ban ki-moon and afghan president hamid karzai to discuss better coordination of military , civilian , development and humanitarian efforts . earlier this week , bush toned down demands that germany take on a combat role in southern afghanistan , but he is still expected to ask for europeans to increase their troop contingents . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : protesters at the us embassy in moscow do n't want nato to expand east germany currently has around 3,250 troops based in the capital , kabul , and the relatively peaceful north , where they are engaged in provincial reconstruction missions .
german defense minister franz josef jung said tuesday that the number of bundeswehr troops in afghanistan would not surpass the 3,500 limit set by parliament . french president nicholas sarkozy has said his country was considering beefing up its deployment to afghanistan and prime minister francois fillon said paris may send " a few hundred " extra troops to afghanistan .
france currently has about 2,200 troops stationed in afghanistan . the move has , however , led members of the french opposition to threaten a no confidence vote if sarkozy goes through with his plan . next year 's plans german chancellor angela merkel is expected to use the meeting in bucharest to launch an initiative with sarkozy to stage a summit early next year marking the 60th anniversary of nato 's founding . " with this gesture , sarkozy and merkel want to underline the german-franco friendship , european reconciliation " and the importance of the transatlantic alliance , german government spokesman ulrich wilhelm . wilhelm said the summit would be held jointly in the french city of strasbourg and across the river rhine in the german city of kehl . dw staff -lrb- sms / th -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

promised reinforcements have n't yet been made available and the interior ministry failed to provide police with appropriate training and mobile tracing equipment , he said . mobile patrols in the border regions replaced stationary border checks after the expansion . minister says no reason to worry bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : poles and germans celebrated on the eve of the schengen expansion schaeuble , however , said on tuesday in the saxon city of zittau that " the concerns of the people in the border regions have not proven true . "
the interior minister had been a major proponent of opening the schengen area late last year , a move that critics said was premature and could lead to increased crime rates in germany . schaeuble 's czech and polish counterparts echoed his sentiments . " the feared scenarios have n't occurred , " said czech interior minister ivan langer .
poland 's state secretary witold drodz called police cooperation between the three countries " exemplary . " since the border posts on the german-polish and german-czech borders were symbolically removed just before christmas last year , 1,128 people have been detained for illegal entry into germany .
713 of these have already been deported back to their home countries . schaeuble said the number of illegal entry attempts was particularly high in december and january , but has sunk dramatically since then . matthias seeger , who heads the federal police district responsible for guarding the border to poland , said the visible presence of the federal police in the 1,300-kilometer -lrb- 800-mile -rrb- border region continued to ensure greater security for the people there . borders dismantled in new schengen countries bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : border controls such as these have been dismantled in new schengen members on sunday , passport controls in airports were lifted in the nine new member countries - estonia , the czech republic , lithuania , hungary , latvia , malta , poland , slovakia and slovenia .
the abolishment of the air borders had been postponed to coincide with the airlines ' bi-yearly flight schedule changes . " it all went very smoothly , " said friso roscam abbing , spokesman for the eu 's justice , freedom and security commission . the schengen area is now made up of 22 eu countries plus norway and iceland .

" the higher emissions resulting from the phase-out of nuclear energy -lsb- and the resulting reliance on other forms of energy -rsb- must be considered by the european union in the total budget of emissions trading , " said glos , according to the handelsblatt . glos also pointed to sweden as a forerunner in the effort to gain allowances .
he said sweden was able to achieve such special treatment from the eu at the end of the 1990s - setting a precedent , said glos , from which germany could now benefit . during negotiations about how to share the burden of meeting emissions cuts among eu countries in trying to fulfill the requirements of the kyoto protocol , sweden at the time pointed to its efforts to phase out the use of nuclear energy .
the country was then permitted to raise its co2 emissions output by four percent from 1990 to 2012 . long-term emissions cuts bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : germany has agreed to significantly curtail its emissions germany is required to reduce its emissions by 21 percent during that same period , while eu countries as a whole have aimed to reduce emissions by eight percent . currently , the european commission is hammering out a plan to implement the resolutions regarding energy and climate change which were agreed on at an eu summit in march 2007 . in the plan , the eu wants to define what its contribution should be in the next international agreement for protecting the environment , which is to replace the kyoto protocol when its requirements expire at the end of 2012 .
the eu aims to reduce co2 emissions by 20 percent by 2020 , compared to 1990 levels . according to the handelsblatt , the german environment ministry has not yet responded to glos ' request , but told the paper that higher emissions in the sectors involved in emissions trading " would have to be balanced out by additional emissions reduction in other areas , such as the private household or transportation sectors , if germany is to achieve the climate protection targets laid out in eu agreements .

" the higher emissions resulting from the phase-out of nuclear energy -lsb- and the resulting reliance on other forms of energy -rsb- must be considered by the european union in the total budget of emissions trading , " said glos , according to the handelsblatt . glos also pointed to sweden as a forerunner in the effort to gain allowances .
he said sweden was able to achieve such special treatment from the eu at the end of the 1990s - setting a precedent , said glos , from which germany could now benefit . during negotiations about how to share the burden of meeting emissions cuts among eu countries in trying to fulfill the requirements of the kyoto protocol , sweden at the time pointed to its efforts to phase out the use of nuclear energy .
the country was then permitted to raise its co2 emissions output by four percent from 1990 to 2012 . long-term emissions cuts bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : germany has agreed to significantly curtail its emissions germany is required to reduce its emissions by 21 percent during that same period , while eu countries as a whole have aimed to reduce emissions by eight percent . currently , the european commission is hammering out a plan to implement the resolutions regarding energy and climate change which were agreed on at an eu summit in march 2007 . in the plan , the eu wants to define what its contribution should be in the next international agreement for protecting the environment , which is to replace the kyoto protocol when its requirements expire at the end of 2012 .
the eu aims to reduce co2 emissions by 20 percent by 2020 , compared to 1990 levels . according to the handelsblatt , the german environment ministry has not yet responded to glos ' request , but told the paper that higher emissions in the sectors involved in emissions trading " would have to be balanced out by additional emissions reduction in other areas , such as the private household or transportation sectors , if germany is to achieve the climate protection targets laid out in eu agreements .

the applications from ukraine and georgia have met skepticism within the alliance as well as open opposition from russia .

the german government feels the countries need better internal stability and more internal support for nato before beginning a membership process . expansion disagreements nato leaders are meeting in bucharest to discuss the eastwards expansion of the 26-member alliance as well as its involvement in afghanistan and strategies for the future . georgia and ukraine are hoping to be offered a membership action plan -lrb- map -rrb- , a key step to full membership .
russia opposes the bids on grounds that nato is intruding on its sphere of influence . " the membership action plan marks the point of no return , in our opinion , " moscow 's envoy to nato , dmitry rogozin , told interfax news agency .
" if map is granted to georgia and ukraine ... our relations would take a dramatic turn . " us president george w. bush , who is in eastern europe on a week-long visit , is expected to tell his counterparts that the alliance must remain open to all european democracies looking to join , according to excerpts of his speech made available by the white house . afghanistan prominent on agenda military troop numbers in afghanistan are also likely to dominate the two-day meeting in romania .
at a session on thursday , nato allies and other troop contributors will also meet un secretary-general ban ki-moon and afghan president hamid karzai to discuss better coordination of military , civilian , development and humanitarian efforts . earlier this week , bush toned down demands that germany take on a combat role in southern afghanistan , but he is still expected to ask for europeans to increase their troop contingents . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : protesters at the us embassy in moscow do n't want nato to expand east germany currently has around 3,250 troops based in the capital , kabul , and the relatively peaceful north , where they are engaged in provincial reconstruction missions .
german defense minister franz josef jung said tuesday that the number of bundeswehr troops in afghanistan would not surpass the 3,500 limit set by parliament . french president nicholas sarkozy has said his country was considering beefing up its deployment to afghanistan and prime minister francois fillon said paris may send " a few hundred " extra troops to afghanistan .
france currently has about 2,200 troops stationed in afghanistan . the move has , however , led members of the french opposition to threaten a no confidence vote if sarkozy goes through with his plan . next year 's plans german chancellor angela merkel is expected to use the meeting in bucharest to launch an initiative with sarkozy to stage a summit early next year marking the 60th anniversary of nato 's founding . " with this gesture , sarkozy and merkel want to underline the german-franco friendship , european reconciliation " and the importance of the transatlantic alliance , german government spokesman ulrich wilhelm . wilhelm said the summit would be held jointly in the french city of strasbourg and across the river rhine in the german city of kehl . dw staff -lrb- sms / th -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

the applications from ukraine and georgia have met skepticism within the alliance as well as open opposition from russia . " the time is not ripe " both germany and france , backed by several smaller countries , strongly oppose bush 's membership action plan -lrb- map -rrb- for the two nations , arguing that georgia and ukraine do not meet nato 's criteria and the decision would be an unnecessary provocation to russia before president-elect dmirty medvedev takes office . german chancellor angela merkel said in bucharest that both georgia and ukraine should have a long-term prospect of nato membership , " but there is one difference with the united states : we believe the time for map is not ripe . " earlier , german foreign minister frank-walter steinmeier said in an interview europe should try to avoid further damaging its relationship with russia . it is clear " that we have reached the limit in foreign policy in relations with russia , " steinmeier regional daily leipziger volkszeitung in an interview . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : steinmeier wants better relations with russia steinmeier pointed to russia 's anger over kosovo as a recent example of deteriorating relations .
russia is likewise strongly opposed to georgia and ukraine becomign nato members .
and steinmeier said he could see " no convincing reason ... to create more tension . " steinmeier stressed that germany does not oppose georgia and ukraine joining nato out of deference to russia .

the applications from ukraine and georgia have met skepticism within the alliance as well as open opposition from russia . " the time is not ripe " both germany and france , backed by several smaller countries , strongly oppose bush 's membership action plan -lrb- map -rrb- for the two nations , arguing that georgia and ukraine do not meet nato 's criteria and the decision would be an unnecessary provocation to russia before president-elect dmirty medvedev takes office . german chancellor angela merkel said in bucharest that both georgia and ukraine should have a long-term prospect of nato membership , " but there is one difference with the united states : we believe the time for map is not ripe . " earlier , german foreign minister frank-walter steinmeier said in an interview europe should try to avoid further damaging its relationship with russia . it is clear " that we have reached the limit in foreign policy in relations with russia , " steinmeier regional daily leipziger volkszeitung in an interview . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : steinmeier wants better relations with russia steinmeier pointed to russia 's anger over kosovo as a recent example of deteriorating relations .
russia is likewise strongly opposed to georgia and ukraine becomign nato members .
and steinmeier said he could see " no convincing reason ... to create more tension . " steinmeier stressed that germany does not oppose georgia and ukraine joining nato out of deference to russia .
the german government feels the countries need better internal stability and more internal support for nato before beginning a membership process . expansion disagreements nato leaders are meeting in bucharest to discuss the eastwards expansion of the 26-member alliance as well as its involvement in afghanistan and strategies for the future . georgia and ukraine are hoping to be offered a membership action plan -lrb- map -rrb- , a key step to full membership .
russia opposes the bids on grounds that nato is intruding on its sphere of influence . " the membership action plan marks the point of no return , in our opinion , " moscow 's envoy to nato , dmitry rogozin , told interfax news agency .
" if map is granted to georgia and ukraine ... our relations would take a dramatic turn . " us president george w. bush , who is in eastern europe on a week-long visit , is expected to tell his counterparts that the alliance must remain open to all european democracies looking to join , according to excerpts of his speech made available by the white house . afghanistan prominent on agenda military troop numbers in afghanistan are also likely to dominate the two-day meeting in romania .
at a session on thursday , nato allies and other troop contributors will also meet un secretary-general ban ki-moon and afghan president hamid karzai to discuss better coordination of military , civilian , development and humanitarian efforts . earlier this week , bush toned down demands that germany take on a combat role in southern afghanistan , but he is still expected to ask for europeans to increase their troop contingents . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : protesters at the us embassy in moscow do n't want nato to expand east germany currently has around 3,250 troops based in the capital , kabul , and the relatively peaceful north , where they are engaged in provincial reconstruction missions .
german defense minister franz josef jung said tuesday that the number of bundeswehr troops in afghanistan would not surpass the 3,500 limit set by parliament . french president nicholas sarkozy has said his country was considering beefing up its deployment to afghanistan and prime minister francois fillon said paris may send " a few hundred " extra troops to afghanistan .
france currently has about 2,200 troops stationed in afghanistan . the move has , however , led members of the french opposition to threaten a no confidence vote if sarkozy goes through with his plan . next year 's plans german chancellor angela merkel is expected to use the meeting in bucharest to launch an initiative with sarkozy to stage a summit early next year marking the 60th anniversary of nato 's founding . " with this gesture , sarkozy and merkel want to underline the german-franco friendship , european reconciliation " and the importance of the transatlantic alliance , german government spokesman ulrich wilhelm . wilhelm said the summit would be held jointly in the french city of strasbourg and across the river rhine in the german city of kehl . dw staff -lrb- sms / th -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

on wednesday , a german regional public bank bank posted a massive 2007 net loss . european and us investors were unfazed after the tuesday announcement from two of europe 's largest banks - swiss bank ubs and germany 's deutsche bank - of enormous first quarter losses .
there was a sense that things could n't get much worse and that the bad news could actually set the beleaguered banking industry down the road to recovery . but the celebrations might prove premature .
german banks are estimated to have about 200 billion euros -lrb- $ 312 billion -rrb- in bad credit on their books , according to a study by ernst & young released wednesday . world-wide , us loan defaults that sparked the crisis could cause losses in the financial industry of up to $ 600 billion , according to spiegel magazine , citing an internal study by german financial supervisory body bafin .
the 16-page paper was a worse-case scenario which bafin stressed might not happen . thus far , financial institutions have publicly admitted to losses of $ 295 billion .
german banks were believed to be exposed to about 10 percent of the total , according to the federal regulator .

as long as the price decline in the us property market continues , further turbulences have to be expected , " weber said in an interview with the german newspaper bild , which appeared wednesday . european union economic and monetary affairs commissioner joachin almunia echoed the ecb concern that further bad news could come .

on wednesday , a german regional public bank bank posted a massive 2007 net loss . european and us investors were unfazed after the tuesday announcement from two of europe 's largest banks - swiss bank ubs and germany 's deutsche bank - of enormous first quarter losses .
there was a sense that things could n't get much worse and that the bad news could actually set the beleaguered banking industry down the road to recovery . but the celebrations might prove premature .
german banks are estimated to have about 200 billion euros -lrb- $ 312 billion -rrb- in bad credit on their books , according to a study by ernst & young released wednesday . world-wide , us loan defaults that sparked the crisis could cause losses in the financial industry of up to $ 600 billion , according to spiegel magazine , citing an internal study by german financial supervisory body bafin .
the 16-page paper was a worse-case scenario which bafin stressed might not happen . thus far , financial institutions have publicly admitted to losses of $ 295 billion .
german banks were believed to be exposed to about 10 percent of the total , according to the federal regulator .

but fc schalke 04 looked intimidated by fc barcelona on tuesday , april 1 , admitted coach mirko slomka . slomka said his team , which lost 0-1 , was not aggressive enough against the spanish soccer giants . " when you play barcelona , you have to respect them , but i think we gave them too much respect today -lrb- tuesday -rrb- , " slomka said . barcelona 's 17-year-old striker bojan krkic scored the game 's only goal 12 minutes into the first half and schalke was unable to respond despite numerous chances .
xavi hernandez got the play started , splitting open schalke 's defense .
ex-arsenal striker thierry henry picked up a rebound from schalke goalie manuel neuer and passed it to krkic , who buried a shot at the top of the net . schalke left defenseless bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : slomka was unhappy with the timid playing schalke gave barcelona too much space and thierry henry wasted no time in taking advantage of it , said slomka .
to make it worse , schalke " did n't have enough courage to attack them , " the coach said . " in the second half we had our chances to force an equalizer , but unfortunately we did n't take them , " he said .
" we had talked about the danger of conceding an early goal , unfortunately manuel neuer did n't hold onto the ball and that was an error . " the germans had plenty of chances to even out the score , with fabian ernst and halil altintop both having shots on the goal close to the midway point of the second half .
schalke 's soren larsen then squandered a free header and marcelo bordon brought a fingertip save from victor valdes in the match 's final moments . down , but not out bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : next week barcelona will play at home if schalke ever was going to beat barcelona , tuesday at their home field in gelsenkirchen was the night .
the catalans lost four of their seven games in march .
and when the teams meet for the second leg of the quarterfinal match on april 9 , barcelona will have home-field advantage . " in the champions league you have to capitalize on chances like the ones we had , " slomka said . barcelona coach frank rijkaard admitted his side coasted during the second half , but praised his players for their tough playing . " it was a very hard match , " he said .
" schalke showed how strong they are and what team spirit they have . " semi-finals on the horizon bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : which team will make it to the semi-finals ? the winner of next week 's quarter-final second leg of the champions league will likely face manchester united in the semi-finals . schalke 's slomka said his players would not repeat the errors next week . " in spite of the result we still have our chances , " said schalke 's slomka .

" the higher emissions resulting from the phase-out of nuclear energy -lsb- and the resulting reliance on other forms of energy -rsb- must be considered by the european union in the total budget of emissions trading , " said glos , according to the handelsblatt . glos also pointed to sweden as a forerunner in the effort to gain allowances .
he said sweden was able to achieve such special treatment from the eu at the end of the 1990s - setting a precedent , said glos , from which germany could now benefit . during negotiations about how to share the burden of meeting emissions cuts among eu countries in trying to fulfill the requirements of the kyoto protocol , sweden at the time pointed to its efforts to phase out the use of nuclear energy .
the country was then permitted to raise its co2 emissions output by four percent from 1990 to 2012 . long-term emissions cuts bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : germany has agreed to significantly curtail its emissions germany is required to reduce its emissions by 21 percent during that same period , while eu countries as a whole have aimed to reduce emissions by eight percent . currently , the european commission is hammering out a plan to implement the resolutions regarding energy and climate change which were agreed on at an eu summit in march 2007 . in the plan , the eu wants to define what its contribution should be in the next international agreement for protecting the environment , which is to replace the kyoto protocol when its requirements expire at the end of 2012 .
the eu aims to reduce co2 emissions by 20 percent by 2020 , compared to 1990 levels . according to the handelsblatt , the german environment ministry has not yet responded to glos ' request , but told the paper that higher emissions in the sectors involved in emissions trading " would have to be balanced out by additional emissions reduction in other areas , such as the private household or transportation sectors , if germany is to achieve the climate protection targets laid out in eu agreements .

the applications from ukraine and georgia have met skepticism within the alliance as well as open opposition from russia . " the time is not ripe " both germany and france , backed by several smaller countries , strongly oppose bush 's membership action plan -lrb- map -rrb- for the two nations , arguing that georgia and ukraine do not meet nato 's criteria and the decision would be an unnecessary provocation to russia before president-elect dmirty medvedev takes office . german chancellor angela merkel said in bucharest that both georgia and ukraine should have a long-term prospect of nato membership , " but there is one difference with the united states : we believe the time for map is not ripe .

russia opposes the bids on grounds that nato is intruding on its sphere of influence . " the membership action plan marks the point of no return , in our opinion , " moscow 's envoy to nato , dmitry rogozin , told interfax news agency .
" if map is granted to georgia and ukraine ... our relations would take a dramatic turn .

at a session on thursday , nato allies and other troop contributors will also meet un secretary-general ban ki-moon and afghan president hamid karzai to discuss better coordination of military , civilian , development and humanitarian efforts . earlier this week , bush toned down demands that germany take on a combat role in southern afghanistan , but he is still expected to ask for europeans to increase their troop contingents . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : protesters at the us embassy in moscow do n't want nato to expand east germany currently has around 3,250 troops based in the capital , kabul , and the relatively peaceful north , where they are engaged in provincial reconstruction missions .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de banking -pipe- 02.04.2008 european officials warn banking woes set to continue großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : europe 's banking industry is n't out of the woods yet even as investors seemed ready to put the banking crisis behind them , top european officials warned that more bad news was likely .
on wednesday , a german regional public bank bank posted a massive 2007 net loss . european and us investors were unfazed after the tuesday announcement from two of europe 's largest banks - swiss bank ubs and germany 's deutsche bank - of enormous first quarter losses .
there was a sense that things could n't get much worse and that the bad news could actually set the beleaguered banking industry down the road to recovery . but the celebrations might prove premature .
german banks are estimated to have about 200 billion euros -lrb- $ 312 billion -rrb- in bad credit on their books , according to a study by ernst & young released wednesday . world-wide , us loan defaults that sparked the crisis could cause losses in the financial industry of up to $ 600 billion , according to spiegel magazine , citing an internal study by german financial supervisory body bafin .
the 16-page paper was a worse-case scenario which bafin stressed might not happen . thus far , financial institutions have publicly admitted to losses of $ 295 billion .
german banks were believed to be exposed to about 10 percent of the total , according to the federal regulator .
calls for transparency bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : weber warned that the crisis of confidence is n't over european central bank -lrb- ecb -rrb- governor axel weber also warned that more bad news is sure to come . " the crisis of confidence is not over yet .
as long as the price decline in the us property market continues , further turbulences have to be expected , " weber said in an interview with the german newspaper bild , which appeared wednesday . european union economic and monetary affairs commissioner joachin almunia echoed the ecb concern that further bad news could come . " we do not yet have an overview of the level of losses , banks do not yet inspire trust , " almunia said in an interview with the frankfurter rundshau newspaper . weber reiterated the need for more transparency in the banking sector , calling on banks which have taken great risks to " disclose their losses . " grim outlook for westlb bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : investors have hoped that the worst is over one such disclosure came wednesday .
while no one expected there to be any good news from the troubled german westlb bank , the news was even worse than expected . westlb announced that the global financial turmoil and stock trading losses would leave it 1.6 billion euros -lrb- $ 2.5 billion -rrb- in the red for 2007 .
the bank had previously estimated a loss of 1 billion euros . " westlb has seen one of the most difficult situations in its history , " said bank head alexander stuhlmann . on monday , the german state of north-rhine westphalia promised a 5 billion euro bailout for the regional bank .
the state holds a stake of around 38 percent in westlb and regional state-owned savings banks hold more than 50 percent of the bank 's shares . the bank has also announced plans to cut 1,350 jobs as part of a plan to turn the business around and possibly prepare it for a sale or merger . extent of exposure murky bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the german banking industry has been among the hardest hit in europe the westlb announcement comes one day after two of europe 's biggest banks , both of which had extensive exposure to the us subprime crisis , announced major first quarter losses . deutsche bank said it would write down 2.5 billion euros and swiss bank ubs said it would write down 12 billion euros .
the bad news pushed up both banks ' stock prices , as investors hoped the worst of the crisis might soon be over . since the us market for high-risk mortgages collapsed last year , lending on international credit markets has dried up .
banks have been unable to determine their own exposure to potential losses and therefore have become wary of lending to one another . international financial officials have repeatedly called on banks and other financial institutions to come clean on their losses , which would restore market confidence . for germany , a muted upswing bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : ubs has come clean on expected losses while the us seems to be headed towards a recession , almunia said he believes that the " european economies are better prepared than others against the crisis . " weber , who is also the president of the bundesbank or german central bank , remained confident regarding the german economy 's outlook . " the upswing is continuing , " weber told the bild .
" above all , that refers to the ' up ' , just the ' swing ' dwindles away a bit . " the bundesbank forecasts that the german economy , europe 's biggest , will grow by a little more than 1.5 percent in 2008 . weber said he does continue to have long-term concerns about inflation .
euro zone inflation accelerated to a provisional 3.5 percent year-on-year in march , the highest level since the single currency was launched in 1999 . " it is important for the further upswing that the purchasing power of the people is preserved , " weber said . dw staff -lrb- th -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

the applications from ukraine and georgia have met skepticism within the alliance as well as open opposition from russia . " the time is not ripe " both germany and france , backed by several smaller countries , strongly oppose bush 's membership action plan -lrb- map -rrb- for the two nations , arguing that georgia and ukraine do not meet nato 's criteria and the decision would be an unnecessary provocation to russia before president-elect dmirty medvedev takes office . german chancellor angela merkel said in bucharest that both georgia and ukraine should have a long-term prospect of nato membership , " but there is one difference with the united states : we believe the time for map is not ripe . " earlier , german foreign minister frank-walter steinmeier said in an interview europe should try to avoid further damaging its relationship with russia . it is clear " that we have reached the limit in foreign policy in relations with russia , " steinmeier regional daily leipziger volkszeitung in an interview . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : steinmeier wants better relations with russia steinmeier pointed to russia 's anger over kosovo as a recent example of deteriorating relations .
russia is likewise strongly opposed to georgia and ukraine becomign nato members .
and steinmeier said he could see " no convincing reason ... to create more tension . " steinmeier stressed that germany does not oppose georgia and ukraine joining nato out of deference to russia .
the german government feels the countries need better internal stability and more internal support for nato before beginning a membership process . expansion disagreements nato leaders are meeting in bucharest to discuss the eastwards expansion of the 26-member alliance as well as its involvement in afghanistan and strategies for the future . georgia and ukraine are hoping to be offered a membership action plan -lrb- map -rrb- , a key step to full membership .
russia opposes the bids on grounds that nato is intruding on its sphere of influence . " the membership action plan marks the point of no return , in our opinion , " moscow 's envoy to nato , dmitry rogozin , told interfax news agency .
" if map is granted to georgia and ukraine ... our relations would take a dramatic turn . " us president george w. bush , who is in eastern europe on a week-long visit , is expected to tell his counterparts that the alliance must remain open to all european democracies looking to join , according to excerpts of his speech made available by the white house . afghanistan prominent on agenda military troop numbers in afghanistan are also likely to dominate the two-day meeting in romania .
at a session on thursday , nato allies and other troop contributors will also meet un secretary-general ban ki-moon and afghan president hamid karzai to discuss better coordination of military , civilian , development and humanitarian efforts . earlier this week , bush toned down demands that germany take on a combat role in southern afghanistan , but he is still expected to ask for europeans to increase their troop contingents . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : protesters at the us embassy in moscow do n't want nato to expand east germany currently has around 3,250 troops based in the capital , kabul , and the relatively peaceful north , where they are engaged in provincial reconstruction missions .
german defense minister franz josef jung said tuesday that the number of bundeswehr troops in afghanistan would not surpass the 3,500 limit set by parliament . french president nicholas sarkozy has said his country was considering beefing up its deployment to afghanistan and prime minister francois fillon said paris may send " a few hundred " extra troops to afghanistan .
france currently has about 2,200 troops stationed in afghanistan . the move has , however , led members of the french opposition to threaten a no confidence vote if sarkozy goes through with his plan . next year 's plans german chancellor angela merkel is expected to use the meeting in bucharest to launch an initiative with sarkozy to stage a summit early next year marking the 60th anniversary of nato 's founding . " with this gesture , sarkozy and merkel want to underline the german-franco friendship , european reconciliation " and the importance of the transatlantic alliance , german government spokesman ulrich wilhelm . wilhelm said the summit would be held jointly in the french city of strasbourg and across the river rhine in the german city of kehl . dw staff -lrb- sms / th -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

the applications from ukraine and georgia have met skepticism within the alliance as well as open opposition from russia . " the time is not ripe " both germany and france , backed by several smaller countries , strongly oppose bush 's membership action plan -lrb- map -rrb- for the two nations , arguing that georgia and ukraine do not meet nato 's criteria and the decision would be an unnecessary provocation to russia before president-elect dmirty medvedev takes office . german chancellor angela merkel said in bucharest that both georgia and ukraine should have a long-term prospect of nato membership , " but there is one difference with the united states : we believe the time for map is not ripe .

the eu aims to reduce co2 emissions by 20 percent by 2020 , compared to 1990 levels . according to the handelsblatt , the german environment ministry has not yet responded to glos ' request , but told the paper that higher emissions in the sectors involved in emissions trading " would have to be balanced out by additional emissions reduction in other areas , such as the private household or transportation sectors , if germany is to achieve the climate protection targets laid out in eu agreements .

it has inked a deal to dispose of up to 160,000 tons of neapolitan waste - for a tidy price . italian representatives closed the deal with germany 's state environment ministries , according to a report in the frankfurter allgemeine zeitung .
up to 60,000 tons of trash will be removed from the streets of naples and shipped to germany for incineration ; another 100,000 tons will be made up of household waste . hamburg 's commercial waste disposal service srh has already agreed to take 30,000 tons at a price of 150 euros -lrb- $ 235 -rrb- per ton .

" it will and should not turn into a permanent situation that italy disposes of waste in germany , " the spokesman said . italy 's rubbish crisis peaked in december when campania 's landfill sites were declared full and trash began to pile up on the streets .
the italian government then gave former police chief gianni de gennaro a 120-day mandate to clean up the mess which has led to sagging tourist rates . while the streets in downtown naples have been cleared , the suburbs are reportedly still littered with garbage . dw staff -lrb- kjb -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de banking -pipe- 02.04.2008 european officials warn banking woes set to continue großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : europe 's banking industry is n't out of the woods yet even as investors seemed ready to put the banking crisis behind them , top european officials warned that more bad news was likely .
on wednesday , a german regional public bank bank posted a massive 2007 net loss . european and us investors were unfazed after the tuesday announcement from two of europe 's largest banks - swiss bank ubs and germany 's deutsche bank - of enormous first quarter losses .
there was a sense that things could n't get much worse and that the bad news could actually set the beleaguered banking industry down the road to recovery . but the celebrations might prove premature .
german banks are estimated to have about 200 billion euros -lrb- $ 312 billion -rrb- in bad credit on their books , according to a study by ernst & young released wednesday . world-wide , us loan defaults that sparked the crisis could cause losses in the financial industry of up to $ 600 billion , according to spiegel magazine , citing an internal study by german financial supervisory body bafin .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de nato -pipe- 02.04.2008 nato 's eastward expansion rift to dominate summit großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : merkel with romanian president basescu and nato secretary-general de hoop scheffer the membership bids of two former soviet republics , georgia and ukraine , backed strongly by us president bush , are set to overshadow a nato summit in romania - much to the displeasure of germany . us president george w bush urged his european allies to set the two former soviet republics , georgia and ukraine , on a path to nato membership , setting the tone for a potentially tense summit of the 26-member alliance which opens on wednesday , april 2 , in romania . the nato meeting will consider full membership for three countries , albania , croatia and macedonia , and plans for potential membership for ukraine and georgia .
the applications from ukraine and georgia have met skepticism within the alliance as well as open opposition from russia . " the time is not ripe " both germany and france , backed by several smaller countries , strongly oppose bush 's membership action plan -lrb- map -rrb- for the two nations , arguing that georgia and ukraine do not meet nato 's criteria and the decision would be an unnecessary provocation to russia before president-elect dmirty medvedev takes office . german chancellor angela merkel said in bucharest that both georgia and ukraine should have a long-term prospect of nato membership , " but there is one difference with the united states : we believe the time for map is not ripe . " earlier , german foreign minister frank-walter steinmeier said in an interview europe should try to avoid further damaging its relationship with russia . it is clear " that we have reached the limit in foreign policy in relations with russia , " steinmeier regional daily leipziger volkszeitung in an interview . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : steinmeier wants better relations with russia steinmeier pointed to russia 's anger over kosovo as a recent example of deteriorating relations .
russia is likewise strongly opposed to georgia and ukraine becomign nato members .
and steinmeier said he could see " no convincing reason ... to create more tension . " steinmeier stressed that germany does not oppose georgia and ukraine joining nato out of deference to russia .
the german government feels the countries need better internal stability and more internal support for nato before beginning a membership process . expansion disagreements nato leaders are meeting in bucharest to discuss the eastwards expansion of the 26-member alliance as well as its involvement in afghanistan and strategies for the future . georgia and ukraine are hoping to be offered a membership action plan -lrb- map -rrb- , a key step to full membership .
russia opposes the bids on grounds that nato is intruding on its sphere of influence . " the membership action plan marks the point of no return , in our opinion , " moscow 's envoy to nato , dmitry rogozin , told interfax news agency .
" if map is granted to georgia and ukraine ... our relations would take a dramatic turn . " us president george w. bush , who is in eastern europe on a week-long visit , is expected to tell his counterparts that the alliance must remain open to all european democracies looking to join , according to excerpts of his speech made available by the white house . afghanistan prominent on agenda military troop numbers in afghanistan are also likely to dominate the two-day meeting in romania .
at a session on thursday , nato allies and other troop contributors will also meet un secretary-general ban ki-moon and afghan president hamid karzai to discuss better coordination of military , civilian , development and humanitarian efforts . earlier this week , bush toned down demands that germany take on a combat role in southern afghanistan , but he is still expected to ask for europeans to increase their troop contingents . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : protesters at the us embassy in moscow do n't want nato to expand east germany currently has around 3,250 troops based in the capital , kabul , and the relatively peaceful north , where they are engaged in provincial reconstruction missions .
german defense minister franz josef jung said tuesday that the number of bundeswehr troops in afghanistan would not surpass the 3,500 limit set by parliament . french president nicholas sarkozy has said his country was considering beefing up its deployment to afghanistan and prime minister francois fillon said paris may send " a few hundred " extra troops to afghanistan .
france currently has about 2,200 troops stationed in afghanistan . the move has , however , led members of the french opposition to threaten a no confidence vote if sarkozy goes through with his plan . next year 's plans german chancellor angela merkel is expected to use the meeting in bucharest to launch an initiative with sarkozy to stage a summit early next year marking the 60th anniversary of nato 's founding . " with this gesture , sarkozy and merkel want to underline the german-franco friendship , european reconciliation " and the importance of the transatlantic alliance , german government spokesman ulrich wilhelm . wilhelm said the summit would be held jointly in the french city of strasbourg and across the river rhine in the german city of kehl . dw staff -lrb- sms / th -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

the applications from ukraine and georgia have met skepticism within the alliance as well as open opposition from russia . " the time is not ripe " both germany and france , backed by several smaller countries , strongly oppose bush 's membership action plan -lrb- map -rrb- for the two nations , arguing that georgia and ukraine do not meet nato 's criteria and the decision would be an unnecessary provocation to russia before president-elect dmirty medvedev takes office . german chancellor angela merkel said in bucharest that both georgia and ukraine should have a long-term prospect of nato membership , " but there is one difference with the united states : we believe the time for map is not ripe .

his views are at odds with the police who say crime has risen . break-ins and thefts have risen considerably in germany 's border regions since the passport-free schengen area added nine new central and eastern european members on dec .
21 , 2007 , klaus jansen , chairmen of the federation of german detectives , told deutschlandfunk public radio on tuesday , april 1 . jansen criticized german interior minister wolfgang schaeuble for not adequately preparing police for the move .
promised reinforcements have n't yet been made available and the interior ministry failed to provide police with appropriate training and mobile tracing equipment , he said . mobile patrols in the border regions replaced stationary border checks after the expansion . minister says no reason to worry bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : poles and germans celebrated on the eve of the schengen expansion schaeuble , however , said on tuesday in the saxon city of zittau that " the concerns of the people in the border regions have not proven true .

the interior minister had been a major proponent of opening the schengen area late last year , a move that critics said was premature and could lead to increased crime rates in germany . schaeuble 's czech and polish counterparts echoed his sentiments .

713 of these have already been deported back to their home countries . schaeuble said the number of illegal entry attempts was particularly high in december and january , but has sunk dramatically since then . matthias seeger , who heads the federal police district responsible for guarding the border to poland , said the visible presence of the federal police in the 1,300-kilometer -lrb- 800-mile -rrb- border region continued to ensure greater security for the people there . borders dismantled in new schengen countries bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : border controls such as these have been dismantled in new schengen members on sunday , passport controls in airports were lifted in the nine new member countries - estonia , the czech republic , lithuania , hungary , latvia , malta , poland , slovakia and slovenia .

the applications from ukraine and georgia have met skepticism within the alliance as well as open opposition from russia . " the time is not ripe " both germany and france , backed by several smaller countries , strongly oppose bush 's membership action plan -lrb- map -rrb- for the two nations , arguing that georgia and ukraine do not meet nato 's criteria and the decision would be an unnecessary provocation to russia before president-elect dmirty medvedev takes office . german chancellor angela merkel said in bucharest that both georgia and ukraine should have a long-term prospect of nato membership , " but there is one difference with the united states : we believe the time for map is not ripe .

the german government feels the countries need better internal stability and more internal support for nato before beginning a membership process . expansion disagreements nato leaders are meeting in bucharest to discuss the eastwards expansion of the 26-member alliance as well as its involvement in afghanistan and strategies for the future . georgia and ukraine are hoping to be offered a membership action plan -lrb- map -rrb- , a key step to full membership .
russia opposes the bids on grounds that nato is intruding on its sphere of influence . " the membership action plan marks the point of no return , in our opinion , " moscow 's envoy to nato , dmitry rogozin , told interfax news agency .
" if map is granted to georgia and ukraine ... our relations would take a dramatic turn .

france currently has about 2,200 troops stationed in afghanistan . the move has , however , led members of the french opposition to threaten a no confidence vote if sarkozy goes through with his plan . next year 's plans german chancellor angela merkel is expected to use the meeting in bucharest to launch an initiative with sarkozy to stage a summit early next year marking the 60th anniversary of nato 's founding .

the applications from ukraine and georgia have met skepticism within the alliance as well as open opposition from russia . " the time is not ripe " both germany and france , backed by several smaller countries , strongly oppose bush 's membership action plan -lrb- map -rrb- for the two nations , arguing that georgia and ukraine do not meet nato 's criteria and the decision would be an unnecessary provocation to russia before president-elect dmirty medvedev takes office . german chancellor angela merkel said in bucharest that both georgia and ukraine should have a long-term prospect of nato membership , " but there is one difference with the united states : we believe the time for map is not ripe . " earlier , german foreign minister frank-walter steinmeier said in an interview europe should try to avoid further damaging its relationship with russia . it is clear " that we have reached the limit in foreign policy in relations with russia , " steinmeier regional daily leipziger volkszeitung in an interview . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : steinmeier wants better relations with russia steinmeier pointed to russia 's anger over kosovo as a recent example of deteriorating relations .
russia is likewise strongly opposed to georgia and ukraine becomign nato members .
and steinmeier said he could see " no convincing reason ... to create more tension . " steinmeier stressed that germany does not oppose georgia and ukraine joining nato out of deference to russia .
the german government feels the countries need better internal stability and more internal support for nato before beginning a membership process . expansion disagreements nato leaders are meeting in bucharest to discuss the eastwards expansion of the 26-member alliance as well as its involvement in afghanistan and strategies for the future . georgia and ukraine are hoping to be offered a membership action plan -lrb- map -rrb- , a key step to full membership .
russia opposes the bids on grounds that nato is intruding on its sphere of influence . " the membership action plan marks the point of no return , in our opinion , " moscow 's envoy to nato , dmitry rogozin , told interfax news agency .
" if map is granted to georgia and ukraine ... our relations would take a dramatic turn . " us president george w. bush , who is in eastern europe on a week-long visit , is expected to tell his counterparts that the alliance must remain open to all european democracies looking to join , according to excerpts of his speech made available by the white house . afghanistan prominent on agenda military troop numbers in afghanistan are also likely to dominate the two-day meeting in romania .
at a session on thursday , nato allies and other troop contributors will also meet un secretary-general ban ki-moon and afghan president hamid karzai to discuss better coordination of military , civilian , development and humanitarian efforts . earlier this week , bush toned down demands that germany take on a combat role in southern afghanistan , but he is still expected to ask for europeans to increase their troop contingents . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : protesters at the us embassy in moscow do n't want nato to expand east germany currently has around 3,250 troops based in the capital , kabul , and the relatively peaceful north , where they are engaged in provincial reconstruction missions .
german defense minister franz josef jung said tuesday that the number of bundeswehr troops in afghanistan would not surpass the 3,500 limit set by parliament . french president nicholas sarkozy has said his country was considering beefing up its deployment to afghanistan and prime minister francois fillon said paris may send " a few hundred " extra troops to afghanistan .
france currently has about 2,200 troops stationed in afghanistan . the move has , however , led members of the french opposition to threaten a no confidence vote if sarkozy goes through with his plan . next year 's plans german chancellor angela merkel is expected to use the meeting in bucharest to launch an initiative with sarkozy to stage a summit early next year marking the 60th anniversary of nato 's founding . " with this gesture , sarkozy and merkel want to underline the german-franco friendship , european reconciliation " and the importance of the transatlantic alliance , german government spokesman ulrich wilhelm . wilhelm said the summit would be held jointly in the french city of strasbourg and across the river rhine in the german city of kehl . dw staff -lrb- sms / th -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de banking -pipe- 02.04.2008 european officials warn banking woes set to continue großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : europe 's banking industry is n't out of the woods yet even as investors seemed ready to put the banking crisis behind them , top european officials warned that more bad news was likely .
on wednesday , a german regional public bank bank posted a massive 2007 net loss . european and us investors were unfazed after the tuesday announcement from two of europe 's largest banks - swiss bank ubs and germany 's deutsche bank - of enormous first quarter losses .
there was a sense that things could n't get much worse and that the bad news could actually set the beleaguered banking industry down the road to recovery . but the celebrations might prove premature .
german banks are estimated to have about 200 billion euros -lrb- $ 312 billion -rrb- in bad credit on their books , according to a study by ernst & young released wednesday . world-wide , us loan defaults that sparked the crisis could cause losses in the financial industry of up to $ 600 billion , according to spiegel magazine , citing an internal study by german financial supervisory body bafin .
the 16-page paper was a worse-case scenario which bafin stressed might not happen . thus far , financial institutions have publicly admitted to losses of $ 295 billion .
german banks were believed to be exposed to about 10 percent of the total , according to the federal regulator .
calls for transparency bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : weber warned that the crisis of confidence is n't over european central bank -lrb- ecb -rrb- governor axel weber also warned that more bad news is sure to come . " the crisis of confidence is not over yet .
as long as the price decline in the us property market continues , further turbulences have to be expected , " weber said in an interview with the german newspaper bild , which appeared wednesday . european union economic and monetary affairs commissioner joachin almunia echoed the ecb concern that further bad news could come . " we do not yet have an overview of the level of losses , banks do not yet inspire trust , " almunia said in an interview with the frankfurter rundshau newspaper . weber reiterated the need for more transparency in the banking sector , calling on banks which have taken great risks to " disclose their losses . " grim outlook for westlb bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : investors have hoped that the worst is over one such disclosure came wednesday .
while no one expected there to be any good news from the troubled german westlb bank , the news was even worse than expected . westlb announced that the global financial turmoil and stock trading losses would leave it 1.6 billion euros -lrb- $ 2.5 billion -rrb- in the red for 2007 .
the bank had previously estimated a loss of 1 billion euros . " westlb has seen one of the most difficult situations in its history , " said bank head alexander stuhlmann . on monday , the german state of north-rhine westphalia promised a 5 billion euro bailout for the regional bank .
the state holds a stake of around 38 percent in westlb and regional state-owned savings banks hold more than 50 percent of the bank 's shares . the bank has also announced plans to cut 1,350 jobs as part of a plan to turn the business around and possibly prepare it for a sale or merger . extent of exposure murky bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the german banking industry has been among the hardest hit in europe the westlb announcement comes one day after two of europe 's biggest banks , both of which had extensive exposure to the us subprime crisis , announced major first quarter losses . deutsche bank said it would write down 2.5 billion euros and swiss bank ubs said it would write down 12 billion euros .
the bad news pushed up both banks ' stock prices , as investors hoped the worst of the crisis might soon be over . since the us market for high-risk mortgages collapsed last year , lending on international credit markets has dried up .
banks have been unable to determine their own exposure to potential losses and therefore have become wary of lending to one another . international financial officials have repeatedly called on banks and other financial institutions to come clean on their losses , which would restore market confidence . for germany , a muted upswing bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : ubs has come clean on expected losses while the us seems to be headed towards a recession , almunia said he believes that the " european economies are better prepared than others against the crisis . " weber , who is also the president of the bundesbank or german central bank , remained confident regarding the german economy 's outlook . " the upswing is continuing , " weber told the bild .
" above all , that refers to the ' up ' , just the ' swing ' dwindles away a bit . " the bundesbank forecasts that the german economy , europe 's biggest , will grow by a little more than 1.5 percent in 2008 . weber said he does continue to have long-term concerns about inflation .
euro zone inflation accelerated to a provisional 3.5 percent year-on-year in march , the highest level since the single currency was launched in 1999 . " it is important for the further upswing that the purchasing power of the people is preserved , " weber said . dw staff -lrb- th -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

the applications from ukraine and georgia have met skepticism within the alliance as well as open opposition from russia . " the time is not ripe " both germany and france , backed by several smaller countries , strongly oppose bush 's membership action plan -lrb- map -rrb- for the two nations , arguing that georgia and ukraine do not meet nato 's criteria and the decision would be an unnecessary provocation to russia before president-elect dmirty medvedev takes office . german chancellor angela merkel said in bucharest that both georgia and ukraine should have a long-term prospect of nato membership , " but there is one difference with the united states : we believe the time for map is not ripe . " earlier , german foreign minister frank-walter steinmeier said in an interview europe should try to avoid further damaging its relationship with russia . it is clear " that we have reached the limit in foreign policy in relations with russia , " steinmeier regional daily leipziger volkszeitung in an interview . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : steinmeier wants better relations with russia steinmeier pointed to russia 's anger over kosovo as a recent example of deteriorating relations .
russia is likewise strongly opposed to georgia and ukraine becomign nato members .
and steinmeier said he could see " no convincing reason ... to create more tension . " steinmeier stressed that germany does not oppose georgia and ukraine joining nato out of deference to russia .
the german government feels the countries need better internal stability and more internal support for nato before beginning a membership process . expansion disagreements nato leaders are meeting in bucharest to discuss the eastwards expansion of the 26-member alliance as well as its involvement in afghanistan and strategies for the future . georgia and ukraine are hoping to be offered a membership action plan -lrb- map -rrb- , a key step to full membership .
russia opposes the bids on grounds that nato is intruding on its sphere of influence . " the membership action plan marks the point of no return , in our opinion , " moscow 's envoy to nato , dmitry rogozin , told interfax news agency .
" if map is granted to georgia and ukraine ... our relations would take a dramatic turn . " us president george w. bush , who is in eastern europe on a week-long visit , is expected to tell his counterparts that the alliance must remain open to all european democracies looking to join , according to excerpts of his speech made available by the white house . afghanistan prominent on agenda military troop numbers in afghanistan are also likely to dominate the two-day meeting in romania .
at a session on thursday , nato allies and other troop contributors will also meet un secretary-general ban ki-moon and afghan president hamid karzai to discuss better coordination of military , civilian , development and humanitarian efforts . earlier this week , bush toned down demands that germany take on a combat role in southern afghanistan , but he is still expected to ask for europeans to increase their troop contingents . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : protesters at the us embassy in moscow do n't want nato to expand east germany currently has around 3,250 troops based in the capital , kabul , and the relatively peaceful north , where they are engaged in provincial reconstruction missions .
german defense minister franz josef jung said tuesday that the number of bundeswehr troops in afghanistan would not surpass the 3,500 limit set by parliament . french president nicholas sarkozy has said his country was considering beefing up its deployment to afghanistan and prime minister francois fillon said paris may send " a few hundred " extra troops to afghanistan .
france currently has about 2,200 troops stationed in afghanistan . the move has , however , led members of the french opposition to threaten a no confidence vote if sarkozy goes through with his plan . next year 's plans german chancellor angela merkel is expected to use the meeting in bucharest to launch an initiative with sarkozy to stage a summit early next year marking the 60th anniversary of nato 's founding . " with this gesture , sarkozy and merkel want to underline the german-franco friendship , european reconciliation " and the importance of the transatlantic alliance , german government spokesman ulrich wilhelm . wilhelm said the summit would be held jointly in the french city of strasbourg and across the river rhine in the german city of kehl . dw staff -lrb- sms / th -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

his views are at odds with the police who say crime has risen . break-ins and thefts have risen considerably in germany 's border regions since the passport-free schengen area added nine new central and eastern european members on dec .
21 , 2007 , klaus jansen , chairmen of the federation of german detectives , told deutschlandfunk public radio on tuesday , april 1 . jansen criticized german interior minister wolfgang schaeuble for not adequately preparing police for the move .
promised reinforcements have n't yet been made available and the interior ministry failed to provide police with appropriate training and mobile tracing equipment , he said . mobile patrols in the border regions replaced stationary border checks after the expansion . minister says no reason to worry bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : poles and germans celebrated on the eve of the schengen expansion schaeuble , however , said on tuesday in the saxon city of zittau that " the concerns of the people in the border regions have not proven true . "
the interior minister had been a major proponent of opening the schengen area late last year , a move that critics said was premature and could lead to increased crime rates in germany . schaeuble 's czech and polish counterparts echoed his sentiments . " the feared scenarios have n't occurred , " said czech interior minister ivan langer .
poland 's state secretary witold drodz called police cooperation between the three countries " exemplary . " since the border posts on the german-polish and german-czech borders were symbolically removed just before christmas last year , 1,128 people have been detained for illegal entry into germany .
713 of these have already been deported back to their home countries . schaeuble said the number of illegal entry attempts was particularly high in december and january , but has sunk dramatically since then . matthias seeger , who heads the federal police district responsible for guarding the border to poland , said the visible presence of the federal police in the 1,300-kilometer -lrb- 800-mile -rrb- border region continued to ensure greater security for the people there . borders dismantled in new schengen countries bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : border controls such as these have been dismantled in new schengen members on sunday , passport controls in airports were lifted in the nine new member countries - estonia , the czech republic , lithuania , hungary , latvia , malta , poland , slovakia and slovenia .
the abolishment of the air borders had been postponed to coincide with the airlines ' bi-yearly flight schedule changes . " it all went very smoothly , " said friso roscam abbing , spokesman for the eu 's justice , freedom and security commission . the schengen area is now made up of 22 eu countries plus norway and iceland .

the consultancy is alleged to have earned large amounts through transactions - up to 22,000 euros for a single doctorate - from lawyers aiming to boost their standing by acquiring a doctorate . the problem of falsely awarded doctorates is said to be widespread in germany , where academic degrees are particularly highly regarded . dw staff / dpa -lrb- als -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de nato -pipe- 02.04.2008 nato 's eastward expansion rift to dominate summit großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : merkel with romanian president basescu and nato secretary-general de hoop scheffer the membership bids of two former soviet republics , georgia and ukraine , backed strongly by us president bush , are set to overshadow a nato summit in romania - much to the displeasure of germany . us president george w bush urged his european allies to set the two former soviet republics , georgia and ukraine , on a path to nato membership , setting the tone for a potentially tense summit of the 26-member alliance which opens on wednesday , april 2 , in romania . the nato meeting will consider full membership for three countries , albania , croatia and macedonia , and plans for potential membership for ukraine and georgia .
the applications from ukraine and georgia have met skepticism within the alliance as well as open opposition from russia . " the time is not ripe " both germany and france , backed by several smaller countries , strongly oppose bush 's membership action plan -lrb- map -rrb- for the two nations , arguing that georgia and ukraine do not meet nato 's criteria and the decision would be an unnecessary provocation to russia before president-elect dmirty medvedev takes office . german chancellor angela merkel said in bucharest that both georgia and ukraine should have a long-term prospect of nato membership , " but there is one difference with the united states : we believe the time for map is not ripe . " earlier , german foreign minister frank-walter steinmeier said in an interview europe should try to avoid further damaging its relationship with russia . it is clear " that we have reached the limit in foreign policy in relations with russia , " steinmeier regional daily leipziger volkszeitung in an interview . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : steinmeier wants better relations with russia steinmeier pointed to russia 's anger over kosovo as a recent example of deteriorating relations .
russia is likewise strongly opposed to georgia and ukraine becomign nato members .
and steinmeier said he could see " no convincing reason ... to create more tension . " steinmeier stressed that germany does not oppose georgia and ukraine joining nato out of deference to russia .
the german government feels the countries need better internal stability and more internal support for nato before beginning a membership process . expansion disagreements nato leaders are meeting in bucharest to discuss the eastwards expansion of the 26-member alliance as well as its involvement in afghanistan and strategies for the future . georgia and ukraine are hoping to be offered a membership action plan -lrb- map -rrb- , a key step to full membership .
russia opposes the bids on grounds that nato is intruding on its sphere of influence . " the membership action plan marks the point of no return , in our opinion , " moscow 's envoy to nato , dmitry rogozin , told interfax news agency .
" if map is granted to georgia and ukraine ... our relations would take a dramatic turn . " us president george w. bush , who is in eastern europe on a week-long visit , is expected to tell his counterparts that the alliance must remain open to all european democracies looking to join , according to excerpts of his speech made available by the white house . afghanistan prominent on agenda military troop numbers in afghanistan are also likely to dominate the two-day meeting in romania .
at a session on thursday , nato allies and other troop contributors will also meet un secretary-general ban ki-moon and afghan president hamid karzai to discuss better coordination of military , civilian , development and humanitarian efforts . earlier this week , bush toned down demands that germany take on a combat role in southern afghanistan , but he is still expected to ask for europeans to increase their troop contingents . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : protesters at the us embassy in moscow do n't want nato to expand east germany currently has around 3,250 troops based in the capital , kabul , and the relatively peaceful north , where they are engaged in provincial reconstruction missions .
german defense minister franz josef jung said tuesday that the number of bundeswehr troops in afghanistan would not surpass the 3,500 limit set by parliament . french president nicholas sarkozy has said his country was considering beefing up its deployment to afghanistan and prime minister francois fillon said paris may send " a few hundred " extra troops to afghanistan .
france currently has about 2,200 troops stationed in afghanistan . the move has , however , led members of the french opposition to threaten a no confidence vote if sarkozy goes through with his plan . next year 's plans german chancellor angela merkel is expected to use the meeting in bucharest to launch an initiative with sarkozy to stage a summit early next year marking the 60th anniversary of nato 's founding . " with this gesture , sarkozy and merkel want to underline the german-franco friendship , european reconciliation " and the importance of the transatlantic alliance , german government spokesman ulrich wilhelm . wilhelm said the summit would be held jointly in the french city of strasbourg and across the river rhine in the german city of kehl . dw staff -lrb- sms / th -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

" the higher emissions resulting from the phase-out of nuclear energy -lsb- and the resulting reliance on other forms of energy -rsb- must be considered by the european union in the total budget of emissions trading , " said glos , according to the handelsblatt . glos also pointed to sweden as a forerunner in the effort to gain allowances .
he said sweden was able to achieve such special treatment from the eu at the end of the 1990s - setting a precedent , said glos , from which germany could now benefit . during negotiations about how to share the burden of meeting emissions cuts among eu countries in trying to fulfill the requirements of the kyoto protocol , sweden at the time pointed to its efforts to phase out the use of nuclear energy .
the country was then permitted to raise its co2 emissions output by four percent from 1990 to 2012 . long-term emissions cuts bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : germany has agreed to significantly curtail its emissions germany is required to reduce its emissions by 21 percent during that same period , while eu countries as a whole have aimed to reduce emissions by eight percent . currently , the european commission is hammering out a plan to implement the resolutions regarding energy and climate change which were agreed on at an eu summit in march 2007 . in the plan , the eu wants to define what its contribution should be in the next international agreement for protecting the environment , which is to replace the kyoto protocol when its requirements expire at the end of 2012 .
the eu aims to reduce co2 emissions by 20 percent by 2020 , compared to 1990 levels . according to the handelsblatt , the german environment ministry has not yet responded to glos ' request , but told the paper that higher emissions in the sectors involved in emissions trading " would have to be balanced out by additional emissions reduction in other areas , such as the private household or transportation sectors , if germany is to achieve the climate protection targets laid out in eu agreements .

the injection treats age-related macular degeneration -lrb- amd -rrb- , the leading cause of sight loss in the uk .
some primary care trusts in england and wales only made treatment available to patients who had already lost their sight in one eye .
the drug , which is already available in scotland , will be part funded by the manufacturer novartis .
the national institute for clinical excellence -lrb- nice -rrb- is publishing its final appraisal document , to ensure that all trusts fund the drug .
the disease destroys the central region of the retina - the macula - leading to gradual loss of sight .
with this decision , it means that patients are no longer put in a situation where they have to choose between their sight and their life savings barbara mclaughlan rnib it comes in two forms - wet and dry - with the dry form being much more common .
however , the wet type is more aggressive and is responsible for about 90 % of blindness caused by the condition .
if there are no appeals , nice 's final guidance will be published in june and the nhs is then expected to implement its recommendation for using lucentis , which is also called ranibizumab .
some 19,000 of the 26,000 people diagnosed with wet amd every year live in england and wales .

barbara mclaughlan , of the royal national institute for the blind , has been campaigning on behalf of patients .

" with this decision , it means that patients are no longer put in a situation where they have to choose between their sight and their life savings . "
a spokeswoman for the department of health said : " the dose capping scheme put forward by novartis , and which nice has endorsed , means the nhs will be reimbursed for the cost of lucentis if a patient requires more than 14 doses per eye .

according to amnesty international , china is clamping down on dissent in a bid to portray a stable and harmonious image ahead of the games in august .
it urged the international olympic committee -lrb- ioc -rrb- and world leaders to speak out against abuses , including china 's handling of protests in tibet .
us president george w bush is facing calls to boycott the games ' opening .
" it would be clearly inappropriate for you to attend the olympic games in china , given the increasingly repressive nature of that country 's government , " a group of 15 us politicians wrote in a letter to mr bush on tuesday .
mr bush has said he plans to attend the ceremony but germany 's angela merkel says she will not .
french president nicolas sarkozy has not ruled out a boycott .
an ioc team is currently in beijing to assess its readiness for the games .
' beyond reach ' in a report entitled china : the olympics countdown , the london-based group said the olympics had failed to act as a catalyst for reform in china . "
it is increasingly clear that much of the current wave of repression is occurring not in spite of the olympics but actually because of the olympics " amnesty international report send us your comments " unless the chinese authorities take steps to redress the situation urgently , a positive human rights legacy for the beijing olympics looks increasingly beyond reach , " it said .
" it is increasingly clear that much of the current wave of repression is occurring not in spite of the olympics but actually because of the olympics . "
activists and dissidents had been targeted as part of an apparent pre-olympics clean-up , it said , with many under some form of detention .
journalists , both domestic and foreign , were still prevented from reporting freely .
the group also called on world leaders to speak out on the situation in tibet , calling a failure to address the issue " tacit endorsement " of human rights abuses .
it accused chinese troops of using lethal force on tibetan protesters and urged china to release information about those who had been detained , saying it feared for their safety .
' prejudice ' on tuesday , ahead of the publication of the report , china hit out at amnesty and said any attempt to pressure beijing over the olympics would fail .
" the organisation holds prejudice against china , so you can imagine what kind of report it will release , " foreign ministry spokeswoman jiang yu said .
public security ministry spokesman wu heping also said that tibetan " independence forces " were planning to launch suicide attacks as part of a wider uprising - a move he blamed on the dalai lama .
china says 18 civilians and two police officers died in the unrest in tibetan and neighbouring provinces inhabited by tibetans that began on 10 march .
tibetan groups outside china put the death toll at up to 140 , a figure that includes tibetans they say were killed by chinese security forces .
all claims about the unrest are difficult to verify because the chinese government has mostly barred foreign journalists from these sensitive areas .

until today .
the house of lords select committee on economic affairs is not the highest profile body at westminster .
but it has dominated headlines by producing an in-depth analysis of what it calls " one of the biggest public policy issues in the uk " .
with a membership including two former chancellors , a former governor of the bank of england and some eminent economists , its conclusions can not be ignored .
economic benefit something approaching conventional wisdom has suggested that immigration brings net benefits to the economy .
various pieces of research have tended to back up this thinking , but the lords committee robustly takes issue with that .
ministers have argued that the recent wave of immigration has added £ 6bn per year to british economic output .
the peers say that this is an " irrelevant and misleading measure " .
they argue that the total size of the economy is not the issue .
a larger population will inevitably lead to a larger gdp , they point out .
they say that what counts is annual income per head -lrb- gdp per capita -rrb- and specifically the per capita income of the resident population -lrb- i.e. excluding immigrants -rrb- .
on this basis , immigration has had very little impact on economic wellbeing .
who benefits ?
the peers also point out that the costs and benefits of immigration are unevenly spread .
the report argues that there has been a " small negative impact on the lowest paid workers in the uk " - wages in this sector have been depressed because of migrant workers competing for jobs .
the committee acknowledges that some higher income earners have benefited , the logic being that they have been freer to develop their skills and boost their earning potential .
opportunities for younger workers to learn skills may be impaired by immigration according to the report .
this is because some employers may be more inclined to employ migrant workers with existing skills .
cost to the taxpayer on public finances the committee takes issue with the idea that immigration has been a net benefit because of tax contributions from workers .
it says there is no evidence that migrant workers will help defuse the " pensions time bomb " .
it also suggests there are greater pressures on public services such as health and education .
but after knocking down some well-rehearsed economic arguments on the pros of immigration , the committee does acknowledge there are winners apart from the incoming workers themselves .
political debate shoppers , for example , have benefited from lower prices .
taxpayers will not complain about wages in public services being held down .
the report notes the enthusiasm amongst employers for migrant workers .
but it says the argument that immigrants are prepared to do jobs that locals wo n't do is " fundamentally flawed " .
it implies that if given the opportunity british workers could take up the slack .
leading employers groups such as the cbi and the chambers of commerce have rejected many of the committee 's findings .
and the prime minister still believes in the benefits of economic migrants .
but it is harder for them take issue with the economic credentials or political complexion of this group of peers .
so the debate about the costs and benefits of immigration is likely to intensify as a key political battleground over the next few years .

the house of lords select committee on economic affairs is not the highest profile body at westminster .
but it has dominated headlines by producing an in-depth analysis of what it calls " one of the biggest public policy issues in the uk " .
with a membership including two former chancellors , a former governor of the bank of england and some eminent economists , its conclusions can not be ignored .
economic benefit something approaching conventional wisdom has suggested that immigration brings net benefits to the economy .
various pieces of research have tended to back up this thinking , but the lords committee robustly takes issue with that .
ministers have argued that the recent wave of immigration has added £ 6bn per year to british economic output .
the peers say that this is an " irrelevant and misleading measure " .
they argue that the total size of the economy is not the issue .
a larger population will inevitably lead to a larger gdp , they point out .
they say that what counts is annual income per head -lrb- gdp per capita -rrb- and specifically the per capita income of the resident population -lrb- i.e. excluding immigrants -rrb- .
on this basis , immigration has had very little impact on economic wellbeing .
who benefits ?
the peers also point out that the costs and benefits of immigration are unevenly spread .
the report argues that there has been a " small negative impact on the lowest paid workers in the uk " - wages in this sector have been depressed because of migrant workers competing for jobs .
the committee acknowledges that some higher income earners have benefited , the logic being that they have been freer to develop their skills and boost their earning potential .
opportunities for younger workers to learn skills may be impaired by immigration according to the report .
this is because some employers may be more inclined to employ migrant workers with existing skills .
cost to the taxpayer on public finances the committee takes issue with the idea that immigration has been a net benefit because of tax contributions from workers .
it says there is no evidence that migrant workers will help defuse the " pensions time bomb " .
it also suggests there are greater pressures on public services such as health and education .
but after knocking down some well-rehearsed economic arguments on the pros of immigration , the committee does acknowledge there are winners apart from the incoming workers themselves .
political debate shoppers , for example , have benefited from lower prices .
taxpayers will not complain about wages in public services being held down .
the report notes the enthusiasm amongst employers for migrant workers .
but it says the argument that immigrants are prepared to do jobs that locals wo n't do is " fundamentally flawed " .

the home office has been working with social networking firms and is expected to publish a set of guidelines for the sites around best practice , security and privacy on friday .
the report is expected to recommend that profiles created by children are set to private by default , or are only viewable by friends nominated by the user .
it also suggests that social sites maintain a distinct contact page listing contact numbers , such as 999 , children can use to get help .
the three leading social networks , myspace , bebo and facebook , all say they remove profiles of users that are found to be too young on their sites .
but at present no technology is used to actively verify the age of users .
the home office guidelines are set to encourage social networking sites to investigate age verification technologies and to give better signposting to users about privacy settings , and warnings about the implications of posting personal details .
have your say one solution to this problem would be for schools to set up sites of their own that could be grouped by age laura , london send us your comments a spokesman for myspace said the firm " proactively ensures that profiles of 14 and 15-year-olds are automatically made private so that users are protected from adults they do n't already know in the offline world " .
the company said in the future all of its users under 18 would have profiles set automatically to private .
risk perception more than a fifth of people in the uk aged 16 and over have an online profile , the ofcom survey showed .
but the report revealed a " significant difference " between the perception of the risks and use of social networks between parents and children .
" while people are aware of the status of their profile there is a general lack of awareness of the issues attached to them around privacy and safety , " said mr thickett .
from the dot.life blog the government has little or no power to make the social networks change rory cellan-jones , bbc technology correspondent read rory 's thoughts in full he added : " people put aside concerns about privacy and safety believing they have been taken care of by someone else . "
forty-one per cent of children had set their profile so that it was visible to anyone , according to the report .
but 16 % of parents admitted they did not know if their child 's profile could be seen or not by strangers .
" there is an issue about parenting , " said robin blake , head of media literacy at ofcom .
new friends he added : " parents who are allowing their children to go online without supervision and support ... need to recognise that their children are potentially at risk . "
according to the ofcom report , almost 60 % of children use social networking sites to make new friends , compared to 17 % of adults who use the sites for the same purpose .

" children are using these sites with a far lower awareness of some of the issues and rules that these sites entail , " said mr thickett .
ofcom called on social networks to improve the visibility of privacy settings .
monitor guidelines " the settings are not obvious to some people when using these sites , " said mr blake .
he said ofcom would be " monitoring and reviewing " the guidelines that social networks had drawn up in conjunction with the home office .
advice for parents if your child is 14 or under , check whether you feel the site is appropriate set rules check your child 's profile source : ofcom however , ofcom admitted it had no legal authority over social networks and was not " regulating them " .
mr blake said : " ofcom 's approach is very much to encourage industry to do the right thing . "
dr rachel o 'connell , chief safety officer at bebo , told bbc news : " we 're working with the regulatory bodies .
it 's critical to our business that we adhere to these guidelines . "

the contest in abu dhabi is one of the richest and biggest events of its kind , with more than $ 9m -lrb- £ 4.5m ; 5.8m euros -rrb- and 100 cars in prizes up for grabs .
the contest will feature camels or " ships of the desert " from bahrain , kuwait , oman , qatar and saudi arabia .
organisers hope it will remind emiratis of traditional desert values .
the contest is part of the mazayin dhafra festival , which starts on wednesday , and organisers say it is the biggest contest of its kind to be staged in the gulf .
a panel of expert camel appreciators will choose the best animals for each age group .
entry is open to anyone who can prove ownership of a pedigree camel , and the animals must be free from contagious diseases , and without any serious defects .
the ruler of abu dhabi , sheikh khalifa bin zayed , has sponsored the event .
it is said he wants emiratis to help preserve their national identity through the respect of an animal central to arab culture .
the first camel beauty contest in the uae took place six years ago .
camel racing is a popular sport , with money from the region 's oil riches often placed in huge bets .
long before the oil industry moved in , the bedou tribes prized the animal known as the " ship of the desert " .

bbc news -pipe- europe -pipe- putin in nato summit spotlight bbc news / europe graphics version bbc sport home news front page -pipe- africa -pipe- americas -pipe- asia-pacific -pipe- europe -pipe- middle east -pipe- south asia -pipe- uk -pipe- business -pipe- health -pipe- science & environment -pipe- technology -pipe- entertainment -pipe- also in the news -pipe- have your say -pipe- 07:52 gmt , wednesday , 2 april 2008 08:52 uk putin in nato summit spotlight by richard galpin bbc news , moscow the nato summit that begins on wednesday in the romanian capital bucharest is already being billed as the biggest in the alliance 's 59-year history .
but it will also have an unusual and important guest of honour : russian president vladimir putin .
the soviet union and nato were , of course , enemies during the cold war , so it is still a significant moment when the russian head of state agrees to turn up .
mr putin has only been to one previous summit and that was when the nato-russia council was established in rome in 2002 .
since then relations have been steadily deteriorating .
but now , in his final few weeks as russian president , mr putin may be seeking to soften his image as a confrontational leader on the world stage , as the man who stoked concerns that a deep chill was once again descending on relations between east and west .
that is probably why the kremlin is talking up the likelihood of a symbolically important agreement which it expects to be signed during the talks between mr putin and nato leaders on friday .
afghanistan initiative according to kremlin spokesman dmitry peskov , russia will allow the shipment of non-military supplies across its territory to the nato mission in afghanistan .
it is not a purely magnanimous gesture by moscow .
it is also in russia 's own interest to see afghanistan stabilised and hard-core islamic groups neutralised .
but that anticipated bright spot at the summit may be eclipsed by the major areas of disagreement between russia and nato .
chief among them is nato 's plan to keep expanding into eastern europe , a region which moscow sees as its traditional sphere of influence .
on the agenda at the marble-lined palace in bucharest will be the question of whether ukraine and georgia should be allowed to join nato 's membership action plan , a step which would eventually lead to both countries becoming full members of the military alliance .
the mere suggestion of this is making russia see red .
one russian analyst said it would be " a spit in the face " if nato leaders agreed to it .
mr peskov put it more diplomatically : " the artificial integration of these countries into nato would damage democracy , " he said , " and lead to additional tension . "
he went on to criticise nato as a " child of the cold war " which was still in search of a new identity in the vastly changed world of the 21st century .
eastward expansion privately even some western diplomats in moscow say they are dismayed by the american-led push to get ukraine and georgia into the nato club right now , arguing it sends all the wrong signals to russia during the transition between president putin and his successor , dmitry medvedev .
they also say it will add to russia 's fear of being encircled by nato member states .
ukraine and georgia , which border russia , would be just the latest in a long list of eastern european countries to join nato , including estonia and latvia , which also lie along russia 's long border .
but moscow 's strongly-worded opposition to the plan has succeeded in splitting nato 's 26 member states .
germany is leading the rebellion and has other western european countries , including france , on its side .
the lack of consensus will probably lead to the crucial decision being delayed until the next summit , although president bush , who will also be in bucharest , continues to lobby hard .
mr bush 's first stop on his way to the nato summit was in ukraine , where he said he strongly supported kiev 's bid .
the nato secretary general , jaap de hoop scheffer , has also made it clear that russia would not be allowed to veto the decision of independent states to join the alliance , saying it is only " a question of when " ukraine and georgia will join the membership action plan .
if , as expected , the decision is delayed for at least a year , there is no prospect of a change in russia 's position under dmitry medvedev , who will be sworn in as president next month .
in his first major interview since being elected , mr medvedev told the financial times that allowing ukraine and georgia to join nato could jeopardise european security .
it was a clear sign that on the fundamental foreign policy issues mr medvedev will be following closely the course set by his mentor and predecessor , vladimir putin .

but it will also have an unusual and important guest of honour : russian president vladimir putin .
the soviet union and nato were , of course , enemies during the cold war , so it is still a significant moment when the russian head of state agrees to turn up .
mr putin has only been to one previous summit and that was when the nato-russia council was established in rome in 2002 .
since then relations have been steadily deteriorating .
but now , in his final few weeks as russian president , mr putin may be seeking to soften his image as a confrontational leader on the world stage , as the man who stoked concerns that a deep chill was once again descending on relations between east and west .
that is probably why the kremlin is talking up the likelihood of a symbolically important agreement which it expects to be signed during the talks between mr putin and nato leaders on friday .
afghanistan initiative according to kremlin spokesman dmitry peskov , russia will allow the shipment of non-military supplies across its territory to the nato mission in afghanistan .
president putin strongly opposes the bids of georgia and ukraine it is not a purely magnanimous gesture by moscow .
it is also in russia 's own interest to see afghanistan stabilised and hard-core islamic groups neutralised .
but that anticipated bright spot at the summit may be eclipsed by the major areas of disagreement between russia and nato .
chief among them is nato 's plan to keep expanding into eastern europe , a region which moscow sees as its traditional sphere of influence .
on the agenda at the marble-lined palace in bucharest will be the question of whether ukraine and georgia should be allowed to join nato 's membership action plan , a step which would eventually lead to both countries becoming full members of the military alliance .
the mere suggestion of this is making russia see red .
one russian analyst said it would be " a spit in the face " if nato leaders agreed to it .
mr peskov put it more diplomatically : " the artificial integration of these countries into nato would damage democracy , " he said , " and lead to additional tension . "
he went on to criticise nato as a " child of the cold war " which was still in search of a new identity in the vastly changed world of the 21st century .
eastward expansion privately even some western diplomats in moscow say they are dismayed by the american-led push to get ukraine and georgia into the nato club right now , arguing it sends all the wrong signals to russia during the transition between president putin and his successor , dmitry medvedev .
president bush said russia would not be able to veto new members they also say it will add to russia 's fear of being encircled by nato member states .
ukraine and georgia , which border russia , would be just the latest in a long list of eastern european countries to join nato , including estonia and latvia , which also lie along russia 's long border .
but moscow 's strongly-worded opposition to the plan has succeeded in splitting nato 's 26 member states .
germany is leading the rebellion and has other western european countries , including france , on its side .
the lack of consensus will probably lead to the crucial decision being delayed until the next summit , although president bush , who will also be in bucharest , continues to lobby hard .

on the agenda at the marble-lined palace in bucharest will be the question of whether ukraine and georgia should be allowed to join nato 's membership action plan , a step which would eventually lead to both countries becoming full members of the military alliance .
the mere suggestion of this is making russia see red .
one russian analyst said it would be " a spit in the face " if nato leaders agreed to it .
mr peskov put it more diplomatically : " the artificial integration of these countries into nato would damage democracy , " he said , " and lead to additional tension . "
he went on to criticise nato as a " child of the cold war " which was still in search of a new identity in the vastly changed world of the 21st century .
eastward expansion privately even some western diplomats in moscow say they are dismayed by the american-led push to get ukraine and georgia into the nato club right now , arguing it sends all the wrong signals to russia during the transition between president putin and his successor , dmitry medvedev .
president bush said russia would not be able to veto new members they also say it will add to russia 's fear of being encircled by nato member states .
ukraine and georgia , which border russia , would be just the latest in a long list of eastern european countries to join nato , including estonia and latvia , which also lie along russia 's long border .
but moscow 's strongly-worded opposition to the plan has succeeded in splitting nato 's 26 member states .
germany is leading the rebellion and has other western european countries , including france , on its side .
the lack of consensus will probably lead to the crucial decision being delayed until the next summit , although president bush , who will also be in bucharest , continues to lobby hard .
mr bush 's first stop on his way to the nato summit was in ukraine , where he said he strongly supported kiev 's bid .
the nato secretary general , jaap de hoop scheffer , has also made it clear that russia would not be allowed to veto the decision of independent states to join the alliance , saying it is only " a question of when " ukraine and georgia will join the membership action plan .
if , as expected , the decision is delayed for at least a year , there is no prospect of a change in russia 's position under dmitry medvedev , who will be sworn in as president next month .
in his first major interview since being elected , mr medvedev told the financial times that allowing ukraine and georgia to join nato could jeopardise european security .
it was a clear sign that on the fundamental foreign policy issues mr medvedev will be following closely the course set by his mentor and predecessor , vladimir putin .

but it will also have an unusual and important guest of honour : russian president vladimir putin .
the soviet union and nato were , of course , enemies during the cold war , so it is still a significant moment when the russian head of state agrees to turn up .
mr putin has only been to one previous summit and that was when the nato-russia council was established in rome in 2002 .
since then relations have been steadily deteriorating .
but now , in his final few weeks as russian president , mr putin may be seeking to soften his image as a confrontational leader on the world stage , as the man who stoked concerns that a deep chill was once again descending on relations between east and west .
that is probably why the kremlin is talking up the likelihood of a symbolically important agreement which it expects to be signed during the talks between mr putin and nato leaders on friday .
afghanistan initiative according to kremlin spokesman dmitry peskov , russia will allow the shipment of non-military supplies across its territory to the nato mission in afghanistan .
president putin strongly opposes the bids of georgia and ukraine it is not a purely magnanimous gesture by moscow .
it is also in russia 's own interest to see afghanistan stabilised and hard-core islamic groups neutralised .
but that anticipated bright spot at the summit may be eclipsed by the major areas of disagreement between russia and nato .
chief among them is nato 's plan to keep expanding into eastern europe , a region which moscow sees as its traditional sphere of influence .

a general and pilot in the army before he entered politics , he insists on flying military aircraft himself when on official trips .
it is an issue that caused much controversy during his 10-year tenure as deputy president of arguably africa 's most successful country .
the official opposition has bitterly complained , as by law only serving officers should fly military planes .
you have let me succeed my father as king seretse khama ian khama quoting from the bible at his inauguration but mr khama , the son of botswana 's renowned first leader seretse khama , has stuck to his guns and still take the controls .
during his inauguration on tuesday , ian khama made a biblical allusion to his dynastic roots .
" that night , the lord appeared to him in a dream and asked him , ' what would you like me to give you ? " ' he said , quoting from 1 kings .
" solomon answered : ' oh lord god , you have let me succeed my father as king , even though i am very young and do n't know how to rule .
so give me the wisdom i need to rule your people with justice , and to know the difference between good and evil . " '
thousands of people , dressed in the national colours of black , blue and white , attended the short ceremony where festus mogae stepped down after serving two five-year terms .
some have criticised the fact that ian khama is inheriting his father 's mantle , without an election - as parliament appoints the president .
but mps recently rejected a call for the president to be elected directly by the people , so ian khama will lead the ruling party into elections next year .
and the crowds joked about how the smooth transition of power bucked recent african history and was in marked contrast to the current dramas in neighbouring zimbabwe .
bucking tradition by virtue of his birth , ian khama is a paramount chief of the bamangwato people , the largest ethnic group in botswana .
wildlife is ian khama 's passion however , although made a chief in 1979 , he has never assumed the responsibilities of traditional leadership in his village .
he has bucked tradition too , by not marrying , something culturally expected of paramount chiefs .
mr khama was born in 1953 in the uk , where his father , had married an english woman , ruth williams .
their romance scandalised both nations and seretse khama was deposed as bangwato chief and exiled by the british .
but the family returned in 1956 , 10 years before botswana gained independence .
fitness fanatic ian khama attended school in his father 's village of serowe , in the central district , before proceeding to study in other countries including zimbabwe , then rhodesia , swaziland , switzerland and the uk where he graduated from the sandhurst military academy .
after completing his studies he began a long and distinguished military career which saw him rise through the ranks .
he is credited with playing a pivotal role in developing the army into a professional force , which participates in peacekeeping missions , disaster relief and anti-poaching activities .
wildlife , for which botswana is renowned as well as diamonds , is his unrelenting passion , and he is also a fitness fanatic .
otherwise , he is said to be a quiet person .
even those close to him in the ruling party have complained that it is difficult to know what he is thinking and what his next move would be .
however , he says he will continue the policies of his predecessor - a man he described as a democrat who upheld the rule of law .

the official opposition has bitterly complained , as by law only serving officers should fly military planes .
you have let me succeed my father as king seretse khama ian khama quoting from the bible at his inauguration but mr khama , the son of botswana 's renowned first leader seretse khama , has stuck to his guns and still take the controls .
during his inauguration on tuesday , ian khama made a biblical allusion to his dynastic roots .
" that night , the lord appeared to him in a dream and asked him , ' what would you like me to give you ? " ' he said , quoting from 1 kings .
" solomon answered : ' oh lord god , you have let me succeed my father as king , even though i am very young and do n't know how to rule .
so give me the wisdom i need to rule your people with justice , and to know the difference between good and evil . " '
thousands of people , dressed in the national colours of black , blue and white , attended the short ceremony where festus mogae stepped down after serving two five-year terms .
some have criticised the fact that ian khama is inheriting his father 's mantle , without an election - as parliament appoints the president .
but mps recently rejected a call for the president to be elected directly by the people , so ian khama will lead the ruling party into elections next year .
and the crowds joked about how the smooth transition of power bucked recent african history and was in marked contrast to the current dramas in neighbouring zimbabwe .
bucking tradition by virtue of his birth , ian khama is a paramount chief of the bamangwato people , the largest ethnic group in botswana .
wildlife is ian khama 's passion however , although made a chief in 1979 , he has never assumed the responsibilities of traditional leadership in his village .
he has bucked tradition too , by not marrying , something culturally expected of paramount chiefs .
mr khama was born in 1953 in the uk , where his father , had married an english woman , ruth williams .
their romance scandalised both nations and seretse khama was deposed as bangwato chief and exiled by the british .
but the family returned in 1956 , 10 years before botswana gained independence .
fitness fanatic ian khama attended school in his father 's village of serowe , in the central district , before proceeding to study in other countries including zimbabwe , then rhodesia , swaziland , switzerland and the uk where he graduated from the sandhurst military academy .
after completing his studies he began a long and distinguished military career which saw him rise through the ranks .
he is credited with playing a pivotal role in developing the army into a professional force , which participates in peacekeeping missions , disaster relief and anti-poaching activities .
wildlife , for which botswana is renowned as well as diamonds , is his unrelenting passion , and he is also a fitness fanatic .
otherwise , he is said to be a quiet person .
even those close to him in the ruling party have complained that it is difficult to know what he is thinking and what his next move would be .
however , he says he will continue the policies of his predecessor - a man he described as a democrat who upheld the rule of law .

the show , aired live on radio 2 , saw the band play three tracks from the album alongside several songs from their most recent album in rainbows .
it was the second gig the band played on tuesday , after a matinee show which relied on more recent tracks .
the concerts were ahead of a uk tour taking place in the summer .
earlier this year the band were supposed to play the rough trade store in london 's east end .
the gig was pulled at the last minute , with the oxford quintet decamping to the neighbouring 93 feet east - a similarly intimate venue , and the kind of gig they had not played in years .
only 312 people could attend tuesday 's show at the bbc radio theatre in central london - a mere fraction of the numbers expected at the band 's forthcoming summer tour .
special show but after so long headlining festivals and arenas , they did not show any nerves about being so close to their fans at this special show .
radiohead were not fazed by the intimate show after a tongue-in-cheek introduction from radio 2 dj mark radcliffe , radiohead trooped on stage to resounding cheers , looking lean and happy .
many of the songs on in rainbows - direct , taut , punchy - sounded ready-made for their live sets when the record emerged last year .
fittingly , it was with a ragged version of bodysnatchers off their newest album that radiohead kicked things off .
thom yorke , ed o 'brien and jonny greenwood presented a three-guitar line up , lighting up bodysnatchers with flashes of stuttering guitar , aided by a tight , metronomic rhythm from bassist colin greenwood and drummer phil selway .
the band looked like they were having fun .
o 'brien beamed massively as he wrung his guitar , while colin greenwood bounded along to the song 's rhythm .
radiohead 's po-faced reputation evaporated almost instantly .
things took a darker turn with the follow-up all i need , with its brooding keyboards .
yorke leaned against the piano , as if the song 's oppressive mood was overwhelming even him .
nude - a sparse , icily-cold ballad - is a track radiohead spent more than a decade trying to get right .
originally written during sessions for 1997 's ok computer , it only made it onto record on in rainbows .
tonight , as the set 's third song , it was sublime .
yorke 's keening , imploring vocal was made all the more heart-rending given the intimacy .
" do n't get any big ideas / they 're not going to happen , " he sang .
you could hear a pin drop .
from there , the band cast a quick look back .
the warped , howling guitar of ok computer 's airbag filled the theatre , the first of three tracks from their landmark album .
it rivalled nude as the night 's standout song .
melodic grace singer thom yorke helped defy the band 's po-faced reputation some radiohead fans have complained the band 's post-ok computer albums lack its melodic grace .
as if to keep that element of their fanbase happy , the band played the album 's downbeat closer the tourist as well as lucky , with o 'brien playing the song 's chilling guitar line to roars and whoops from the crowd .
jonny greenwood spent much of the night flitting from guitar to mellotron to keyboards , while o 'brien added beautiful backing vocals to yorke 's voice .
a few false starts could not derail everything in its right place , the opener to 2000 's electronica-tinged kid a. yorke , on keyboards , eventually counted the band in .
the sparse , keyboard-heavy track on record was transformed into something much darker and insistent , with selway 's disco beat interspersed with snatches of yorke 's voice sampled and played back .
a heady , confused brew , it would have been a fitting end .
however , yorke had other ideas .
returning to the stage with jonny greenwood , the pair added a folk-tinged version of in rainbows ' faust arp to bring the night to a close .

special show but after so long headlining festivals and arenas , they did not show any nerves about being so close to their fans at this special show .
radiohead were not fazed by the intimate show after a tongue-in-cheek introduction from radio 2 dj mark radcliffe , radiohead trooped on stage to resounding cheers , looking lean and happy .
many of the songs on in rainbows - direct , taut , punchy - sounded ready-made for their live sets when the record emerged last year .
fittingly , it was with a ragged version of bodysnatchers off their newest album that radiohead kicked things off .
thom yorke , ed o 'brien and jonny greenwood presented a three-guitar line up , lighting up bodysnatchers with flashes of stuttering guitar , aided by a tight , metronomic rhythm from bassist colin greenwood and drummer phil selway .
the band looked like they were having fun .
o 'brien beamed massively as he wrung his guitar , while colin greenwood bounded along to the song 's rhythm .
radiohead 's po-faced reputation evaporated almost instantly .
things took a darker turn with the follow-up all i need , with its brooding keyboards .
yorke leaned against the piano , as if the song 's oppressive mood was overwhelming even him .
nude - a sparse , icily-cold ballad - is a track radiohead spent more than a decade trying to get right .
originally written during sessions for 1997 's ok computer , it only made it onto record on in rainbows .
tonight , as the set 's third song , it was sublime .
yorke 's keening , imploring vocal was made all the more heart-rending given the intimacy .
" do n't get any big ideas / they 're not going to happen , " he sang .
you could hear a pin drop .
from there , the band cast a quick look back .
the warped , howling guitar of ok computer 's airbag filled the theatre , the first of three tracks from their landmark album .
it rivalled nude as the night 's standout song .
melodic grace singer thom yorke helped defy the band 's po-faced reputation some radiohead fans have complained the band 's post-ok computer albums lack its melodic grace .
as if to keep that element of their fanbase happy , the band played the album 's downbeat closer the tourist as well as lucky , with o 'brien playing the song 's chilling guitar line to roars and whoops from the crowd .
jonny greenwood spent much of the night flitting from guitar to mellotron to keyboards , while o 'brien added beautiful backing vocals to yorke 's voice .
a few false starts could not derail everything in its right place , the opener to 2000 's electronica-tinged kid a. yorke , on keyboards , eventually counted the band in .
the sparse , keyboard-heavy track on record was transformed into something much darker and insistent , with selway 's disco beat interspersed with snatches of yorke 's voice sampled and played back .
a heady , confused brew , it would have been a fitting end .
however , yorke had other ideas .
returning to the stage with jonny greenwood , the pair added a folk-tinged version of in rainbows ' faust arp to bring the night to a close .

the peer , who was blocked from being un envoy to afghanistan by president hamid karzai , says it will take more than extra troops to quell the fighting .
he spoke as gordon brown flies to romania for nato 's biggest summit .
" i 'm not saying for a moment that we have lost ...
i 'm saying that we 're getting pretty close to it , " he said .
during the bucharest summit , mr brown and us president george bush are set to call for more of the 26 nato members to send combat troops and provide additional support in the battle against the taleban .
international strategy needed lord ashdown , who stepped down as lib dem leader in 1999 , said alongside more troops , afghanistan needs a stable government .
" while more troops are definitely necessary , they are not sufficient , " he told bbc radio 4 's today programme . "
if we do n't create the government , the taleban simply come back ... you have to do both of them together " lord ashdown " what we really need here , alongside more troops and more people prepared to carry the burden , is a clear international strategy which is unified and which has a political aim .
" you can defeat the enemy militarily on the battlefield , but what you have to do is win the political battle .
" and if you do n't do the second of those , there 's not much point doing the first . "
lord ashdown said he did not believe it was possible to defeat the taleban " unless you can also create a stable government in kabul and an effective state in afghanistan " .
" and we are a long way from achieving that , " he said .
main aims " if we do n't create the government , the taleban simply come back ... you have to do both of them together . "
he added : " i 'm not saying for a moment that we have lost in afghanistan , i am , however , saying that we are getting pretty close to it and unless we begin to turn this thing round with a political strategy that can be supported by the military action , more troops that we are calling for in bucharest may help in the short term , but wo n't help us in the long . "
lord ashdown said he had listed three aims for the job of un special envoy to afghanistan , before norwegian diplomat kai eide was selected to carry it out .
these included establishing security for the nation , not just militarily , but on the home front , with a secure water supply and secure government on the ground .
he also believed it was necessary to establish the rule of law and increase the capacity to govern afghanistan by building governmental institutions .
he said if these three aims were adopted , the soldiers in afghanistan " become part of the plan " rather than having the problem dumped on them with all the sacrifices and risks that entails .

lord ashdown said he had listed three aims for the job of un special envoy to afghanistan , before norwegian diplomat kai eide was selected to carry it out .
these included establishing security for the nation , not just militarily , but on the home front , with a secure water supply and secure government on the ground .
he also believed it was necessary to establish the rule of law and increase the capacity to govern afghanistan by building governmental institutions .
he said if these three aims were adopted , the soldiers in afghanistan " become part of the plan " rather than having the problem dumped on them with all the sacrifices and risks that entails .

the former theatre , which has been empty for months , was undergoing urgent repairs on friday when a large part of the roof collapsed .
derby city council said it was applying for an injunction to stop it being knocked down completely .
this was prompted , the authority said , by the owner 's solicitor claiming it was dangerously unsafe .
the council had demanded the owner carry out work on the grade ii listed structure .
further investigations but the parties have disputed whether the exact nature of the repairs had been agreed .
while a mechanical digger was at the green lane site on friday the roof , and subsequently a large part of an external wall , fell in .
in a statement , the council said : " we were told by the hippodrome 's owner 's barrister that they had just received a report from the structural engineer they commissioned to carry out an inspection of the premises .
" the report allegedly says that the hippodrome is an immediate danger to the public and must be demolished without delay .
" as a consequence , the council is taking immediate action to try and obtain a court injunction to prevent any further demolition .
we are trying to get a hearing before a judge . "
officials also said they were investigating the exact circumstances surrounding the collapse .
