" a draw would have been really unfair since we had the best chances and they just wanted to get a draw , " villa said . villa said that " having six points " was " much more important " than he being tournament top scorer . liverpool striker fernando torres had spain an early lead , only for zlatan ibrahimovic to equalize for sweden before half-time .

sweden have three points and will need to beat russia in their final game to be sure of a place in the quarter-finals . spain went ahead with their first real attack in the 15th minute .
xavi hernandez played a short corner for david villa , who laid the ball back for david silva .
silva 's center was volleyed in by the stretching torres , from just beyond the penalty spot . torres ' goal obliged sweden to react , and they did so manfully - to the delight of the noisy swedish fans in innsbruck .
two minutes later johan elmander wasted a good chance to equalize down the right .
thought they had a draw in the 24th minute carles puyol limped off with a pulled muscle in his right thigh .
the spanish defense was crippled , and sweden took advantage to make it 1-1 in the 34th minute . luis aragones ' defense made a mess of an elmander center from the right .
ibrahimovic held off sergio ramos and scored with a soft low shot , when iker casillas could only push into the net . sweden manager lars lagerback surprisingly pulled off ibrahimovic at the start of the second half , and spain took control with their slick passing game .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de intercultural dialogue -pipe- 14.06.2008 muslim kindergarten opens amid controversy großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the new kindergarten has to stick to the rules earlier this year , the opening of a kindergarten in an immigrant district of berlin was blocked on account of the founder ’ s alleged ties to a radical muslim group .
once he was replaced , the center got the green light . in february , an application for a muslim kindergarten landed on the desk of the education authority in the central berlin district of wedding , where almost 35 percent of the population has an immigrant background .
permission was refused on the grounds that sinan w. , the head of the " morgenland " -lrb- orient -rrb- association behind the project , was believed to have ties to the radical muslim group hizb-ut-tahrir , banned in germany since 2003 .
in 2004 he allegedly published texts on the internet containing incitement to hatred .
although sinan w. admitted links , he was also reported to have distanced himself from the group , saying that after studying islamic sources , he " realized that it tried to draw young people under its spell with emotional subjects and then exploited them for sinister ends . "
authorities stipulate certain conditions bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : wedding is home to a high percentage of immigrants on april 6 , the morgenland association elected another chairman , michael w. , a relative of sinan w. , and resubmitted its application .
this time , it was given the go-ahead .
" there was no reason to deny permission , " said bernhard kempf.from the education authority .
" all the formal criteria were met , including in terms of educational concept . "
this included the promotion of inter-religious dialogue , gender equality , and the learning of german .
the kindergarten subsequently opened in may with 45 children in its care , including turks , bosnians , arabs and lithuanians .
however , the authorities have laid down certain conditions .
any staff changes must be registered with the authorities , while the youth welfare office is allowed to inspect the kindergarten whenever it wishes without giving notice .
" we will be doing this , " said city councillor rainer maria fritsch in the daily tagesspiegel .
" if parents or staff report unusual activity at odds with the constitution , we can withdraw permission at any time . "
fulfilling a need " they can come whenever they like , " said sinan w. 's wife in the same newspaper , adding that the kindergarten had been her idea .
" we have nothing to hide , " she went on .
" i used to work at another kindergarten in the same district , and muslim mothers would often ask why there was no muslim childcare facility in the neighborhood .
they want their children to grow up with traditions , such as observing ramadan . "
now they can .
the new kindergarten observes muslim holidays and only serves halal food .
otherwise , little sets it apart from other kindergartens in the capital .
some have expressed skepticism others have their doubts , and believe that sinan w. 's resignation as chairman of morgenland was merely tactical .
" the abrupt change to the leadership of morgenland was a transparent maneuver geared to securing permission , " said christian democrat spokesperson frank henkel in welt online , adding that sinan w. most probably still pulls the strings .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the al-nur mosque meanwhile , local radio station info-radio reported that the kindergarten staff were recruited via an advert posted on the website of the al-nur mosque in the south of berlin , widely believed to be a meeting place for radicals .
further adverts appeared on muslim web sites , which , according to the federal office for the protection of the constitution , " directly and indirectly spread anti-zionist and anti-israeli propaganda . "
" we will be making sure that democratic standards are maintained , " insisted berhard kempf .
" if we allow them a place within our education system we can keep an eye on them .
it 's preferable to having extremists working undercover . " dw staff -lrb- jp -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

the blues still have to secure a win after two games . the dutch team made a strong showing from the start with dirk kuyt and substitute robin van persie putting holland 2-0 up after an hour .
thierry henry managed to pull one back for france -lrb- 71st minute -rrb- , but another substitute , arjen robben , scored 30 seconds later and wesley sneijder completed the win in injury time with a superb strike .
world cup runners-up france will face world cup winners italy , who also have one point from two matches , in their final group c match on tuesday .
but both sides , who have put on rather less glorious performances in this championship , will be out if romania beat the netherlands on the same day .
dutch surprise themselves bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : netherlands ' dirk kuyt kicked off the series " we 're still trying to get our heads around this , " the netherlands ' former manchester united striker ruud van nistelrooy said .
" we could n't have expected this , we did n't have the best of form in the qualifying or coming in , but now it seems it is all falling into place .
now i think the confidence is there and it 's lifting the team , " he added .
the dutch , unchanged from the side that hammered italy 3-0 in their opening match , began superbly and kuyt put them in front in the ninth minute , beating florent malouda to head home from a corner . kuyt almost made it 2-0 with a chance soon after , but france came back into the match and sydney govou , preferred to nicolas anelka , had a couple of chances , only to be denied by goalkeeper edwin van der sar .
france came out firing after half-time and henry , who was restored to the starting line-up after injury , lobbed a volley just over the bar .
fine piece of coaching bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : van persie quickly showed the wisdom of the dutch coach 's decision but it was dutch coach marco van basten 's substitutions that proved decisive .
he replaced holding midfielder orlando engelaar at half-time for the speed and attacking thrust of robben , and after 10 minutes striker robin van persie came on for kuyt .
" it gave us greater possibilities to go deeper and give us more space to attack again .
these players are quick and technically good and so we were more dangerous in the second half even though france were creating more pressure , " van basten said . " i have to compliment the defense because there was a lot of pressure and in the end we made some good goals with some good counter-attacks which has made us all very happy . "
the second dutch goal was brilliantly executed , with van nistelrooy near the halfway line cleverly feeding the ball through to substitute robben , who sped down the wing and crossed for van persie to volley home off the hand of gregory coupet .
france continued to press , though , and with 19 minutes to go , willy sagnol broke down the right , fed the ball low into the box and henry scored with a neat left-foot finish .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : thierry henry was fighting a losing battle despite pulling one back for france but france were then undone by a moment of brilliance from robben , who , having broken down the left again but with seemingly nowhere to go , fired a shot high past coupet to make it 3-1 .
robben and van nistelrooy both went close to increasing their lead late on , while patrice evra fired a shot wide for france and franck ribery lifted a free kick just over .
sneijder then completed the victory with a brilliant turn and shot from outside the area to send the dutch fans wild .
it was another outstanding display by the real madrid midfielder , who picked up the man-of-the-match award as he did against italy .
dutch wo n't put their feet up bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : it was n't just the dutch squad that put on a colorful performance the result leaves the netherlands able to take it easy in the last game against romania , but van basten dismissed any idea of allowing romania to win to eliminate two tough rivals in france and italy .
van basten said he had not considered whether he would be playing reserves for the romania game .
" we will start thinking about that game tomorrow but we will prepare for it seriously , " he said .
meanwhile france coach raymond domenech put a brave face on the defeat , knowing his side 's fate is no longer in his hands .

bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : thierry henry was fighting a losing battle despite pulling one back for france but france were then undone by a moment of brilliance from robben , who , having broken down the left again but with seemingly nowhere to go , fired a shot high past coupet to make it 3-1 .
robben and van nistelrooy both went close to increasing their lead late on , while patrice evra fired a shot wide for france and franck ribery lifted a free kick just over .
sneijder then completed the victory with a brilliant turn and shot from outside the area to send the dutch fans wild .
it was another outstanding display by the real madrid midfielder , who picked up the man-of-the-match award as he did against italy .
dutch wo n't put their feet up bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : it was n't just the dutch squad that put on a colorful performance the result leaves the netherlands able to take it easy in the last game against romania , but van basten dismissed any idea of allowing romania to win to eliminate two tough rivals in france and italy .
van basten said he had not considered whether he would be playing reserves for the romania game .
" we will start thinking about that game tomorrow but we will prepare for it seriously , " he said .
meanwhile france coach raymond domenech put a brave face on the defeat , knowing his side 's fate is no longer in his hands .

the blues still have to secure a win after two games . the dutch team made a strong showing from the start with dirk kuyt and substitute robin van persie putting holland 2-0 up after an hour .
thierry henry managed to pull one back for france -lrb- 71st minute -rrb- , but another substitute , arjen robben , scored 30 seconds later and wesley sneijder completed the win in injury time with a superb strike .
world cup runners-up france will face world cup winners italy , who also have one point from two matches , in their final group c match on tuesday .
but both sides , who have put on rather less glorious performances in this championship , will be out if romania beat the netherlands on the same day .
dutch surprise themselves bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : netherlands ' dirk kuyt kicked off the series " we 're still trying to get our heads around this , " the netherlands ' former manchester united striker ruud van nistelrooy said .
" we could n't have expected this , we did n't have the best of form in the qualifying or coming in , but now it seems it is all falling into place .
now i think the confidence is there and it 's lifting the team , " he added .
the dutch , unchanged from the side that hammered italy 3-0 in their opening match , began superbly and kuyt put them in front in the ninth minute , beating florent malouda to head home from a corner . kuyt almost made it 2-0 with a chance soon after , but france came back into the match and sydney govou , preferred to nicolas anelka , had a couple of chances , only to be denied by goalkeeper edwin van der sar .
france came out firing after half-time and henry , who was restored to the starting line-up after injury , lobbed a volley just over the bar .
fine piece of coaching bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : van persie quickly showed the wisdom of the dutch coach 's decision but it was dutch coach marco van basten 's substitutions that proved decisive .
he replaced holding midfielder orlando engelaar at half-time for the speed and attacking thrust of robben , and after 10 minutes striker robin van persie came on for kuyt .
" it gave us greater possibilities to go deeper and give us more space to attack again .
these players are quick and technically good and so we were more dangerous in the second half even though france were creating more pressure , " van basten said . " i have to compliment the defense because there was a lot of pressure and in the end we made some good goals with some good counter-attacks which has made us all very happy . "
the second dutch goal was brilliantly executed , with van nistelrooy near the halfway line cleverly feeding the ball through to substitute robben , who sped down the wing and crossed for van persie to volley home off the hand of gregory coupet .
france continued to press , though , and with 19 minutes to go , willy sagnol broke down the right , fed the ball low into the box and henry scored with a neat left-foot finish .

dw-world.de answers some of the most pertinent questions . what is the treaty of lisbon ?
after the failure of its forerunner , the european constitution , which was rejected in 2005 by voters in france and the netherlands , the treaty of lisbon , also called the european reform treaty , was conceived as an alternative series of amendments to two existing eu treaties , the treaty on the european union -lrb- maastricht -rrb- and the treaty establishing the european community -lrb- rome -rrb- . the treaty of lisbon , which was approved by eu leaders at an eu summit in the portuguese capital in december 2007 , is a blueprint for running the 27-member european union more efficiently .
it must be ratified by each of the bloc 's members .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : european leaders agreed on the lisbon treaty in december 2007 what would the treaty of lisbon do ?
the document is meant to change the eu in the following ways : § it creates the role of european president this is one of the most controversial proposals as the idea was initially opposed by smaller eu nations but was forced through by the larger member states .
the president would serve a two-and-a-half-year term , replacing the current system of a rotating six-month presidency , and will not be allowed to serve more than two terms . § it creates the role of an eu high representative for foreign affairs and security policy essentially the eu 's foreign minister , this role combines the posts of current foreign affairs chief javier solana and external affairs commissioner benita ferrero-waldner and will be the bloc 's point person for world affairs . § it reduces the size of the eu 's executive body , the european commission the eu commission would be reduced so that there will be fewer commissioners than member states by 2014 , with only two-thirds of countries supplying a commissioner on a rotational basis .
currently each member state has a commissioner . § it redistributes voting weights among member states the treaty intends to introduce majority voting , which will allow votes to be carried on a 55-percent majority as long as that majority also represent 65 percent of the european population .
this would be phased in between 2014 and 2017 . § it gives new powers to the european commission , european parliament and european court of justice , in areas such as justice and domestic affairs § it removes members ' rights to veto legislation in a number of areas have all eu members ratified the treaty ?
not yet .
every country except ireland left ratification of the treaty to their parliaments .
the irish rejected it in a first referendum in 2008 , but voted " yes " the second time around , in early october 2009 .
poland and the czech republic are the final holdouts . poland 's president lech kaczynski is expected to sign the treaty soon , thus completing polish ratification . # b # in prague , both the lower and upper houses of parliament have already approved the treaty , but czech president vaclav klaus , one of europe 's most vocal opponent 's of the legislation , has yet to sign it .
a group of senators has moved to challenge the treaty in the constitutional court . ncy / sh editor : nancy isenson send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?
dw-world.de france sees irish no-vote as wake-up call french president nicolas sarkozy has called ireland 's " no " to the eu 's lisbon treaty a call to change the way europe was being constructed .
but he has also urged other states to continue the ratification process .
-lrb- 14.06.2008 -rrb- european parliament ratifies lisbon treaty despite protests the european parliament on wednesday voted overwhelmingly in favor of the lisbon treaty , which reforms the european union 's institutions .
there were , however , some protests from euroskeptics demanding referenda .
-lrb- 20.02.2008 -rrb- leaders commit to eu 's future by signing the lisbon treaty after a long and painstaking road , the eu has a new roadmap into the future .
but while the lisbon treaty hints at a future of cooperation , one absent leader reminded all that old habits die hard .

after the failure of its forerunner , the european constitution , which was rejected in 2005 by voters in france and the netherlands , the treaty of lisbon , also called the european reform treaty , was conceived as an alternative series of amendments to two existing eu treaties , the treaty on the european union -lrb- maastricht -rrb- and the treaty establishing the european community -lrb- rome -rrb- . the treaty of lisbon , which was approved by eu leaders at an eu summit in the portuguese capital in december 2007 , is a blueprint for running the 27-member european union more efficiently .
it must be ratified by each of the bloc 's members .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : european leaders agreed on the lisbon treaty in december 2007 what would the treaty of lisbon do ?
the document is meant to change the eu in the following ways : § it creates the role of european president this is one of the most controversial proposals as the idea was initially opposed by smaller eu nations but was forced through by the larger member states .
the president would serve a two-and-a-half-year term , replacing the current system of a rotating six-month presidency , and will not be allowed to serve more than two terms . § it creates the role of an eu high representative for foreign affairs and security policy essentially the eu 's foreign minister , this role combines the posts of current foreign affairs chief javier solana and external affairs commissioner benita ferrero-waldner and will be the bloc 's point person for world affairs . § it reduces the size of the eu 's executive body , the european commission the eu commission would be reduced so that there will be fewer commissioners than member states by 2014 , with only two-thirds of countries supplying a commissioner on a rotational basis .
currently each member state has a commissioner . § it redistributes voting weights among member states the treaty intends to introduce majority voting , which will allow votes to be carried on a 55-percent majority as long as that majority also represent 65 percent of the european population .
this would be phased in between 2014 and 2017 . § it gives new powers to the european commission , european parliament and european court of justice , in areas such as justice and domestic affairs § it removes members ' rights to veto legislation in a number of areas have all eu members ratified the treaty ?
not yet .
every country except ireland left ratification of the treaty to their parliaments .
the irish rejected it in a first referendum in 2008 , but voted " yes " the second time around , in early october 2009 .
poland and the czech republic are the final holdouts . poland 's president lech kaczynski is expected to sign the treaty soon , thus completing polish ratification . # b # in prague , both the lower and upper houses of parliament have already approved the treaty , but czech president vaclav klaus , one of europe 's most vocal opponent 's of the legislation , has yet to sign it .
a group of senators has moved to challenge the treaty in the constitutional court . ncy / sh editor : nancy isenson send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?
dw-world.de france sees irish no-vote as wake-up call french president nicolas sarkozy has called ireland 's " no " to the eu 's lisbon treaty a call to change the way europe was being constructed .
but he has also urged other states to continue the ratification process .
-lrb- 14.06.2008 -rrb- european parliament ratifies lisbon treaty despite protests the european parliament on wednesday voted overwhelmingly in favor of the lisbon treaty , which reforms the european union 's institutions .
there were , however , some protests from euroskeptics demanding referenda .
-lrb- 20.02.2008 -rrb- leaders commit to eu 's future by signing the lisbon treaty after a long and painstaking road , the eu has a new roadmap into the future .
but while the lisbon treaty hints at a future of cooperation , one absent leader reminded all that old habits die hard .

once he was replaced , the center got the green light . in february , an application for a muslim kindergarten landed on the desk of the education authority in the central berlin district of wedding , where almost 35 percent of the population has an immigrant background .
permission was refused on the grounds that sinan w. , the head of the " morgenland " -lrb- orient -rrb- association behind the project , was believed to have ties to the radical muslim group hizb-ut-tahrir , banned in germany since 2003 .
in 2004 he allegedly published texts on the internet containing incitement to hatred .
although sinan w. admitted links , he was also reported to have distanced himself from the group , saying that after studying islamic sources , he " realized that it tried to draw young people under its spell with emotional subjects and then exploited them for sinister ends . "
authorities stipulate certain conditions bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : wedding is home to a high percentage of immigrants on april 6 , the morgenland association elected another chairman , michael w. , a relative of sinan w. , and resubmitted its application .
this time , it was given the go-ahead .
" there was no reason to deny permission , " said bernhard kempf.from the education authority .
" all the formal criteria were met , including in terms of educational concept . "
this included the promotion of inter-religious dialogue , gender equality , and the learning of german .
the kindergarten subsequently opened in may with 45 children in its care , including turks , bosnians , arabs and lithuanians .
however , the authorities have laid down certain conditions .
any staff changes must be registered with the authorities , while the youth welfare office is allowed to inspect the kindergarten whenever it wishes without giving notice .
" we will be doing this , " said city councillor rainer maria fritsch in the daily tagesspiegel .
" if parents or staff report unusual activity at odds with the constitution , we can withdraw permission at any time . "
fulfilling a need " they can come whenever they like , " said sinan w. 's wife in the same newspaper , adding that the kindergarten had been her idea .
" we have nothing to hide , " she went on .
" i used to work at another kindergarten in the same district , and muslim mothers would often ask why there was no muslim childcare facility in the neighborhood .
they want their children to grow up with traditions , such as observing ramadan . "
now they can .
the new kindergarten observes muslim holidays and only serves halal food .
otherwise , little sets it apart from other kindergartens in the capital .
some have expressed skepticism others have their doubts , and believe that sinan w. 's resignation as chairman of morgenland was merely tactical .
" the abrupt change to the leadership of morgenland was a transparent maneuver geared to securing permission , " said christian democrat spokesperson frank henkel in welt online , adding that sinan w. most probably still pulls the strings .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the al-nur mosque meanwhile , local radio station info-radio reported that the kindergarten staff were recruited via an advert posted on the website of the al-nur mosque in the south of berlin , widely believed to be a meeting place for radicals .
further adverts appeared on muslim web sites , which , according to the federal office for the protection of the constitution , " directly and indirectly spread anti-zionist and anti-israeli propaganda . "
" we will be making sure that democratic standards are maintained , " insisted berhard kempf .
" if we allow them a place within our education system we can keep an eye on them .
it 's preferable to having extremists working undercover . " dw staff -lrb- jp -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

but he has also urged other states to continue the ratification process .
" many europeans do not understand how we are constructing europe .
we must therefore change the way we do it , " sarkozy told journalists in paris after meeting us president george w bush .
the irish rejection of the treaty was " an appeal to do more , to do it better , " he said .
non , mais oui bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : nicolas sarkozy made his comments after meeting the us president but sarkozy , whose country is taking over the rotating presidency in july , stressed that no one had the right to sabotage the european project .
one of the treaty 's aims is to streamline decision-making processes in the enlarged and more unwieldy 27-member bloc .
he also admitted saturday , june 14 , that the no-vote would " not simplify the task of the french -lrb- eu -rrb- presidency . "
and sarkozy reiterated his call to other countries to continue ratifying the treaty in order to stop the " irish incident becoming a crisis . "
sarkozy and german chancellor angela merkel had already issued a joint statement on friday to this end .
meanwhile , the irish state minister responsible for integration , conor lenihan , said it was unlikely that the country would stage another referendum on the european union reform treaty in the wake of its rejection by voters this week .
on the morning news show of the national broadcaster rte , lenihan said he could not rule out the possibility of a new vote , but he then cautioned there was a risk of even more damage being done if the treaty is put up for a second vote .
if at first you do n't succeed bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : irish prime minister has not ruled out a second vote lenihan warned that ireland is now " extremely isolated " in europe as the only eu member to has rejected the treaty .
his comments came as irish politicians - both those who favored and opposed the treaty - took stock of the referendum result in which the treaty was rejected by a margin of 110,000 votes .
declan ganley , president of the libertas group that led the " no " campaign , said he was horrified that the possibility of another referendum was even being raised .
on friday evening , irish prime minister brian cowen said the government accepted and respected the verdict of voters , but he declined to rule out the possibility of another vote .
cowen will be meeting his colleagues at the eu summit in brussels next week as european leaders ponder what to do next in the wake of the irish voters ' rejection of the treaty .
adapting the eu the lisbon treaty is designed to replace the failed treaty of nice , which ireland only approved in 2002 after it was put to the people for a second time following a no-vote a year earlier .
the nice treaty was subsequently torpedoed by france and the netherlands . like the rejected constitution , the lisbon treaty proposes a european foreign policy supremo and a permanent president to replace the six-month rotation system .
aimed at preventing decision-making gridlock in the expanding organization , the charter cuts the size of the european parliament and the number of eu decisions which require unanimous support , thus reducing national vetoes .
it also includes a european charter of fundamental human and legal rights , which britain and poland have refused to make binding .

besides books , the publishing trade 's top annual event will provide a forum for political discussion on a country undergoing rapid change . turkey promised this week to showcase its cultural diversity at the annual frankfurt book fair in october , where its literature will have guest-of-honor status this year .
speaking from frankfurt , organizers said 350 authors and translators from turkey will be at the world 's principal book fair , presenting their work to publishers from around the globe .
ethnic minorities will be included , said muge gursoy sokmen , co-chair of the organizing committee .
she added that kurdish authors lal lales and seyhmus diken , armenian writers migirdic margosyan and jaklin celik , and jewish writer mario levi would be making appearances in person .
at the october 15-19 fair a special exhibition on turkish literature will also highlight the little-known " layers " that are woven in with turkic origins in the country 's culture today .
showcasing turkey 's cultural diversity " you 'll see how it includes arab or armenian or byzantine roots too , " she said .
" we have to treat the heritage of our cultural diversity with respect , " said sokmen , who is a leftist istanbul publisher .
" we see this as a very rich resource . "
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : pamuk has often been the subject of controversy the cultural ferment in turkey , in which intellectuals argue about whether and how political islam can be reconciled with modernity , is not just a literary topic , but has also become politicized , with secular turkish judges now mulling a ban on the country 's ruling akp party , which has islamic roots .
germany is home to the largest turkish community outside of turkey .

besides books , the publishing trade 's top annual event will provide a forum for political discussion on a country undergoing rapid change . turkey promised this week to showcase its cultural diversity at the annual frankfurt book fair in october , where its literature will have guest-of-honor status this year .
speaking from frankfurt , organizers said 350 authors and translators from turkey will be at the world 's principal book fair , presenting their work to publishers from around the globe .
ethnic minorities will be included , said muge gursoy sokmen , co-chair of the organizing committee .
she added that kurdish authors lal lales and seyhmus diken , armenian writers migirdic margosyan and jaklin celik , and jewish writer mario levi would be making appearances in person .
at the october 15-19 fair a special exhibition on turkish literature will also highlight the little-known " layers " that are woven in with turkic origins in the country 's culture today .
showcasing turkey 's cultural diversity " you 'll see how it includes arab or armenian or byzantine roots too , " she said .
" we have to treat the heritage of our cultural diversity with respect , " said sokmen , who is a leftist istanbul publisher .
" we see this as a very rich resource . "
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : pamuk has often been the subject of controversy the cultural ferment in turkey , in which intellectuals argue about whether and how political islam can be reconciled with modernity , is not just a literary topic , but has also become politicized , with secular turkish judges now mulling a ban on the country 's ruling akp party , which has islamic roots .
germany is home to the largest turkish community outside of turkey .
" guest workers , " who have migrated since the 1960s , and their descendents make up the country 's largest ethnic minority .
" at least 2.5 million people here are of turkish origin and there is a rich german turkish literature .
that 's one reason turkey feels very close to us , as if it were a next-door neighbor , " said juergen boos , the book fair chief executive .
nobel-prize winner pamuk to open fair orhan pamuk , the nobel literature prize winner in 2006 , will open the fair with turkish president abdullah gul . the best-selling author was the subject of international controversy when he was charged with making statements that violated an article in turkey 's penal code for " insulting turkishness , " though he was never prosecuted .
in addition to authors , hundreds of performers and artists will round out the offerings at the frankfurt fair .
ahmet ari , the coordinator of the turkish presentation , said the fair would focus not only on the riches of turkish literature awaiting translation into other languages , but also provide a forum for discussing politically controversial topics in a nation going through rapid change .
restrictions on minorities eased bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the turkish-kurdish minority has long been culturally repressed he said that turkey had greatly improved its democratic record in recent years , and there was no longer a single author in jail on account of his political views .
turkish state television had also started its first non-turkish-language broadcasts only a few days ago , he added .
ari was referring to turkey 's decades-old policy of repressing minority languages and cultures .
prime minister recep tayyip erdogan 's center-right akp party has eased many restrictions , with an eye to the eventual possibility of joining the european union .
turkey has 1,724 publishing houses with annual sales of $ 810 million -lrb- 516 million euros -rrb- .
the frankfurt book fair is a springboard in book publishing that helps boost exports and the translation of works into foreign languages .

but feminists feel this was a mere political tactic to keep french women from voting en masse for his female opponent , socialist candidate segolene royal .
feminists feel sarkozy 's given the women 's rights issue very little attention since taking office just over a year ago .
one vocal sarkozy critic is emmanuelle piet , a doctor who has been involved in promoting the campaign against domestic violence for the past quarter century .
piet currently serves as president of an aid organization for battered women .
" sarkozy has already been in office for a year and he has caused problems from the beginning on , " she said .
" when he formed his government , he did not establish any ministry to deal with issues of women 's rights or equality . ”
sarkozy accused of lack of interest bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : sarkozy did n't want to lose women 's votes to royal in 1981 , francois mitterrand launched a ministry for women 's rights , which put france at the forefront in europe on the issue .
since then , each government has included women 's rights and equality as part of its portfolio , or at least assigned a secretary of state to the issue .
when sarkozy took the helm in may 2007 , he added female politicians to his team , but not nearly as many as he promised during the elections .
yet his government is proud that top posts have been filled by women including that of finance minister christine lagarde , interior minister michele alliot-marie and justice minister rachida dati .
for piet , having women as ministers does n't make up for the lack of a women 's ministry .
she also has been worried by reports that the state office for women 's rights might be closed .
the office ensures that women have access to abortions and deals with other privacy issues .
" in short , one notices a big disinterest in respect to the government 's involvement in women 's rights , ” she said .
little help for trafficking victims bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : sarkozy has been accused of insensitivity to victims of human trafficking this opinion is backed up by francoise laurant , president of the family planning organization mfpf .
during the run-up to the elections , the group requested meetings with all of the major mainstream candidates .
sarkozy was the only one who did not reply , said laurant .
“ that was the first alarm signal for us , ” she said .
yet there were signals that sarkozy would take a more conservative line on issues such as prostitution .
as interior minister , he helped usher through a series of laws in 2003 which went after prostitutes who engaged in so-called “ passive solicitation . ”
while the term 's meaning is not completely clear , it has amounted to a declaration of war on foreign prostitutes .
the majority of these women are victims of illegal human trafficking networks .
in order to be eligible for help from the french government , they have to be willing to turn in their tormenters , people often involved in criminal networks .
if they are unwilling to do so , they face deportation .
this practice of deporting prostitutes has been strongly criticized by the united nations organization which is trying to put an end to human trafficking .
feminists decry " victimization " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : sarkozy has seemed distracted by his love life the president has been active in providing more state help to victims of domestic violence .
while sarkozy has taken on this issue as one that is close to his heart , laurant from the mfpf remains skeptical .

sarkozy accused of lack of interest bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : sarkozy did n't want to lose women 's votes to royal in 1981 , francois mitterrand launched a ministry for women 's rights , which put france at the forefront in europe on the issue .
since then , each government has included women 's rights and equality as part of its portfolio , or at least assigned a secretary of state to the issue .
when sarkozy took the helm in may 2007 , he added female politicians to his team , but not nearly as many as he promised during the elections .
yet his government is proud that top posts have been filled by women including that of finance minister christine lagarde , interior minister michele alliot-marie and justice minister rachida dati .
for piet , having women as ministers does n't make up for the lack of a women 's ministry .
she also has been worried by reports that the state office for women 's rights might be closed .
the office ensures that women have access to abortions and deals with other privacy issues .
" in short , one notices a big disinterest in respect to the government 's involvement in women 's rights , ” she said .
little help for trafficking victims bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : sarkozy has been accused of insensitivity to victims of human trafficking this opinion is backed up by francoise laurant , president of the family planning organization mfpf .
during the run-up to the elections , the group requested meetings with all of the major mainstream candidates .
sarkozy was the only one who did not reply , said laurant .
“ that was the first alarm signal for us , ” she said .
yet there were signals that sarkozy would take a more conservative line on issues such as prostitution .
as interior minister , he helped usher through a series of laws in 2003 which went after prostitutes who engaged in so-called “ passive solicitation . ”
while the term 's meaning is not completely clear , it has amounted to a declaration of war on foreign prostitutes .
the majority of these women are victims of illegal human trafficking networks .
in order to be eligible for help from the french government , they have to be willing to turn in their tormenters , people often involved in criminal networks .
if they are unwilling to do so , they face deportation .
this practice of deporting prostitutes has been strongly criticized by the united nations organization which is trying to put an end to human trafficking .
feminists decry " victimization " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : sarkozy has seemed distracted by his love life the president has been active in providing more state help to victims of domestic violence .
while sarkozy has taken on this issue as one that is close to his heart , laurant from the mfpf remains skeptical .
“ in sarkozy 's speeches are always only about victims and that they need to be defended .
for feminists , that makes our blood run cold , ” laurant said . dw staff -lrb- th -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

but he has also urged other states to continue the ratification process .
" many europeans do not understand how we are constructing europe .
we must therefore change the way we do it , " sarkozy told journalists in paris after meeting us president george w bush .
the irish rejection of the treaty was " an appeal to do more , to do it better , " he said .
non , mais oui bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : nicolas sarkozy made his comments after meeting the us president but sarkozy , whose country is taking over the rotating presidency in july , stressed that no one had the right to sabotage the european project .
one of the treaty 's aims is to streamline decision-making processes in the enlarged and more unwieldy 27-member bloc .
he also admitted saturday , june 14 , that the no-vote would " not simplify the task of the french -lrb- eu -rrb- presidency . "
and sarkozy reiterated his call to other countries to continue ratifying the treaty in order to stop the " irish incident becoming a crisis . "
sarkozy and german chancellor angela merkel had already issued a joint statement on friday to this end .
meanwhile , the irish state minister responsible for integration , conor lenihan , said it was unlikely that the country would stage another referendum on the european union reform treaty in the wake of its rejection by voters this week .
on the morning news show of the national broadcaster rte , lenihan said he could not rule out the possibility of a new vote , but he then cautioned there was a risk of even more damage being done if the treaty is put up for a second vote .

his comments came as irish politicians - both those who favored and opposed the treaty - took stock of the referendum result in which the treaty was rejected by a margin of 110,000 votes .
declan ganley , president of the libertas group that led the " no " campaign , said he was horrified that the possibility of another referendum was even being raised .
on friday evening , irish prime minister brian cowen said the government accepted and respected the verdict of voters , but he declined to rule out the possibility of another vote .
cowen will be meeting his colleagues at the eu summit in brussels next week as european leaders ponder what to do next in the wake of the irish voters ' rejection of the treaty .
adapting the eu the lisbon treaty is designed to replace the failed treaty of nice , which ireland only approved in 2002 after it was put to the people for a second time following a no-vote a year earlier .
the nice treaty was subsequently torpedoed by france and the netherlands . like the rejected constitution , the lisbon treaty proposes a european foreign policy supremo and a permanent president to replace the six-month rotation system .
aimed at preventing decision-making gridlock in the expanding organization , the charter cuts the size of the european parliament and the number of eu decisions which require unanimous support , thus reducing national vetoes .
it also includes a european charter of fundamental human and legal rights , which britain and poland have refused to make binding .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de women -pipe- 14.06.2008 french feminists unhappy with sarkozy großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : sarkozy has given women top jobs in his cabinet french president nicolas sarkozy courted female voters during the run-up to the last elections , but since he took office , women ’ s rights has taken a back seat to other issues , feminists say . french president nicolas sarkozy courted female voters during the run-up to the last elections , saying that france should take the lead in pushing for women 's rights .
but feminists feel this was a mere political tactic to keep french women from voting en masse for his female opponent , socialist candidate segolene royal .
feminists feel sarkozy 's given the women 's rights issue very little attention since taking office just over a year ago .
one vocal sarkozy critic is emmanuelle piet , a doctor who has been involved in promoting the campaign against domestic violence for the past quarter century .
piet currently serves as president of an aid organization for battered women .
" sarkozy has already been in office for a year and he has caused problems from the beginning on , " she said .
" when he formed his government , he did not establish any ministry to deal with issues of women 's rights or equality . ”
sarkozy accused of lack of interest bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : sarkozy did n't want to lose women 's votes to royal in 1981 , francois mitterrand launched a ministry for women 's rights , which put france at the forefront in europe on the issue .
since then , each government has included women 's rights and equality as part of its portfolio , or at least assigned a secretary of state to the issue .
when sarkozy took the helm in may 2007 , he added female politicians to his team , but not nearly as many as he promised during the elections .
yet his government is proud that top posts have been filled by women including that of finance minister christine lagarde , interior minister michele alliot-marie and justice minister rachida dati .
for piet , having women as ministers does n't make up for the lack of a women 's ministry .
she also has been worried by reports that the state office for women 's rights might be closed .
the office ensures that women have access to abortions and deals with other privacy issues .
" in short , one notices a big disinterest in respect to the government 's involvement in women 's rights , ” she said .
little help for trafficking victims bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : sarkozy has been accused of insensitivity to victims of human trafficking this opinion is backed up by francoise laurant , president of the family planning organization mfpf .
during the run-up to the elections , the group requested meetings with all of the major mainstream candidates .
sarkozy was the only one who did not reply , said laurant .
“ that was the first alarm signal for us , ” she said .
yet there were signals that sarkozy would take a more conservative line on issues such as prostitution .
as interior minister , he helped usher through a series of laws in 2003 which went after prostitutes who engaged in so-called “ passive solicitation . ”
while the term 's meaning is not completely clear , it has amounted to a declaration of war on foreign prostitutes .
the majority of these women are victims of illegal human trafficking networks .
in order to be eligible for help from the french government , they have to be willing to turn in their tormenters , people often involved in criminal networks .
if they are unwilling to do so , they face deportation .
this practice of deporting prostitutes has been strongly criticized by the united nations organization which is trying to put an end to human trafficking .
feminists decry " victimization " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : sarkozy has seemed distracted by his love life the president has been active in providing more state help to victims of domestic violence .
while sarkozy has taken on this issue as one that is close to his heart , laurant from the mfpf remains skeptical .
“ in sarkozy 's speeches are always only about victims and that they need to be defended .
for feminists , that makes our blood run cold , ” laurant said . dw staff -lrb- th -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

the blues still have to secure a win after two games . the dutch team made a strong showing from the start with dirk kuyt and substitute robin van persie putting holland 2-0 up after an hour .
thierry henry managed to pull one back for france -lrb- 71st minute -rrb- , but another substitute , arjen robben , scored 30 seconds later and wesley sneijder completed the win in injury time with a superb strike .
world cup runners-up france will face world cup winners italy , who also have one point from two matches , in their final group c match on tuesday .
but both sides , who have put on rather less glorious performances in this championship , will be out if romania beat the netherlands on the same day .
dutch surprise themselves bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : netherlands ' dirk kuyt kicked off the series " we 're still trying to get our heads around this , " the netherlands ' former manchester united striker ruud van nistelrooy said .
" we could n't have expected this , we did n't have the best of form in the qualifying or coming in , but now it seems it is all falling into place .
now i think the confidence is there and it 's lifting the team , " he added .
the dutch , unchanged from the side that hammered italy 3-0 in their opening match , began superbly and kuyt put them in front in the ninth minute , beating florent malouda to head home from a corner . kuyt almost made it 2-0 with a chance soon after , but france came back into the match and sydney govou , preferred to nicolas anelka , had a couple of chances , only to be denied by goalkeeper edwin van der sar .
france came out firing after half-time and henry , who was restored to the starting line-up after injury , lobbed a volley just over the bar .
fine piece of coaching bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : van persie quickly showed the wisdom of the dutch coach 's decision but it was dutch coach marco van basten 's substitutions that proved decisive .
he replaced holding midfielder orlando engelaar at half-time for the speed and attacking thrust of robben , and after 10 minutes striker robin van persie came on for kuyt .
" it gave us greater possibilities to go deeper and give us more space to attack again .
these players are quick and technically good and so we were more dangerous in the second half even though france were creating more pressure , " van basten said . " i have to compliment the defense because there was a lot of pressure and in the end we made some good goals with some good counter-attacks which has made us all very happy . "
the second dutch goal was brilliantly executed , with van nistelrooy near the halfway line cleverly feeding the ball through to substitute robben , who sped down the wing and crossed for van persie to volley home off the hand of gregory coupet .
france continued to press , though , and with 19 minutes to go , willy sagnol broke down the right , fed the ball low into the box and henry scored with a neat left-foot finish .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : thierry henry was fighting a losing battle despite pulling one back for france but france were then undone by a moment of brilliance from robben , who , having broken down the left again but with seemingly nowhere to go , fired a shot high past coupet to make it 3-1 .
robben and van nistelrooy both went close to increasing their lead late on , while patrice evra fired a shot wide for france and franck ribery lifted a free kick just over .
sneijder then completed the victory with a brilliant turn and shot from outside the area to send the dutch fans wild .
it was another outstanding display by the real madrid midfielder , who picked up the man-of-the-match award as he did against italy .
dutch wo n't put their feet up bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : it was n't just the dutch squad that put on a colorful performance the result leaves the netherlands able to take it easy in the last game against romania , but van basten dismissed any idea of allowing romania to win to eliminate two tough rivals in france and italy .
van basten said he had not considered whether he would be playing reserves for the romania game .
" we will start thinking about that game tomorrow but we will prepare for it seriously , " he said .

besides books , the publishing trade 's top annual event will provide a forum for political discussion on a country undergoing rapid change . turkey promised this week to showcase its cultural diversity at the annual frankfurt book fair in october , where its literature will have guest-of-honor status this year .
speaking from frankfurt , organizers said 350 authors and translators from turkey will be at the world 's principal book fair , presenting their work to publishers from around the globe .
ethnic minorities will be included , said muge gursoy sokmen , co-chair of the organizing committee .
she added that kurdish authors lal lales and seyhmus diken , armenian writers migirdic margosyan and jaklin celik , and jewish writer mario levi would be making appearances in person .

bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : pamuk has often been the subject of controversy the cultural ferment in turkey , in which intellectuals argue about whether and how political islam can be reconciled with modernity , is not just a literary topic , but has also become politicized , with secular turkish judges now mulling a ban on the country 's ruling akp party , which has islamic roots .
germany is home to the largest turkish community outside of turkey .
" guest workers , " who have migrated since the 1960s , and their descendents make up the country 's largest ethnic minority .
" at least 2.5 million people here are of turkish origin and there is a rich german turkish literature .
that 's one reason turkey feels very close to us , as if it were a next-door neighbor , " said juergen boos , the book fair chief executive .
nobel-prize winner pamuk to open fair orhan pamuk , the nobel literature prize winner in 2006 , will open the fair with turkish president abdullah gul . the best-selling author was the subject of international controversy when he was charged with making statements that violated an article in turkey 's penal code for " insulting turkishness , " though he was never prosecuted .
in addition to authors , hundreds of performers and artists will round out the offerings at the frankfurt fair .
ahmet ari , the coordinator of the turkish presentation , said the fair would focus not only on the riches of turkish literature awaiting translation into other languages , but also provide a forum for discussing politically controversial topics in a nation going through rapid change .
restrictions on minorities eased bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the turkish-kurdish minority has long been culturally repressed he said that turkey had greatly improved its democratic record in recent years , and there was no longer a single author in jail on account of his political views .
turkish state television had also started its first non-turkish-language broadcasts only a few days ago , he added .
ari was referring to turkey 's decades-old policy of repressing minority languages and cultures .
prime minister recep tayyip erdogan 's center-right akp party has eased many restrictions , with an eye to the eventual possibility of joining the european union .
turkey has 1,724 publishing houses with annual sales of $ 810 million -lrb- 516 million euros -rrb- .
the frankfurt book fair is a springboard in book publishing that helps boost exports and the translation of works into foreign languages .

but he has also urged other states to continue the ratification process .
" many europeans do not understand how we are constructing europe .
we must therefore change the way we do it , " sarkozy told journalists in paris after meeting us president george w bush .
the irish rejection of the treaty was " an appeal to do more , to do it better , " he said .
non , mais oui bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : nicolas sarkozy made his comments after meeting the us president but sarkozy , whose country is taking over the rotating presidency in july , stressed that no one had the right to sabotage the european project .
one of the treaty 's aims is to streamline decision-making processes in the enlarged and more unwieldy 27-member bloc .
he also admitted saturday , june 14 , that the no-vote would " not simplify the task of the french -lrb- eu -rrb- presidency . "
and sarkozy reiterated his call to other countries to continue ratifying the treaty in order to stop the " irish incident becoming a crisis . "
sarkozy and german chancellor angela merkel had already issued a joint statement on friday to this end .
meanwhile , the irish state minister responsible for integration , conor lenihan , said it was unlikely that the country would stage another referendum on the european union reform treaty in the wake of its rejection by voters this week .
on the morning news show of the national broadcaster rte , lenihan said he could not rule out the possibility of a new vote , but he then cautioned there was a risk of even more damage being done if the treaty is put up for a second vote .
if at first you do n't succeed bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : irish prime minister has not ruled out a second vote lenihan warned that ireland is now " extremely isolated " in europe as the only eu member to has rejected the treaty .
his comments came as irish politicians - both those who favored and opposed the treaty - took stock of the referendum result in which the treaty was rejected by a margin of 110,000 votes .
declan ganley , president of the libertas group that led the " no " campaign , said he was horrified that the possibility of another referendum was even being raised .
on friday evening , irish prime minister brian cowen said the government accepted and respected the verdict of voters , but he declined to rule out the possibility of another vote .
cowen will be meeting his colleagues at the eu summit in brussels next week as european leaders ponder what to do next in the wake of the irish voters ' rejection of the treaty .
adapting the eu the lisbon treaty is designed to replace the failed treaty of nice , which ireland only approved in 2002 after it was put to the people for a second time following a no-vote a year earlier .
the nice treaty was subsequently torpedoed by france and the netherlands . like the rejected constitution , the lisbon treaty proposes a european foreign policy supremo and a permanent president to replace the six-month rotation system .
aimed at preventing decision-making gridlock in the expanding organization , the charter cuts the size of the european parliament and the number of eu decisions which require unanimous support , thus reducing national vetoes .
it also includes a european charter of fundamental human and legal rights , which britain and poland have refused to make binding .

but he has also urged other states to continue the ratification process .
" many europeans do not understand how we are constructing europe .
we must therefore change the way we do it , " sarkozy told journalists in paris after meeting us president george w bush .
the irish rejection of the treaty was " an appeal to do more , to do it better , " he said .
non , mais oui bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : nicolas sarkozy made his comments after meeting the us president but sarkozy , whose country is taking over the rotating presidency in july , stressed that no one had the right to sabotage the european project .
one of the treaty 's aims is to streamline decision-making processes in the enlarged and more unwieldy 27-member bloc .
he also admitted saturday , june 14 , that the no-vote would " not simplify the task of the french -lrb- eu -rrb- presidency . "
and sarkozy reiterated his call to other countries to continue ratifying the treaty in order to stop the " irish incident becoming a crisis . "
sarkozy and german chancellor angela merkel had already issued a joint statement on friday to this end .
meanwhile , the irish state minister responsible for integration , conor lenihan , said it was unlikely that the country would stage another referendum on the european union reform treaty in the wake of its rejection by voters this week .
on the morning news show of the national broadcaster rte , lenihan said he could not rule out the possibility of a new vote , but he then cautioned there was a risk of even more damage being done if the treaty is put up for a second vote .

his comments came as irish politicians - both those who favored and opposed the treaty - took stock of the referendum result in which the treaty was rejected by a margin of 110,000 votes .
declan ganley , president of the libertas group that led the " no " campaign , said he was horrified that the possibility of another referendum was even being raised .
on friday evening , irish prime minister brian cowen said the government accepted and respected the verdict of voters , but he declined to rule out the possibility of another vote .
cowen will be meeting his colleagues at the eu summit in brussels next week as european leaders ponder what to do next in the wake of the irish voters ' rejection of the treaty .

" a draw would have been really unfair since we had the best chances and they just wanted to get a draw , " villa said . villa said that " having six points " was " much more important " than he being tournament top scorer . liverpool striker fernando torres had spain an early lead , only for zlatan ibrahimovic to equalize for sweden before half-time .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : ibrahimovic , center , scores an equalizer past spain 's iker casillas spain remain top of the group with six points from two games and will go through if greece fail to beat russia later in the evening .
sweden have three points and will need to beat russia in their final game to be sure of a place in the quarter-finals . spain went ahead with their first real attack in the 15th minute .
xavi hernandez played a short corner for david villa , who laid the ball back for david silva .
silva 's center was volleyed in by the stretching torres , from just beyond the penalty spot . torres ' goal obliged sweden to react , and they did so manfully - to the delight of the noisy swedish fans in innsbruck .
two minutes later johan elmander wasted a good chance to equalize down the right .
thought they had a draw in the 24th minute carles puyol limped off with a pulled muscle in his right thigh .
the spanish defense was crippled , and sweden took advantage to make it 1-1 in the 34th minute . luis aragones ' defense made a mess of an elmander center from the right .
ibrahimovic held off sergio ramos and scored with a soft low shot , when iker casillas could only push into the net . sweden manager lars lagerback surprisingly pulled off ibrahimovic at the start of the second half , and spain took control with their slick passing game .

" a draw would have been really unfair since we had the best chances and they just wanted to get a draw , " villa said . villa said that " having six points " was " much more important " than he being tournament top scorer . liverpool striker fernando torres had spain an early lead , only for zlatan ibrahimovic to equalize for sweden before half-time .

xavi hernandez played a short corner for david villa , who laid the ball back for david silva .
silva 's center was volleyed in by the stretching torres , from just beyond the penalty spot . torres ' goal obliged sweden to react , and they did so manfully - to the delight of the noisy swedish fans in innsbruck .
two minutes later johan elmander wasted a good chance to equalize down the right .
thought they had a draw in the 24th minute carles puyol limped off with a pulled muscle in his right thigh .
the spanish defense was crippled , and sweden took advantage to make it 1-1 in the 34th minute . luis aragones ' defense made a mess of an elmander center from the right .
ibrahimovic held off sergio ramos and scored with a soft low shot , when iker casillas could only push into the net . sweden manager lars lagerback surprisingly pulled off ibrahimovic at the start of the second half , and spain took control with their slick passing game .

villa calmly slipped the ball between hansson and olof mellberg - and won the game with a precise low drive . dpa news agency -lrb- ncy -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

" a draw would have been really unfair since we had the best chances and they just wanted to get a draw , " villa said . villa said that " having six points " was " much more important " than he being tournament top scorer . liverpool striker fernando torres had spain an early lead , only for zlatan ibrahimovic to equalize for sweden before half-time .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : ibrahimovic , center , scores an equalizer past spain 's iker casillas spain remain top of the group with six points from two games and will go through if greece fail to beat russia later in the evening .
sweden have three points and will need to beat russia in their final game to be sure of a place in the quarter-finals . spain went ahead with their first real attack in the 15th minute .
xavi hernandez played a short corner for david villa , who laid the ball back for david silva .
silva 's center was volleyed in by the stretching torres , from just beyond the penalty spot . torres ' goal obliged sweden to react , and they did so manfully - to the delight of the noisy swedish fans in innsbruck .
two minutes later johan elmander wasted a good chance to equalize down the right .

ibrahimovic held off sergio ramos and scored with a soft low shot , when iker casillas could only push into the net . sweden manager lars lagerback surprisingly pulled off ibrahimovic at the start of the second half , and spain took control with their slick passing game .

the blues still have to secure a win after two games . the dutch team made a strong showing from the start with dirk kuyt and substitute robin van persie putting holland 2-0 up after an hour .
thierry henry managed to pull one back for france -lrb- 71st minute -rrb- , but another substitute , arjen robben , scored 30 seconds later and wesley sneijder completed the win in injury time with a superb strike .
world cup runners-up france will face world cup winners italy , who also have one point from two matches , in their final group c match on tuesday .
but both sides , who have put on rather less glorious performances in this championship , will be out if romania beat the netherlands on the same day .
dutch surprise themselves bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : netherlands ' dirk kuyt kicked off the series " we 're still trying to get our heads around this , " the netherlands ' former manchester united striker ruud van nistelrooy said .
" we could n't have expected this , we did n't have the best of form in the qualifying or coming in , but now it seems it is all falling into place .
now i think the confidence is there and it 's lifting the team , " he added .
the dutch , unchanged from the side that hammered italy 3-0 in their opening match , began superbly and kuyt put them in front in the ninth minute , beating florent malouda to head home from a corner . kuyt almost made it 2-0 with a chance soon after , but france came back into the match and sydney govou , preferred to nicolas anelka , had a couple of chances , only to be denied by goalkeeper edwin van der sar .
france came out firing after half-time and henry , who was restored to the starting line-up after injury , lobbed a volley just over the bar .
fine piece of coaching bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : van persie quickly showed the wisdom of the dutch coach 's decision but it was dutch coach marco van basten 's substitutions that proved decisive .
he replaced holding midfielder orlando engelaar at half-time for the speed and attacking thrust of robben , and after 10 minutes striker robin van persie came on for kuyt .
" it gave us greater possibilities to go deeper and give us more space to attack again .
these players are quick and technically good and so we were more dangerous in the second half even though france were creating more pressure , " van basten said . " i have to compliment the defense because there was a lot of pressure and in the end we made some good goals with some good counter-attacks which has made us all very happy . "
the second dutch goal was brilliantly executed , with van nistelrooy near the halfway line cleverly feeding the ball through to substitute robben , who sped down the wing and crossed for van persie to volley home off the hand of gregory coupet .
france continued to press , though , and with 19 minutes to go , willy sagnol broke down the right , fed the ball low into the box and henry scored with a neat left-foot finish .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : thierry henry was fighting a losing battle despite pulling one back for france but france were then undone by a moment of brilliance from robben , who , having broken down the left again but with seemingly nowhere to go , fired a shot high past coupet to make it 3-1 .
robben and van nistelrooy both went close to increasing their lead late on , while patrice evra fired a shot wide for france and franck ribery lifted a free kick just over .
sneijder then completed the victory with a brilliant turn and shot from outside the area to send the dutch fans wild .
it was another outstanding display by the real madrid midfielder , who picked up the man-of-the-match award as he did against italy .
dutch wo n't put their feet up bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : it was n't just the dutch squad that put on a colorful performance the result leaves the netherlands able to take it easy in the last game against romania , but van basten dismissed any idea of allowing romania to win to eliminate two tough rivals in france and italy .
van basten said he had not considered whether he would be playing reserves for the romania game .
" we will start thinking about that game tomorrow but we will prepare for it seriously , " he said .
meanwhile france coach raymond domenech put a brave face on the defeat , knowing his side 's fate is no longer in his hands .

thierry henry managed to pull one back for france -lrb- 71st minute -rrb- , but another substitute , arjen robben , scored 30 seconds later and wesley sneijder completed the win in injury time with a superb strike .
world cup runners-up france will face world cup winners italy , who also have one point from two matches , in their final group c match on tuesday .
but both sides , who have put on rather less glorious performances in this championship , will be out if romania beat the netherlands on the same day .
dutch surprise themselves bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : netherlands ' dirk kuyt kicked off the series " we 're still trying to get our heads around this , " the netherlands ' former manchester united striker ruud van nistelrooy said .
" we could n't have expected this , we did n't have the best of form in the qualifying or coming in , but now it seems it is all falling into place .
now i think the confidence is there and it 's lifting the team , " he added .
the dutch , unchanged from the side that hammered italy 3-0 in their opening match , began superbly and kuyt put them in front in the ninth minute , beating florent malouda to head home from a corner . kuyt almost made it 2-0 with a chance soon after , but france came back into the match and sydney govou , preferred to nicolas anelka , had a couple of chances , only to be denied by goalkeeper edwin van der sar .
france came out firing after half-time and henry , who was restored to the starting line-up after injury , lobbed a volley just over the bar .
fine piece of coaching bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : van persie quickly showed the wisdom of the dutch coach 's decision but it was dutch coach marco van basten 's substitutions that proved decisive .
he replaced holding midfielder orlando engelaar at half-time for the speed and attacking thrust of robben , and after 10 minutes striker robin van persie came on for kuyt .
" it gave us greater possibilities to go deeper and give us more space to attack again .
these players are quick and technically good and so we were more dangerous in the second half even though france were creating more pressure , " van basten said . " i have to compliment the defense because there was a lot of pressure and in the end we made some good goals with some good counter-attacks which has made us all very happy . "
the second dutch goal was brilliantly executed , with van nistelrooy near the halfway line cleverly feeding the ball through to substitute robben , who sped down the wing and crossed for van persie to volley home off the hand of gregory coupet .
france continued to press , though , and with 19 minutes to go , willy sagnol broke down the right , fed the ball low into the box and henry scored with a neat left-foot finish .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : thierry henry was fighting a losing battle despite pulling one back for france but france were then undone by a moment of brilliance from robben , who , having broken down the left again but with seemingly nowhere to go , fired a shot high past coupet to make it 3-1 .
robben and van nistelrooy both went close to increasing their lead late on , while patrice evra fired a shot wide for france and franck ribery lifted a free kick just over .
sneijder then completed the victory with a brilliant turn and shot from outside the area to send the dutch fans wild .
it was another outstanding display by the real madrid midfielder , who picked up the man-of-the-match award as he did against italy .
dutch wo n't put their feet up bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : it was n't just the dutch squad that put on a colorful performance the result leaves the netherlands able to take it easy in the last game against romania , but van basten dismissed any idea of allowing romania to win to eliminate two tough rivals in france and italy .
van basten said he had not considered whether he would be playing reserves for the romania game .
" we will start thinking about that game tomorrow but we will prepare for it seriously , " he said .
meanwhile france coach raymond domenech put a brave face on the defeat , knowing his side 's fate is no longer in his hands .

besides books , the publishing trade 's top annual event will provide a forum for political discussion on a country undergoing rapid change . turkey promised this week to showcase its cultural diversity at the annual frankfurt book fair in october , where its literature will have guest-of-honor status this year .
speaking from frankfurt , organizers said 350 authors and translators from turkey will be at the world 's principal book fair , presenting their work to publishers from around the globe .

she added that kurdish authors lal lales and seyhmus diken , armenian writers migirdic margosyan and jaklin celik , and jewish writer mario levi would be making appearances in person .

bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : pamuk has often been the subject of controversy the cultural ferment in turkey , in which intellectuals argue about whether and how political islam can be reconciled with modernity , is not just a literary topic , but has also become politicized , with secular turkish judges now mulling a ban on the country 's ruling akp party , which has islamic roots .
germany is home to the largest turkish community outside of turkey .
" guest workers , " who have migrated since the 1960s , and their descendents make up the country 's largest ethnic minority .
" at least 2.5 million people here are of turkish origin and there is a rich german turkish literature .
that 's one reason turkey feels very close to us , as if it were a next-door neighbor , " said juergen boos , the book fair chief executive .

in addition to authors , hundreds of performers and artists will round out the offerings at the frankfurt fair .
ahmet ari , the coordinator of the turkish presentation , said the fair would focus not only on the riches of turkish literature awaiting translation into other languages , but also provide a forum for discussing politically controversial topics in a nation going through rapid change .
restrictions on minorities eased bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the turkish-kurdish minority has long been culturally repressed he said that turkey had greatly improved its democratic record in recent years , and there was no longer a single author in jail on account of his political views .
turkish state television had also started its first non-turkish-language broadcasts only a few days ago , he added .
ari was referring to turkey 's decades-old policy of repressing minority languages and cultures .
prime minister recep tayyip erdogan 's center-right akp party has eased many restrictions , with an eye to the eventual possibility of joining the european union .
turkey has 1,724 publishing houses with annual sales of $ 810 million -lrb- 516 million euros -rrb- .
the frankfurt book fair is a springboard in book publishing that helps boost exports and the translation of works into foreign languages .

the blues still have to secure a win after two games . the dutch team made a strong showing from the start with dirk kuyt and substitute robin van persie putting holland 2-0 up after an hour .
thierry henry managed to pull one back for france -lrb- 71st minute -rrb- , but another substitute , arjen robben , scored 30 seconds later and wesley sneijder completed the win in injury time with a superb strike .
world cup runners-up france will face world cup winners italy , who also have one point from two matches , in their final group c match on tuesday .
but both sides , who have put on rather less glorious performances in this championship , will be out if romania beat the netherlands on the same day .
dutch surprise themselves bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : netherlands ' dirk kuyt kicked off the series " we 're still trying to get our heads around this , " the netherlands ' former manchester united striker ruud van nistelrooy said .
" we could n't have expected this , we did n't have the best of form in the qualifying or coming in , but now it seems it is all falling into place .
now i think the confidence is there and it 's lifting the team , " he added .
the dutch , unchanged from the side that hammered italy 3-0 in their opening match , began superbly and kuyt put them in front in the ninth minute , beating florent malouda to head home from a corner . kuyt almost made it 2-0 with a chance soon after , but france came back into the match and sydney govou , preferred to nicolas anelka , had a couple of chances , only to be denied by goalkeeper edwin van der sar .
france came out firing after half-time and henry , who was restored to the starting line-up after injury , lobbed a volley just over the bar .
fine piece of coaching bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : van persie quickly showed the wisdom of the dutch coach 's decision but it was dutch coach marco van basten 's substitutions that proved decisive .
he replaced holding midfielder orlando engelaar at half-time for the speed and attacking thrust of robben , and after 10 minutes striker robin van persie came on for kuyt .
" it gave us greater possibilities to go deeper and give us more space to attack again .
these players are quick and technically good and so we were more dangerous in the second half even though france were creating more pressure , " van basten said . " i have to compliment the defense because there was a lot of pressure and in the end we made some good goals with some good counter-attacks which has made us all very happy . "
the second dutch goal was brilliantly executed , with van nistelrooy near the halfway line cleverly feeding the ball through to substitute robben , who sped down the wing and crossed for van persie to volley home off the hand of gregory coupet .
france continued to press , though , and with 19 minutes to go , willy sagnol broke down the right , fed the ball low into the box and henry scored with a neat left-foot finish .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : thierry henry was fighting a losing battle despite pulling one back for france but france were then undone by a moment of brilliance from robben , who , having broken down the left again but with seemingly nowhere to go , fired a shot high past coupet to make it 3-1 .
robben and van nistelrooy both went close to increasing their lead late on , while patrice evra fired a shot wide for france and franck ribery lifted a free kick just over .
sneijder then completed the victory with a brilliant turn and shot from outside the area to send the dutch fans wild .
it was another outstanding display by the real madrid midfielder , who picked up the man-of-the-match award as he did against italy .
dutch wo n't put their feet up bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : it was n't just the dutch squad that put on a colorful performance the result leaves the netherlands able to take it easy in the last game against romania , but van basten dismissed any idea of allowing romania to win to eliminate two tough rivals in france and italy .
van basten said he had not considered whether he would be playing reserves for the romania game .
" we will start thinking about that game tomorrow but we will prepare for it seriously , " he said .
meanwhile france coach raymond domenech put a brave face on the defeat , knowing his side 's fate is no longer in his hands .

the blues still have to secure a win after two games . the dutch team made a strong showing from the start with dirk kuyt and substitute robin van persie putting holland 2-0 up after an hour .
thierry henry managed to pull one back for france -lrb- 71st minute -rrb- , but another substitute , arjen robben , scored 30 seconds later and wesley sneijder completed the win in injury time with a superb strike .
world cup runners-up france will face world cup winners italy , who also have one point from two matches , in their final group c match on tuesday .
but both sides , who have put on rather less glorious performances in this championship , will be out if romania beat the netherlands on the same day .
dutch surprise themselves bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : netherlands ' dirk kuyt kicked off the series " we 're still trying to get our heads around this , " the netherlands ' former manchester united striker ruud van nistelrooy said .
" we could n't have expected this , we did n't have the best of form in the qualifying or coming in , but now it seems it is all falling into place .
now i think the confidence is there and it 's lifting the team , " he added .
the dutch , unchanged from the side that hammered italy 3-0 in their opening match , began superbly and kuyt put them in front in the ninth minute , beating florent malouda to head home from a corner . kuyt almost made it 2-0 with a chance soon after , but france came back into the match and sydney govou , preferred to nicolas anelka , had a couple of chances , only to be denied by goalkeeper edwin van der sar .
france came out firing after half-time and henry , who was restored to the starting line-up after injury , lobbed a volley just over the bar .
fine piece of coaching bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : van persie quickly showed the wisdom of the dutch coach 's decision but it was dutch coach marco van basten 's substitutions that proved decisive .
he replaced holding midfielder orlando engelaar at half-time for the speed and attacking thrust of robben , and after 10 minutes striker robin van persie came on for kuyt .
" it gave us greater possibilities to go deeper and give us more space to attack again .
these players are quick and technically good and so we were more dangerous in the second half even though france were creating more pressure , " van basten said . " i have to compliment the defense because there was a lot of pressure and in the end we made some good goals with some good counter-attacks which has made us all very happy . "
the second dutch goal was brilliantly executed , with van nistelrooy near the halfway line cleverly feeding the ball through to substitute robben , who sped down the wing and crossed for van persie to volley home off the hand of gregory coupet .
france continued to press , though , and with 19 minutes to go , willy sagnol broke down the right , fed the ball low into the box and henry scored with a neat left-foot finish .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : thierry henry was fighting a losing battle despite pulling one back for france but france were then undone by a moment of brilliance from robben , who , having broken down the left again but with seemingly nowhere to go , fired a shot high past coupet to make it 3-1 .
robben and van nistelrooy both went close to increasing their lead late on , while patrice evra fired a shot wide for france and franck ribery lifted a free kick just over .
sneijder then completed the victory with a brilliant turn and shot from outside the area to send the dutch fans wild .
it was another outstanding display by the real madrid midfielder , who picked up the man-of-the-match award as he did against italy .
dutch wo n't put their feet up bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : it was n't just the dutch squad that put on a colorful performance the result leaves the netherlands able to take it easy in the last game against romania , but van basten dismissed any idea of allowing romania to win to eliminate two tough rivals in france and italy .
van basten said he had not considered whether he would be playing reserves for the romania game .
" we will start thinking about that game tomorrow but we will prepare for it seriously , " he said .
meanwhile france coach raymond domenech put a brave face on the defeat , knowing his side 's fate is no longer in his hands .
" we tried to play and win but there were some unfortunate moments .
there were moments in which we set ourselves up to be successful but we had a lot of bad luck , " he said . dpa news agency -lrb- jg -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

ethnic minorities will be included , said muge gursoy sokmen , co-chair of the organizing committee .
she added that kurdish authors lal lales and seyhmus diken , armenian writers migirdic margosyan and jaklin celik , and jewish writer mario levi would be making appearances in person .

bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : pamuk has often been the subject of controversy the cultural ferment in turkey , in which intellectuals argue about whether and how political islam can be reconciled with modernity , is not just a literary topic , but has also become politicized , with secular turkish judges now mulling a ban on the country 's ruling akp party , which has islamic roots .
germany is home to the largest turkish community outside of turkey .
" guest workers , " who have migrated since the 1960s , and their descendents make up the country 's largest ethnic minority .
" at least 2.5 million people here are of turkish origin and there is a rich german turkish literature .
that 's one reason turkey feels very close to us , as if it were a next-door neighbor , " said juergen boos , the book fair chief executive .

in addition to authors , hundreds of performers and artists will round out the offerings at the frankfurt fair .
ahmet ari , the coordinator of the turkish presentation , said the fair would focus not only on the riches of turkish literature awaiting translation into other languages , but also provide a forum for discussing politically controversial topics in a nation going through rapid change .

turkish state television had also started its first non-turkish-language broadcasts only a few days ago , he added .
ari was referring to turkey 's decades-old policy of repressing minority languages and cultures .
prime minister recep tayyip erdogan 's center-right akp party has eased many restrictions , with an eye to the eventual possibility of joining the european union .
turkey has 1,724 publishing houses with annual sales of $ 810 million -lrb- 516 million euros -rrb- .

but he has also urged other states to continue the ratification process .
" many europeans do not understand how we are constructing europe .
we must therefore change the way we do it , " sarkozy told journalists in paris after meeting us president george w bush .
the irish rejection of the treaty was " an appeal to do more , to do it better , " he said .
non , mais oui bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : nicolas sarkozy made his comments after meeting the us president but sarkozy , whose country is taking over the rotating presidency in july , stressed that no one had the right to sabotage the european project .
one of the treaty 's aims is to streamline decision-making processes in the enlarged and more unwieldy 27-member bloc .
he also admitted saturday , june 14 , that the no-vote would " not simplify the task of the french -lrb- eu -rrb- presidency . "
and sarkozy reiterated his call to other countries to continue ratifying the treaty in order to stop the " irish incident becoming a crisis . "
sarkozy and german chancellor angela merkel had already issued a joint statement on friday to this end .
meanwhile , the irish state minister responsible for integration , conor lenihan , said it was unlikely that the country would stage another referendum on the european union reform treaty in the wake of its rejection by voters this week .

declan ganley , president of the libertas group that led the " no " campaign , said he was horrified that the possibility of another referendum was even being raised .
on friday evening , irish prime minister brian cowen said the government accepted and respected the verdict of voters , but he declined to rule out the possibility of another vote .
cowen will be meeting his colleagues at the eu summit in brussels next week as european leaders ponder what to do next in the wake of the irish voters ' rejection of the treaty .

aimed at preventing decision-making gridlock in the expanding organization , the charter cuts the size of the european parliament and the number of eu decisions which require unanimous support , thus reducing national vetoes .
it also includes a european charter of fundamental human and legal rights , which britain and poland have refused to make binding .

germany is home to the largest turkish community outside of turkey .
" guest workers , " who have migrated since the 1960s , and their descendents make up the country 's largest ethnic minority .
" at least 2.5 million people here are of turkish origin and there is a rich german turkish literature .

in addition to authors , hundreds of performers and artists will round out the offerings at the frankfurt fair .

besides books , the publishing trade 's top annual event will provide a forum for political discussion on a country undergoing rapid change . turkey promised this week to showcase its cultural diversity at the annual frankfurt book fair in october , where its literature will have guest-of-honor status this year .
speaking from frankfurt , organizers said 350 authors and translators from turkey will be at the world 's principal book fair , presenting their work to publishers from around the globe .
ethnic minorities will be included , said muge gursoy sokmen , co-chair of the organizing committee .
she added that kurdish authors lal lales and seyhmus diken , armenian writers migirdic margosyan and jaklin celik , and jewish writer mario levi would be making appearances in person .
at the october 15-19 fair a special exhibition on turkish literature will also highlight the little-known " layers " that are woven in with turkic origins in the country 's culture today .
showcasing turkey 's cultural diversity " you 'll see how it includes arab or armenian or byzantine roots too , " she said .
" we have to treat the heritage of our cultural diversity with respect , " said sokmen , who is a leftist istanbul publisher .
" we see this as a very rich resource . "
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : pamuk has often been the subject of controversy the cultural ferment in turkey , in which intellectuals argue about whether and how political islam can be reconciled with modernity , is not just a literary topic , but has also become politicized , with secular turkish judges now mulling a ban on the country 's ruling akp party , which has islamic roots .
germany is home to the largest turkish community outside of turkey .
" guest workers , " who have migrated since the 1960s , and their descendents make up the country 's largest ethnic minority .
" at least 2.5 million people here are of turkish origin and there is a rich german turkish literature .
that 's one reason turkey feels very close to us , as if it were a next-door neighbor , " said juergen boos , the book fair chief executive .
nobel-prize winner pamuk to open fair orhan pamuk , the nobel literature prize winner in 2006 , will open the fair with turkish president abdullah gul . the best-selling author was the subject of international controversy when he was charged with making statements that violated an article in turkey 's penal code for " insulting turkishness , " though he was never prosecuted .
in addition to authors , hundreds of performers and artists will round out the offerings at the frankfurt fair .
ahmet ari , the coordinator of the turkish presentation , said the fair would focus not only on the riches of turkish literature awaiting translation into other languages , but also provide a forum for discussing politically controversial topics in a nation going through rapid change .
restrictions on minorities eased bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the turkish-kurdish minority has long been culturally repressed he said that turkey had greatly improved its democratic record in recent years , and there was no longer a single author in jail on account of his political views .
turkish state television had also started its first non-turkish-language broadcasts only a few days ago , he added .
ari was referring to turkey 's decades-old policy of repressing minority languages and cultures .
prime minister recep tayyip erdogan 's center-right akp party has eased many restrictions , with an eye to the eventual possibility of joining the european union .
turkey has 1,724 publishing houses with annual sales of $ 810 million -lrb- 516 million euros -rrb- .
the frankfurt book fair is a springboard in book publishing that helps boost exports and the translation of works into foreign languages .

the blues still have to secure a win after two games . the dutch team made a strong showing from the start with dirk kuyt and substitute robin van persie putting holland 2-0 up after an hour .
thierry henry managed to pull one back for france -lrb- 71st minute -rrb- , but another substitute , arjen robben , scored 30 seconds later and wesley sneijder completed the win in injury time with a superb strike .
world cup runners-up france will face world cup winners italy , who also have one point from two matches , in their final group c match on tuesday .
but both sides , who have put on rather less glorious performances in this championship , will be out if romania beat the netherlands on the same day .
dutch surprise themselves bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : netherlands ' dirk kuyt kicked off the series " we 're still trying to get our heads around this , " the netherlands ' former manchester united striker ruud van nistelrooy said .
" we could n't have expected this , we did n't have the best of form in the qualifying or coming in , but now it seems it is all falling into place .
now i think the confidence is there and it 's lifting the team , " he added .
the dutch , unchanged from the side that hammered italy 3-0 in their opening match , began superbly and kuyt put them in front in the ninth minute , beating florent malouda to head home from a corner . kuyt almost made it 2-0 with a chance soon after , but france came back into the match and sydney govou , preferred to nicolas anelka , had a couple of chances , only to be denied by goalkeeper edwin van der sar .
france came out firing after half-time and henry , who was restored to the starting line-up after injury , lobbed a volley just over the bar .
fine piece of coaching bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : van persie quickly showed the wisdom of the dutch coach 's decision but it was dutch coach marco van basten 's substitutions that proved decisive .
he replaced holding midfielder orlando engelaar at half-time for the speed and attacking thrust of robben , and after 10 minutes striker robin van persie came on for kuyt .
" it gave us greater possibilities to go deeper and give us more space to attack again .
these players are quick and technically good and so we were more dangerous in the second half even though france were creating more pressure , " van basten said . " i have to compliment the defense because there was a lot of pressure and in the end we made some good goals with some good counter-attacks which has made us all very happy . "
the second dutch goal was brilliantly executed , with van nistelrooy near the halfway line cleverly feeding the ball through to substitute robben , who sped down the wing and crossed for van persie to volley home off the hand of gregory coupet .
france continued to press , though , and with 19 minutes to go , willy sagnol broke down the right , fed the ball low into the box and henry scored with a neat left-foot finish .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : thierry henry was fighting a losing battle despite pulling one back for france but france were then undone by a moment of brilliance from robben , who , having broken down the left again but with seemingly nowhere to go , fired a shot high past coupet to make it 3-1 .
robben and van nistelrooy both went close to increasing their lead late on , while patrice evra fired a shot wide for france and franck ribery lifted a free kick just over .
sneijder then completed the victory with a brilliant turn and shot from outside the area to send the dutch fans wild .
it was another outstanding display by the real madrid midfielder , who picked up the man-of-the-match award as he did against italy .
dutch wo n't put their feet up bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : it was n't just the dutch squad that put on a colorful performance the result leaves the netherlands able to take it easy in the last game against romania , but van basten dismissed any idea of allowing romania to win to eliminate two tough rivals in france and italy .
van basten said he had not considered whether he would be playing reserves for the romania game .
" we will start thinking about that game tomorrow but we will prepare for it seriously , " he said .
meanwhile france coach raymond domenech put a brave face on the defeat , knowing his side 's fate is no longer in his hands .
" we tried to play and win but there were some unfortunate moments .
there were moments in which we set ourselves up to be successful but we had a lot of bad luck , " he said . dpa news agency -lrb- jg -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

besides books , the publishing trade 's top annual event will provide a forum for political discussion on a country undergoing rapid change . turkey promised this week to showcase its cultural diversity at the annual frankfurt book fair in october , where its literature will have guest-of-honor status this year .
speaking from frankfurt , organizers said 350 authors and translators from turkey will be at the world 's principal book fair , presenting their work to publishers from around the globe .
ethnic minorities will be included , said muge gursoy sokmen , co-chair of the organizing committee .
she added that kurdish authors lal lales and seyhmus diken , armenian writers migirdic margosyan and jaklin celik , and jewish writer mario levi would be making appearances in person .
at the october 15-19 fair a special exhibition on turkish literature will also highlight the little-known " layers " that are woven in with turkic origins in the country 's culture today .
showcasing turkey 's cultural diversity " you 'll see how it includes arab or armenian or byzantine roots too , " she said .
" we have to treat the heritage of our cultural diversity with respect , " said sokmen , who is a leftist istanbul publisher .
" we see this as a very rich resource . "
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : pamuk has often been the subject of controversy the cultural ferment in turkey , in which intellectuals argue about whether and how political islam can be reconciled with modernity , is not just a literary topic , but has also become politicized , with secular turkish judges now mulling a ban on the country 's ruling akp party , which has islamic roots .
germany is home to the largest turkish community outside of turkey .
" guest workers , " who have migrated since the 1960s , and their descendents make up the country 's largest ethnic minority .
" at least 2.5 million people here are of turkish origin and there is a rich german turkish literature .
that 's one reason turkey feels very close to us , as if it were a next-door neighbor , " said juergen boos , the book fair chief executive .
nobel-prize winner pamuk to open fair orhan pamuk , the nobel literature prize winner in 2006 , will open the fair with turkish president abdullah gul . the best-selling author was the subject of international controversy when he was charged with making statements that violated an article in turkey 's penal code for " insulting turkishness , " though he was never prosecuted .
in addition to authors , hundreds of performers and artists will round out the offerings at the frankfurt fair .
ahmet ari , the coordinator of the turkish presentation , said the fair would focus not only on the riches of turkish literature awaiting translation into other languages , but also provide a forum for discussing politically controversial topics in a nation going through rapid change .
restrictions on minorities eased bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the turkish-kurdish minority has long been culturally repressed he said that turkey had greatly improved its democratic record in recent years , and there was no longer a single author in jail on account of his political views .
turkish state television had also started its first non-turkish-language broadcasts only a few days ago , he added .
ari was referring to turkey 's decades-old policy of repressing minority languages and cultures .
prime minister recep tayyip erdogan 's center-right akp party has eased many restrictions , with an eye to the eventual possibility of joining the european union .
turkey has 1,724 publishing houses with annual sales of $ 810 million -lrb- 516 million euros -rrb- .
the frankfurt book fair is a springboard in book publishing that helps boost exports and the translation of works into foreign languages .

speaking from frankfurt , organizers said 350 authors and translators from turkey will be at the world 's principal book fair , presenting their work to publishers from around the globe .
ethnic minorities will be included , said muge gursoy sokmen , co-chair of the organizing committee .
she added that kurdish authors lal lales and seyhmus diken , armenian writers migirdic margosyan and jaklin celik , and jewish writer mario levi would be making appearances in person .
at the october 15-19 fair a special exhibition on turkish literature will also highlight the little-known " layers " that are woven in with turkic origins in the country 's culture today .

" we see this as a very rich resource . "
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : pamuk has often been the subject of controversy the cultural ferment in turkey , in which intellectuals argue about whether and how political islam can be reconciled with modernity , is not just a literary topic , but has also become politicized , with secular turkish judges now mulling a ban on the country 's ruling akp party , which has islamic roots .
germany is home to the largest turkish community outside of turkey .
" guest workers , " who have migrated since the 1960s , and their descendents make up the country 's largest ethnic minority .
" at least 2.5 million people here are of turkish origin and there is a rich german turkish literature .
that 's one reason turkey feels very close to us , as if it were a next-door neighbor , " said juergen boos , the book fair chief executive .
nobel-prize winner pamuk to open fair orhan pamuk , the nobel literature prize winner in 2006 , will open the fair with turkish president abdullah gul . the best-selling author was the subject of international controversy when he was charged with making statements that violated an article in turkey 's penal code for " insulting turkishness , " though he was never prosecuted .
in addition to authors , hundreds of performers and artists will round out the offerings at the frankfurt fair .
ahmet ari , the coordinator of the turkish presentation , said the fair would focus not only on the riches of turkish literature awaiting translation into other languages , but also provide a forum for discussing politically controversial topics in a nation going through rapid change .
restrictions on minorities eased bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the turkish-kurdish minority has long been culturally repressed he said that turkey had greatly improved its democratic record in recent years , and there was no longer a single author in jail on account of his political views .
turkish state television had also started its first non-turkish-language broadcasts only a few days ago , he added .
ari was referring to turkey 's decades-old policy of repressing minority languages and cultures .
prime minister recep tayyip erdogan 's center-right akp party has eased many restrictions , with an eye to the eventual possibility of joining the european union .
turkey has 1,724 publishing houses with annual sales of $ 810 million -lrb- 516 million euros -rrb- .

permission was refused on the grounds that sinan w. , the head of the " morgenland " -lrb- orient -rrb- association behind the project , was believed to have ties to the radical muslim group hizb-ut-tahrir , banned in germany since 2003 .
in 2004 he allegedly published texts on the internet containing incitement to hatred .

the new kindergarten observes muslim holidays and only serves halal food .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de women -pipe- 14.06.2008 french feminists unhappy with sarkozy großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : sarkozy has given women top jobs in his cabinet french president nicolas sarkozy courted female voters during the run-up to the last elections , but since he took office , women ’ s rights has taken a back seat to other issues , feminists say . french president nicolas sarkozy courted female voters during the run-up to the last elections , saying that france should take the lead in pushing for women 's rights .
but feminists feel this was a mere political tactic to keep french women from voting en masse for his female opponent , socialist candidate segolene royal .
feminists feel sarkozy 's given the women 's rights issue very little attention since taking office just over a year ago .
one vocal sarkozy critic is emmanuelle piet , a doctor who has been involved in promoting the campaign against domestic violence for the past quarter century .
piet currently serves as president of an aid organization for battered women .
" sarkozy has already been in office for a year and he has caused problems from the beginning on , " she said .
" when he formed his government , he did not establish any ministry to deal with issues of women 's rights or equality . ”
sarkozy accused of lack of interest bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : sarkozy did n't want to lose women 's votes to royal in 1981 , francois mitterrand launched a ministry for women 's rights , which put france at the forefront in europe on the issue .
since then , each government has included women 's rights and equality as part of its portfolio , or at least assigned a secretary of state to the issue .
when sarkozy took the helm in may 2007 , he added female politicians to his team , but not nearly as many as he promised during the elections .
yet his government is proud that top posts have been filled by women including that of finance minister christine lagarde , interior minister michele alliot-marie and justice minister rachida dati .
for piet , having women as ministers does n't make up for the lack of a women 's ministry .
she also has been worried by reports that the state office for women 's rights might be closed .
the office ensures that women have access to abortions and deals with other privacy issues .
" in short , one notices a big disinterest in respect to the government 's involvement in women 's rights , ” she said .
little help for trafficking victims bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : sarkozy has been accused of insensitivity to victims of human trafficking this opinion is backed up by francoise laurant , president of the family planning organization mfpf .
during the run-up to the elections , the group requested meetings with all of the major mainstream candidates .
sarkozy was the only one who did not reply , said laurant .
“ that was the first alarm signal for us , ” she said .
yet there were signals that sarkozy would take a more conservative line on issues such as prostitution .
as interior minister , he helped usher through a series of laws in 2003 which went after prostitutes who engaged in so-called “ passive solicitation . ”
while the term 's meaning is not completely clear , it has amounted to a declaration of war on foreign prostitutes .
the majority of these women are victims of illegal human trafficking networks .
in order to be eligible for help from the french government , they have to be willing to turn in their tormenters , people often involved in criminal networks .
if they are unwilling to do so , they face deportation .
this practice of deporting prostitutes has been strongly criticized by the united nations organization which is trying to put an end to human trafficking .
feminists decry " victimization " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : sarkozy has seemed distracted by his love life the president has been active in providing more state help to victims of domestic violence .
while sarkozy has taken on this issue as one that is close to his heart , laurant from the mfpf remains skeptical .
“ in sarkozy 's speeches are always only about victims and that they need to be defended .
for feminists , that makes our blood run cold , ” laurant said . dw staff -lrb- th -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

but feminists feel this was a mere political tactic to keep french women from voting en masse for his female opponent , socialist candidate segolene royal .
feminists feel sarkozy 's given the women 's rights issue very little attention since taking office just over a year ago .
one vocal sarkozy critic is emmanuelle piet , a doctor who has been involved in promoting the campaign against domestic violence for the past quarter century .
piet currently serves as president of an aid organization for battered women .
" sarkozy has already been in office for a year and he has caused problems from the beginning on , " she said .
" when he formed his government , he did not establish any ministry to deal with issues of women 's rights or equality . ”
sarkozy accused of lack of interest bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : sarkozy did n't want to lose women 's votes to royal in 1981 , francois mitterrand launched a ministry for women 's rights , which put france at the forefront in europe on the issue .
since then , each government has included women 's rights and equality as part of its portfolio , or at least assigned a secretary of state to the issue .
when sarkozy took the helm in may 2007 , he added female politicians to his team , but not nearly as many as he promised during the elections .
yet his government is proud that top posts have been filled by women including that of finance minister christine lagarde , interior minister michele alliot-marie and justice minister rachida dati .
for piet , having women as ministers does n't make up for the lack of a women 's ministry .
she also has been worried by reports that the state office for women 's rights might be closed .
the office ensures that women have access to abortions and deals with other privacy issues .

yet there were signals that sarkozy would take a more conservative line on issues such as prostitution .
as interior minister , he helped usher through a series of laws in 2003 which went after prostitutes who engaged in so-called “ passive solicitation . ”
while the term 's meaning is not completely clear , it has amounted to a declaration of war on foreign prostitutes .
the majority of these women are victims of illegal human trafficking networks .
in order to be eligible for help from the french government , they have to be willing to turn in their tormenters , people often involved in criminal networks .

french president nicolas sarkozy has called ireland 's " no " to the eu 's lisbon treaty a call to change the way europe was being constructed .
but he has also urged other states to continue the ratification process . french president nicolas sarkozy has called ireland 's " no " to the eu 's lisbon treaty a call to change the way europe was being constructed .
but he has also urged other states to continue the ratification process .
" many europeans do not understand how we are constructing europe .
we must therefore change the way we do it , " sarkozy told journalists in paris after meeting us president george w bush .
the irish rejection of the treaty was " an appeal to do more , to do it better , " he said .
non , mais oui bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : nicolas sarkozy made his comments after meeting the us president but sarkozy , whose country is taking over the rotating presidency in july , stressed that no one had the right to sabotage the european project .
one of the treaty 's aims is to streamline decision-making processes in the enlarged and more unwieldy 27-member bloc .
he also admitted saturday , june 14 , that the no-vote would " not simplify the task of the french -lrb- eu -rrb- presidency . "
and sarkozy reiterated his call to other countries to continue ratifying the treaty in order to stop the " irish incident becoming a crisis . "
sarkozy and german chancellor angela merkel had already issued a joint statement on friday to this end .
meanwhile , the irish state minister responsible for integration , conor lenihan , said it was unlikely that the country would stage another referendum on the european union reform treaty in the wake of its rejection by voters this week .
on the morning news show of the national broadcaster rte , lenihan said he could not rule out the possibility of a new vote , but he then cautioned there was a risk of even more damage being done if the treaty is put up for a second vote .
if at first you do n't succeed bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : irish prime minister has not ruled out a second vote lenihan warned that ireland is now " extremely isolated " in europe as the only eu member to has rejected the treaty .
his comments came as irish politicians - both those who favored and opposed the treaty - took stock of the referendum result in which the treaty was rejected by a margin of 110,000 votes .
declan ganley , president of the libertas group that led the " no " campaign , said he was horrified that the possibility of another referendum was even being raised .
on friday evening , irish prime minister brian cowen said the government accepted and respected the verdict of voters , but he declined to rule out the possibility of another vote .
cowen will be meeting his colleagues at the eu summit in brussels next week as european leaders ponder what to do next in the wake of the irish voters ' rejection of the treaty .
adapting the eu the lisbon treaty is designed to replace the failed treaty of nice , which ireland only approved in 2002 after it was put to the people for a second time following a no-vote a year earlier .
the nice treaty was subsequently torpedoed by france and the netherlands . like the rejected constitution , the lisbon treaty proposes a european foreign policy supremo and a permanent president to replace the six-month rotation system .
aimed at preventing decision-making gridlock in the expanding organization , the charter cuts the size of the european parliament and the number of eu decisions which require unanimous support , thus reducing national vetoes .
it also includes a european charter of fundamental human and legal rights , which britain and poland have refused to make binding .
however it drops all references to an eu flag or anthem which had fanned euroskeptic fears of another step towards a federal europe , and no longer cites unbridled competition as a goal for the bloc . dw staff -lrb- jg -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

but feminists feel this was a mere political tactic to keep french women from voting en masse for his female opponent , socialist candidate segolene royal .
feminists feel sarkozy 's given the women 's rights issue very little attention since taking office just over a year ago .
one vocal sarkozy critic is emmanuelle piet , a doctor who has been involved in promoting the campaign against domestic violence for the past quarter century .
piet currently serves as president of an aid organization for battered women .
" sarkozy has already been in office for a year and he has caused problems from the beginning on , " she said .
" when he formed his government , he did not establish any ministry to deal with issues of women 's rights or equality . ”
sarkozy accused of lack of interest bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : sarkozy did n't want to lose women 's votes to royal in 1981 , francois mitterrand launched a ministry for women 's rights , which put france at the forefront in europe on the issue .
since then , each government has included women 's rights and equality as part of its portfolio , or at least assigned a secretary of state to the issue .
when sarkozy took the helm in may 2007 , he added female politicians to his team , but not nearly as many as he promised during the elections .
yet his government is proud that top posts have been filled by women including that of finance minister christine lagarde , interior minister michele alliot-marie and justice minister rachida dati .
for piet , having women as ministers does n't make up for the lack of a women 's ministry .
she also has been worried by reports that the state office for women 's rights might be closed .
the office ensures that women have access to abortions and deals with other privacy issues .
" in short , one notices a big disinterest in respect to the government 's involvement in women 's rights , ” she said .
little help for trafficking victims bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : sarkozy has been accused of insensitivity to victims of human trafficking this opinion is backed up by francoise laurant , president of the family planning organization mfpf .
during the run-up to the elections , the group requested meetings with all of the major mainstream candidates .
sarkozy was the only one who did not reply , said laurant .
“ that was the first alarm signal for us , ” she said .
yet there were signals that sarkozy would take a more conservative line on issues such as prostitution .
as interior minister , he helped usher through a series of laws in 2003 which went after prostitutes who engaged in so-called “ passive solicitation . ”
while the term 's meaning is not completely clear , it has amounted to a declaration of war on foreign prostitutes .
the majority of these women are victims of illegal human trafficking networks .
in order to be eligible for help from the french government , they have to be willing to turn in their tormenters , people often involved in criminal networks .
if they are unwilling to do so , they face deportation .
this practice of deporting prostitutes has been strongly criticized by the united nations organization which is trying to put an end to human trafficking .
feminists decry " victimization " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : sarkozy has seemed distracted by his love life the president has been active in providing more state help to victims of domestic violence .
while sarkozy has taken on this issue as one that is close to his heart , laurant from the mfpf remains skeptical .
“ in sarkozy 's speeches are always only about victims and that they need to be defended .
for feminists , that makes our blood run cold , ” laurant said . dw staff -lrb- th -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

in 2004 he allegedly published texts on the internet containing incitement to hatred .

the kindergarten subsequently opened in may with 45 children in its care , including turks , bosnians , arabs and lithuanians .
however , the authorities have laid down certain conditions .
any staff changes must be registered with the authorities , while the youth welfare office is allowed to inspect the kindergarten whenever it wishes without giving notice .
" we will be doing this , " said city councillor rainer maria fritsch in the daily tagesspiegel .
" if parents or staff report unusual activity at odds with the constitution , we can withdraw permission at any time . "
fulfilling a need " they can come whenever they like , " said sinan w. 's wife in the same newspaper , adding that the kindergarten had been her idea .
" we have nothing to hide , " she went on .
" i used to work at another kindergarten in the same district , and muslim mothers would often ask why there was no muslim childcare facility in the neighborhood .
they want their children to grow up with traditions , such as observing ramadan . "
now they can .
the new kindergarten observes muslim holidays and only serves halal food .
otherwise , little sets it apart from other kindergartens in the capital .
some have expressed skepticism others have their doubts , and believe that sinan w. 's resignation as chairman of morgenland was merely tactical .
" the abrupt change to the leadership of morgenland was a transparent maneuver geared to securing permission , " said christian democrat spokesperson frank henkel in welt online , adding that sinan w. most probably still pulls the strings .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the al-nur mosque meanwhile , local radio station info-radio reported that the kindergarten staff were recruited via an advert posted on the website of the al-nur mosque in the south of berlin , widely believed to be a meeting place for radicals .
further adverts appeared on muslim web sites , which , according to the federal office for the protection of the constitution , " directly and indirectly spread anti-zionist and anti-israeli propaganda . "
" we will be making sure that democratic standards are maintained , " insisted berhard kempf .
" if we allow them a place within our education system we can keep an eye on them .
it 's preferable to having extremists working undercover . " dw staff -lrb- jp -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

but feminists feel this was a mere political tactic to keep french women from voting en masse for his female opponent , socialist candidate segolene royal .
feminists feel sarkozy 's given the women 's rights issue very little attention since taking office just over a year ago .
one vocal sarkozy critic is emmanuelle piet , a doctor who has been involved in promoting the campaign against domestic violence for the past quarter century .
piet currently serves as president of an aid organization for battered women .
" sarkozy has already been in office for a year and he has caused problems from the beginning on , " she said .
" when he formed his government , he did not establish any ministry to deal with issues of women 's rights or equality . ”
sarkozy accused of lack of interest bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : sarkozy did n't want to lose women 's votes to royal in 1981 , francois mitterrand launched a ministry for women 's rights , which put france at the forefront in europe on the issue .
since then , each government has included women 's rights and equality as part of its portfolio , or at least assigned a secretary of state to the issue .
when sarkozy took the helm in may 2007 , he added female politicians to his team , but not nearly as many as he promised during the elections .
yet his government is proud that top posts have been filled by women including that of finance minister christine lagarde , interior minister michele alliot-marie and justice minister rachida dati .
for piet , having women as ministers does n't make up for the lack of a women 's ministry .
she also has been worried by reports that the state office for women 's rights might be closed .
the office ensures that women have access to abortions and deals with other privacy issues .
" in short , one notices a big disinterest in respect to the government 's involvement in women 's rights , ” she said .
little help for trafficking victims bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : sarkozy has been accused of insensitivity to victims of human trafficking this opinion is backed up by francoise laurant , president of the family planning organization mfpf .
during the run-up to the elections , the group requested meetings with all of the major mainstream candidates .
sarkozy was the only one who did not reply , said laurant .
“ that was the first alarm signal for us , ” she said .
yet there were signals that sarkozy would take a more conservative line on issues such as prostitution .
as interior minister , he helped usher through a series of laws in 2003 which went after prostitutes who engaged in so-called “ passive solicitation . ”
while the term 's meaning is not completely clear , it has amounted to a declaration of war on foreign prostitutes .
the majority of these women are victims of illegal human trafficking networks .
in order to be eligible for help from the french government , they have to be willing to turn in their tormenters , people often involved in criminal networks .
if they are unwilling to do so , they face deportation .
this practice of deporting prostitutes has been strongly criticized by the united nations organization which is trying to put an end to human trafficking .
feminists decry " victimization " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : sarkozy has seemed distracted by his love life the president has been active in providing more state help to victims of domestic violence .
while sarkozy has taken on this issue as one that is close to his heart , laurant from the mfpf remains skeptical .

but feminists feel this was a mere political tactic to keep french women from voting en masse for his female opponent , socialist candidate segolene royal .
feminists feel sarkozy 's given the women 's rights issue very little attention since taking office just over a year ago .
one vocal sarkozy critic is emmanuelle piet , a doctor who has been involved in promoting the campaign against domestic violence for the past quarter century .
piet currently serves as president of an aid organization for battered women .
" sarkozy has already been in office for a year and he has caused problems from the beginning on , " she said .
" when he formed his government , he did not establish any ministry to deal with issues of women 's rights or equality . ”
sarkozy accused of lack of interest bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : sarkozy did n't want to lose women 's votes to royal in 1981 , francois mitterrand launched a ministry for women 's rights , which put france at the forefront in europe on the issue .
since then , each government has included women 's rights and equality as part of its portfolio , or at least assigned a secretary of state to the issue .
when sarkozy took the helm in may 2007 , he added female politicians to his team , but not nearly as many as he promised during the elections .
yet his government is proud that top posts have been filled by women including that of finance minister christine lagarde , interior minister michele alliot-marie and justice minister rachida dati .
for piet , having women as ministers does n't make up for the lack of a women 's ministry .
she also has been worried by reports that the state office for women 's rights might be closed .
the office ensures that women have access to abortions and deals with other privacy issues .
" in short , one notices a big disinterest in respect to the government 's involvement in women 's rights , ” she said .
little help for trafficking victims bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : sarkozy has been accused of insensitivity to victims of human trafficking this opinion is backed up by francoise laurant , president of the family planning organization mfpf .
during the run-up to the elections , the group requested meetings with all of the major mainstream candidates .
sarkozy was the only one who did not reply , said laurant .
“ that was the first alarm signal for us , ” she said .
yet there were signals that sarkozy would take a more conservative line on issues such as prostitution .
as interior minister , he helped usher through a series of laws in 2003 which went after prostitutes who engaged in so-called “ passive solicitation . ”
while the term 's meaning is not completely clear , it has amounted to a declaration of war on foreign prostitutes .
the majority of these women are victims of illegal human trafficking networks .
in order to be eligible for help from the french government , they have to be willing to turn in their tormenters , people often involved in criminal networks .
if they are unwilling to do so , they face deportation .
this practice of deporting prostitutes has been strongly criticized by the united nations organization which is trying to put an end to human trafficking .
feminists decry " victimization " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : sarkozy has seemed distracted by his love life the president has been active in providing more state help to victims of domestic violence .
while sarkozy has taken on this issue as one that is close to his heart , laurant from the mfpf remains skeptical .
“ in sarkozy 's speeches are always only about victims and that they need to be defended .
for feminists , that makes our blood run cold , ” laurant said . dw staff -lrb- th -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

french president nicolas sarkozy has called ireland 's " no " to the eu 's lisbon treaty a call to change the way europe was being constructed .
but he has also urged other states to continue the ratification process . french president nicolas sarkozy has called ireland 's " no " to the eu 's lisbon treaty a call to change the way europe was being constructed .
but he has also urged other states to continue the ratification process .
" many europeans do not understand how we are constructing europe .
we must therefore change the way we do it , " sarkozy told journalists in paris after meeting us president george w bush .
the irish rejection of the treaty was " an appeal to do more , to do it better , " he said .
non , mais oui bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : nicolas sarkozy made his comments after meeting the us president but sarkozy , whose country is taking over the rotating presidency in july , stressed that no one had the right to sabotage the european project .
one of the treaty 's aims is to streamline decision-making processes in the enlarged and more unwieldy 27-member bloc .
he also admitted saturday , june 14 , that the no-vote would " not simplify the task of the french -lrb- eu -rrb- presidency . "
and sarkozy reiterated his call to other countries to continue ratifying the treaty in order to stop the " irish incident becoming a crisis . "
sarkozy and german chancellor angela merkel had already issued a joint statement on friday to this end .
meanwhile , the irish state minister responsible for integration , conor lenihan , said it was unlikely that the country would stage another referendum on the european union reform treaty in the wake of its rejection by voters this week .
on the morning news show of the national broadcaster rte , lenihan said he could not rule out the possibility of a new vote , but he then cautioned there was a risk of even more damage being done if the treaty is put up for a second vote .
if at first you do n't succeed bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : irish prime minister has not ruled out a second vote lenihan warned that ireland is now " extremely isolated " in europe as the only eu member to has rejected the treaty .
his comments came as irish politicians - both those who favored and opposed the treaty - took stock of the referendum result in which the treaty was rejected by a margin of 110,000 votes .
declan ganley , president of the libertas group that led the " no " campaign , said he was horrified that the possibility of another referendum was even being raised .
on friday evening , irish prime minister brian cowen said the government accepted and respected the verdict of voters , but he declined to rule out the possibility of another vote .
cowen will be meeting his colleagues at the eu summit in brussels next week as european leaders ponder what to do next in the wake of the irish voters ' rejection of the treaty .
adapting the eu the lisbon treaty is designed to replace the failed treaty of nice , which ireland only approved in 2002 after it was put to the people for a second time following a no-vote a year earlier .
the nice treaty was subsequently torpedoed by france and the netherlands . like the rejected constitution , the lisbon treaty proposes a european foreign policy supremo and a permanent president to replace the six-month rotation system .

french president nicolas sarkozy has called ireland 's " no " to the eu 's lisbon treaty a call to change the way europe was being constructed .
but he has also urged other states to continue the ratification process . french president nicolas sarkozy has called ireland 's " no " to the eu 's lisbon treaty a call to change the way europe was being constructed .
but he has also urged other states to continue the ratification process .
" many europeans do not understand how we are constructing europe .
we must therefore change the way we do it , " sarkozy told journalists in paris after meeting us president george w bush .
the irish rejection of the treaty was " an appeal to do more , to do it better , " he said .
non , mais oui bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : nicolas sarkozy made his comments after meeting the us president but sarkozy , whose country is taking over the rotating presidency in july , stressed that no one had the right to sabotage the european project .
one of the treaty 's aims is to streamline decision-making processes in the enlarged and more unwieldy 27-member bloc .
he also admitted saturday , june 14 , that the no-vote would " not simplify the task of the french -lrb- eu -rrb- presidency . "
and sarkozy reiterated his call to other countries to continue ratifying the treaty in order to stop the " irish incident becoming a crisis . "
sarkozy and german chancellor angela merkel had already issued a joint statement on friday to this end .
meanwhile , the irish state minister responsible for integration , conor lenihan , said it was unlikely that the country would stage another referendum on the european union reform treaty in the wake of its rejection by voters this week .
on the morning news show of the national broadcaster rte , lenihan said he could not rule out the possibility of a new vote , but he then cautioned there was a risk of even more damage being done if the treaty is put up for a second vote .

his comments came as irish politicians - both those who favored and opposed the treaty - took stock of the referendum result in which the treaty was rejected by a margin of 110,000 votes .
declan ganley , president of the libertas group that led the " no " campaign , said he was horrified that the possibility of another referendum was even being raised .
on friday evening , irish prime minister brian cowen said the government accepted and respected the verdict of voters , but he declined to rule out the possibility of another vote .
cowen will be meeting his colleagues at the eu summit in brussels next week as european leaders ponder what to do next in the wake of the irish voters ' rejection of the treaty .
adapting the eu the lisbon treaty is designed to replace the failed treaty of nice , which ireland only approved in 2002 after it was put to the people for a second time following a no-vote a year earlier .
the nice treaty was subsequently torpedoed by france and the netherlands . like the rejected constitution , the lisbon treaty proposes a european foreign policy supremo and a permanent president to replace the six-month rotation system .

french president nicolas sarkozy has called ireland 's " no " to the eu 's lisbon treaty a call to change the way europe was being constructed .
but he has also urged other states to continue the ratification process . french president nicolas sarkozy has called ireland 's " no " to the eu 's lisbon treaty a call to change the way europe was being constructed .
but he has also urged other states to continue the ratification process .
" many europeans do not understand how we are constructing europe .
we must therefore change the way we do it , " sarkozy told journalists in paris after meeting us president george w bush .
the irish rejection of the treaty was " an appeal to do more , to do it better , " he said .
non , mais oui bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : nicolas sarkozy made his comments after meeting the us president but sarkozy , whose country is taking over the rotating presidency in july , stressed that no one had the right to sabotage the european project .
one of the treaty 's aims is to streamline decision-making processes in the enlarged and more unwieldy 27-member bloc .
he also admitted saturday , june 14 , that the no-vote would " not simplify the task of the french -lrb- eu -rrb- presidency . "
and sarkozy reiterated his call to other countries to continue ratifying the treaty in order to stop the " irish incident becoming a crisis . "
sarkozy and german chancellor angela merkel had already issued a joint statement on friday to this end .
meanwhile , the irish state minister responsible for integration , conor lenihan , said it was unlikely that the country would stage another referendum on the european union reform treaty in the wake of its rejection by voters this week .
on the morning news show of the national broadcaster rte , lenihan said he could not rule out the possibility of a new vote , but he then cautioned there was a risk of even more damage being done if the treaty is put up for a second vote .
if at first you do n't succeed bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : irish prime minister has not ruled out a second vote lenihan warned that ireland is now " extremely isolated " in europe as the only eu member to has rejected the treaty .
his comments came as irish politicians - both those who favored and opposed the treaty - took stock of the referendum result in which the treaty was rejected by a margin of 110,000 votes .
declan ganley , president of the libertas group that led the " no " campaign , said he was horrified that the possibility of another referendum was even being raised .
on friday evening , irish prime minister brian cowen said the government accepted and respected the verdict of voters , but he declined to rule out the possibility of another vote .
cowen will be meeting his colleagues at the eu summit in brussels next week as european leaders ponder what to do next in the wake of the irish voters ' rejection of the treaty .
adapting the eu the lisbon treaty is designed to replace the failed treaty of nice , which ireland only approved in 2002 after it was put to the people for a second time following a no-vote a year earlier .
the nice treaty was subsequently torpedoed by france and the netherlands . like the rejected constitution , the lisbon treaty proposes a european foreign policy supremo and a permanent president to replace the six-month rotation system .
aimed at preventing decision-making gridlock in the expanding organization , the charter cuts the size of the european parliament and the number of eu decisions which require unanimous support , thus reducing national vetoes .
it also includes a european charter of fundamental human and legal rights , which britain and poland have refused to make binding .
however it drops all references to an eu flag or anthem which had fanned euroskeptic fears of another step towards a federal europe , and no longer cites unbridled competition as a goal for the bloc . dw staff -lrb- jg -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

the blues still have to secure a win after two games . the dutch team made a strong showing from the start with dirk kuyt and substitute robin van persie putting holland 2-0 up after an hour .
thierry henry managed to pull one back for france -lrb- 71st minute -rrb- , but another substitute , arjen robben , scored 30 seconds later and wesley sneijder completed the win in injury time with a superb strike .
world cup runners-up france will face world cup winners italy , who also have one point from two matches , in their final group c match on tuesday .
but both sides , who have put on rather less glorious performances in this championship , will be out if romania beat the netherlands on the same day .
dutch surprise themselves bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : netherlands ' dirk kuyt kicked off the series " we 're still trying to get our heads around this , " the netherlands ' former manchester united striker ruud van nistelrooy said .
" we could n't have expected this , we did n't have the best of form in the qualifying or coming in , but now it seems it is all falling into place .
now i think the confidence is there and it 's lifting the team , " he added .
the dutch , unchanged from the side that hammered italy 3-0 in their opening match , began superbly and kuyt put them in front in the ninth minute , beating florent malouda to head home from a corner . kuyt almost made it 2-0 with a chance soon after , but france came back into the match and sydney govou , preferred to nicolas anelka , had a couple of chances , only to be denied by goalkeeper edwin van der sar .
france came out firing after half-time and henry , who was restored to the starting line-up after injury , lobbed a volley just over the bar .
fine piece of coaching bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : van persie quickly showed the wisdom of the dutch coach 's decision but it was dutch coach marco van basten 's substitutions that proved decisive .
he replaced holding midfielder orlando engelaar at half-time for the speed and attacking thrust of robben , and after 10 minutes striker robin van persie came on for kuyt .
" it gave us greater possibilities to go deeper and give us more space to attack again .
these players are quick and technically good and so we were more dangerous in the second half even though france were creating more pressure , " van basten said . " i have to compliment the defense because there was a lot of pressure and in the end we made some good goals with some good counter-attacks which has made us all very happy . "
the second dutch goal was brilliantly executed , with van nistelrooy near the halfway line cleverly feeding the ball through to substitute robben , who sped down the wing and crossed for van persie to volley home off the hand of gregory coupet .
france continued to press , though , and with 19 minutes to go , willy sagnol broke down the right , fed the ball low into the box and henry scored with a neat left-foot finish .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : thierry henry was fighting a losing battle despite pulling one back for france but france were then undone by a moment of brilliance from robben , who , having broken down the left again but with seemingly nowhere to go , fired a shot high past coupet to make it 3-1 .
robben and van nistelrooy both went close to increasing their lead late on , while patrice evra fired a shot wide for france and franck ribery lifted a free kick just over .
sneijder then completed the victory with a brilliant turn and shot from outside the area to send the dutch fans wild .
it was another outstanding display by the real madrid midfielder , who picked up the man-of-the-match award as he did against italy .
dutch wo n't put their feet up bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : it was n't just the dutch squad that put on a colorful performance the result leaves the netherlands able to take it easy in the last game against romania , but van basten dismissed any idea of allowing romania to win to eliminate two tough rivals in france and italy .
van basten said he had not considered whether he would be playing reserves for the romania game .
" we will start thinking about that game tomorrow but we will prepare for it seriously , " he said .
meanwhile france coach raymond domenech put a brave face on the defeat , knowing his side 's fate is no longer in his hands .
" we tried to play and win but there were some unfortunate moments .
there were moments in which we set ourselves up to be successful but we had a lot of bad luck , " he said . dpa news agency -lrb- jg -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

the blues still have to secure a win after two games . the dutch team made a strong showing from the start with dirk kuyt and substitute robin van persie putting holland 2-0 up after an hour .
thierry henry managed to pull one back for france -lrb- 71st minute -rrb- , but another substitute , arjen robben , scored 30 seconds later and wesley sneijder completed the win in injury time with a superb strike .
world cup runners-up france will face world cup winners italy , who also have one point from two matches , in their final group c match on tuesday .
but both sides , who have put on rather less glorious performances in this championship , will be out if romania beat the netherlands on the same day .
dutch surprise themselves bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : netherlands ' dirk kuyt kicked off the series " we 're still trying to get our heads around this , " the netherlands ' former manchester united striker ruud van nistelrooy said .
" we could n't have expected this , we did n't have the best of form in the qualifying or coming in , but now it seems it is all falling into place .
now i think the confidence is there and it 's lifting the team , " he added .
the dutch , unchanged from the side that hammered italy 3-0 in their opening match , began superbly and kuyt put them in front in the ninth minute , beating florent malouda to head home from a corner . kuyt almost made it 2-0 with a chance soon after , but france came back into the match and sydney govou , preferred to nicolas anelka , had a couple of chances , only to be denied by goalkeeper edwin van der sar .
france came out firing after half-time and henry , who was restored to the starting line-up after injury , lobbed a volley just over the bar .
fine piece of coaching bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : van persie quickly showed the wisdom of the dutch coach 's decision but it was dutch coach marco van basten 's substitutions that proved decisive .
he replaced holding midfielder orlando engelaar at half-time for the speed and attacking thrust of robben , and after 10 minutes striker robin van persie came on for kuyt .
" it gave us greater possibilities to go deeper and give us more space to attack again .
these players are quick and technically good and so we were more dangerous in the second half even though france were creating more pressure , " van basten said . " i have to compliment the defense because there was a lot of pressure and in the end we made some good goals with some good counter-attacks which has made us all very happy . "
the second dutch goal was brilliantly executed , with van nistelrooy near the halfway line cleverly feeding the ball through to substitute robben , who sped down the wing and crossed for van persie to volley home off the hand of gregory coupet .
france continued to press , though , and with 19 minutes to go , willy sagnol broke down the right , fed the ball low into the box and henry scored with a neat left-foot finish .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : thierry henry was fighting a losing battle despite pulling one back for france but france were then undone by a moment of brilliance from robben , who , having broken down the left again but with seemingly nowhere to go , fired a shot high past coupet to make it 3-1 .
robben and van nistelrooy both went close to increasing their lead late on , while patrice evra fired a shot wide for france and franck ribery lifted a free kick just over .
sneijder then completed the victory with a brilliant turn and shot from outside the area to send the dutch fans wild .
it was another outstanding display by the real madrid midfielder , who picked up the man-of-the-match award as he did against italy .
dutch wo n't put their feet up bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : it was n't just the dutch squad that put on a colorful performance the result leaves the netherlands able to take it easy in the last game against romania , but van basten dismissed any idea of allowing romania to win to eliminate two tough rivals in france and italy .
van basten said he had not considered whether he would be playing reserves for the romania game .
" we will start thinking about that game tomorrow but we will prepare for it seriously , " he said .
meanwhile france coach raymond domenech put a brave face on the defeat , knowing his side 's fate is no longer in his hands .
" we tried to play and win but there were some unfortunate moments .
there were moments in which we set ourselves up to be successful but we had a lot of bad luck , " he said . dpa news agency -lrb- jg -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

dw-world.de answers some of the most pertinent questions . what is the treaty of lisbon ?
after the failure of its forerunner , the european constitution , which was rejected in 2005 by voters in france and the netherlands , the treaty of lisbon , also called the european reform treaty , was conceived as an alternative series of amendments to two existing eu treaties , the treaty on the european union -lrb- maastricht -rrb- and the treaty establishing the european community -lrb- rome -rrb- . the treaty of lisbon , which was approved by eu leaders at an eu summit in the portuguese capital in december 2007 , is a blueprint for running the 27-member european union more efficiently .
it must be ratified by each of the bloc 's members .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : european leaders agreed on the lisbon treaty in december 2007 what would the treaty of lisbon do ?
the document is meant to change the eu in the following ways : § it creates the role of european president this is one of the most controversial proposals as the idea was initially opposed by smaller eu nations but was forced through by the larger member states .
the president would serve a two-and-a-half-year term , replacing the current system of a rotating six-month presidency , and will not be allowed to serve more than two terms . § it creates the role of an eu high representative for foreign affairs and security policy essentially the eu 's foreign minister , this role combines the posts of current foreign affairs chief javier solana and external affairs commissioner benita ferrero-waldner and will be the bloc 's point person for world affairs . § it reduces the size of the eu 's executive body , the european commission the eu commission would be reduced so that there will be fewer commissioners than member states by 2014 , with only two-thirds of countries supplying a commissioner on a rotational basis .
currently each member state has a commissioner . § it redistributes voting weights among member states the treaty intends to introduce majority voting , which will allow votes to be carried on a 55-percent majority as long as that majority also represent 65 percent of the european population .
this would be phased in between 2014 and 2017 . § it gives new powers to the european commission , european parliament and european court of justice , in areas such as justice and domestic affairs § it removes members ' rights to veto legislation in a number of areas have all eu members ratified the treaty ?
not yet .
every country except ireland left ratification of the treaty to their parliaments .
the irish rejected it in a first referendum in 2008 , but voted " yes " the second time around , in early october 2009 .
poland and the czech republic are the final holdouts . poland 's president lech kaczynski is expected to sign the treaty soon , thus completing polish ratification . # b # in prague , both the lower and upper houses of parliament have already approved the treaty , but czech president vaclav klaus , one of europe 's most vocal opponent 's of the legislation , has yet to sign it .

-lrb- 14.06.2008 -rrb- european parliament ratifies lisbon treaty despite protests the european parliament on wednesday voted overwhelmingly in favor of the lisbon treaty , which reforms the european union 's institutions .

french president nicolas sarkozy has called ireland 's " no " to the eu 's lisbon treaty a call to change the way europe was being constructed .
but he has also urged other states to continue the ratification process . french president nicolas sarkozy has called ireland 's " no " to the eu 's lisbon treaty a call to change the way europe was being constructed .
but he has also urged other states to continue the ratification process .
" many europeans do not understand how we are constructing europe .
we must therefore change the way we do it , " sarkozy told journalists in paris after meeting us president george w bush .
the irish rejection of the treaty was " an appeal to do more , to do it better , " he said .
non , mais oui bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : nicolas sarkozy made his comments after meeting the us president but sarkozy , whose country is taking over the rotating presidency in july , stressed that no one had the right to sabotage the european project .
one of the treaty 's aims is to streamline decision-making processes in the enlarged and more unwieldy 27-member bloc .
he also admitted saturday , june 14 , that the no-vote would " not simplify the task of the french -lrb- eu -rrb- presidency . "
and sarkozy reiterated his call to other countries to continue ratifying the treaty in order to stop the " irish incident becoming a crisis . "
sarkozy and german chancellor angela merkel had already issued a joint statement on friday to this end .
meanwhile , the irish state minister responsible for integration , conor lenihan , said it was unlikely that the country would stage another referendum on the european union reform treaty in the wake of its rejection by voters this week .
on the morning news show of the national broadcaster rte , lenihan said he could not rule out the possibility of a new vote , but he then cautioned there was a risk of even more damage being done if the treaty is put up for a second vote .
if at first you do n't succeed bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : irish prime minister has not ruled out a second vote lenihan warned that ireland is now " extremely isolated " in europe as the only eu member to has rejected the treaty .
his comments came as irish politicians - both those who favored and opposed the treaty - took stock of the referendum result in which the treaty was rejected by a margin of 110,000 votes .
declan ganley , president of the libertas group that led the " no " campaign , said he was horrified that the possibility of another referendum was even being raised .
on friday evening , irish prime minister brian cowen said the government accepted and respected the verdict of voters , but he declined to rule out the possibility of another vote .
cowen will be meeting his colleagues at the eu summit in brussels next week as european leaders ponder what to do next in the wake of the irish voters ' rejection of the treaty .
adapting the eu the lisbon treaty is designed to replace the failed treaty of nice , which ireland only approved in 2002 after it was put to the people for a second time following a no-vote a year earlier .
the nice treaty was subsequently torpedoed by france and the netherlands . like the rejected constitution , the lisbon treaty proposes a european foreign policy supremo and a permanent president to replace the six-month rotation system .
aimed at preventing decision-making gridlock in the expanding organization , the charter cuts the size of the european parliament and the number of eu decisions which require unanimous support , thus reducing national vetoes .
it also includes a european charter of fundamental human and legal rights , which britain and poland have refused to make binding .

the blues still have to secure a win after two games . the dutch team made a strong showing from the start with dirk kuyt and substitute robin van persie putting holland 2-0 up after an hour .
thierry henry managed to pull one back for france -lrb- 71st minute -rrb- , but another substitute , arjen robben , scored 30 seconds later and wesley sneijder completed the win in injury time with a superb strike .
world cup runners-up france will face world cup winners italy , who also have one point from two matches , in their final group c match on tuesday .
but both sides , who have put on rather less glorious performances in this championship , will be out if romania beat the netherlands on the same day .
dutch surprise themselves bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : netherlands ' dirk kuyt kicked off the series " we 're still trying to get our heads around this , " the netherlands ' former manchester united striker ruud van nistelrooy said .
" we could n't have expected this , we did n't have the best of form in the qualifying or coming in , but now it seems it is all falling into place .
now i think the confidence is there and it 's lifting the team , " he added .
the dutch , unchanged from the side that hammered italy 3-0 in their opening match , began superbly and kuyt put them in front in the ninth minute , beating florent malouda to head home from a corner . kuyt almost made it 2-0 with a chance soon after , but france came back into the match and sydney govou , preferred to nicolas anelka , had a couple of chances , only to be denied by goalkeeper edwin van der sar .
france came out firing after half-time and henry , who was restored to the starting line-up after injury , lobbed a volley just over the bar .
fine piece of coaching bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : van persie quickly showed the wisdom of the dutch coach 's decision but it was dutch coach marco van basten 's substitutions that proved decisive .
he replaced holding midfielder orlando engelaar at half-time for the speed and attacking thrust of robben , and after 10 minutes striker robin van persie came on for kuyt .
" it gave us greater possibilities to go deeper and give us more space to attack again .
these players are quick and technically good and so we were more dangerous in the second half even though france were creating more pressure , " van basten said . " i have to compliment the defense because there was a lot of pressure and in the end we made some good goals with some good counter-attacks which has made us all very happy . "
the second dutch goal was brilliantly executed , with van nistelrooy near the halfway line cleverly feeding the ball through to substitute robben , who sped down the wing and crossed for van persie to volley home off the hand of gregory coupet .
france continued to press , though , and with 19 minutes to go , willy sagnol broke down the right , fed the ball low into the box and henry scored with a neat left-foot finish .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : thierry henry was fighting a losing battle despite pulling one back for france but france were then undone by a moment of brilliance from robben , who , having broken down the left again but with seemingly nowhere to go , fired a shot high past coupet to make it 3-1 .
robben and van nistelrooy both went close to increasing their lead late on , while patrice evra fired a shot wide for france and franck ribery lifted a free kick just over .
sneijder then completed the victory with a brilliant turn and shot from outside the area to send the dutch fans wild .
it was another outstanding display by the real madrid midfielder , who picked up the man-of-the-match award as he did against italy .
dutch wo n't put their feet up bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : it was n't just the dutch squad that put on a colorful performance the result leaves the netherlands able to take it easy in the last game against romania , but van basten dismissed any idea of allowing romania to win to eliminate two tough rivals in france and italy .
van basten said he had not considered whether he would be playing reserves for the romania game .
" we will start thinking about that game tomorrow but we will prepare for it seriously , " he said .
meanwhile france coach raymond domenech put a brave face on the defeat , knowing his side 's fate is no longer in his hands .
" we tried to play and win but there were some unfortunate moments .
there were moments in which we set ourselves up to be successful but we had a lot of bad luck , " he said . dpa news agency -lrb- jg -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

the second dutch goal was brilliantly executed , with van nistelrooy near the halfway line cleverly feeding the ball through to substitute robben , who sped down the wing and crossed for van persie to volley home off the hand of gregory coupet .

dw-world.de answers some of the most pertinent questions . what is the treaty of lisbon ?
after the failure of its forerunner , the european constitution , which was rejected in 2005 by voters in france and the netherlands , the treaty of lisbon , also called the european reform treaty , was conceived as an alternative series of amendments to two existing eu treaties , the treaty on the european union -lrb- maastricht -rrb- and the treaty establishing the european community -lrb- rome -rrb- . the treaty of lisbon , which was approved by eu leaders at an eu summit in the portuguese capital in december 2007 , is a blueprint for running the 27-member european union more efficiently .
it must be ratified by each of the bloc 's members .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : european leaders agreed on the lisbon treaty in december 2007 what would the treaty of lisbon do ?
the document is meant to change the eu in the following ways : § it creates the role of european president this is one of the most controversial proposals as the idea was initially opposed by smaller eu nations but was forced through by the larger member states .
the president would serve a two-and-a-half-year term , replacing the current system of a rotating six-month presidency , and will not be allowed to serve more than two terms . § it creates the role of an eu high representative for foreign affairs and security policy essentially the eu 's foreign minister , this role combines the posts of current foreign affairs chief javier solana and external affairs commissioner benita ferrero-waldner and will be the bloc 's point person for world affairs . § it reduces the size of the eu 's executive body , the european commission the eu commission would be reduced so that there will be fewer commissioners than member states by 2014 , with only two-thirds of countries supplying a commissioner on a rotational basis .
currently each member state has a commissioner . § it redistributes voting weights among member states the treaty intends to introduce majority voting , which will allow votes to be carried on a 55-percent majority as long as that majority also represent 65 percent of the european population .
this would be phased in between 2014 and 2017 . § it gives new powers to the european commission , european parliament and european court of justice , in areas such as justice and domestic affairs § it removes members ' rights to veto legislation in a number of areas have all eu members ratified the treaty ?
not yet .
every country except ireland left ratification of the treaty to their parliaments .
the irish rejected it in a first referendum in 2008 , but voted " yes " the second time around , in early october 2009 .
poland and the czech republic are the final holdouts . poland 's president lech kaczynski is expected to sign the treaty soon , thus completing polish ratification . # b # in prague , both the lower and upper houses of parliament have already approved the treaty , but czech president vaclav klaus , one of europe 's most vocal opponent 's of the legislation , has yet to sign it .

french president nicolas sarkozy has called ireland 's " no " to the eu 's lisbon treaty a call to change the way europe was being constructed .
but he has also urged other states to continue the ratification process . french president nicolas sarkozy has called ireland 's " no " to the eu 's lisbon treaty a call to change the way europe was being constructed .
but he has also urged other states to continue the ratification process .
" many europeans do not understand how we are constructing europe .
we must therefore change the way we do it , " sarkozy told journalists in paris after meeting us president george w bush .
the irish rejection of the treaty was " an appeal to do more , to do it better , " he said .
non , mais oui bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : nicolas sarkozy made his comments after meeting the us president but sarkozy , whose country is taking over the rotating presidency in july , stressed that no one had the right to sabotage the european project .
one of the treaty 's aims is to streamline decision-making processes in the enlarged and more unwieldy 27-member bloc .
he also admitted saturday , june 14 , that the no-vote would " not simplify the task of the french -lrb- eu -rrb- presidency . "
and sarkozy reiterated his call to other countries to continue ratifying the treaty in order to stop the " irish incident becoming a crisis . "
sarkozy and german chancellor angela merkel had already issued a joint statement on friday to this end .
meanwhile , the irish state minister responsible for integration , conor lenihan , said it was unlikely that the country would stage another referendum on the european union reform treaty in the wake of its rejection by voters this week .
on the morning news show of the national broadcaster rte , lenihan said he could not rule out the possibility of a new vote , but he then cautioned there was a risk of even more damage being done if the treaty is put up for a second vote .
if at first you do n't succeed bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : irish prime minister has not ruled out a second vote lenihan warned that ireland is now " extremely isolated " in europe as the only eu member to has rejected the treaty .
his comments came as irish politicians - both those who favored and opposed the treaty - took stock of the referendum result in which the treaty was rejected by a margin of 110,000 votes .
declan ganley , president of the libertas group that led the " no " campaign , said he was horrified that the possibility of another referendum was even being raised .
on friday evening , irish prime minister brian cowen said the government accepted and respected the verdict of voters , but he declined to rule out the possibility of another vote .
cowen will be meeting his colleagues at the eu summit in brussels next week as european leaders ponder what to do next in the wake of the irish voters ' rejection of the treaty .
adapting the eu the lisbon treaty is designed to replace the failed treaty of nice , which ireland only approved in 2002 after it was put to the people for a second time following a no-vote a year earlier .
the nice treaty was subsequently torpedoed by france and the netherlands . like the rejected constitution , the lisbon treaty proposes a european foreign policy supremo and a permanent president to replace the six-month rotation system .
aimed at preventing decision-making gridlock in the expanding organization , the charter cuts the size of the european parliament and the number of eu decisions which require unanimous support , thus reducing national vetoes .
it also includes a european charter of fundamental human and legal rights , which britain and poland have refused to make binding .
however it drops all references to an eu flag or anthem which had fanned euroskeptic fears of another step towards a federal europe , and no longer cites unbridled competition as a goal for the bloc . dw staff -lrb- jg -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

ethnic minorities will be included , said muge gursoy sokmen , co-chair of the organizing committee .
she added that kurdish authors lal lales and seyhmus diken , armenian writers migirdic margosyan and jaklin celik , and jewish writer mario levi would be making appearances in person .

" we see this as a very rich resource . "
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : pamuk has often been the subject of controversy the cultural ferment in turkey , in which intellectuals argue about whether and how political islam can be reconciled with modernity , is not just a literary topic , but has also become politicized , with secular turkish judges now mulling a ban on the country 's ruling akp party , which has islamic roots .
germany is home to the largest turkish community outside of turkey .
" guest workers , " who have migrated since the 1960s , and their descendents make up the country 's largest ethnic minority .
" at least 2.5 million people here are of turkish origin and there is a rich german turkish literature .
that 's one reason turkey feels very close to us , as if it were a next-door neighbor , " said juergen boos , the book fair chief executive .
nobel-prize winner pamuk to open fair orhan pamuk , the nobel literature prize winner in 2006 , will open the fair with turkish president abdullah gul . the best-selling author was the subject of international controversy when he was charged with making statements that violated an article in turkey 's penal code for " insulting turkishness , " though he was never prosecuted .
in addition to authors , hundreds of performers and artists will round out the offerings at the frankfurt fair .
ahmet ari , the coordinator of the turkish presentation , said the fair would focus not only on the riches of turkish literature awaiting translation into other languages , but also provide a forum for discussing politically controversial topics in a nation going through rapid change .
restrictions on minorities eased bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the turkish-kurdish minority has long been culturally repressed he said that turkey had greatly improved its democratic record in recent years , and there was no longer a single author in jail on account of his political views .
turkish state television had also started its first non-turkish-language broadcasts only a few days ago , he added .
ari was referring to turkey 's decades-old policy of repressing minority languages and cultures .
prime minister recep tayyip erdogan 's center-right akp party has eased many restrictions , with an eye to the eventual possibility of joining the european union .
turkey has 1,724 publishing houses with annual sales of $ 810 million -lrb- 516 million euros -rrb- .

french president nicolas sarkozy has called ireland 's " no " to the eu 's lisbon treaty a call to change the way europe was being constructed .
but he has also urged other states to continue the ratification process . french president nicolas sarkozy has called ireland 's " no " to the eu 's lisbon treaty a call to change the way europe was being constructed .
but he has also urged other states to continue the ratification process .
" many europeans do not understand how we are constructing europe .
we must therefore change the way we do it , " sarkozy told journalists in paris after meeting us president george w bush .
the irish rejection of the treaty was " an appeal to do more , to do it better , " he said .
non , mais oui bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : nicolas sarkozy made his comments after meeting the us president but sarkozy , whose country is taking over the rotating presidency in july , stressed that no one had the right to sabotage the european project .
one of the treaty 's aims is to streamline decision-making processes in the enlarged and more unwieldy 27-member bloc .
he also admitted saturday , june 14 , that the no-vote would " not simplify the task of the french -lrb- eu -rrb- presidency . "
and sarkozy reiterated his call to other countries to continue ratifying the treaty in order to stop the " irish incident becoming a crisis . "
sarkozy and german chancellor angela merkel had already issued a joint statement on friday to this end .
meanwhile , the irish state minister responsible for integration , conor lenihan , said it was unlikely that the country would stage another referendum on the european union reform treaty in the wake of its rejection by voters this week .
on the morning news show of the national broadcaster rte , lenihan said he could not rule out the possibility of a new vote , but he then cautioned there was a risk of even more damage being done if the treaty is put up for a second vote .
if at first you do n't succeed bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : irish prime minister has not ruled out a second vote lenihan warned that ireland is now " extremely isolated " in europe as the only eu member to has rejected the treaty .
his comments came as irish politicians - both those who favored and opposed the treaty - took stock of the referendum result in which the treaty was rejected by a margin of 110,000 votes .
declan ganley , president of the libertas group that led the " no " campaign , said he was horrified that the possibility of another referendum was even being raised .
on friday evening , irish prime minister brian cowen said the government accepted and respected the verdict of voters , but he declined to rule out the possibility of another vote .
cowen will be meeting his colleagues at the eu summit in brussels next week as european leaders ponder what to do next in the wake of the irish voters ' rejection of the treaty .
adapting the eu the lisbon treaty is designed to replace the failed treaty of nice , which ireland only approved in 2002 after it was put to the people for a second time following a no-vote a year earlier .
the nice treaty was subsequently torpedoed by france and the netherlands . like the rejected constitution , the lisbon treaty proposes a european foreign policy supremo and a permanent president to replace the six-month rotation system .
aimed at preventing decision-making gridlock in the expanding organization , the charter cuts the size of the european parliament and the number of eu decisions which require unanimous support , thus reducing national vetoes .
it also includes a european charter of fundamental human and legal rights , which britain and poland have refused to make binding .
however it drops all references to an eu flag or anthem which had fanned euroskeptic fears of another step towards a federal europe , and no longer cites unbridled competition as a goal for the bloc . dw staff -lrb- jg -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

besides books , the publishing trade 's top annual event will provide a forum for political discussion on a country undergoing rapid change . turkey promised this week to showcase its cultural diversity at the annual frankfurt book fair in october , where its literature will have guest-of-honor status this year .
speaking from frankfurt , organizers said 350 authors and translators from turkey will be at the world 's principal book fair , presenting their work to publishers from around the globe .
ethnic minorities will be included , said muge gursoy sokmen , co-chair of the organizing committee .
she added that kurdish authors lal lales and seyhmus diken , armenian writers migirdic margosyan and jaklin celik , and jewish writer mario levi would be making appearances in person .
at the october 15-19 fair a special exhibition on turkish literature will also highlight the little-known " layers " that are woven in with turkic origins in the country 's culture today .
showcasing turkey 's cultural diversity " you 'll see how it includes arab or armenian or byzantine roots too , " she said .
" we have to treat the heritage of our cultural diversity with respect , " said sokmen , who is a leftist istanbul publisher .
" we see this as a very rich resource . "
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : pamuk has often been the subject of controversy the cultural ferment in turkey , in which intellectuals argue about whether and how political islam can be reconciled with modernity , is not just a literary topic , but has also become politicized , with secular turkish judges now mulling a ban on the country 's ruling akp party , which has islamic roots .
germany is home to the largest turkish community outside of turkey .
" guest workers , " who have migrated since the 1960s , and their descendents make up the country 's largest ethnic minority .
" at least 2.5 million people here are of turkish origin and there is a rich german turkish literature .
that 's one reason turkey feels very close to us , as if it were a next-door neighbor , " said juergen boos , the book fair chief executive .
nobel-prize winner pamuk to open fair orhan pamuk , the nobel literature prize winner in 2006 , will open the fair with turkish president abdullah gul . the best-selling author was the subject of international controversy when he was charged with making statements that violated an article in turkey 's penal code for " insulting turkishness , " though he was never prosecuted .
in addition to authors , hundreds of performers and artists will round out the offerings at the frankfurt fair .
ahmet ari , the coordinator of the turkish presentation , said the fair would focus not only on the riches of turkish literature awaiting translation into other languages , but also provide a forum for discussing politically controversial topics in a nation going through rapid change .
restrictions on minorities eased bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the turkish-kurdish minority has long been culturally repressed he said that turkey had greatly improved its democratic record in recent years , and there was no longer a single author in jail on account of his political views .
turkish state television had also started its first non-turkish-language broadcasts only a few days ago , he added .
ari was referring to turkey 's decades-old policy of repressing minority languages and cultures .
prime minister recep tayyip erdogan 's center-right akp party has eased many restrictions , with an eye to the eventual possibility of joining the european union .
turkey has 1,724 publishing houses with annual sales of $ 810 million -lrb- 516 million euros -rrb- .
the frankfurt book fair is a springboard in book publishing that helps boost exports and the translation of works into foreign languages .

" a draw would have been really unfair since we had the best chances and they just wanted to get a draw , " villa said . villa said that " having six points " was " much more important " than he being tournament top scorer . liverpool striker fernando torres had spain an early lead , only for zlatan ibrahimovic to equalize for sweden before half-time .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : ibrahimovic , center , scores an equalizer past spain 's iker casillas spain remain top of the group with six points from two games and will go through if greece fail to beat russia later in the evening .

xavi hernandez played a short corner for david villa , who laid the ball back for david silva .
silva 's center was volleyed in by the stretching torres , from just beyond the penalty spot . torres ' goal obliged sweden to react , and they did so manfully - to the delight of the noisy swedish fans in innsbruck .
two minutes later johan elmander wasted a good chance to equalize down the right .
thought they had a draw in the 24th minute carles puyol limped off with a pulled muscle in his right thigh .
the spanish defense was crippled , and sweden took advantage to make it 1-1 in the 34th minute . luis aragones ' defense made a mess of an elmander center from the right .
ibrahimovic held off sergio ramos and scored with a soft low shot , when iker casillas could only push into the net . sweden manager lars lagerback surprisingly pulled off ibrahimovic at the start of the second half , and spain took control with their slick passing game .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de intercultural dialogue -pipe- 14.06.2008 muslim kindergarten opens amid controversy großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the new kindergarten has to stick to the rules earlier this year , the opening of a kindergarten in an immigrant district of berlin was blocked on account of the founder ’ s alleged ties to a radical muslim group .
once he was replaced , the center got the green light . in february , an application for a muslim kindergarten landed on the desk of the education authority in the central berlin district of wedding , where almost 35 percent of the population has an immigrant background .
permission was refused on the grounds that sinan w. , the head of the " morgenland " -lrb- orient -rrb- association behind the project , was believed to have ties to the radical muslim group hizb-ut-tahrir , banned in germany since 2003 .
in 2004 he allegedly published texts on the internet containing incitement to hatred .
although sinan w. admitted links , he was also reported to have distanced himself from the group , saying that after studying islamic sources , he " realized that it tried to draw young people under its spell with emotional subjects and then exploited them for sinister ends . "
authorities stipulate certain conditions bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : wedding is home to a high percentage of immigrants on april 6 , the morgenland association elected another chairman , michael w. , a relative of sinan w. , and resubmitted its application .
this time , it was given the go-ahead .
" there was no reason to deny permission , " said bernhard kempf.from the education authority .
" all the formal criteria were met , including in terms of educational concept . "
this included the promotion of inter-religious dialogue , gender equality , and the learning of german .
the kindergarten subsequently opened in may with 45 children in its care , including turks , bosnians , arabs and lithuanians .
however , the authorities have laid down certain conditions .
any staff changes must be registered with the authorities , while the youth welfare office is allowed to inspect the kindergarten whenever it wishes without giving notice .
" we will be doing this , " said city councillor rainer maria fritsch in the daily tagesspiegel .
" if parents or staff report unusual activity at odds with the constitution , we can withdraw permission at any time . "
fulfilling a need " they can come whenever they like , " said sinan w. 's wife in the same newspaper , adding that the kindergarten had been her idea .
" we have nothing to hide , " she went on .
" i used to work at another kindergarten in the same district , and muslim mothers would often ask why there was no muslim childcare facility in the neighborhood .
they want their children to grow up with traditions , such as observing ramadan . "
now they can .
the new kindergarten observes muslim holidays and only serves halal food .
otherwise , little sets it apart from other kindergartens in the capital .
some have expressed skepticism others have their doubts , and believe that sinan w. 's resignation as chairman of morgenland was merely tactical .
" the abrupt change to the leadership of morgenland was a transparent maneuver geared to securing permission , " said christian democrat spokesperson frank henkel in welt online , adding that sinan w. most probably still pulls the strings .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the al-nur mosque meanwhile , local radio station info-radio reported that the kindergarten staff were recruited via an advert posted on the website of the al-nur mosque in the south of berlin , widely believed to be a meeting place for radicals .
further adverts appeared on muslim web sites , which , according to the federal office for the protection of the constitution , " directly and indirectly spread anti-zionist and anti-israeli propaganda . "
" we will be making sure that democratic standards are maintained , " insisted berhard kempf .
" if we allow them a place within our education system we can keep an eye on them .
it 's preferable to having extremists working undercover . " dw staff -lrb- jp -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

thierry henry managed to pull one back for france -lrb- 71st minute -rrb- , but another substitute , arjen robben , scored 30 seconds later and wesley sneijder completed the win in injury time with a superb strike .
world cup runners-up france will face world cup winners italy , who also have one point from two matches , in their final group c match on tuesday .
but both sides , who have put on rather less glorious performances in this championship , will be out if romania beat the netherlands on the same day .
dutch surprise themselves bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : netherlands ' dirk kuyt kicked off the series " we 're still trying to get our heads around this , " the netherlands ' former manchester united striker ruud van nistelrooy said .
" we could n't have expected this , we did n't have the best of form in the qualifying or coming in , but now it seems it is all falling into place .
now i think the confidence is there and it 's lifting the team , " he added .
the dutch , unchanged from the side that hammered italy 3-0 in their opening match , began superbly and kuyt put them in front in the ninth minute , beating florent malouda to head home from a corner . kuyt almost made it 2-0 with a chance soon after , but france came back into the match and sydney govou , preferred to nicolas anelka , had a couple of chances , only to be denied by goalkeeper edwin van der sar .
france came out firing after half-time and henry , who was restored to the starting line-up after injury , lobbed a volley just over the bar .
fine piece of coaching bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : van persie quickly showed the wisdom of the dutch coach 's decision but it was dutch coach marco van basten 's substitutions that proved decisive .
he replaced holding midfielder orlando engelaar at half-time for the speed and attacking thrust of robben , and after 10 minutes striker robin van persie came on for kuyt .
" it gave us greater possibilities to go deeper and give us more space to attack again .
these players are quick and technically good and so we were more dangerous in the second half even though france were creating more pressure , " van basten said . " i have to compliment the defense because there was a lot of pressure and in the end we made some good goals with some good counter-attacks which has made us all very happy . "
the second dutch goal was brilliantly executed , with van nistelrooy near the halfway line cleverly feeding the ball through to substitute robben , who sped down the wing and crossed for van persie to volley home off the hand of gregory coupet .
france continued to press , though , and with 19 minutes to go , willy sagnol broke down the right , fed the ball low into the box and henry scored with a neat left-foot finish .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : thierry henry was fighting a losing battle despite pulling one back for france but france were then undone by a moment of brilliance from robben , who , having broken down the left again but with seemingly nowhere to go , fired a shot high past coupet to make it 3-1 .
robben and van nistelrooy both went close to increasing their lead late on , while patrice evra fired a shot wide for france and franck ribery lifted a free kick just over .
sneijder then completed the victory with a brilliant turn and shot from outside the area to send the dutch fans wild .
it was another outstanding display by the real madrid midfielder , who picked up the man-of-the-match award as he did against italy .

van basten said he had not considered whether he would be playing reserves for the romania game .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de european union -pipe- 14.06.2008 the eu 's lisbon treaty : frequently asked questions großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : lisbon was meant to streamline the eu what is the treaty of lisbon and what is all the fuss about ?
dw-world.de answers some of the most pertinent questions . what is the treaty of lisbon ?
after the failure of its forerunner , the european constitution , which was rejected in 2005 by voters in france and the netherlands , the treaty of lisbon , also called the european reform treaty , was conceived as an alternative series of amendments to two existing eu treaties , the treaty on the european union -lrb- maastricht -rrb- and the treaty establishing the european community -lrb- rome -rrb- . the treaty of lisbon , which was approved by eu leaders at an eu summit in the portuguese capital in december 2007 , is a blueprint for running the 27-member european union more efficiently .
it must be ratified by each of the bloc 's members .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : european leaders agreed on the lisbon treaty in december 2007 what would the treaty of lisbon do ?
the document is meant to change the eu in the following ways : § it creates the role of european president this is one of the most controversial proposals as the idea was initially opposed by smaller eu nations but was forced through by the larger member states .
the president would serve a two-and-a-half-year term , replacing the current system of a rotating six-month presidency , and will not be allowed to serve more than two terms . § it creates the role of an eu high representative for foreign affairs and security policy essentially the eu 's foreign minister , this role combines the posts of current foreign affairs chief javier solana and external affairs commissioner benita ferrero-waldner and will be the bloc 's point person for world affairs . § it reduces the size of the eu 's executive body , the european commission the eu commission would be reduced so that there will be fewer commissioners than member states by 2014 , with only two-thirds of countries supplying a commissioner on a rotational basis .
currently each member state has a commissioner . § it redistributes voting weights among member states the treaty intends to introduce majority voting , which will allow votes to be carried on a 55-percent majority as long as that majority also represent 65 percent of the european population .
this would be phased in between 2014 and 2017 . § it gives new powers to the european commission , european parliament and european court of justice , in areas such as justice and domestic affairs § it removes members ' rights to veto legislation in a number of areas have all eu members ratified the treaty ?
not yet .
every country except ireland left ratification of the treaty to their parliaments .
the irish rejected it in a first referendum in 2008 , but voted " yes " the second time around , in early october 2009 .
poland and the czech republic are the final holdouts . poland 's president lech kaczynski is expected to sign the treaty soon , thus completing polish ratification . # b # in prague , both the lower and upper houses of parliament have already approved the treaty , but czech president vaclav klaus , one of europe 's most vocal opponent 's of the legislation , has yet to sign it .
a group of senators has moved to challenge the treaty in the constitutional court . ncy / sh editor : nancy isenson send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?
dw-world.de france sees irish no-vote as wake-up call french president nicolas sarkozy has called ireland 's " no " to the eu 's lisbon treaty a call to change the way europe was being constructed .
but he has also urged other states to continue the ratification process .
-lrb- 14.06.2008 -rrb- european parliament ratifies lisbon treaty despite protests the european parliament on wednesday voted overwhelmingly in favor of the lisbon treaty , which reforms the european union 's institutions .
there were , however , some protests from euroskeptics demanding referenda .
-lrb- 20.02.2008 -rrb- leaders commit to eu 's future by signing the lisbon treaty after a long and painstaking road , the eu has a new roadmap into the future .
but while the lisbon treaty hints at a future of cooperation , one absent leader reminded all that old habits die hard .

french president nicolas sarkozy has called ireland 's " no " to the eu 's lisbon treaty a call to change the way europe was being constructed .
but he has also urged other states to continue the ratification process . french president nicolas sarkozy has called ireland 's " no " to the eu 's lisbon treaty a call to change the way europe was being constructed .
but he has also urged other states to continue the ratification process .
" many europeans do not understand how we are constructing europe .
we must therefore change the way we do it , " sarkozy told journalists in paris after meeting us president george w bush .
the irish rejection of the treaty was " an appeal to do more , to do it better , " he said .
non , mais oui bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : nicolas sarkozy made his comments after meeting the us president but sarkozy , whose country is taking over the rotating presidency in july , stressed that no one had the right to sabotage the european project .
one of the treaty 's aims is to streamline decision-making processes in the enlarged and more unwieldy 27-member bloc .
he also admitted saturday , june 14 , that the no-vote would " not simplify the task of the french -lrb- eu -rrb- presidency . "
and sarkozy reiterated his call to other countries to continue ratifying the treaty in order to stop the " irish incident becoming a crisis . "
sarkozy and german chancellor angela merkel had already issued a joint statement on friday to this end .
meanwhile , the irish state minister responsible for integration , conor lenihan , said it was unlikely that the country would stage another referendum on the european union reform treaty in the wake of its rejection by voters this week .
on the morning news show of the national broadcaster rte , lenihan said he could not rule out the possibility of a new vote , but he then cautioned there was a risk of even more damage being done if the treaty is put up for a second vote .
if at first you do n't succeed bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : irish prime minister has not ruled out a second vote lenihan warned that ireland is now " extremely isolated " in europe as the only eu member to has rejected the treaty .
his comments came as irish politicians - both those who favored and opposed the treaty - took stock of the referendum result in which the treaty was rejected by a margin of 110,000 votes .
declan ganley , president of the libertas group that led the " no " campaign , said he was horrified that the possibility of another referendum was even being raised .
on friday evening , irish prime minister brian cowen said the government accepted and respected the verdict of voters , but he declined to rule out the possibility of another vote .
cowen will be meeting his colleagues at the eu summit in brussels next week as european leaders ponder what to do next in the wake of the irish voters ' rejection of the treaty .
adapting the eu the lisbon treaty is designed to replace the failed treaty of nice , which ireland only approved in 2002 after it was put to the people for a second time following a no-vote a year earlier .
the nice treaty was subsequently torpedoed by france and the netherlands . like the rejected constitution , the lisbon treaty proposes a european foreign policy supremo and a permanent president to replace the six-month rotation system .
aimed at preventing decision-making gridlock in the expanding organization , the charter cuts the size of the european parliament and the number of eu decisions which require unanimous support , thus reducing national vetoes .
it also includes a european charter of fundamental human and legal rights , which britain and poland have refused to make binding .
however it drops all references to an eu flag or anthem which had fanned euroskeptic fears of another step towards a federal europe , and no longer cites unbridled competition as a goal for the bloc . dw staff -lrb- jg -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

but feminists feel this was a mere political tactic to keep french women from voting en masse for his female opponent , socialist candidate segolene royal .
feminists feel sarkozy 's given the women 's rights issue very little attention since taking office just over a year ago .
one vocal sarkozy critic is emmanuelle piet , a doctor who has been involved in promoting the campaign against domestic violence for the past quarter century .
piet currently serves as president of an aid organization for battered women .
" sarkozy has already been in office for a year and he has caused problems from the beginning on , " she said .
" when he formed his government , he did not establish any ministry to deal with issues of women 's rights or equality . ”
sarkozy accused of lack of interest bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : sarkozy did n't want to lose women 's votes to royal in 1981 , francois mitterrand launched a ministry for women 's rights , which put france at the forefront in europe on the issue .
since then , each government has included women 's rights and equality as part of its portfolio , or at least assigned a secretary of state to the issue .
when sarkozy took the helm in may 2007 , he added female politicians to his team , but not nearly as many as he promised during the elections .
yet his government is proud that top posts have been filled by women including that of finance minister christine lagarde , interior minister michele alliot-marie and justice minister rachida dati .
for piet , having women as ministers does n't make up for the lack of a women 's ministry .
she also has been worried by reports that the state office for women 's rights might be closed .
the office ensures that women have access to abortions and deals with other privacy issues .
" in short , one notices a big disinterest in respect to the government 's involvement in women 's rights , ” she said .
little help for trafficking victims bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : sarkozy has been accused of insensitivity to victims of human trafficking this opinion is backed up by francoise laurant , president of the family planning organization mfpf .
during the run-up to the elections , the group requested meetings with all of the major mainstream candidates .
sarkozy was the only one who did not reply , said laurant .
“ that was the first alarm signal for us , ” she said .
yet there were signals that sarkozy would take a more conservative line on issues such as prostitution .
as interior minister , he helped usher through a series of laws in 2003 which went after prostitutes who engaged in so-called “ passive solicitation . ”
while the term 's meaning is not completely clear , it has amounted to a declaration of war on foreign prostitutes .
the majority of these women are victims of illegal human trafficking networks .
in order to be eligible for help from the french government , they have to be willing to turn in their tormenters , people often involved in criminal networks .
if they are unwilling to do so , they face deportation .
this practice of deporting prostitutes has been strongly criticized by the united nations organization which is trying to put an end to human trafficking .
feminists decry " victimization " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : sarkozy has seemed distracted by his love life the president has been active in providing more state help to victims of domestic violence .
while sarkozy has taken on this issue as one that is close to his heart , laurant from the mfpf remains skeptical .

once he was replaced , the center got the green light . in february , an application for a muslim kindergarten landed on the desk of the education authority in the central berlin district of wedding , where almost 35 percent of the population has an immigrant background .
permission was refused on the grounds that sinan w. , the head of the " morgenland " -lrb- orient -rrb- association behind the project , was believed to have ties to the radical muslim group hizb-ut-tahrir , banned in germany since 2003 .
in 2004 he allegedly published texts on the internet containing incitement to hatred .
although sinan w. admitted links , he was also reported to have distanced himself from the group , saying that after studying islamic sources , he " realized that it tried to draw young people under its spell with emotional subjects and then exploited them for sinister ends . "
authorities stipulate certain conditions bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : wedding is home to a high percentage of immigrants on april 6 , the morgenland association elected another chairman , michael w. , a relative of sinan w. , and resubmitted its application .
this time , it was given the go-ahead .
" there was no reason to deny permission , " said bernhard kempf.from the education authority .
" all the formal criteria were met , including in terms of educational concept . "
this included the promotion of inter-religious dialogue , gender equality , and the learning of german .
the kindergarten subsequently opened in may with 45 children in its care , including turks , bosnians , arabs and lithuanians .
however , the authorities have laid down certain conditions .
any staff changes must be registered with the authorities , while the youth welfare office is allowed to inspect the kindergarten whenever it wishes without giving notice .
" we will be doing this , " said city councillor rainer maria fritsch in the daily tagesspiegel .
" if parents or staff report unusual activity at odds with the constitution , we can withdraw permission at any time . "
fulfilling a need " they can come whenever they like , " said sinan w. 's wife in the same newspaper , adding that the kindergarten had been her idea .
" we have nothing to hide , " she went on .
" i used to work at another kindergarten in the same district , and muslim mothers would often ask why there was no muslim childcare facility in the neighborhood .
they want their children to grow up with traditions , such as observing ramadan . "
now they can .
the new kindergarten observes muslim holidays and only serves halal food .
otherwise , little sets it apart from other kindergartens in the capital .
some have expressed skepticism others have their doubts , and believe that sinan w. 's resignation as chairman of morgenland was merely tactical .
" the abrupt change to the leadership of morgenland was a transparent maneuver geared to securing permission , " said christian democrat spokesperson frank henkel in welt online , adding that sinan w. most probably still pulls the strings .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the al-nur mosque meanwhile , local radio station info-radio reported that the kindergarten staff were recruited via an advert posted on the website of the al-nur mosque in the south of berlin , widely believed to be a meeting place for radicals .
further adverts appeared on muslim web sites , which , according to the federal office for the protection of the constitution , " directly and indirectly spread anti-zionist and anti-israeli propaganda . "
" we will be making sure that democratic standards are maintained , " insisted berhard kempf .

french president nicolas sarkozy has called ireland 's " no " to the eu 's lisbon treaty a call to change the way europe was being constructed .
but he has also urged other states to continue the ratification process . french president nicolas sarkozy has called ireland 's " no " to the eu 's lisbon treaty a call to change the way europe was being constructed .
but he has also urged other states to continue the ratification process .
" many europeans do not understand how we are constructing europe .
we must therefore change the way we do it , " sarkozy told journalists in paris after meeting us president george w bush .
the irish rejection of the treaty was " an appeal to do more , to do it better , " he said .
non , mais oui bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : nicolas sarkozy made his comments after meeting the us president but sarkozy , whose country is taking over the rotating presidency in july , stressed that no one had the right to sabotage the european project .
one of the treaty 's aims is to streamline decision-making processes in the enlarged and more unwieldy 27-member bloc .
he also admitted saturday , june 14 , that the no-vote would " not simplify the task of the french -lrb- eu -rrb- presidency . "
and sarkozy reiterated his call to other countries to continue ratifying the treaty in order to stop the " irish incident becoming a crisis . "
sarkozy and german chancellor angela merkel had already issued a joint statement on friday to this end .
meanwhile , the irish state minister responsible for integration , conor lenihan , said it was unlikely that the country would stage another referendum on the european union reform treaty in the wake of its rejection by voters this week .
on the morning news show of the national broadcaster rte , lenihan said he could not rule out the possibility of a new vote , but he then cautioned there was a risk of even more damage being done if the treaty is put up for a second vote .
if at first you do n't succeed bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : irish prime minister has not ruled out a second vote lenihan warned that ireland is now " extremely isolated " in europe as the only eu member to has rejected the treaty .
his comments came as irish politicians - both those who favored and opposed the treaty - took stock of the referendum result in which the treaty was rejected by a margin of 110,000 votes .
declan ganley , president of the libertas group that led the " no " campaign , said he was horrified that the possibility of another referendum was even being raised .
on friday evening , irish prime minister brian cowen said the government accepted and respected the verdict of voters , but he declined to rule out the possibility of another vote .
cowen will be meeting his colleagues at the eu summit in brussels next week as european leaders ponder what to do next in the wake of the irish voters ' rejection of the treaty .
adapting the eu the lisbon treaty is designed to replace the failed treaty of nice , which ireland only approved in 2002 after it was put to the people for a second time following a no-vote a year earlier .
the nice treaty was subsequently torpedoed by france and the netherlands . like the rejected constitution , the lisbon treaty proposes a european foreign policy supremo and a permanent president to replace the six-month rotation system .
aimed at preventing decision-making gridlock in the expanding organization , the charter cuts the size of the european parliament and the number of eu decisions which require unanimous support , thus reducing national vetoes .
it also includes a european charter of fundamental human and legal rights , which britain and poland have refused to make binding .
however it drops all references to an eu flag or anthem which had fanned euroskeptic fears of another step towards a federal europe , and no longer cites unbridled competition as a goal for the bloc . dw staff -lrb- jg -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

but feminists feel this was a mere political tactic to keep french women from voting en masse for his female opponent , socialist candidate segolene royal .
feminists feel sarkozy 's given the women 's rights issue very little attention since taking office just over a year ago .
one vocal sarkozy critic is emmanuelle piet , a doctor who has been involved in promoting the campaign against domestic violence for the past quarter century .
piet currently serves as president of an aid organization for battered women .
" sarkozy has already been in office for a year and he has caused problems from the beginning on , " she said .
" when he formed his government , he did not establish any ministry to deal with issues of women 's rights or equality . ”
sarkozy accused of lack of interest bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : sarkozy did n't want to lose women 's votes to royal in 1981 , francois mitterrand launched a ministry for women 's rights , which put france at the forefront in europe on the issue .
since then , each government has included women 's rights and equality as part of its portfolio , or at least assigned a secretary of state to the issue .
when sarkozy took the helm in may 2007 , he added female politicians to his team , but not nearly as many as he promised during the elections .
yet his government is proud that top posts have been filled by women including that of finance minister christine lagarde , interior minister michele alliot-marie and justice minister rachida dati .
for piet , having women as ministers does n't make up for the lack of a women 's ministry .
she also has been worried by reports that the state office for women 's rights might be closed .
the office ensures that women have access to abortions and deals with other privacy issues .
" in short , one notices a big disinterest in respect to the government 's involvement in women 's rights , ” she said .
little help for trafficking victims bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : sarkozy has been accused of insensitivity to victims of human trafficking this opinion is backed up by francoise laurant , president of the family planning organization mfpf .
during the run-up to the elections , the group requested meetings with all of the major mainstream candidates .
sarkozy was the only one who did not reply , said laurant .
“ that was the first alarm signal for us , ” she said .
yet there were signals that sarkozy would take a more conservative line on issues such as prostitution .
as interior minister , he helped usher through a series of laws in 2003 which went after prostitutes who engaged in so-called “ passive solicitation . ”
while the term 's meaning is not completely clear , it has amounted to a declaration of war on foreign prostitutes .
the majority of these women are victims of illegal human trafficking networks .
in order to be eligible for help from the french government , they have to be willing to turn in their tormenters , people often involved in criminal networks .
if they are unwilling to do so , they face deportation .
this practice of deporting prostitutes has been strongly criticized by the united nations organization which is trying to put an end to human trafficking .
feminists decry " victimization " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : sarkozy has seemed distracted by his love life the president has been active in providing more state help to victims of domestic violence .
while sarkozy has taken on this issue as one that is close to his heart , laurant from the mfpf remains skeptical .
“ in sarkozy 's speeches are always only about victims and that they need to be defended .
for feminists , that makes our blood run cold , ” laurant said . dw staff -lrb- th -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de women -pipe- 14.06.2008 french feminists unhappy with sarkozy großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : sarkozy has given women top jobs in his cabinet french president nicolas sarkozy courted female voters during the run-up to the last elections , but since he took office , women ’ s rights has taken a back seat to other issues , feminists say . french president nicolas sarkozy courted female voters during the run-up to the last elections , saying that france should take the lead in pushing for women 's rights .
but feminists feel this was a mere political tactic to keep french women from voting en masse for his female opponent , socialist candidate segolene royal .
feminists feel sarkozy 's given the women 's rights issue very little attention since taking office just over a year ago .
one vocal sarkozy critic is emmanuelle piet , a doctor who has been involved in promoting the campaign against domestic violence for the past quarter century .
piet currently serves as president of an aid organization for battered women .
" sarkozy has already been in office for a year and he has caused problems from the beginning on , " she said .
" when he formed his government , he did not establish any ministry to deal with issues of women 's rights or equality . ”
sarkozy accused of lack of interest bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : sarkozy did n't want to lose women 's votes to royal in 1981 , francois mitterrand launched a ministry for women 's rights , which put france at the forefront in europe on the issue .
since then , each government has included women 's rights and equality as part of its portfolio , or at least assigned a secretary of state to the issue .
when sarkozy took the helm in may 2007 , he added female politicians to his team , but not nearly as many as he promised during the elections .
yet his government is proud that top posts have been filled by women including that of finance minister christine lagarde , interior minister michele alliot-marie and justice minister rachida dati .
for piet , having women as ministers does n't make up for the lack of a women 's ministry .
she also has been worried by reports that the state office for women 's rights might be closed .
the office ensures that women have access to abortions and deals with other privacy issues .
" in short , one notices a big disinterest in respect to the government 's involvement in women 's rights , ” she said .
little help for trafficking victims bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : sarkozy has been accused of insensitivity to victims of human trafficking this opinion is backed up by francoise laurant , president of the family planning organization mfpf .
during the run-up to the elections , the group requested meetings with all of the major mainstream candidates .
sarkozy was the only one who did not reply , said laurant .
“ that was the first alarm signal for us , ” she said .
yet there were signals that sarkozy would take a more conservative line on issues such as prostitution .
as interior minister , he helped usher through a series of laws in 2003 which went after prostitutes who engaged in so-called “ passive solicitation . ”
while the term 's meaning is not completely clear , it has amounted to a declaration of war on foreign prostitutes .
the majority of these women are victims of illegal human trafficking networks .
in order to be eligible for help from the french government , they have to be willing to turn in their tormenters , people often involved in criminal networks .
if they are unwilling to do so , they face deportation .
this practice of deporting prostitutes has been strongly criticized by the united nations organization which is trying to put an end to human trafficking .
feminists decry " victimization " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : sarkozy has seemed distracted by his love life the president has been active in providing more state help to victims of domestic violence .
while sarkozy has taken on this issue as one that is close to his heart , laurant from the mfpf remains skeptical .
“ in sarkozy 's speeches are always only about victims and that they need to be defended .
for feminists , that makes our blood run cold , ” laurant said . dw staff -lrb- th -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

the blues still have to secure a win after two games . the dutch team made a strong showing from the start with dirk kuyt and substitute robin van persie putting holland 2-0 up after an hour .
thierry henry managed to pull one back for france -lrb- 71st minute -rrb- , but another substitute , arjen robben , scored 30 seconds later and wesley sneijder completed the win in injury time with a superb strike .
world cup runners-up france will face world cup winners italy , who also have one point from two matches , in their final group c match on tuesday .
but both sides , who have put on rather less glorious performances in this championship , will be out if romania beat the netherlands on the same day .
dutch surprise themselves bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : netherlands ' dirk kuyt kicked off the series " we 're still trying to get our heads around this , " the netherlands ' former manchester united striker ruud van nistelrooy said .
" we could n't have expected this , we did n't have the best of form in the qualifying or coming in , but now it seems it is all falling into place .
now i think the confidence is there and it 's lifting the team , " he added .
the dutch , unchanged from the side that hammered italy 3-0 in their opening match , began superbly and kuyt put them in front in the ninth minute , beating florent malouda to head home from a corner . kuyt almost made it 2-0 with a chance soon after , but france came back into the match and sydney govou , preferred to nicolas anelka , had a couple of chances , only to be denied by goalkeeper edwin van der sar .
france came out firing after half-time and henry , who was restored to the starting line-up after injury , lobbed a volley just over the bar .
fine piece of coaching bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : van persie quickly showed the wisdom of the dutch coach 's decision but it was dutch coach marco van basten 's substitutions that proved decisive .
he replaced holding midfielder orlando engelaar at half-time for the speed and attacking thrust of robben , and after 10 minutes striker robin van persie came on for kuyt .
" it gave us greater possibilities to go deeper and give us more space to attack again .
these players are quick and technically good and so we were more dangerous in the second half even though france were creating more pressure , " van basten said . " i have to compliment the defense because there was a lot of pressure and in the end we made some good goals with some good counter-attacks which has made us all very happy . "
the second dutch goal was brilliantly executed , with van nistelrooy near the halfway line cleverly feeding the ball through to substitute robben , who sped down the wing and crossed for van persie to volley home off the hand of gregory coupet .
france continued to press , though , and with 19 minutes to go , willy sagnol broke down the right , fed the ball low into the box and henry scored with a neat left-foot finish .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : thierry henry was fighting a losing battle despite pulling one back for france but france were then undone by a moment of brilliance from robben , who , having broken down the left again but with seemingly nowhere to go , fired a shot high past coupet to make it 3-1 .
robben and van nistelrooy both went close to increasing their lead late on , while patrice evra fired a shot wide for france and franck ribery lifted a free kick just over .
sneijder then completed the victory with a brilliant turn and shot from outside the area to send the dutch fans wild .
it was another outstanding display by the real madrid midfielder , who picked up the man-of-the-match award as he did against italy .
dutch wo n't put their feet up bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : it was n't just the dutch squad that put on a colorful performance the result leaves the netherlands able to take it easy in the last game against romania , but van basten dismissed any idea of allowing romania to win to eliminate two tough rivals in france and italy .
van basten said he had not considered whether he would be playing reserves for the romania game .
" we will start thinking about that game tomorrow but we will prepare for it seriously , " he said .
meanwhile france coach raymond domenech put a brave face on the defeat , knowing his side 's fate is no longer in his hands .
" we tried to play and win but there were some unfortunate moments .
there were moments in which we set ourselves up to be successful but we had a lot of bad luck , " he said . dpa news agency -lrb- jg -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

french president nicolas sarkozy has called ireland 's " no " to the eu 's lisbon treaty a call to change the way europe was being constructed .
but he has also urged other states to continue the ratification process . french president nicolas sarkozy has called ireland 's " no " to the eu 's lisbon treaty a call to change the way europe was being constructed .
but he has also urged other states to continue the ratification process .
" many europeans do not understand how we are constructing europe .
we must therefore change the way we do it , " sarkozy told journalists in paris after meeting us president george w bush .
the irish rejection of the treaty was " an appeal to do more , to do it better , " he said .
non , mais oui bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : nicolas sarkozy made his comments after meeting the us president but sarkozy , whose country is taking over the rotating presidency in july , stressed that no one had the right to sabotage the european project .
one of the treaty 's aims is to streamline decision-making processes in the enlarged and more unwieldy 27-member bloc .
he also admitted saturday , june 14 , that the no-vote would " not simplify the task of the french -lrb- eu -rrb- presidency . "
and sarkozy reiterated his call to other countries to continue ratifying the treaty in order to stop the " irish incident becoming a crisis . "
sarkozy and german chancellor angela merkel had already issued a joint statement on friday to this end .
meanwhile , the irish state minister responsible for integration , conor lenihan , said it was unlikely that the country would stage another referendum on the european union reform treaty in the wake of its rejection by voters this week .
on the morning news show of the national broadcaster rte , lenihan said he could not rule out the possibility of a new vote , but he then cautioned there was a risk of even more damage being done if the treaty is put up for a second vote .
if at first you do n't succeed bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : irish prime minister has not ruled out a second vote lenihan warned that ireland is now " extremely isolated " in europe as the only eu member to has rejected the treaty .
his comments came as irish politicians - both those who favored and opposed the treaty - took stock of the referendum result in which the treaty was rejected by a margin of 110,000 votes .
declan ganley , president of the libertas group that led the " no " campaign , said he was horrified that the possibility of another referendum was even being raised .
on friday evening , irish prime minister brian cowen said the government accepted and respected the verdict of voters , but he declined to rule out the possibility of another vote .
cowen will be meeting his colleagues at the eu summit in brussels next week as european leaders ponder what to do next in the wake of the irish voters ' rejection of the treaty .
adapting the eu the lisbon treaty is designed to replace the failed treaty of nice , which ireland only approved in 2002 after it was put to the people for a second time following a no-vote a year earlier .
the nice treaty was subsequently torpedoed by france and the netherlands . like the rejected constitution , the lisbon treaty proposes a european foreign policy supremo and a permanent president to replace the six-month rotation system .
aimed at preventing decision-making gridlock in the expanding organization , the charter cuts the size of the european parliament and the number of eu decisions which require unanimous support , thus reducing national vetoes .
it also includes a european charter of fundamental human and legal rights , which britain and poland have refused to make binding .
however it drops all references to an eu flag or anthem which had fanned euroskeptic fears of another step towards a federal europe , and no longer cites unbridled competition as a goal for the bloc . dw staff -lrb- jg -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

french president nicolas sarkozy has called ireland 's " no " to the eu 's lisbon treaty a call to change the way europe was being constructed .
but he has also urged other states to continue the ratification process . french president nicolas sarkozy has called ireland 's " no " to the eu 's lisbon treaty a call to change the way europe was being constructed .
but he has also urged other states to continue the ratification process .
" many europeans do not understand how we are constructing europe .
we must therefore change the way we do it , " sarkozy told journalists in paris after meeting us president george w bush .
the irish rejection of the treaty was " an appeal to do more , to do it better , " he said .
non , mais oui bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : nicolas sarkozy made his comments after meeting the us president but sarkozy , whose country is taking over the rotating presidency in july , stressed that no one had the right to sabotage the european project .
one of the treaty 's aims is to streamline decision-making processes in the enlarged and more unwieldy 27-member bloc .
he also admitted saturday , june 14 , that the no-vote would " not simplify the task of the french -lrb- eu -rrb- presidency . "
and sarkozy reiterated his call to other countries to continue ratifying the treaty in order to stop the " irish incident becoming a crisis . "
sarkozy and german chancellor angela merkel had already issued a joint statement on friday to this end .
meanwhile , the irish state minister responsible for integration , conor lenihan , said it was unlikely that the country would stage another referendum on the european union reform treaty in the wake of its rejection by voters this week .
on the morning news show of the national broadcaster rte , lenihan said he could not rule out the possibility of a new vote , but he then cautioned there was a risk of even more damage being done if the treaty is put up for a second vote .
if at first you do n't succeed bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : irish prime minister has not ruled out a second vote lenihan warned that ireland is now " extremely isolated " in europe as the only eu member to has rejected the treaty .
his comments came as irish politicians - both those who favored and opposed the treaty - took stock of the referendum result in which the treaty was rejected by a margin of 110,000 votes .
declan ganley , president of the libertas group that led the " no " campaign , said he was horrified that the possibility of another referendum was even being raised .
on friday evening , irish prime minister brian cowen said the government accepted and respected the verdict of voters , but he declined to rule out the possibility of another vote .
cowen will be meeting his colleagues at the eu summit in brussels next week as european leaders ponder what to do next in the wake of the irish voters ' rejection of the treaty .
adapting the eu the lisbon treaty is designed to replace the failed treaty of nice , which ireland only approved in 2002 after it was put to the people for a second time following a no-vote a year earlier .
the nice treaty was subsequently torpedoed by france and the netherlands . like the rejected constitution , the lisbon treaty proposes a european foreign policy supremo and a permanent president to replace the six-month rotation system .
aimed at preventing decision-making gridlock in the expanding organization , the charter cuts the size of the european parliament and the number of eu decisions which require unanimous support , thus reducing national vetoes .
it also includes a european charter of fundamental human and legal rights , which britain and poland have refused to make binding .
however it drops all references to an eu flag or anthem which had fanned euroskeptic fears of another step towards a federal europe , and no longer cites unbridled competition as a goal for the bloc . dw staff -lrb- jg -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

the blues still have to secure a win after two games . the dutch team made a strong showing from the start with dirk kuyt and substitute robin van persie putting holland 2-0 up after an hour .
thierry henry managed to pull one back for france -lrb- 71st minute -rrb- , but another substitute , arjen robben , scored 30 seconds later and wesley sneijder completed the win in injury time with a superb strike .
world cup runners-up france will face world cup winners italy , who also have one point from two matches , in their final group c match on tuesday .
but both sides , who have put on rather less glorious performances in this championship , will be out if romania beat the netherlands on the same day .
dutch surprise themselves bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : netherlands ' dirk kuyt kicked off the series " we 're still trying to get our heads around this , " the netherlands ' former manchester united striker ruud van nistelrooy said .
" we could n't have expected this , we did n't have the best of form in the qualifying or coming in , but now it seems it is all falling into place .
now i think the confidence is there and it 's lifting the team , " he added .
the dutch , unchanged from the side that hammered italy 3-0 in their opening match , began superbly and kuyt put them in front in the ninth minute , beating florent malouda to head home from a corner . kuyt almost made it 2-0 with a chance soon after , but france came back into the match and sydney govou , preferred to nicolas anelka , had a couple of chances , only to be denied by goalkeeper edwin van der sar .
france came out firing after half-time and henry , who was restored to the starting line-up after injury , lobbed a volley just over the bar .
fine piece of coaching bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : van persie quickly showed the wisdom of the dutch coach 's decision but it was dutch coach marco van basten 's substitutions that proved decisive .
he replaced holding midfielder orlando engelaar at half-time for the speed and attacking thrust of robben , and after 10 minutes striker robin van persie came on for kuyt .
" it gave us greater possibilities to go deeper and give us more space to attack again .
these players are quick and technically good and so we were more dangerous in the second half even though france were creating more pressure , " van basten said . " i have to compliment the defense because there was a lot of pressure and in the end we made some good goals with some good counter-attacks which has made us all very happy . "
the second dutch goal was brilliantly executed , with van nistelrooy near the halfway line cleverly feeding the ball through to substitute robben , who sped down the wing and crossed for van persie to volley home off the hand of gregory coupet .
france continued to press , though , and with 19 minutes to go , willy sagnol broke down the right , fed the ball low into the box and henry scored with a neat left-foot finish .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : thierry henry was fighting a losing battle despite pulling one back for france but france were then undone by a moment of brilliance from robben , who , having broken down the left again but with seemingly nowhere to go , fired a shot high past coupet to make it 3-1 .
robben and van nistelrooy both went close to increasing their lead late on , while patrice evra fired a shot wide for france and franck ribery lifted a free kick just over .
sneijder then completed the victory with a brilliant turn and shot from outside the area to send the dutch fans wild .
it was another outstanding display by the real madrid midfielder , who picked up the man-of-the-match award as he did against italy .
dutch wo n't put their feet up bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : it was n't just the dutch squad that put on a colorful performance the result leaves the netherlands able to take it easy in the last game against romania , but van basten dismissed any idea of allowing romania to win to eliminate two tough rivals in france and italy .
van basten said he had not considered whether he would be playing reserves for the romania game .
" we will start thinking about that game tomorrow but we will prepare for it seriously , " he said .
meanwhile france coach raymond domenech put a brave face on the defeat , knowing his side 's fate is no longer in his hands .
" we tried to play and win but there were some unfortunate moments .
there were moments in which we set ourselves up to be successful but we had a lot of bad luck , " he said . dpa news agency -lrb- jg -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

once he was replaced , the center got the green light . in february , an application for a muslim kindergarten landed on the desk of the education authority in the central berlin district of wedding , where almost 35 percent of the population has an immigrant background .
permission was refused on the grounds that sinan w. , the head of the " morgenland " -lrb- orient -rrb- association behind the project , was believed to have ties to the radical muslim group hizb-ut-tahrir , banned in germany since 2003 .
in 2004 he allegedly published texts on the internet containing incitement to hatred .
although sinan w. admitted links , he was also reported to have distanced himself from the group , saying that after studying islamic sources , he " realized that it tried to draw young people under its spell with emotional subjects and then exploited them for sinister ends . "
authorities stipulate certain conditions bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : wedding is home to a high percentage of immigrants on april 6 , the morgenland association elected another chairman , michael w. , a relative of sinan w. , and resubmitted its application .
this time , it was given the go-ahead .
" there was no reason to deny permission , " said bernhard kempf.from the education authority .
" all the formal criteria were met , including in terms of educational concept . "
this included the promotion of inter-religious dialogue , gender equality , and the learning of german .
the kindergarten subsequently opened in may with 45 children in its care , including turks , bosnians , arabs and lithuanians .
however , the authorities have laid down certain conditions .
any staff changes must be registered with the authorities , while the youth welfare office is allowed to inspect the kindergarten whenever it wishes without giving notice .
" we will be doing this , " said city councillor rainer maria fritsch in the daily tagesspiegel .
" if parents or staff report unusual activity at odds with the constitution , we can withdraw permission at any time . "
fulfilling a need " they can come whenever they like , " said sinan w. 's wife in the same newspaper , adding that the kindergarten had been her idea .
" we have nothing to hide , " she went on .
" i used to work at another kindergarten in the same district , and muslim mothers would often ask why there was no muslim childcare facility in the neighborhood .
they want their children to grow up with traditions , such as observing ramadan . "
now they can .
the new kindergarten observes muslim holidays and only serves halal food .
otherwise , little sets it apart from other kindergartens in the capital .
some have expressed skepticism others have their doubts , and believe that sinan w. 's resignation as chairman of morgenland was merely tactical .
" the abrupt change to the leadership of morgenland was a transparent maneuver geared to securing permission , " said christian democrat spokesperson frank henkel in welt online , adding that sinan w. most probably still pulls the strings .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the al-nur mosque meanwhile , local radio station info-radio reported that the kindergarten staff were recruited via an advert posted on the website of the al-nur mosque in the south of berlin , widely believed to be a meeting place for radicals .
further adverts appeared on muslim web sites , which , according to the federal office for the protection of the constitution , " directly and indirectly spread anti-zionist and anti-israeli propaganda . "
" we will be making sure that democratic standards are maintained , " insisted berhard kempf .
" if we allow them a place within our education system we can keep an eye on them .

the blues still have to secure a win after two games . the dutch team made a strong showing from the start with dirk kuyt and substitute robin van persie putting holland 2-0 up after an hour .
thierry henry managed to pull one back for france -lrb- 71st minute -rrb- , but another substitute , arjen robben , scored 30 seconds later and wesley sneijder completed the win in injury time with a superb strike .
world cup runners-up france will face world cup winners italy , who also have one point from two matches , in their final group c match on tuesday .
but both sides , who have put on rather less glorious performances in this championship , will be out if romania beat the netherlands on the same day .
dutch surprise themselves bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : netherlands ' dirk kuyt kicked off the series " we 're still trying to get our heads around this , " the netherlands ' former manchester united striker ruud van nistelrooy said .
" we could n't have expected this , we did n't have the best of form in the qualifying or coming in , but now it seems it is all falling into place .
now i think the confidence is there and it 's lifting the team , " he added .
the dutch , unchanged from the side that hammered italy 3-0 in their opening match , began superbly and kuyt put them in front in the ninth minute , beating florent malouda to head home from a corner . kuyt almost made it 2-0 with a chance soon after , but france came back into the match and sydney govou , preferred to nicolas anelka , had a couple of chances , only to be denied by goalkeeper edwin van der sar .
france came out firing after half-time and henry , who was restored to the starting line-up after injury , lobbed a volley just over the bar .
fine piece of coaching bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : van persie quickly showed the wisdom of the dutch coach 's decision but it was dutch coach marco van basten 's substitutions that proved decisive .
he replaced holding midfielder orlando engelaar at half-time for the speed and attacking thrust of robben , and after 10 minutes striker robin van persie came on for kuyt .
" it gave us greater possibilities to go deeper and give us more space to attack again .
these players are quick and technically good and so we were more dangerous in the second half even though france were creating more pressure , " van basten said . " i have to compliment the defense because there was a lot of pressure and in the end we made some good goals with some good counter-attacks which has made us all very happy . "
the second dutch goal was brilliantly executed , with van nistelrooy near the halfway line cleverly feeding the ball through to substitute robben , who sped down the wing and crossed for van persie to volley home off the hand of gregory coupet .
france continued to press , though , and with 19 minutes to go , willy sagnol broke down the right , fed the ball low into the box and henry scored with a neat left-foot finish .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : thierry henry was fighting a losing battle despite pulling one back for france but france were then undone by a moment of brilliance from robben , who , having broken down the left again but with seemingly nowhere to go , fired a shot high past coupet to make it 3-1 .
robben and van nistelrooy both went close to increasing their lead late on , while patrice evra fired a shot wide for france and franck ribery lifted a free kick just over .
sneijder then completed the victory with a brilliant turn and shot from outside the area to send the dutch fans wild .
it was another outstanding display by the real madrid midfielder , who picked up the man-of-the-match award as he did against italy .
dutch wo n't put their feet up bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : it was n't just the dutch squad that put on a colorful performance the result leaves the netherlands able to take it easy in the last game against romania , but van basten dismissed any idea of allowing romania to win to eliminate two tough rivals in france and italy .
van basten said he had not considered whether he would be playing reserves for the romania game .
" we will start thinking about that game tomorrow but we will prepare for it seriously , " he said .
meanwhile france coach raymond domenech put a brave face on the defeat , knowing his side 's fate is no longer in his hands .
" we tried to play and win but there were some unfortunate moments .
there were moments in which we set ourselves up to be successful but we had a lot of bad luck , " he said . dpa news agency -lrb- jg -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de women -pipe- 14.06.2008 french feminists unhappy with sarkozy großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : sarkozy has given women top jobs in his cabinet french president nicolas sarkozy courted female voters during the run-up to the last elections , but since he took office , women ’ s rights has taken a back seat to other issues , feminists say . french president nicolas sarkozy courted female voters during the run-up to the last elections , saying that france should take the lead in pushing for women 's rights .
but feminists feel this was a mere political tactic to keep french women from voting en masse for his female opponent , socialist candidate segolene royal .
feminists feel sarkozy 's given the women 's rights issue very little attention since taking office just over a year ago .
one vocal sarkozy critic is emmanuelle piet , a doctor who has been involved in promoting the campaign against domestic violence for the past quarter century .
piet currently serves as president of an aid organization for battered women .
" sarkozy has already been in office for a year and he has caused problems from the beginning on , " she said .
" when he formed his government , he did not establish any ministry to deal with issues of women 's rights or equality . ”
sarkozy accused of lack of interest bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : sarkozy did n't want to lose women 's votes to royal in 1981 , francois mitterrand launched a ministry for women 's rights , which put france at the forefront in europe on the issue .
since then , each government has included women 's rights and equality as part of its portfolio , or at least assigned a secretary of state to the issue .
when sarkozy took the helm in may 2007 , he added female politicians to his team , but not nearly as many as he promised during the elections .
yet his government is proud that top posts have been filled by women including that of finance minister christine lagarde , interior minister michele alliot-marie and justice minister rachida dati .
for piet , having women as ministers does n't make up for the lack of a women 's ministry .
she also has been worried by reports that the state office for women 's rights might be closed .
the office ensures that women have access to abortions and deals with other privacy issues .
" in short , one notices a big disinterest in respect to the government 's involvement in women 's rights , ” she said .
little help for trafficking victims bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : sarkozy has been accused of insensitivity to victims of human trafficking this opinion is backed up by francoise laurant , president of the family planning organization mfpf .
during the run-up to the elections , the group requested meetings with all of the major mainstream candidates .
sarkozy was the only one who did not reply , said laurant .
“ that was the first alarm signal for us , ” she said .
yet there were signals that sarkozy would take a more conservative line on issues such as prostitution .
as interior minister , he helped usher through a series of laws in 2003 which went after prostitutes who engaged in so-called “ passive solicitation . ”
while the term 's meaning is not completely clear , it has amounted to a declaration of war on foreign prostitutes .
the majority of these women are victims of illegal human trafficking networks .
in order to be eligible for help from the french government , they have to be willing to turn in their tormenters , people often involved in criminal networks .
if they are unwilling to do so , they face deportation .
this practice of deporting prostitutes has been strongly criticized by the united nations organization which is trying to put an end to human trafficking .
feminists decry " victimization " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : sarkozy has seemed distracted by his love life the president has been active in providing more state help to victims of domestic violence .
while sarkozy has taken on this issue as one that is close to his heart , laurant from the mfpf remains skeptical .
“ in sarkozy 's speeches are always only about victims and that they need to be defended .
for feminists , that makes our blood run cold , ” laurant said . dw staff -lrb- th -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

" a draw would have been really unfair since we had the best chances and they just wanted to get a draw , " villa said . villa said that " having six points " was " much more important " than he being tournament top scorer . liverpool striker fernando torres had spain an early lead , only for zlatan ibrahimovic to equalize for sweden before half-time .

sweden have three points and will need to beat russia in their final game to be sure of a place in the quarter-finals . spain went ahead with their first real attack in the 15th minute .
xavi hernandez played a short corner for david villa , who laid the ball back for david silva .
silva 's center was volleyed in by the stretching torres , from just beyond the penalty spot . torres ' goal obliged sweden to react , and they did so manfully - to the delight of the noisy swedish fans in innsbruck .
two minutes later johan elmander wasted a good chance to equalize down the right .

ibrahimovic held off sergio ramos and scored with a soft low shot , when iker casillas could only push into the net . sweden manager lars lagerback surprisingly pulled off ibrahimovic at the start of the second half , and spain took control with their slick passing game .

besides books , the publishing trade 's top annual event will provide a forum for political discussion on a country undergoing rapid change . turkey promised this week to showcase its cultural diversity at the annual frankfurt book fair in october , where its literature will have guest-of-honor status this year .
speaking from frankfurt , organizers said 350 authors and translators from turkey will be at the world 's principal book fair , presenting their work to publishers from around the globe .
ethnic minorities will be included , said muge gursoy sokmen , co-chair of the organizing committee .
she added that kurdish authors lal lales and seyhmus diken , armenian writers migirdic margosyan and jaklin celik , and jewish writer mario levi would be making appearances in person .
at the october 15-19 fair a special exhibition on turkish literature will also highlight the little-known " layers " that are woven in with turkic origins in the country 's culture today .
showcasing turkey 's cultural diversity " you 'll see how it includes arab or armenian or byzantine roots too , " she said .
" we have to treat the heritage of our cultural diversity with respect , " said sokmen , who is a leftist istanbul publisher .
" we see this as a very rich resource . "
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : pamuk has often been the subject of controversy the cultural ferment in turkey , in which intellectuals argue about whether and how political islam can be reconciled with modernity , is not just a literary topic , but has also become politicized , with secular turkish judges now mulling a ban on the country 's ruling akp party , which has islamic roots .
germany is home to the largest turkish community outside of turkey .
" guest workers , " who have migrated since the 1960s , and their descendents make up the country 's largest ethnic minority .
" at least 2.5 million people here are of turkish origin and there is a rich german turkish literature .
that 's one reason turkey feels very close to us , as if it were a next-door neighbor , " said juergen boos , the book fair chief executive .
nobel-prize winner pamuk to open fair orhan pamuk , the nobel literature prize winner in 2006 , will open the fair with turkish president abdullah gul . the best-selling author was the subject of international controversy when he was charged with making statements that violated an article in turkey 's penal code for " insulting turkishness , " though he was never prosecuted .
in addition to authors , hundreds of performers and artists will round out the offerings at the frankfurt fair .
ahmet ari , the coordinator of the turkish presentation , said the fair would focus not only on the riches of turkish literature awaiting translation into other languages , but also provide a forum for discussing politically controversial topics in a nation going through rapid change .
restrictions on minorities eased bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the turkish-kurdish minority has long been culturally repressed he said that turkey had greatly improved its democratic record in recent years , and there was no longer a single author in jail on account of his political views .
turkish state television had also started its first non-turkish-language broadcasts only a few days ago , he added .
ari was referring to turkey 's decades-old policy of repressing minority languages and cultures .
prime minister recep tayyip erdogan 's center-right akp party has eased many restrictions , with an eye to the eventual possibility of joining the european union .
turkey has 1,724 publishing houses with annual sales of $ 810 million -lrb- 516 million euros -rrb- .
the frankfurt book fair is a springboard in book publishing that helps boost exports and the translation of works into foreign languages .

once he was replaced , the center got the green light . in february , an application for a muslim kindergarten landed on the desk of the education authority in the central berlin district of wedding , where almost 35 percent of the population has an immigrant background .
permission was refused on the grounds that sinan w. , the head of the " morgenland " -lrb- orient -rrb- association behind the project , was believed to have ties to the radical muslim group hizb-ut-tahrir , banned in germany since 2003 .
in 2004 he allegedly published texts on the internet containing incitement to hatred .
although sinan w. admitted links , he was also reported to have distanced himself from the group , saying that after studying islamic sources , he " realized that it tried to draw young people under its spell with emotional subjects and then exploited them for sinister ends . "
authorities stipulate certain conditions bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : wedding is home to a high percentage of immigrants on april 6 , the morgenland association elected another chairman , michael w. , a relative of sinan w. , and resubmitted its application .
this time , it was given the go-ahead .
" there was no reason to deny permission , " said bernhard kempf.from the education authority .
" all the formal criteria were met , including in terms of educational concept . "
this included the promotion of inter-religious dialogue , gender equality , and the learning of german .
the kindergarten subsequently opened in may with 45 children in its care , including turks , bosnians , arabs and lithuanians .
however , the authorities have laid down certain conditions .
any staff changes must be registered with the authorities , while the youth welfare office is allowed to inspect the kindergarten whenever it wishes without giving notice .
" we will be doing this , " said city councillor rainer maria fritsch in the daily tagesspiegel .
" if parents or staff report unusual activity at odds with the constitution , we can withdraw permission at any time . "
fulfilling a need " they can come whenever they like , " said sinan w. 's wife in the same newspaper , adding that the kindergarten had been her idea .
" we have nothing to hide , " she went on .
" i used to work at another kindergarten in the same district , and muslim mothers would often ask why there was no muslim childcare facility in the neighborhood .
they want their children to grow up with traditions , such as observing ramadan . "
now they can .
the new kindergarten observes muslim holidays and only serves halal food .
otherwise , little sets it apart from other kindergartens in the capital .
some have expressed skepticism others have their doubts , and believe that sinan w. 's resignation as chairman of morgenland was merely tactical .
" the abrupt change to the leadership of morgenland was a transparent maneuver geared to securing permission , " said christian democrat spokesperson frank henkel in welt online , adding that sinan w. most probably still pulls the strings .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the al-nur mosque meanwhile , local radio station info-radio reported that the kindergarten staff were recruited via an advert posted on the website of the al-nur mosque in the south of berlin , widely believed to be a meeting place for radicals .
further adverts appeared on muslim web sites , which , according to the federal office for the protection of the constitution , " directly and indirectly spread anti-zionist and anti-israeli propaganda . "
" we will be making sure that democratic standards are maintained , " insisted berhard kempf .
" if we allow them a place within our education system we can keep an eye on them .

but feminists feel this was a mere political tactic to keep french women from voting en masse for his female opponent , socialist candidate segolene royal .
feminists feel sarkozy 's given the women 's rights issue very little attention since taking office just over a year ago .
one vocal sarkozy critic is emmanuelle piet , a doctor who has been involved in promoting the campaign against domestic violence for the past quarter century .
piet currently serves as president of an aid organization for battered women .
" sarkozy has already been in office for a year and he has caused problems from the beginning on , " she said .
" when he formed his government , he did not establish any ministry to deal with issues of women 's rights or equality . ”
sarkozy accused of lack of interest bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : sarkozy did n't want to lose women 's votes to royal in 1981 , francois mitterrand launched a ministry for women 's rights , which put france at the forefront in europe on the issue .
since then , each government has included women 's rights and equality as part of its portfolio , or at least assigned a secretary of state to the issue .
when sarkozy took the helm in may 2007 , he added female politicians to his team , but not nearly as many as he promised during the elections .
yet his government is proud that top posts have been filled by women including that of finance minister christine lagarde , interior minister michele alliot-marie and justice minister rachida dati .
for piet , having women as ministers does n't make up for the lack of a women 's ministry .
she also has been worried by reports that the state office for women 's rights might be closed .
the office ensures that women have access to abortions and deals with other privacy issues .
" in short , one notices a big disinterest in respect to the government 's involvement in women 's rights , ” she said .
little help for trafficking victims bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : sarkozy has been accused of insensitivity to victims of human trafficking this opinion is backed up by francoise laurant , president of the family planning organization mfpf .
during the run-up to the elections , the group requested meetings with all of the major mainstream candidates .
sarkozy was the only one who did not reply , said laurant .
“ that was the first alarm signal for us , ” she said .
yet there were signals that sarkozy would take a more conservative line on issues such as prostitution .
as interior minister , he helped usher through a series of laws in 2003 which went after prostitutes who engaged in so-called “ passive solicitation . ”
while the term 's meaning is not completely clear , it has amounted to a declaration of war on foreign prostitutes .
the majority of these women are victims of illegal human trafficking networks .
in order to be eligible for help from the french government , they have to be willing to turn in their tormenters , people often involved in criminal networks .
if they are unwilling to do so , they face deportation .
this practice of deporting prostitutes has been strongly criticized by the united nations organization which is trying to put an end to human trafficking .
feminists decry " victimization " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : sarkozy has seemed distracted by his love life the president has been active in providing more state help to victims of domestic violence .
while sarkozy has taken on this issue as one that is close to his heart , laurant from the mfpf remains skeptical .
“ in sarkozy 's speeches are always only about victims and that they need to be defended .

once he was replaced , the center got the green light . in february , an application for a muslim kindergarten landed on the desk of the education authority in the central berlin district of wedding , where almost 35 percent of the population has an immigrant background .
permission was refused on the grounds that sinan w. , the head of the " morgenland " -lrb- orient -rrb- association behind the project , was believed to have ties to the radical muslim group hizb-ut-tahrir , banned in germany since 2003 .
in 2004 he allegedly published texts on the internet containing incitement to hatred .
although sinan w. admitted links , he was also reported to have distanced himself from the group , saying that after studying islamic sources , he " realized that it tried to draw young people under its spell with emotional subjects and then exploited them for sinister ends . "
authorities stipulate certain conditions bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : wedding is home to a high percentage of immigrants on april 6 , the morgenland association elected another chairman , michael w. , a relative of sinan w. , and resubmitted its application .
this time , it was given the go-ahead .
" there was no reason to deny permission , " said bernhard kempf.from the education authority .
" all the formal criteria were met , including in terms of educational concept . "
this included the promotion of inter-religious dialogue , gender equality , and the learning of german .
the kindergarten subsequently opened in may with 45 children in its care , including turks , bosnians , arabs and lithuanians .
however , the authorities have laid down certain conditions .
any staff changes must be registered with the authorities , while the youth welfare office is allowed to inspect the kindergarten whenever it wishes without giving notice .
" we will be doing this , " said city councillor rainer maria fritsch in the daily tagesspiegel .
" if parents or staff report unusual activity at odds with the constitution , we can withdraw permission at any time . "
fulfilling a need " they can come whenever they like , " said sinan w. 's wife in the same newspaper , adding that the kindergarten had been her idea .
" we have nothing to hide , " she went on .
" i used to work at another kindergarten in the same district , and muslim mothers would often ask why there was no muslim childcare facility in the neighborhood .
they want their children to grow up with traditions , such as observing ramadan . "
now they can .
the new kindergarten observes muslim holidays and only serves halal food .
otherwise , little sets it apart from other kindergartens in the capital .
some have expressed skepticism others have their doubts , and believe that sinan w. 's resignation as chairman of morgenland was merely tactical .
" the abrupt change to the leadership of morgenland was a transparent maneuver geared to securing permission , " said christian democrat spokesperson frank henkel in welt online , adding that sinan w. most probably still pulls the strings .

but feminists feel this was a mere political tactic to keep french women from voting en masse for his female opponent , socialist candidate segolene royal .
feminists feel sarkozy 's given the women 's rights issue very little attention since taking office just over a year ago .
one vocal sarkozy critic is emmanuelle piet , a doctor who has been involved in promoting the campaign against domestic violence for the past quarter century .
piet currently serves as president of an aid organization for battered women .
" sarkozy has already been in office for a year and he has caused problems from the beginning on , " she said .
" when he formed his government , he did not establish any ministry to deal with issues of women 's rights or equality . ”
sarkozy accused of lack of interest bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : sarkozy did n't want to lose women 's votes to royal in 1981 , francois mitterrand launched a ministry for women 's rights , which put france at the forefront in europe on the issue .
since then , each government has included women 's rights and equality as part of its portfolio , or at least assigned a secretary of state to the issue .
when sarkozy took the helm in may 2007 , he added female politicians to his team , but not nearly as many as he promised during the elections .
yet his government is proud that top posts have been filled by women including that of finance minister christine lagarde , interior minister michele alliot-marie and justice minister rachida dati .
for piet , having women as ministers does n't make up for the lack of a women 's ministry .
she also has been worried by reports that the state office for women 's rights might be closed .
the office ensures that women have access to abortions and deals with other privacy issues .
" in short , one notices a big disinterest in respect to the government 's involvement in women 's rights , ” she said .
little help for trafficking victims bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : sarkozy has been accused of insensitivity to victims of human trafficking this opinion is backed up by francoise laurant , president of the family planning organization mfpf .
during the run-up to the elections , the group requested meetings with all of the major mainstream candidates .
sarkozy was the only one who did not reply , said laurant .
“ that was the first alarm signal for us , ” she said .
yet there were signals that sarkozy would take a more conservative line on issues such as prostitution .
as interior minister , he helped usher through a series of laws in 2003 which went after prostitutes who engaged in so-called “ passive solicitation . ”
while the term 's meaning is not completely clear , it has amounted to a declaration of war on foreign prostitutes .
the majority of these women are victims of illegal human trafficking networks .
in order to be eligible for help from the french government , they have to be willing to turn in their tormenters , people often involved in criminal networks .
if they are unwilling to do so , they face deportation .
this practice of deporting prostitutes has been strongly criticized by the united nations organization which is trying to put an end to human trafficking .
feminists decry " victimization " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : sarkozy has seemed distracted by his love life the president has been active in providing more state help to victims of domestic violence .
while sarkozy has taken on this issue as one that is close to his heart , laurant from the mfpf remains skeptical .
“ in sarkozy 's speeches are always only about victims and that they need to be defended .
for feminists , that makes our blood run cold , ” laurant said . dw staff -lrb- th -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

in 2004 he allegedly published texts on the internet containing incitement to hatred .
although sinan w. admitted links , he was also reported to have distanced himself from the group , saying that after studying islamic sources , he " realized that it tried to draw young people under its spell with emotional subjects and then exploited them for sinister ends . "

but feminists feel this was a mere political tactic to keep french women from voting en masse for his female opponent , socialist candidate segolene royal .
feminists feel sarkozy 's given the women 's rights issue very little attention since taking office just over a year ago .
one vocal sarkozy critic is emmanuelle piet , a doctor who has been involved in promoting the campaign against domestic violence for the past quarter century .
piet currently serves as president of an aid organization for battered women .
" sarkozy has already been in office for a year and he has caused problems from the beginning on , " she said .
" when he formed his government , he did not establish any ministry to deal with issues of women 's rights or equality . ”
sarkozy accused of lack of interest bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : sarkozy did n't want to lose women 's votes to royal in 1981 , francois mitterrand launched a ministry for women 's rights , which put france at the forefront in europe on the issue .
since then , each government has included women 's rights and equality as part of its portfolio , or at least assigned a secretary of state to the issue .
when sarkozy took the helm in may 2007 , he added female politicians to his team , but not nearly as many as he promised during the elections .
yet his government is proud that top posts have been filled by women including that of finance minister christine lagarde , interior minister michele alliot-marie and justice minister rachida dati .
for piet , having women as ministers does n't make up for the lack of a women 's ministry .
she also has been worried by reports that the state office for women 's rights might be closed .
the office ensures that women have access to abortions and deals with other privacy issues .
" in short , one notices a big disinterest in respect to the government 's involvement in women 's rights , ” she said .
little help for trafficking victims bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : sarkozy has been accused of insensitivity to victims of human trafficking this opinion is backed up by francoise laurant , president of the family planning organization mfpf .
during the run-up to the elections , the group requested meetings with all of the major mainstream candidates .
sarkozy was the only one who did not reply , said laurant .
“ that was the first alarm signal for us , ” she said .
yet there were signals that sarkozy would take a more conservative line on issues such as prostitution .
as interior minister , he helped usher through a series of laws in 2003 which went after prostitutes who engaged in so-called “ passive solicitation . ”
while the term 's meaning is not completely clear , it has amounted to a declaration of war on foreign prostitutes .
the majority of these women are victims of illegal human trafficking networks .
in order to be eligible for help from the french government , they have to be willing to turn in their tormenters , people often involved in criminal networks .
if they are unwilling to do so , they face deportation .
this practice of deporting prostitutes has been strongly criticized by the united nations organization which is trying to put an end to human trafficking .
feminists decry " victimization " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : sarkozy has seemed distracted by his love life the president has been active in providing more state help to victims of domestic violence .
while sarkozy has taken on this issue as one that is close to his heart , laurant from the mfpf remains skeptical .
“ in sarkozy 's speeches are always only about victims and that they need to be defended .
for feminists , that makes our blood run cold , ” laurant said . dw staff -lrb- th -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

permission was refused on the grounds that sinan w. , the head of the " morgenland " -lrb- orient -rrb- association behind the project , was believed to have ties to the radical muslim group hizb-ut-tahrir , banned in germany since 2003 .
in 2004 he allegedly published texts on the internet containing incitement to hatred .
although sinan w. admitted links , he was also reported to have distanced himself from the group , saying that after studying islamic sources , he " realized that it tried to draw young people under its spell with emotional subjects and then exploited them for sinister ends . "

but feminists feel this was a mere political tactic to keep french women from voting en masse for his female opponent , socialist candidate segolene royal .
feminists feel sarkozy 's given the women 's rights issue very little attention since taking office just over a year ago .
one vocal sarkozy critic is emmanuelle piet , a doctor who has been involved in promoting the campaign against domestic violence for the past quarter century .
piet currently serves as president of an aid organization for battered women .
" sarkozy has already been in office for a year and he has caused problems from the beginning on , " she said .
" when he formed his government , he did not establish any ministry to deal with issues of women 's rights or equality . ”
sarkozy accused of lack of interest bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : sarkozy did n't want to lose women 's votes to royal in 1981 , francois mitterrand launched a ministry for women 's rights , which put france at the forefront in europe on the issue .
since then , each government has included women 's rights and equality as part of its portfolio , or at least assigned a secretary of state to the issue .
when sarkozy took the helm in may 2007 , he added female politicians to his team , but not nearly as many as he promised during the elections .
yet his government is proud that top posts have been filled by women including that of finance minister christine lagarde , interior minister michele alliot-marie and justice minister rachida dati .
for piet , having women as ministers does n't make up for the lack of a women 's ministry .
she also has been worried by reports that the state office for women 's rights might be closed .
the office ensures that women have access to abortions and deals with other privacy issues .
" in short , one notices a big disinterest in respect to the government 's involvement in women 's rights , ” she said .
little help for trafficking victims bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : sarkozy has been accused of insensitivity to victims of human trafficking this opinion is backed up by francoise laurant , president of the family planning organization mfpf .
during the run-up to the elections , the group requested meetings with all of the major mainstream candidates .
sarkozy was the only one who did not reply , said laurant .
“ that was the first alarm signal for us , ” she said .
yet there were signals that sarkozy would take a more conservative line on issues such as prostitution .
as interior minister , he helped usher through a series of laws in 2003 which went after prostitutes who engaged in so-called “ passive solicitation . ”
while the term 's meaning is not completely clear , it has amounted to a declaration of war on foreign prostitutes .
the majority of these women are victims of illegal human trafficking networks .
in order to be eligible for help from the french government , they have to be willing to turn in their tormenters , people often involved in criminal networks .
if they are unwilling to do so , they face deportation .
this practice of deporting prostitutes has been strongly criticized by the united nations organization which is trying to put an end to human trafficking .
feminists decry " victimization " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : sarkozy has seemed distracted by his love life the president has been active in providing more state help to victims of domestic violence .
while sarkozy has taken on this issue as one that is close to his heart , laurant from the mfpf remains skeptical .
“ in sarkozy 's speeches are always only about victims and that they need to be defended .
for feminists , that makes our blood run cold , ” laurant said . dw staff -lrb- th -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

besides books , the publishing trade 's top annual event will provide a forum for political discussion on a country undergoing rapid change . turkey promised this week to showcase its cultural diversity at the annual frankfurt book fair in october , where its literature will have guest-of-honor status this year .
speaking from frankfurt , organizers said 350 authors and translators from turkey will be at the world 's principal book fair , presenting their work to publishers from around the globe .
ethnic minorities will be included , said muge gursoy sokmen , co-chair of the organizing committee .
she added that kurdish authors lal lales and seyhmus diken , armenian writers migirdic margosyan and jaklin celik , and jewish writer mario levi would be making appearances in person .
at the october 15-19 fair a special exhibition on turkish literature will also highlight the little-known " layers " that are woven in with turkic origins in the country 's culture today .
showcasing turkey 's cultural diversity " you 'll see how it includes arab or armenian or byzantine roots too , " she said .
" we have to treat the heritage of our cultural diversity with respect , " said sokmen , who is a leftist istanbul publisher .
" we see this as a very rich resource . "
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : pamuk has often been the subject of controversy the cultural ferment in turkey , in which intellectuals argue about whether and how political islam can be reconciled with modernity , is not just a literary topic , but has also become politicized , with secular turkish judges now mulling a ban on the country 's ruling akp party , which has islamic roots .
germany is home to the largest turkish community outside of turkey .

dw-world.de answers some of the most pertinent questions . what is the treaty of lisbon ?
after the failure of its forerunner , the european constitution , which was rejected in 2005 by voters in france and the netherlands , the treaty of lisbon , also called the european reform treaty , was conceived as an alternative series of amendments to two existing eu treaties , the treaty on the european union -lrb- maastricht -rrb- and the treaty establishing the european community -lrb- rome -rrb- . the treaty of lisbon , which was approved by eu leaders at an eu summit in the portuguese capital in december 2007 , is a blueprint for running the 27-member european union more efficiently .
it must be ratified by each of the bloc 's members .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : european leaders agreed on the lisbon treaty in december 2007 what would the treaty of lisbon do ?
the document is meant to change the eu in the following ways : § it creates the role of european president this is one of the most controversial proposals as the idea was initially opposed by smaller eu nations but was forced through by the larger member states .
the president would serve a two-and-a-half-year term , replacing the current system of a rotating six-month presidency , and will not be allowed to serve more than two terms . § it creates the role of an eu high representative for foreign affairs and security policy essentially the eu 's foreign minister , this role combines the posts of current foreign affairs chief javier solana and external affairs commissioner benita ferrero-waldner and will be the bloc 's point person for world affairs . § it reduces the size of the eu 's executive body , the european commission the eu commission would be reduced so that there will be fewer commissioners than member states by 2014 , with only two-thirds of countries supplying a commissioner on a rotational basis .
currently each member state has a commissioner . § it redistributes voting weights among member states the treaty intends to introduce majority voting , which will allow votes to be carried on a 55-percent majority as long as that majority also represent 65 percent of the european population .
this would be phased in between 2014 and 2017 . § it gives new powers to the european commission , european parliament and european court of justice , in areas such as justice and domestic affairs § it removes members ' rights to veto legislation in a number of areas have all eu members ratified the treaty ?
not yet .
every country except ireland left ratification of the treaty to their parliaments .
the irish rejected it in a first referendum in 2008 , but voted " yes " the second time around , in early october 2009 .
poland and the czech republic are the final holdouts . poland 's president lech kaczynski is expected to sign the treaty soon , thus completing polish ratification . # b # in prague , both the lower and upper houses of parliament have already approved the treaty , but czech president vaclav klaus , one of europe 's most vocal opponent 's of the legislation , has yet to sign it .
a group of senators has moved to challenge the treaty in the constitutional court . ncy / sh editor : nancy isenson send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?
dw-world.de dw-world : france sees irish no-vote as wake-up call french president nicolas sarkozy has called ireland 's " no " to the eu 's lisbon treaty a call to change the way europe was being constructed .
but he has also urged other states to continue the ratification process .
-lrb- 14.06.2008 -rrb- dw-world : european parliament ratifies lisbon treaty despite protests the european parliament on wednesday voted overwhelmingly in favor of the lisbon treaty , which reforms the european union 's institutions .
there were , however , some protests from euroskeptics demanding referenda .
-lrb- 20.02.2008 -rrb- dw-world : leaders commit to eu 's future by signing the lisbon treaty after a long and painstaking road , the eu has a new roadmap into the future .
but while the lisbon treaty hints at a future of cooperation , one absent leader reminded all that old habits die hard .

zac sunderland sets off on saturday and will make the historic year-long journey in a boat bought with his own savings , the bbc 's rajesh mirchandani reports .
zac will cross treacherous waters in the pacific , indian and atlantic oceans " the boat 's called intrepid , " zac sunderland tells me , as we step aboard .
a more fitting name might be " unfinished " , i think to myself .
a few days before he sets sail on a world record-breaking attempt , zac is waiting for new sails to arrive .
several people are working on deck , drilling , fastening , making adjustments .
down below , the mess resembles , well , a typical teenager 's bedroom .
however , zac is far from typical .
he can not yet drive legally , yet he plans to sail this 36-foot -lrb- 11m -rrb- boat around the world .
alone .
and to return as the youngest person ever to do so , he needs to get back by january 2010 .
the current record belongs to australian david dicks , who finished his voyage in 1996 , aged 18 years and 41 days .
" it 's going to be an amazing adventure , going to all those places , meeting all those people , you know , just checking out all the different places around the world , " zac says .
" it 's the adventure of a lifetime . "
freeze-dried food so , home for the next year , at least , will be a cramped cabin : here he will sleep on a narrow bunk , strapped in , in case of choppy seas ; he will plot routes , study weather charts and communicate with his family , friends and the outside world via a sophisticated array of equipment -lrb- with two ipods for some light relief -rrb- .
see zac 's projected route here he will also prepare meals on a stove that pivots back and forth , although he admits his kitchen skills to date begin and end at the microwave -lrb- there is one onboard -rrb- .
zac 's supply of fresh food will last four weeks .
after that , it is tins and freeze-dried food , supplemented by a few fish he may catch himself .
zac is setting sail from los angeles on america 's pacific coast he will spend periods of up to four to six weeks alone at sea , in between stops .
zac 's first port of call will be the marshall islands , 4,000 miles -lrb- 6,437km -rrb- away .
the 40,000-mile -lrb- 64,400-km -rrb- route will then take him across the pacific to papua new guinea and australia , and from there across the indian ocean to mauritius and madagascar .
after rounding the treacherous cape of good hope in south africa , he will traverse the south atlantic ocean .
he will then navigate the panama canal before taking in the galapagos islands and heading north back to california .
he had planned to sail through the suez canal , but changed his route after reading about pirates off the coast of somalia .
safety precautions now this unassuming teenager 's greatest fears are being away from his friends , not getting enough sleep and falling behind with the year 's worth of school work he is taking with him .
one stop near the end of his intended route is the galapagos islands " i have all my books with me .
i have one more year to finish at high school and i have to send back my tests -lsb- via e-mail -rsb- to my mum .
she 's going to grade them and make sure i am doing well . "
so , apart from checking up on homework , how do his parents feel about their son 's voyage ?
well , it helps that they cruised the pacific with their young family for three years , and are in the ship maintenance business themselves .
zac 's mother , marianne sunderland , says : " as far as worrying about something tragic , i do n't have that worry .
" i think we have taken all the necessary safety precautions , he has all the latest equipment , his own father outfitted his boat .
so as far as that goes , we have managed those risks . "
his father , laurence sunderland , from england , adds : " he 's a very competent man on the ocean .
if he was going to be involved in some other feat that i was not involved with i would be more worried . "
zac intends to write a book while he is on his trip and record footage for a potential documentary on his return .
he is far-sighted and mature enough to acknowledge this adventure could set him up for a career in sailing .
in all , he expects to cover more than 40,000 miles .
but whether he breaks the record or not , it looks set to be the greatest journey of his young life .

zac sunderland sets off on saturday and will make the historic year-long journey in a boat bought with his own savings , the bbc 's rajesh mirchandani reports .
" the boat 's called intrepid , " zac sunderland tells me , as we step aboard .
a more fitting name might be " unfinished " , i think to myself .
a few days before he sets sail on a world record-breaking attempt , zac is waiting for new sails to arrive .
several people are working on deck , drilling , fastening , making adjustments .
down below , the mess resembles , well , a typical teenager 's bedroom .
however , zac is far from typical .
he can not yet drive legally , yet he plans to sail this 36-foot -lrb- 11m -rrb- boat around the world .
alone .
and to return as the youngest person ever to do so , he needs to get back by january 2010 .
the current record belongs to australian david dicks , who finished his voyage in 1996 , aged 18 years and 41 days .
" it 's going to be an amazing adventure , going to all those places , meeting all those people , you know , just checking out all the different places around the world , " zac says .
" it 's the adventure of a lifetime . "
freeze-dried food so , home for the next year , at least , will be a cramped cabin : here he will sleep on a narrow bunk , strapped in , in case of choppy seas ; he will plot routes , study weather charts and communicate with his family , friends and the outside world via a sophisticated array of equipment -lrb- with two ipods for some light relief -rrb- .
see zac 's projected route here he will also prepare meals on a stove that pivots back and forth , although he admits his kitchen skills to date begin and end at the microwave -lrb- there is one onboard -rrb- .
zac 's supply of fresh food will last four weeks .
after that , it is tins and freeze-dried food , supplemented by a few fish he may catch himself .
he will spend periods of up to four to six weeks alone at sea , in between stops .
zac 's first port of call will be the marshall islands , 4,000 miles -lrb- 6,437km -rrb- away .
the 40,000-mile -lrb- 64,400-km -rrb- route will then take him across the pacific to papua new guinea and australia , and from there across the indian ocean to mauritius and madagascar .
after rounding the treacherous cape of good hope in south africa , he will traverse the south atlantic ocean .
he will then navigate the panama canal before taking in the galapagos islands and heading north back to california .
he had planned to sail through the suez canal , but changed his route after reading about pirates off the coast of somalia .
safety precautions now this unassuming teenager 's greatest fears are being away from his friends , not getting enough sleep and falling behind with the year 's worth of school work he is taking with him .
" i have all my books with me .
i have one more year to finish at high school and i have to send back my tests -lsb- via e-mail -rsb- to my mum .
she 's going to grade them and make sure i am doing well . "
so , apart from checking up on homework , how do his parents feel about their son 's voyage ?
well , it helps that they cruised the pacific with their young family for three years , and are in the ship maintenance business themselves .
zac 's mother , marianne sunderland , says : " as far as worrying about something tragic , i do n't have that worry .

ramiro , 12 , works as a driller in the high-altitude mines of potosi " i work out of necessity , " explains 12-year-old driller ramiro , helmet in hand , as he stands at the entrance of one of the mines that honeycomb the cerro rico - meaning rich hill - that towers above the town .
he feels bad because he knows that working in the mine puts his health at risk , he says , and " that is what every single one of the children that works inside feels ; sometimes some die , some survive " .
wiping his sweaty forehead , which is covered in dark dust , he adds : " for us , who work inside the mine , it is not good ; the mine brings a lot of disease , a lot of death . "
it is prolonged exposure to that dust that gives the average miner a life expectancy of only 40 years .
the culprit is what they call the " mal de mina " , the lung disease silicosis .
at the entrance to one of the mines , surrounded by grey piles of mineral waste , men can be seen alongside children , chewing coca leaves as a way to stay awake , carrying picks , mattocks and shovels .
it seems that childhood is a luxury the poorest residents of this mining area , located 4,300m -lrb- 14,100ft -rrb- above sea level , can not afford .
high prices although potosi was the financial epicentre of the spanish colonies more than 400 years ago , due to its vast silver reserves , today it is inhabited by many families that are on the edge of survival ; families in which every member , no matter how young , has to work .
the spanish conquistadores took vast amounts of silver from cerro rico and although child labour is illegal , bolivian mines employ thousands of children who need to work to ensure their families ' as well as their own survival .
in the case of the western region of bolivia , mining is still the source of jobs and entire families work in the exploitation of minerals .
today most bolivian mines are co-operatives that operate using risky methods .
it is the increase in the international price of minerals that has led many families to look at mining as an option to improve their income in south america 's poorest country , even if it may involve sending their children to work .
" we thought with the increase in these prices , child labour was going to decrease as families were going to have higher incomes - but reality shows the complete opposite , " explains maria elena reyes , who heads the division of child labour at the international labour organisation in the country 's administrative capital , la paz .
" the situation and the see-no-evil attitude of many sectors are quite worrying . "
' no way out ' bolivia 's birth as a republic was tied to mining , and here , for many years , indigenous people have been joining the mining work force , bringing themselves , their families and community values rooted in the andean cultural identity , where children help adults in their labours as part of their process of growing up .
child miners chew coca leaves like their elders to help them stay awake but that is not the main or only reason most children are here .
for felipe , a veteran miner and father of ramiro , there is no other option .
" children work to help me support the family .
if they do not work , families here wo n't make it ...
" what am i going to do with my children if they do n't work ?
there 's no way out of the mine ; that is why we all work , the whole family works . "
many of these child and adolescent miners work at night , between eight and 12 hours a day .
they do not have a contract and work under the control of contracted workers , which makes it difficult to count their number exactly , but according to the un children 's charity , unicef , about 10 % of all bolivia 's miners are under-age .
earning an average of £ 3 -lrb- $ 6 -rrb- a day , they generally work as drilling assistants , wheelbarrow pushers , pick-miners and sweepers .
dreams of study girls also go underground .
abigail , who is 10 years old , works inside the mine , loading minerals into the wagons , and sometimes outside , cleaning the mineral mills with her four-year-old sister .
abigail works above and below ground , sometimes helped by her sister they lost their father last year to silicosis , so prevalent among miners .
abigail works eight hours every night , then goes to bed at dawn and anxiously wakes up to go to school at noon .
" i 've started to work because of lack of money , because my family had no money , we had nothing to eat , " she explains .
" it 's hard , i feel like i am already a mother or something because i am working this hard , but i do n't want my mother to work because she might also get silicosis or some other disease , something similar to what killed my dad . "
cupping a small piece of shiny mineral rock in her hands , she says : " my dream is to study , to have a profession and work in something else , basically , to get out of the mine . "
throwing the rock away , she adds : " the mine summons death and i am too young to be called yet . "

" we thought with the increase in these prices , child labour was going to decrease as families were going to have higher incomes - but reality shows the complete opposite , " explains maria elena reyes , who heads the division of child labour at the international labour organisation in the country 's administrative capital , la paz .
" the situation and the see-no-evil attitude of many sectors are quite worrying . "
' no way out ' bolivia 's birth as a republic was tied to mining , and here , for many years , indigenous people have been joining the mining work force , bringing themselves , their families and community values rooted in the andean cultural identity , where children help adults in their labours as part of their process of growing up .
child miners chew coca leaves like their elders to help them stay awake but that is not the main or only reason most children are here .
for felipe , a veteran miner and father of ramiro , there is no other option .
" children work to help me support the family .
if they do not work , families here wo n't make it ...
" what am i going to do with my children if they do n't work ?
there 's no way out of the mine ; that is why we all work , the whole family works . "
many of these child and adolescent miners work at night , between eight and 12 hours a day .
they do not have a contract and work under the control of contracted workers , which makes it difficult to count their number exactly , but according to the un children 's charity , unicef , about 10 % of all bolivia 's miners are under-age .
earning an average of £ 3 -lrb- $ 6 -rrb- a day , they generally work as drilling assistants , wheelbarrow pushers , pick-miners and sweepers .
dreams of study girls also go underground .
abigail , who is 10 years old , works inside the mine , loading minerals into the wagons , and sometimes outside , cleaning the mineral mills with her four-year-old sister .
abigail works above and below ground , sometimes helped by her sister they lost their father last year to silicosis , so prevalent among miners .
abigail works eight hours every night , then goes to bed at dawn and anxiously wakes up to go to school at noon .
" i 've started to work because of lack of money , because my family had no money , we had nothing to eat , " she explains .
" it 's hard , i feel like i am already a mother or something because i am working this hard , but i do n't want my mother to work because she might also get silicosis or some other disease , something similar to what killed my dad . "
cupping a small piece of shiny mineral rock in her hands , she says : " my dream is to study , to have a profession and work in something else , basically , to get out of the mine . "
throwing the rock away , she adds : " the mine summons death and i am too young to be called yet . "

ramiro , 12 , works as a driller in the high-altitude mines of potosi " i work out of necessity , " explains 12-year-old driller ramiro , helmet in hand , as he stands at the entrance of one of the mines that honeycomb the cerro rico - meaning rich hill - that towers above the town .
he feels bad because he knows that working in the mine puts his health at risk , he says , and " that is what every single one of the children that works inside feels ; sometimes some die , some survive " .
wiping his sweaty forehead , which is covered in dark dust , he adds : " for us , who work inside the mine , it is not good ; the mine brings a lot of disease , a lot of death . "
it is prolonged exposure to that dust that gives the average miner a life expectancy of only 40 years .
the culprit is what they call the " mal de mina " , the lung disease silicosis .
at the entrance to one of the mines , surrounded by grey piles of mineral waste , men can be seen alongside children , chewing coca leaves as a way to stay awake , carrying picks , mattocks and shovels .
it seems that childhood is a luxury the poorest residents of this mining area , located 4,300m -lrb- 14,100ft -rrb- above sea level , can not afford .
high prices although potosi was the financial epicentre of the spanish colonies more than 400 years ago , due to its vast silver reserves , today it is inhabited by many families that are on the edge of survival ; families in which every member , no matter how young , has to work .
the spanish conquistadores took vast amounts of silver from cerro rico and although child labour is illegal , bolivian mines employ thousands of children who need to work to ensure their families ' as well as their own survival .
in the case of the western region of bolivia , mining is still the source of jobs and entire families work in the exploitation of minerals .
today most bolivian mines are co-operatives that operate using risky methods .
it is the increase in the international price of minerals that has led many families to look at mining as an option to improve their income in south america 's poorest country , even if it may involve sending their children to work .

irresistible force - the referendum - has met immoveable object - the need for every eu member state to ratify the lisbon treaty .
so where next ?
within minutes of the result of the referendum becoming known , some of the wonkiest minds in europe were speculating as to how the european union could dig itself out of the ireland-shaped hole that it had fallen into .
some options are too horrible to contemplate ; the idea of reopening the treaty for wholesale renegotiation is one .
seven long years of institutional navel gazing have already been spent creating the incomprehensible mess that is the lisbon treaty .
there is no appetite whatsoever among diplomats and officials to start the whole thing again .
for the same reason the option of just scrapping the treaty and carrying on as before is medicine that is probably too ghastly to swallow voluntarily .
even if several studies have shown that the union of 27 member states functions pretty well with the institutional structure designed for 15 , there are serious players that want the changes laid out in the treaty and will not give them up without a fight at the say-so of fewer than a million stroppy irish voters .
that 's why , in among the expressions of regret over and respect for the result , europe 's leaders also called for ratification in other eu countries to go ahead .
they want to leave open the door that the irish have tried to slam shut .
' whisky and a revolver ' sceptics may cry foul ; but ireland did not vote on behalf of europe 's voiceless masses , it voted on behalf of ireland .
irish voters give their reasons for voting no or yes for the lisbon treaty in pictures so one theory doing the rounds is that the 26 other eu countries might move ahead with the lisbon treaty without ireland .
it 's a neat idea .
but it is difficult to see how it works , unless it means giving the irish the eu equivalent of a glass of whisky and a revolver and asking it to do the decent thing .
no , the real reason that countries such as the uk are being urged to continue with the ratification process is because lurking at the back of everybody 's mind is the thought that , once all the other countries have ratified , ireland might be asked to vote again , and come up with the right answer this time .
the irish prime minister left this option on the table when he spoke on friday evening immediately after the official result was announced .
" it is our duty now to reflect on the implications of this vote for ireland so that we can move forward and keep this country on the path of progress , " he said .
array of objections there is precedent for this ; ireland voted " no " in 2001 to the nice treaty ; in the months that followed , with a protocol here and an annex there , it was presented with a treaty that allegedly added protection for ireland 's neutral status .
at the end of the day , for a myriad of reasons , the people have spoken dermot ahern , justice minister eu mulls options after no vote mark mardell 's euroblog in quotes : referendum reaction a second vote was held in 2002 and nice was duly passed .
the list of reasons why this might not work this time around is very long .
most analysts point to the low turnout in 2001 as the reason for the nice treaty 's defeat .
in the 2002 vote , ireland 's " natural yes " voters were persuaded to come and vote .
but in 2008 the picture is very different .
the " no " vote has grown ; turnout last week was a whopping 53 % - higher than that of the second nice referendum .
in 2001 there appeared to be one unifying reason -lrb- beyond low turnout -rrb- for the " no " vote - concern over ireland 's neutral status .
but anyone who spent time with voters during this campaign was presented with a bewildering array of objections to the treaty .
among them : abortion , neutrality , tax sovereignty , military conscription , the loss of an irish commissioner , the deregulation of the taxi trade and , of course , the desire to give the government of the day - not to mention the ubiquitous " eurocrats " - a good kicking .
amending the lisbon treaty to encompass those objections would challenge even the mightiest euro-minds .
then there 's the question of political timing .
getting people to vote again is a good trick .
but there 's a limit to how many times you can pull it .
irish voters may have other things on their mind than the re-weighting of votes in the council of ministers .
they are not dumb , and they may get more than a little irritated at being asked to vote over and over again until they come up with the right answer .

irresistible force - the referendum - has met immoveable object - the need for every eu member state to ratify the lisbon treaty .
so where next ?
within minutes of the result of the referendum becoming known , some of the wonkiest minds in europe were speculating as to how the european union could dig itself out of the ireland-shaped hole that it had fallen into .
some options are too horrible to contemplate ; the idea of reopening the treaty for wholesale renegotiation is one .
seven long years of institutional navel gazing have already been spent creating the incomprehensible mess that is the lisbon treaty .
there is no appetite whatsoever among diplomats and officials to start the whole thing again .
for the same reason the option of just scrapping the treaty and carrying on as before is medicine that is probably too ghastly to swallow voluntarily .
even if several studies have shown that the union of 27 member states functions pretty well with the institutional structure designed for 15 , there are serious players that want the changes laid out in the treaty and will not give them up without a fight at the say-so of fewer than a million stroppy irish voters .
that 's why , in among the expressions of regret over and respect for the result , europe 's leaders also called for ratification in other eu countries to go ahead .
they want to leave open the door that the irish have tried to slam shut .
' whisky and a revolver ' sceptics may cry foul ; but ireland did not vote on behalf of europe 's voiceless masses , it voted on behalf of ireland .
irish voters give their reasons for voting no or yes for the lisbon treaty in pictures so one theory doing the rounds is that the 26 other eu countries might move ahead with the lisbon treaty without ireland .
it 's a neat idea .
but it is difficult to see how it works , unless it means giving the irish the eu equivalent of a glass of whisky and a revolver and asking it to do the decent thing .
no , the real reason that countries such as the uk are being urged to continue with the ratification process is because lurking at the back of everybody 's mind is the thought that , once all the other countries have ratified , ireland might be asked to vote again , and come up with the right answer this time .
the irish prime minister left this option on the table when he spoke on friday evening immediately after the official result was announced .
" it is our duty now to reflect on the implications of this vote for ireland so that we can move forward and keep this country on the path of progress , " he said .
array of objections there is precedent for this ; ireland voted " no " in 2001 to the nice treaty ; in the months that followed , with a protocol here and an annex there , it was presented with a treaty that allegedly added protection for ireland 's neutral status .
at the end of the day , for a myriad of reasons , the people have spoken dermot ahern , justice minister eu mulls options after no vote mark mardell 's euroblog in quotes : referendum reaction a second vote was held in 2002 and nice was duly passed .
the list of reasons why this might not work this time around is very long .
most analysts point to the low turnout in 2001 as the reason for the nice treaty 's defeat .
in the 2002 vote , ireland 's " natural yes " voters were persuaded to come and vote .
but in 2008 the picture is very different .
the " no " vote has grown ; turnout last week was a whopping 53 % - higher than that of the second nice referendum .
in 2001 there appeared to be one unifying reason -lrb- beyond low turnout -rrb- for the " no " vote - concern over ireland 's neutral status .
but anyone who spent time with voters during this campaign was presented with a bewildering array of objections to the treaty .
among them : abortion , neutrality , tax sovereignty , military conscription , the loss of an irish commissioner , the deregulation of the taxi trade and , of course , the desire to give the government of the day - not to mention the ubiquitous " eurocrats " - a good kicking .
amending the lisbon treaty to encompass those objections would challenge even the mightiest euro-minds .
then there 's the question of political timing .
getting people to vote again is a good trick .
but there 's a limit to how many times you can pull it .
irish voters may have other things on their mind than the re-weighting of votes in the council of ministers .
they are not dumb , and they may get more than a little irritated at being asked to vote over and over again until they come up with the right answer .
and as the irish economy hits a particularly rocky patch , who is to say that ireland 's voters are going to be in a better mood in six months time , if they are asked to vote again ?
on the monday before the vote brian cowen was asked whether the treaty was dead if ireland voted against it .
" obviously " , came back his reply .
come late friday he 'd changed his mind .
but given the range of deeply unpalatable alternatives , maybe , just maybe , he was right first time around .

irresistible force - the referendum - has met immoveable object - the need for every eu member state to ratify the lisbon treaty .
so where next ?
within minutes of the result of the referendum becoming known , some of the wonkiest minds in europe were speculating as to how the european union could dig itself out of the ireland-shaped hole that it had fallen into .
some options are too horrible to contemplate ; the idea of reopening the treaty for wholesale renegotiation is one .
seven long years of institutional navel gazing have already been spent creating the incomprehensible mess that is the lisbon treaty .
there is no appetite whatsoever among diplomats and officials to start the whole thing again .
for the same reason the option of just scrapping the treaty and carrying on as before is medicine that is probably too ghastly to swallow voluntarily .
even if several studies have shown that the union of 27 member states functions pretty well with the institutional structure designed for 15 , there are serious players that want the changes laid out in the treaty and will not give them up without a fight at the say-so of fewer than a million stroppy irish voters .
that 's why , in among the expressions of regret over and respect for the result , europe 's leaders also called for ratification in other eu countries to go ahead .
they want to leave open the door that the irish have tried to slam shut .
' whisky and a revolver ' sceptics may cry foul ; but ireland did not vote on behalf of europe 's voiceless masses , it voted on behalf of ireland .
so one theory doing the rounds is that the 26 other eu countries might move ahead with the lisbon treaty without ireland .
it 's a neat idea .
but it is difficult to see how it works , unless it means giving the irish the eu equivalent of a glass of whisky and a revolver and asking it to do the decent thing .
no , the real reason that countries such as the uk are being urged to continue with the ratification process is because lurking at the back of everybody 's mind is the thought that , once all the other countries have ratified , ireland might be asked to vote again , and come up with the right answer this time .
the irish prime minister left this option on the table when he spoke on friday evening immediately after the official result was announced .
" it is our duty now to reflect on the implications of this vote for ireland so that we can move forward and keep this country on the path of progress , " he said .
array of objections there is precedent for this ; ireland voted " no " in 2001 to the nice treaty ; in the months that followed , with a protocol here and an annex there , it was presented with a treaty that allegedly added protection for ireland 's neutral status . "
at the end of the day , for a myriad of reasons , the people have spoken " dermot ahern , justice minister eu mulls options after no vote mark mardell 's euroblog in quotes : referendum reaction a second vote was held in 2002 and nice was duly passed .
the list of reasons why this might not work this time around is very long .
most analysts point to the low turnout in 2001 as the reason for the nice treaty 's defeat .
in the 2002 vote , ireland 's " natural yes " voters were persuaded to come and vote .
but in 2008 the picture is very different .
the " no " vote has grown ; turnout last week was a whopping 53 % - higher than that of the second nice referendum .
in 2001 there appeared to be one unifying reason -lrb- beyond low turnout -rrb- for the " no " vote - concern over ireland 's neutral status .
but anyone who spent time with voters during this campaign was presented with a bewildering array of objections to the treaty .
among them : abortion , neutrality , tax sovereignty , military conscription , the loss of an irish commissioner , the deregulation of the taxi trade and , of course , the desire to give the government of the day - not to mention the ubiquitous " eurocrats " - a good kicking .
amending the lisbon treaty to encompass those objections would challenge even the mightiest euro-minds .
then there 's the question of political timing .
getting people to vote again is a good trick .
but there 's a limit to how many times you can pull it .
irish voters may have other things on their mind than the re-weighting of votes in the council of ministers .
they are not dumb , and they may get more than a little irritated at being asked to vote over and over again until they come up with the right answer .
and as the irish economy hits a particularly rocky patch , who is to say that ireland 's voters are going to be in a better mood in six months time , if they are asked to vote again ?
on the monday before the vote brian cowen was asked whether the treaty was dead if ireland voted against it .
" obviously " , came back his reply .
come late friday he 'd changed his mind .
but given the range of deeply unpalatable alternatives , maybe , just maybe , he was right first time around .
