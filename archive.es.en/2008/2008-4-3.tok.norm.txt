merkel calls on brazil to make biofuel production sustainable as biofuels fall from grace , a new generation grabs spotlight germany defends biofuels , hedges bets on energy goals german minister calls for reversal of eu agricultural policy environment -pipe- 03.04.2008 german cars ca n't handle biofuels , environment plan at risk großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : experts said too many cars in germany would n't be able to handle biofuel blends the german government 's plan to introduce a new biofuel blend may now be postponed .
far too many cars are not able to process the fuel , industry sources said , putting a dent in the environment plan . auto industry sources said on that more than 2 million cars in germany would not be able to handle biofuels , thereby exceeding a 1-million limit the german government had set as a pre-condition for use . the sources said that some 330,000 cars made by german manufacturers , as well as more than 2 million imported cars , could not run on the new fuel and that the cars ' owners would be forced to fill up with higher octane , more expensive types of gas . the controversial plan to include a 10-percent biofuel blend plans could be slowed if it seemed likely that vehicle engines would be damaged by the mixture , a spokesperson for the german environment ministry said on wednesday , april 2 . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : biofuel blends are part of a larger german environment plan that includes reducing emissions environment minister sigmar gabriel had earlier said he would annul a government decree for the fuel , called e-10 , be introduced if too many cars were unable to run on it . " we wo n't put this regulation into effect if more than 1 million vehicles are affected , " gabriel told the stuttgarter nachrichten newspaper . part of a larger emissions reduction plan the german law would require regular gasoline to be mixed with 10 percent plant-based ethanol , called " e-10 , " and diesel to be mixed with 7 percent fuel made of plant origin by next year .
by 2020 , the ratio is supposed to rise to 17 percent . it is part of a larger plan to curb emissions , with eu states agreeing last year to reduce emissions by at least one-fifth by 2020 from 1990 levels , to use 20 percent of renewable energy sources in power production and 10 percent of biofuels from crops for transportation , also by 2020 . a change in the biofuel plan would demand possibly altering the overall targets . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : rapeseed can also be used as a biofuel adac , germany 's central motoring club , said that biofuels would damage the hoses and gaskets in 3 million cars on german roads , forcing those car owners to buy a more expensive , non-plant super grade of gas instead .
adac called for the introduction of e-10 to be delayed until 2012 . gabriel has said he will await figures from the auto industry on the number of cars actually unable to use the fuel before making a final decision on whether or not to introduce the plan . environmentalists critical of biofuel farming environmentalist organizations are critical of the plan themselves , albeit for a different reason .
greenpeace said on wednesday that the german plan to blend diesel with biodiesel to combat climate change is detrimental . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : diesel , unleaded , super , and biofuel blends are showing up at the pumps the group said it had tested fossil diesel sold at over 40 filling stations across germany to determine which vegetable oils were used in compulsory biodiesel blends .
it found that around 20 percent was soy oil rather than rapeseed oil from the german harvest . greenpeace said in a statement that germany 's blending policy would not help to fight global warming since soy oil imports largely came from south america , where tropical rain forests were being slashed to cultivate soybeans . " huge areas of tropical rain forests are being destroyed for the new plantations , for example in argentina , " the organization said . but , germany 's biofuels industry association told reuters news service that greenpeace 's charges were unjustified , and that soy oil comes from north america , argentina and brazil . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : straw turned into biofuel ?
you bet !
" soy oil from the us and argentina does not have rain forest issues , " vdb chief executive petra sprick said . "
imports from brazil are largely handled by major trading houses such as adm , bunge and cargill , which have voluntary agreements only to purchase soy oil from sustainable agriculture and not from areas using cleared tropical rain forests . " germany made the blending of biodiesel with fossil diesel at oil refineries compulsory in january 2007 as part of its policies to combat global warming .

merkel calls on brazil to make biofuel production sustainable as biofuels fall from grace , a new generation grabs spotlight germany defends biofuels , hedges bets on energy goals german minister calls for reversal of eu agricultural policy environment -pipe- 03.04.2008 german cars ca n't handle biofuels , environment plan at risk großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : experts said too many cars in germany would n't be able to handle biofuel blends the german government 's plan to introduce a new biofuel blend may now be postponed .
far too many cars are not able to process the fuel , industry sources said , putting a dent in the environment plan . auto industry sources said on that more than 2 million cars in germany would not be able to handle biofuels , thereby exceeding a 1-million limit the german government had set as a pre-condition for use . the sources said that some 330,000 cars made by german manufacturers , as well as more than 2 million imported cars , could not run on the new fuel and that the cars ' owners would be forced to fill up with higher octane , more expensive types of gas . the controversial plan to include a 10-percent biofuel blend plans could be slowed if it seemed likely that vehicle engines would be damaged by the mixture , a spokesperson for the german environment ministry said on wednesday , april 2 . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : biofuel blends are part of a larger german environment plan that includes reducing emissions environment minister sigmar gabriel had earlier said he would annul a government decree for the fuel , called e-10 , be introduced if too many cars were unable to run on it . " we wo n't put this regulation into effect if more than 1 million vehicles are affected , " gabriel told the stuttgarter nachrichten newspaper . part of a larger emissions reduction plan the german law would require regular gasoline to be mixed with 10 percent plant-based ethanol , called " e-10 , " and diesel to be mixed with 7 percent fuel made of plant origin by next year .
by 2020 , the ratio is supposed to rise to 17 percent . it is part of a larger plan to curb emissions , with eu states agreeing last year to reduce emissions by at least one-fifth by 2020 from 1990 levels , to use 20 percent of renewable energy sources in power production and 10 percent of biofuels from crops for transportation , also by 2020 . a change in the biofuel plan would demand possibly altering the overall targets . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : rapeseed can also be used as a biofuel adac , germany 's central motoring club , said that biofuels would damage the hoses and gaskets in 3 million cars on german roads , forcing those car owners to buy a more expensive , non-plant super grade of gas instead .
adac called for the introduction of e-10 to be delayed until 2012 . gabriel has said he will await figures from the auto industry on the number of cars actually unable to use the fuel before making a final decision on whether or not to introduce the plan . environmentalists critical of biofuel farming environmentalist organizations are critical of the plan themselves , albeit for a different reason .
greenpeace said on wednesday that the german plan to blend diesel with biodiesel to combat climate change is detrimental . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : diesel , unleaded , super , and biofuel blends are showing up at the pumps the group said it had tested fossil diesel sold at over 40 filling stations across germany to determine which vegetable oils were used in compulsory biodiesel blends .
it found that around 20 percent was soy oil rather than rapeseed oil from the german harvest . greenpeace said in a statement that germany 's blending policy would not help to fight global warming since soy oil imports largely came from south america , where tropical rain forests were being slashed to cultivate soybeans . " huge areas of tropical rain forests are being destroyed for the new plantations , for example in argentina , " the organization said . but , germany 's biofuels industry association told reuters news service that greenpeace 's charges were unjustified , and that soy oil comes from north america , argentina and brazil . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : straw turned into biofuel ?
you bet !
" soy oil from the us and argentina does not have rain forest issues , " vdb chief executive petra sprick said . "
imports from brazil are largely handled by major trading houses such as adm , bunge and cargill , which have voluntary agreements only to purchase soy oil from sustainable agriculture and not from areas using cleared tropical rain forests . " germany made the blending of biodiesel with fossil diesel at oil refineries compulsory in january 2007 as part of its policies to combat global warming .

the recent case of a 71-year-old man who had a need to stockpile likely did n't involve tv shopping - this man 's primary passion was guns .
the estate lawyer sent out to look at the man 's apartment in the western city of aachen after his death found 71 rifles , revolvers , and pistols along with other weapons he had built himself .
" there were 71 guns - one for each year of his life , " said police spokesman paul kemen .
" he also had 41 cases of ammunition and five walking sticks fitted with retractable blades . "
the man did not have a permit to own weapons , and retractable blades are illegal in germany .
although guns were a special love , the collector did n't limit himself to just weapons .
according to neighbors , the man , who lived alone , collected everything from garden tools to watches .
" the house was stuffed to the rafters , " heiner hautermans , a reporter at the aachener nachrichten newspaper , told reuters .
" by the end , the neighbors said he had to sleep in a hotel sometimes because there was no more room . " dw staff -lrb- jam -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

far too many cars are not able to process the fuel , industry sources said , putting a dent in the environment plan . auto industry sources said on that more than 2 million cars in germany would not be able to handle biofuels , thereby exceeding a 1-million limit the german government had set as a pre-condition for use . the sources said that some 330,000 cars made by german manufacturers , as well as more than 2 million imported cars , could not run on the new fuel and that the cars ' owners would be forced to fill up with higher octane , more expensive types of gas . the controversial plan to include a 10-percent biofuel blend plans could be slowed if it seemed likely that vehicle engines would be damaged by the mixture , a spokesperson for the german environment ministry said on wednesday , april 2 . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : biofuel blends are part of a larger german environment plan that includes reducing emissions environment minister sigmar gabriel had earlier said he would annul a government decree for the fuel , called e-10 , be introduced if too many cars were unable to run on it . " we wo n't put this regulation into effect if more than 1 million vehicles are affected , " gabriel told the stuttgarter nachrichten newspaper . part of a larger emissions reduction plan the german law would require regular gasoline to be mixed with 10 percent plant-based ethanol , called " e-10 , " and diesel to be mixed with 7 percent fuel made of plant origin by next year .
by 2020 , the ratio is supposed to rise to 17 percent . it is part of a larger plan to curb emissions , with eu states agreeing last year to reduce emissions by at least one-fifth by 2020 from 1990 levels , to use 20 percent of renewable energy sources in power production and 10 percent of biofuels from crops for transportation , also by 2020 . a change in the biofuel plan would demand possibly altering the overall targets . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : rapeseed can also be used as a biofuel adac , germany 's central motoring club , said that biofuels would damage the hoses and gaskets in 3 million cars on german roads , forcing those car owners to buy a more expensive , non-plant super grade of gas instead .
adac called for the introduction of e-10 to be delayed until 2012 . gabriel has said he will await figures from the auto industry on the number of cars actually unable to use the fuel before making a final decision on whether or not to introduce the plan . environmentalists critical of biofuel farming environmentalist organizations are critical of the plan themselves , albeit for a different reason .
greenpeace said on wednesday that the german plan to blend diesel with biodiesel to combat climate change is detrimental . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : diesel , unleaded , super , and biofuel blends are showing up at the pumps the group said it had tested fossil diesel sold at over 40 filling stations across germany to determine which vegetable oils were used in compulsory biodiesel blends .
it found that around 20 percent was soy oil rather than rapeseed oil from the german harvest . greenpeace said in a statement that germany 's blending policy would not help to fight global warming since soy oil imports largely came from south america , where tropical rain forests were being slashed to cultivate soybeans . " huge areas of tropical rain forests are being destroyed for the new plantations , for example in argentina , " the organization said . but , germany 's biofuels industry association told reuters news service that greenpeace 's charges were unjustified , and that soy oil comes from north america , argentina and brazil . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : straw turned into biofuel ?

" germany made the blending of biodiesel with fossil diesel at oil refineries compulsory in january 2007 as part of its policies to combat global warming .

the opening is now scheduled for december . no precise opening date has been set for the prestige project , which will be supplanting a more modest corporate museum , but the inauguration is expected to take place by the end of the year , the carmaker said on wednesday , april 2 . construction of what has been billed as a new architectural landmark for the region began in 2005 at the company campus in the suburb of zuffenhausen , and was supposed to have been completed early last year . the 5,600 square meters -lrb- 60,277 square feet -rrb- of display space is to showcase 80 immaculately preserved porsche cars , replacing the old , 600-square-meter museum , which only had room for 20 of the company 's collection of 300 historic cars . but the ambitious scale of the undertaking caused hitches early on .
designed by the delugan meissl architectural office in vienna , the triangular museum built on concrete stilts is a unique project requiring complex engineering - and it soon became clear that the original completion deadline would not be met , despite the 40 different companies hired to see it through . at a press conference wednesday , spokesman anton hunger moreover said the budget of 50 million euros -lrb- $ 78 million -rrb- had proved insufficient and would rise to a " high two-digit number in the millions . " building the best bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the mercedes museum recent years have seen germany 's luxury carmakers racing to build the biggest and best museum , with bmw in munich and volkswagen in wolfsburg among the companies spending fortunes on exhibition spaces and theme parks . porsche 's eagerly-awaited futuristic-looking museum is specifically designed to rival the nearby mercedes-benz center , an 83 million euro facility hailed an architectural masterpiece when it opened in 2006 , and one which fast became a popular tourist magnet . positioned directly outside the main gate of the daimler factory in the untertuerkheim district , the spiral building was designed by the un studio of amsterdam and is based on a unique cloverleaf concept using three overlapping circles with the center removed to form a triangular atrium . the building 's height and " double helix " interior were designed to maximize space , providing 16,500 square meters of exhibition premises on a footprint of just 4,800 square meters .
clad in shimmering silver panels , the museum houses 80 passenger cars , 40 commercial trucks , and 40 racing cars and trucks with more than 1,500 displays from the company 's 120-year history . long-time rivalry bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : mercedes dominates the stuttgart skyline porsche was determined not to be outstripped .
but in fact , the company has long stood in the shadow of mercedes down in baden-wuerttemberg . stuttgart 's industrial heritage is a source of much pride to locals , and the region has always profited from the ongoing rivalry between the luxury carmakers , with each company trying to up its profile by funding competing museums and arenas . but ultimately , the city tends to identify most with the mercedes-benz brand , and the daimler firm has succeeded most obviously in conquering the stuttgart skyline . in comparison , porsche is something of a poor relation , forever trying to emulate and outdo its rival mercedes .
and in the race to erect the best museum , porsche , for the time being , is lagging behind . dw staff -lrb- jp -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

the carmaker called the program disproportionate , illegal and unfair . the german luxury sports car maker lodged papers at the royal courts of justice on wednesday , april 2 , in a bid to stop london mayor ken livingstone 's proposed charge . under the mayor 's plan , from october , people with cars that emit more than 225 grams of carbon dioxide per kilometer - such as sports utility vehicles and high-powered performance cars - will pay a daily charge of 25 pounds -lrb- $ 49.70 , 31.75 euros -rrb- to drive into central london . " not only is this new tax on motorists unfair , it is also a disproportionate and illegal use of power by the mayor , " said andy goss , managing director of porsche cars gb , after the judicial review papers were filed . " the porsche case is about protecting london and londoners from a new tax that will not only fail to reduce carbon dioxide emissions in central london , but also increase congestion and damage air quality . " a judge will now have to decide within the next few days whether to proceed with the case . not backing down livingstone appeared to be unswayed by porsche 's criticism and vowed to fight the legal action . " porsche 's self-serving legal action shows their continuing contempt for the views of londoners , " he said .
" porsche should be using its engineering expertise to create low-polluting cars , not its lawyers to oppose the democratic wishes of londoners . according to a recent poll , 61 percent of londoners approve of increasing the congestion tax for gas-guzzling vehicles . he added : " londoners , not car manufacturers , should be the ones to decide how to tackle pollution in their city .
i will vigorously contest porsche 's legal action . " elections might change things however , the pollution charge may never be imposed . londoners vote in mayoral elections on may 1 and opinion polls have put livingstone 's main rival boris johnson in the lead .
the conservative candidate has vowed to ditch livingstone 's plan . it is the latest program targeting london 's traffic pollution and congestion problems . for five years , london has been assessing drivers a daily congestion charge , now set at eight pounds , to drive into the central city and a large swath around it .
the fee was designed to tackle the bottlenecks that have turned much of london into a parking lot . the uk capital is the biggest urban area in the world to charge such a toll and city officials from around the globe have considered copying the idea . dw staff -lrb- jam -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

" there were 71 guns - one for each year of his life , " said police spokesman paul kemen .
" he also had 41 cases of ammunition and five walking sticks fitted with retractable blades . "
the man did not have a permit to own weapons , and retractable blades are illegal in germany .
although guns were a special love , the collector did n't limit himself to just weapons .
according to neighbors , the man , who lived alone , collected everything from garden tools to watches .
" the house was stuffed to the rafters , " heiner hautermans , a reporter at the aachener nachrichten newspaper , told reuters .

the opening is now scheduled for december . no precise opening date has been set for the prestige project , which will be supplanting a more modest corporate museum , but the inauguration is expected to take place by the end of the year , the carmaker said on wednesday , april 2 . construction of what has been billed as a new architectural landmark for the region began in 2005 at the company campus in the suburb of zuffenhausen , and was supposed to have been completed early last year . the 5,600 square meters -lrb- 60,277 square feet -rrb- of display space is to showcase 80 immaculately preserved porsche cars , replacing the old , 600-square-meter museum , which only had room for 20 of the company 's collection of 300 historic cars . but the ambitious scale of the undertaking caused hitches early on .
designed by the delugan meissl architectural office in vienna , the triangular museum built on concrete stilts is a unique project requiring complex engineering - and it soon became clear that the original completion deadline would not be met , despite the 40 different companies hired to see it through . at a press conference wednesday , spokesman anton hunger moreover said the budget of 50 million euros -lrb- $ 78 million -rrb- had proved insufficient and would rise to a " high two-digit number in the millions . " building the best bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the mercedes museum recent years have seen germany 's luxury carmakers racing to build the biggest and best museum , with bmw in munich and volkswagen in wolfsburg among the companies spending fortunes on exhibition spaces and theme parks . porsche 's eagerly-awaited futuristic-looking museum is specifically designed to rival the nearby mercedes-benz center , an 83 million euro facility hailed an architectural masterpiece when it opened in 2006 , and one which fast became a popular tourist magnet . positioned directly outside the main gate of the daimler factory in the untertuerkheim district , the spiral building was designed by the un studio of amsterdam and is based on a unique cloverleaf concept using three overlapping circles with the center removed to form a triangular atrium . the building 's height and " double helix " interior were designed to maximize space , providing 16,500 square meters of exhibition premises on a footprint of just 4,800 square meters .
clad in shimmering silver panels , the museum houses 80 passenger cars , 40 commercial trucks , and 40 racing cars and trucks with more than 1,500 displays from the company 's 120-year history . long-time rivalry bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : mercedes dominates the stuttgart skyline porsche was determined not to be outstripped .
but in fact , the company has long stood in the shadow of mercedes down in baden-wuerttemberg . stuttgart 's industrial heritage is a source of much pride to locals , and the region has always profited from the ongoing rivalry between the luxury carmakers , with each company trying to up its profile by funding competing museums and arenas . but ultimately , the city tends to identify most with the mercedes-benz brand , and the daimler firm has succeeded most obviously in conquering the stuttgart skyline . in comparison , porsche is something of a poor relation , forever trying to emulate and outdo its rival mercedes .
and in the race to erect the best museum , porsche , for the time being , is lagging behind . dw staff -lrb- jp -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

the carmaker called the program disproportionate , illegal and unfair . the german luxury sports car maker lodged papers at the royal courts of justice on wednesday , april 2 , in a bid to stop london mayor ken livingstone 's proposed charge . under the mayor 's plan , from october , people with cars that emit more than 225 grams of carbon dioxide per kilometer - such as sports utility vehicles and high-powered performance cars - will pay a daily charge of 25 pounds -lrb- $ 49.70 , 31.75 euros -rrb- to drive into central london . " not only is this new tax on motorists unfair , it is also a disproportionate and illegal use of power by the mayor , " said andy goss , managing director of porsche cars gb , after the judicial review papers were filed . " the porsche case is about protecting london and londoners from a new tax that will not only fail to reduce carbon dioxide emissions in central london , but also increase congestion and damage air quality . " a judge will now have to decide within the next few days whether to proceed with the case . not backing down livingstone appeared to be unswayed by porsche 's criticism and vowed to fight the legal action . " porsche 's self-serving legal action shows their continuing contempt for the views of londoners , " he said .
" porsche should be using its engineering expertise to create low-polluting cars , not its lawyers to oppose the democratic wishes of londoners . according to a recent poll , 61 percent of londoners approve of increasing the congestion tax for gas-guzzling vehicles . he added : " londoners , not car manufacturers , should be the ones to decide how to tackle pollution in their city .
i will vigorously contest porsche 's legal action . " elections might change things however , the pollution charge may never be imposed . londoners vote in mayoral elections on may 1 and opinion polls have put livingstone 's main rival boris johnson in the lead .
the conservative candidate has vowed to ditch livingstone 's plan . it is the latest program targeting london 's traffic pollution and congestion problems . for five years , london has been assessing drivers a daily congestion charge , now set at eight pounds , to drive into the central city and a large swath around it .
the fee was designed to tackle the bottlenecks that have turned much of london into a parking lot . the uk capital is the biggest urban area in the world to charge such a toll and city officials from around the globe have considered copying the idea . dw staff -lrb- jam -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

the late collector 's stockpiling instinct was so intense he drove himself out of his own home . over-eager collecting - it can come about through a variety of ways .

soon enough , another order 's been placed .
it can go downhill from here .
the recent case of a 71-year-old man who had a need to stockpile likely did n't involve tv shopping - this man 's primary passion was guns .
the estate lawyer sent out to look at the man 's apartment in the western city of aachen after his death found 71 rifles , revolvers , and pistols along with other weapons he had built himself .
" there were 71 guns - one for each year of his life , " said police spokesman paul kemen .
" he also had 41 cases of ammunition and five walking sticks fitted with retractable blades . "
the man did not have a permit to own weapons , and retractable blades are illegal in germany .
although guns were a special love , the collector did n't limit himself to just weapons .
according to neighbors , the man , who lived alone , collected everything from garden tools to watches .
" the house was stuffed to the rafters , " heiner hautermans , a reporter at the aachener nachrichten newspaper , told reuters .
" by the end , the neighbors said he had to sleep in a hotel sometimes because there was no more room . " dw staff -lrb- jam -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

he was also chief conductor of the vienna symphony orchestra , and the guiding force behind the salzburg festival , where he conducted for 33 years .
karajan died july 16 , 1989 . dw-world.de spoke with james oestreich , music and dance editor at the new york times , about von karajan 's significance in music history . dw-world.de : these days you ca n't look anywhere in the german media without seeing a story or documentary or article about the life of herbert von karajan .
what 's all the fuss about ? james oestreich : he was probably the most recorded conductor of his time .
it was a time when long-playing records were really taking off , and then digital recording came in and the cd came in , and he was riding that technology through the whole thing . he recorded everything , all the time , and he re-recorded things .
he recorded the brahms symphonies three times , i believe , and the beethoven symphonies three times .
so he was simply everywhere . to boot , he was in many ways a fantastic conductor .
he had his shortcomings , as many people do .
but what he did well , he did extremely well .
and he had at that time one of the world 's greatest orchestras , if not the world 's greatest orchestra , performing for him . bildunterschrift : karajan conducts the berlin philharmonic in 1987 can you name a highlight ? his 1960s recordings of the beethoven symphonies were classic .
they were the way i , among many others , got to know the beethoven symphonies .
so they were kind of my standard , and many people 's standard for those works . what effect does a superstar conductor have on an orchestra ?
is it purely good news - more revenue and publicity - or can it also be damaging ? well it can be either .
in this case , he and the orchestra were so closely identified after so many years , and it was the coming together of two superstar names : karajan and the berlin philharmonic . ...
a music director is n't just a conductor .
he is someone who builds the orchestra in addition to conducting it .
in this case , karajan had built up this orchestra over a number of years , and made it into a sensational machine .
they played beautifully for him . to what do you attribute the ongoing interest in karajan ? well , there is the factor of permanence , for one thing .
it helps karajan and hurts people today .
it used to be that people 's vinyl lps would wear down and become unplayable .
now , digital recordings are permanent .
so there are these recordings that were the standard of their time , and they remain with us , and become standards of this time , too . it makes it difficult for people to come up with recording projects today , because all these standards are still readily available . in karajan 's case , there was also this international renown that he had .
when japan was warming to classical music - to put it mildly - 20 or 30 years ago , karajan was almost synonymous with classical music there .
so there is a built-in audience all around the world for his recordings . karajan had an international career , but was still very much a german and austrian conductor .
now an englishman , sir simon rattle , leads the berlin philharmonic . does nationality have a role in orchestras today ? it has become less relevant .
it used to be that orchestras from different countries had different sounds - the russians had very piercing brass instruments , the germans had tremendous warmth in their string sound .
as conductors travel around the world , and players go from orchestra to orchestra , and sometimes from country to country , those things have greatly diminished , in the last 30 or 40 years . that 's the way of the world .
but some of us yearn , to some extent , for the old days , when there were those characteristic sounds of orchestras .
when nobody could play german music like the germans and nobody could play french music like the french . one of the most frequently debated aspects of karajan 's life is the fact that he joined the nazi party in 1933 .
modern biographers have argued it was a political career move , rather than an ideological one .
still , he conducted for hitler and other top nazis , who revered him .
how important is this aspect of his biography ? bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : german composer and conductor richard strauss well , it is a very important aspect .
and he is far from alone in any of this .
-lsb- german conductor wilhelm -rsb- furtwaengler , of course , had many of the same problems ... and -lsb- german composer -rsb- richard strauss was the head of the nazi music chamber .
so karajan was far from alone . it 's a very unfortunate aspect of his biography , but it does n't mitigate his music making in any way , i do n't think .
there were a lot of bad things happening in those days , and he was part of it . if you read about karajan in the press , it is hard to find anyone neutral .
the musicians who played for him adored him , as did a large public .
yet many writers today criticize his sound as being too " cold " and technical , and take his perfectionism to task .
what 's your take ? well , i do n't find his music making cold .
it was certainly very lush , and that was problematic in some ways .
i remember a recording came out of bach and stravinsky , and for me the funny thing about that record is that karajan was out of his depth on both ends .
his big , lush bach sound is totally out of date today , now that the early music movement has brought back the smallness of sound from the baroque era .
and in the case of stravinsky - a very angular , modern sound - again , karajan 's sound is very lush and rich .
it missed the angles and it missed a lot of the music as a result . so , it was a style that did n't suit all types of music , but the music it suited , it suited very well .
there is a recording late in his life of mahler 's 9th symphony that is the opposite of cold .
its one of the great recordings ever made .
so i 'm not sure what people have in mind when they use a blanket term like cold to describe his music making . karajan was also known for leading an extravagant lifestyle , flying jets and driving race cars .
he was also criticized by some for ostensibly forcing concert ticket prices so high that only the wealthy could attend .
how did this affect the public 's view of him ? bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : karajan steps off the jet with his wife , eliette -lrb- left -rrb- and daughter isabella well , i do n't think karajan set concert prices .
karajan certainly made a lot of money and demanded a lot of money , but he was n't alone in that .
concerts were very expensive , especially at salzburg .
but it is far from just karajan .
yo yo ma , itzhak perlman - all sorts of people were demanding huge amounts of money .
and that 's what sent ticket prices soaring . so did his luxury lifestyle image act in his favor , or against him ? i think it humanized him .
toscanini was put on a pedestal by music lovers for a long time .
in this case it brought karajan in to a real world that people could identify with , or wished they had ...
i 'm sure the image was certainly part of the package . how do you suppose karajan will be remembered ? i think there are a lot of generalizations going around this year , and i think generalizations are always risky .
i do n't want to see him swamped , and go down in history with words like " cold " attached and " luxury " attached .
he was many things .
he was a very complex figure , and he was a great musician . interview : jennifer abramsohn send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

he was also chief conductor of the vienna symphony orchestra , and the guiding force behind the salzburg festival , where he conducted for 33 years .
karajan died july 16 , 1989 . dw-world.de spoke with james oestreich , music and dance editor at the new york times , about von karajan 's significance in music history . dw-world.de : these days you ca n't look anywhere in the german media without seeing a story or documentary or article about the life of herbert von karajan .
what 's all the fuss about ? james oestreich : he was probably the most recorded conductor of his time .
it was a time when long-playing records were really taking off , and then digital recording came in and the cd came in , and he was riding that technology through the whole thing . he recorded everything , all the time , and he re-recorded things .
he recorded the brahms symphonies three times , i believe , and the beethoven symphonies three times .
so he was simply everywhere . to boot , he was in many ways a fantastic conductor .
he had his shortcomings , as many people do .
but what he did well , he did extremely well .
and he had at that time one of the world 's greatest orchestras , if not the world 's greatest orchestra , performing for him . bildunterschrift : karajan conducts the berlin philharmonic in 1987 can you name a highlight ? his 1960s recordings of the beethoven symphonies were classic .
they were the way i , among many others , got to know the beethoven symphonies .
so they were kind of my standard , and many people 's standard for those works . what effect does a superstar conductor have on an orchestra ?
is it purely good news - more revenue and publicity - or can it also be damaging ? well it can be either .
in this case , he and the orchestra were so closely identified after so many years , and it was the coming together of two superstar names : karajan and the berlin philharmonic . ...
a music director is n't just a conductor .
he is someone who builds the orchestra in addition to conducting it .
in this case , karajan had built up this orchestra over a number of years , and made it into a sensational machine .
they played beautifully for him . to what do you attribute the ongoing interest in karajan ? well , there is the factor of permanence , for one thing .
it helps karajan and hurts people today .
it used to be that people 's vinyl lps would wear down and become unplayable .
now , digital recordings are permanent .
so there are these recordings that were the standard of their time , and they remain with us , and become standards of this time , too . it makes it difficult for people to come up with recording projects today , because all these standards are still readily available . in karajan 's case , there was also this international renown that he had .
when japan was warming to classical music - to put it mildly - 20 or 30 years ago , karajan was almost synonymous with classical music there .
so there is a built-in audience all around the world for his recordings . karajan had an international career , but was still very much a german and austrian conductor .
now an englishman , sir simon rattle , leads the berlin philharmonic . does nationality have a role in orchestras today ? it has become less relevant .
it used to be that orchestras from different countries had different sounds - the russians had very piercing brass instruments , the germans had tremendous warmth in their string sound .
as conductors travel around the world , and players go from orchestra to orchestra , and sometimes from country to country , those things have greatly diminished , in the last 30 or 40 years . that 's the way of the world .
but some of us yearn , to some extent , for the old days , when there were those characteristic sounds of orchestras .
when nobody could play german music like the germans and nobody could play french music like the french . one of the most frequently debated aspects of karajan 's life is the fact that he joined the nazi party in 1933 .
modern biographers have argued it was a political career move , rather than an ideological one .
still , he conducted for hitler and other top nazis , who revered him .
how important is this aspect of his biography ? bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : german composer and conductor richard strauss well , it is a very important aspect .
and he is far from alone in any of this .
-lsb- german conductor wilhelm -rsb- furtwaengler , of course , had many of the same problems ... and -lsb- german composer -rsb- richard strauss was the head of the nazi music chamber .
so karajan was far from alone . it 's a very unfortunate aspect of his biography , but it does n't mitigate his music making in any way , i do n't think .
there were a lot of bad things happening in those days , and he was part of it . if you read about karajan in the press , it is hard to find anyone neutral .
the musicians who played for him adored him , as did a large public .
yet many writers today criticize his sound as being too " cold " and technical , and take his perfectionism to task .
what 's your take ? well , i do n't find his music making cold .
it was certainly very lush , and that was problematic in some ways .
i remember a recording came out of bach and stravinsky , and for me the funny thing about that record is that karajan was out of his depth on both ends .
his big , lush bach sound is totally out of date today , now that the early music movement has brought back the smallness of sound from the baroque era .
and in the case of stravinsky - a very angular , modern sound - again , karajan 's sound is very lush and rich .
it missed the angles and it missed a lot of the music as a result . so , it was a style that did n't suit all types of music , but the music it suited , it suited very well .
there is a recording late in his life of mahler 's 9th symphony that is the opposite of cold .
its one of the great recordings ever made .
so i 'm not sure what people have in mind when they use a blanket term like cold to describe his music making . karajan was also known for leading an extravagant lifestyle , flying jets and driving race cars .
he was also criticized by some for ostensibly forcing concert ticket prices so high that only the wealthy could attend .
how did this affect the public 's view of him ? bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : karajan steps off the jet with his wife , eliette -lrb- left -rrb- and daughter isabella well , i do n't think karajan set concert prices .
karajan certainly made a lot of money and demanded a lot of money , but he was n't alone in that .
concerts were very expensive , especially at salzburg .
but it is far from just karajan .
yo yo ma , itzhak perlman - all sorts of people were demanding huge amounts of money .
and that 's what sent ticket prices soaring . so did his luxury lifestyle image act in his favor , or against him ? i think it humanized him .
toscanini was put on a pedestal by music lovers for a long time .
in this case it brought karajan in to a real world that people could identify with , or wished they had ...
i 'm sure the image was certainly part of the package . how do you suppose karajan will be remembered ? i think there are a lot of generalizations going around this year , and i think generalizations are always risky .
i do n't want to see him swamped , and go down in history with words like " cold " attached and " luxury " attached .
he was many things .
he was a very complex figure , and he was a great musician . interview : jennifer abramsohn send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

the musicians who played for him adored him , as did a large public .
yet many writers today criticize his sound as being too " cold " and technical , and take his perfectionism to task .
what 's your take ? well , i do n't find his music making cold .
it was certainly very lush , and that was problematic in some ways .
i remember a recording came out of bach and stravinsky , and for me the funny thing about that record is that karajan was out of his depth on both ends .
his big , lush bach sound is totally out of date today , now that the early music movement has brought back the smallness of sound from the baroque era .
and in the case of stravinsky - a very angular , modern sound - again , karajan 's sound is very lush and rich .
it missed the angles and it missed a lot of the music as a result . so , it was a style that did n't suit all types of music , but the music it suited , it suited very well .
there is a recording late in his life of mahler 's 9th symphony that is the opposite of cold .
its one of the great recordings ever made .
so i 'm not sure what people have in mind when they use a blanket term like cold to describe his music making . karajan was also known for leading an extravagant lifestyle , flying jets and driving race cars .
he was also criticized by some for ostensibly forcing concert ticket prices so high that only the wealthy could attend .
how did this affect the public 's view of him ? bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : karajan steps off the jet with his wife , eliette -lrb- left -rrb- and daughter isabella well , i do n't think karajan set concert prices .
karajan certainly made a lot of money and demanded a lot of money , but he was n't alone in that .
concerts were very expensive , especially at salzburg .
but it is far from just karajan .
yo yo ma , itzhak perlman - all sorts of people were demanding huge amounts of money .
and that 's what sent ticket prices soaring . so did his luxury lifestyle image act in his favor , or against him ? i think it humanized him .
toscanini was put on a pedestal by music lovers for a long time .
in this case it brought karajan in to a real world that people could identify with , or wished they had ...
i 'm sure the image was certainly part of the package . how do you suppose karajan will be remembered ? i think there are a lot of generalizations going around this year , and i think generalizations are always risky .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de music -pipe- 03.04.2008 critic explains allure of von karajan , 100 years and counting großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : great , but flawed : herbert von karajan -lrb- 1908-1989 -rrb- ahead of the 100th anniversary of the birth of famous orchestra director and conductor herbert von karajan on april 5 , dw-world.de talked about the maestro as a cultural icon with james oestreich of the new york times . in 1955 , von karajan - classical music 's most prolific recording artist - was named director of the berlin philharmonic orchestra , and was credited with creating its clean and distinctive sound during his 35-year tenure .
he was also chief conductor of the vienna symphony orchestra , and the guiding force behind the salzburg festival , where he conducted for 33 years .
karajan died july 16 , 1989 . dw-world.de spoke with james oestreich , music and dance editor at the new york times , about von karajan 's significance in music history . dw-world.de : these days you ca n't look anywhere in the german media without seeing a story or documentary or article about the life of herbert von karajan .
what 's all the fuss about ? james oestreich : he was probably the most recorded conductor of his time .
it was a time when long-playing records were really taking off , and then digital recording came in and the cd came in , and he was riding that technology through the whole thing . he recorded everything , all the time , and he re-recorded things .
he recorded the brahms symphonies three times , i believe , and the beethoven symphonies three times .
so he was simply everywhere . to boot , he was in many ways a fantastic conductor .
he had his shortcomings , as many people do .
but what he did well , he did extremely well .
and he had at that time one of the world 's greatest orchestras , if not the world 's greatest orchestra , performing for him . bildunterschrift : karajan conducts the berlin philharmonic in 1987 can you name a highlight ? his 1960s recordings of the beethoven symphonies were classic .
they were the way i , among many others , got to know the beethoven symphonies .
so they were kind of my standard , and many people 's standard for those works . what effect does a superstar conductor have on an orchestra ?
is it purely good news - more revenue and publicity - or can it also be damaging ? well it can be either .
in this case , he and the orchestra were so closely identified after so many years , and it was the coming together of two superstar names : karajan and the berlin philharmonic . ...
a music director is n't just a conductor .
he is someone who builds the orchestra in addition to conducting it .
in this case , karajan had built up this orchestra over a number of years , and made it into a sensational machine .
they played beautifully for him . to what do you attribute the ongoing interest in karajan ? well , there is the factor of permanence , for one thing .
it helps karajan and hurts people today .
it used to be that people 's vinyl lps would wear down and become unplayable .
now , digital recordings are permanent .
so there are these recordings that were the standard of their time , and they remain with us , and become standards of this time , too . it makes it difficult for people to come up with recording projects today , because all these standards are still readily available . in karajan 's case , there was also this international renown that he had .
when japan was warming to classical music - to put it mildly - 20 or 30 years ago , karajan was almost synonymous with classical music there .
so there is a built-in audience all around the world for his recordings . karajan had an international career , but was still very much a german and austrian conductor .
now an englishman , sir simon rattle , leads the berlin philharmonic . does nationality have a role in orchestras today ? it has become less relevant .
it used to be that orchestras from different countries had different sounds - the russians had very piercing brass instruments , the germans had tremendous warmth in their string sound .
as conductors travel around the world , and players go from orchestra to orchestra , and sometimes from country to country , those things have greatly diminished , in the last 30 or 40 years . that 's the way of the world .
but some of us yearn , to some extent , for the old days , when there were those characteristic sounds of orchestras .
when nobody could play german music like the germans and nobody could play french music like the french . one of the most frequently debated aspects of karajan 's life is the fact that he joined the nazi party in 1933 .
modern biographers have argued it was a political career move , rather than an ideological one .
still , he conducted for hitler and other top nazis , who revered him .
how important is this aspect of his biography ? bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : german composer and conductor richard strauss well , it is a very important aspect .
and he is far from alone in any of this .
-lsb- german conductor wilhelm -rsb- furtwaengler , of course , had many of the same problems ... and -lsb- german composer -rsb- richard strauss was the head of the nazi music chamber .
so karajan was far from alone . it 's a very unfortunate aspect of his biography , but it does n't mitigate his music making in any way , i do n't think .
there were a lot of bad things happening in those days , and he was part of it . if you read about karajan in the press , it is hard to find anyone neutral .
the musicians who played for him adored him , as did a large public .
yet many writers today criticize his sound as being too " cold " and technical , and take his perfectionism to task .
what 's your take ? well , i do n't find his music making cold .
it was certainly very lush , and that was problematic in some ways .
i remember a recording came out of bach and stravinsky , and for me the funny thing about that record is that karajan was out of his depth on both ends .
his big , lush bach sound is totally out of date today , now that the early music movement has brought back the smallness of sound from the baroque era .

" today more nations stepped forward with offers that will raise that total again , and very substantially , " nato secretary general jaap de hoop scheffer said at a news conference with afghan president hamid karzai and un secretary-general ban ki-moon . scheffer did not say how many troops were offered and referred specifically only to an offer by france to send an additional battalion , about 800 troops .
but he said it satisfied a canadian demand for reinforcements in its sector in southern afghanistan . the nato-led force in afghanistan currently numbers around 47,000 soliders . aiming for self-sufficiency the document , endorsed by the 26 nato members and by the 14 non-nato countries which contribute forces to the un-mandated operation , was welcomed by karzai .

the document underlines the importance in making afghan security forces self-sufficient and taking the lead in counter-insurgency operations .
it also highlights helping the afghan government to extend good governance , reconstruction and development throughout the country . on thursday , karzai announced that as from august , afghan forces would finally be able to take over security operations in the capital kabul . france steps up earlier thursday , french president nicolas sarkozy confirmed that his country would be sending an additional 700 soldiers to the east , thus helping alleviate us and canadian concerns that isaf is overstretched . the offer came amid french plans for a return to nato 's military command next year after more than four decades of absence . isaf has grown by some 4,000 soldiers to about 47,000 in recent months , and more troops are ready to step in from poland , the czech republic and other allies . with their strategic vision document , the allies vowed to support the afghan leadership , bring together civilian and military efforts , and increase cooperation with afghanistan 's neighbors , " especially pakistan . " it also urged nato members to provide " maximum possible flexibility " in the use of their troops and to fill the current shortfalls in manning levels - two issues which have sparked bitter disagreements in the past . a deep rift had emerged within nato over the past months , with some countries , spearheaded by the united states , insisting on the need to fight the insurgents and others , like germany and italy , placing the emphasis on the civilian nature of the isaf mission . two in , three out in a major rebuff to us president george w bush who is attending the last summit of the transatlantic alliance as us president , european leaders kept georgia and ukraine waiting at nato 's doorstep thursday .
they did , however , welcome albania and croatia . bush , eager to burnish his foreign policy legacy in the waning months of a presidency tarnished by iraq , had pushed hard for georgia and ukraine to be allowed into the nato club .
scheffer said nato would offer georgia and ukraine " intensive engagement " , along with a vague promise of membership sometime down the line .

the recent case of a 71-year-old man who had a need to stockpile likely did n't involve tv shopping - this man 's primary passion was guns .
the estate lawyer sent out to look at the man 's apartment in the western city of aachen after his death found 71 rifles , revolvers , and pistols along with other weapons he had built himself .
" there were 71 guns - one for each year of his life , " said police spokesman paul kemen .
" he also had 41 cases of ammunition and five walking sticks fitted with retractable blades . "
the man did not have a permit to own weapons , and retractable blades are illegal in germany .
although guns were a special love , the collector did n't limit himself to just weapons .
according to neighbors , the man , who lived alone , collected everything from garden tools to watches .
" the house was stuffed to the rafters , " heiner hautermans , a reporter at the aachener nachrichten newspaper , told reuters .

he also said he approved of fusions among the regional banks . " we have too many state banks that are too small , " he told the paper . several german banks have admitted to being hit by the subprime crisis , with mid-sized business lender ikb , for instance , receiving billions in help from state and public savings banks .
steinbrueck defended the use of domestic budget funds to help bail out ikb .

croatia and albania were formally invited to join , while macedonia was not . nato leaders were set on thursday , april 3 , to endorse a planned us missile shield for europe , a senior us official told reporters . the final summit statement would " recognize the substantive contribution to the protection of the allies " from the missile defense system to be deployed in the czech republic and poland , the official told reporters . " the united states and the czech republic are pleased to announce the completion of negotiations on a missile-defense agreement .
we plan to sign the agreement in the near future , " a statement said . french commitment the us official also said that president george w. bush had confirmed to the summit leaders that the us will be able to move some of its troops to afghanistan 's south once france sends a battalion of troops to the east of afghanistan , meeting canada 's conditions to keep troops in afghanistan until 2011 , the official said .
ottawa had said it would pull its 2,500 troops out next year if reinforcements were not forthcoming . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : sarkozy said france was willing to deploy additional troops to afghanistan french president nicolas sarkozy had said earlier france would send a battalion of troops to the east of afghanistan as part of efforts to bolster the 47,000-strong peacekeeping force . " i have decided to reinforce the french military presence with one battalion deployed in the east region , " president nicolas sarkozy said in a speech delivered at the summit , the afp news agency reported . the offer , which french military sources put at between 800 and 1,000 soldiers , came amid french plans for a return to nato 's military command next year after more than four decades of absence . " at the end of the french presidency of the european union , the moment will have come to conclude this process and to make the necessary decisions for france to take its full place in nato 's structures , " sarkozy said .
paris is set to take over the rotating eu presidency in july . staying in afghanistan as long as it takes it was good news for us president george w. bush , who on wednesday had urged nato allies to send more troops to afghanistan , stressing that the 26-nation trans-atlantic alliance could not afford to lose its battle against taliban insurgents and al qaeda militants .
as yet , only a few countries have answered his call . " whatever the cost , however difficult , we can not afford it , we must win , " he had said ahead of the summit . in paris , a sarkozy advisor said prior to the summit that the french president had set out conditions for the extra french troops in a letter to nato allies , including an increase in international aid to afghanistan . " he calls for a coordinated strategy whose goal will be a stable afghanistan , reconciled with itself and free of terrorism and drug trafficking , " the advisor said . according to reuters news agency , france is expected to seek us backing for its drive to bolster european union military structures during the second half of next year . reviewing membership for georgia and ukraine bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : canada is now to stay in afghanistan until 2011 but while the us welcomed the french offer of more troops , it met wednesday with strong opposition from paris and berlin over the question of the alliance 's eastwards enlargement - primarily out of fear of provoking moscow . bush had strongly urged skeptical european allies earlier to reward both countries for their democratic revolutions and not to allow russia , which is not a nato member , a veto over the alliance 's decisions . alliance leaders failed to agree to offer ukraine and georgia a membership action plan -lrb- map -rrb- , a gateway to eventual membership , but did confirm thursday that ukraine and georgia would one day become members of the north atlantic alliance , secretary-general jaap de hoop scheffer said . " we agree today that these countries will become member nations , " he said , adding that prospects for their membership plans would be reviewed in december . france and germany had led opposition to the move , saying it was premature when public support for nato was barely 30 percent in ukraine , and georgia did not control all its territory due to frozen conflicts with russian-backed separatists . " we have reached the conclusion that it is too early to give both countries membership action plan status , " german chancellor angela merkel had said on arrival at the summit . a senior georgian diplomat has told the bbc that the " no " to georgia will be widely seen as a victory for russia , which has long been expressing concerns over nato 's eastward expansion . croatia and albania sit at the table bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : merkel does not support nato 's eastwards push greece , meanwhile , dug its heels in over accession by macedonia , unless the country changed its name to recognize athens ' concerns regarding greece 's northern region with the same name - prompting fresh concerns about stability in the balkans .
officials said thursday that the alliance decided not to invite macedonia to join until the dispute is solved . according to a macedonian government spokesman , allied leaders meeting in bucharest had authorized their ambassadors to issue the invitation as soon as the name issue , which has festered for 17 years , is resolved . " we have agreed that an invitation to the former yugoslav republic of macedonia will be issued as soon as a mutually acceptable solution to the name issue has been reached , " nato 's secretary-general jaap de hoop scheffer told a news conference . two other balkan countries - croatia and albania - were , however , invited to join the defense alliance and sat at nato 's table for the first time thursday .

croatia and albania were formally invited to join , while macedonia was not . nato leaders were set on thursday , april 3 , to endorse a planned us missile shield for europe , a senior us official told reporters . the final summit statement would " recognize the substantive contribution to the protection of the allies " from the missile defense system to be deployed in the czech republic and poland , the official told reporters . " the united states and the czech republic are pleased to announce the completion of negotiations on a missile-defense agreement .
we plan to sign the agreement in the near future , " a statement said . french commitment the us official also said that president george w. bush had confirmed to the summit leaders that the us will be able to move some of its troops to afghanistan 's south once france sends a battalion of troops to the east of afghanistan , meeting canada 's conditions to keep troops in afghanistan until 2011 , the official said .
ottawa had said it would pull its 2,500 troops out next year if reinforcements were not forthcoming . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : sarkozy said france was willing to deploy additional troops to afghanistan french president nicolas sarkozy had said earlier france would send a battalion of troops to the east of afghanistan as part of efforts to bolster the 47,000-strong peacekeeping force . " i have decided to reinforce the french military presence with one battalion deployed in the east region , " president nicolas sarkozy said in a speech delivered at the summit , the afp news agency reported . the offer , which french military sources put at between 800 and 1,000 soldiers , came amid french plans for a return to nato 's military command next year after more than four decades of absence . " at the end of the french presidency of the european union , the moment will have come to conclude this process and to make the necessary decisions for france to take its full place in nato 's structures , " sarkozy said .
paris is set to take over the rotating eu presidency in july . staying in afghanistan as long as it takes it was good news for us president george w. bush , who on wednesday had urged nato allies to send more troops to afghanistan , stressing that the 26-nation trans-atlantic alliance could not afford to lose its battle against taliban insurgents and al qaeda militants .
as yet , only a few countries have answered his call . " whatever the cost , however difficult , we can not afford it , we must win , " he had said ahead of the summit . in paris , a sarkozy advisor said prior to the summit that the french president had set out conditions for the extra french troops in a letter to nato allies , including an increase in international aid to afghanistan . " he calls for a coordinated strategy whose goal will be a stable afghanistan , reconciled with itself and free of terrorism and drug trafficking , " the advisor said . according to reuters news agency , france is expected to seek us backing for its drive to bolster european union military structures during the second half of next year . reviewing membership for georgia and ukraine bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : canada is now to stay in afghanistan until 2011 but while the us welcomed the french offer of more troops , it met wednesday with strong opposition from paris and berlin over the question of the alliance 's eastwards enlargement - primarily out of fear of provoking moscow . bush had strongly urged skeptical european allies earlier to reward both countries for their democratic revolutions and not to allow russia , which is not a nato member , a veto over the alliance 's decisions . alliance leaders failed to agree to offer ukraine and georgia a membership action plan -lrb- map -rrb- , a gateway to eventual membership , but did confirm thursday that ukraine and georgia would one day become members of the north atlantic alliance , secretary-general jaap de hoop scheffer said . " we agree today that these countries will become member nations , " he said , adding that prospects for their membership plans would be reviewed in december . france and germany had led opposition to the move , saying it was premature when public support for nato was barely 30 percent in ukraine , and georgia did not control all its territory due to frozen conflicts with russian-backed separatists . " we have reached the conclusion that it is too early to give both countries membership action plan status , " german chancellor angela merkel had said on arrival at the summit . a senior georgian diplomat has told the bbc that the " no " to georgia will be widely seen as a victory for russia , which has long been expressing concerns over nato 's eastward expansion . croatia and albania sit at the table bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : merkel does not support nato 's eastwards push greece , meanwhile , dug its heels in over accession by macedonia , unless the country changed its name to recognize athens ' concerns regarding greece 's northern region with the same name - prompting fresh concerns about stability in the balkans .
officials said thursday that the alliance decided not to invite macedonia to join until the dispute is solved . according to a macedonian government spokesman , allied leaders meeting in bucharest had authorized their ambassadors to issue the invitation as soon as the name issue , which has festered for 17 years , is resolved . " we have agreed that an invitation to the former yugoslav republic of macedonia will be issued as soon as a mutually acceptable solution to the name issue has been reached , " nato 's secretary-general jaap de hoop scheffer told a news conference . two other balkan countries - croatia and albania - were , however , invited to join the defense alliance and sat at nato 's table for the first time thursday .
the two countries will become the 27th and 28th members of nato once the accession and ratification process has been finalized , which alliance officials hope will be done within a year . dw staff -lrb- jp -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

meanwhile , germany 's second biggest state-owned bank has announced billions of euros in write-downs . the credit market squeeze and volatile market activity after the collapse of the subprime mortgage market in the united states " are going to have repercussions all year and well into 2009 , " steinbrueck said in the thursday , april 3 , edition of the daily bild tabloid . steinbrueck said banks should be more aware of risks and exercise prudence as a result of the crisis , rather than focus on returns .
he also said he approved of fusions among the regional banks . " we have too many state banks that are too small , " he told the paper . several german banks have admitted to being hit by the subprime crisis , with mid-sized business lender ikb , for instance , receiving billions in help from state and public savings banks .
steinbrueck defended the use of domestic budget funds to help bail out ikb .
some of the banks , including sachsenlb , were bought out and shored up by other regional lending institutions . banks with major write-downs also on thursday , germany 's second biggest state-owned bank bayernlb announced write-downs of 4.3 billion euros -lrb- $ 6.7 billion -rrb- as a result of the us housing market crisis . the bavaria-based bank was the third german financial institution this week to own up to losses as a consequence of involvement in the subprime mortgage market .
bayernlb reported write-downs of 2.3 billion euros for 2007 and an additional 2 billion euros for the first quarter of 2008 . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : finance minister steinbrueck has warned of aftershocks on different levels on wednesday , germany 's biggest state-owned bank , westlb , revealed a net loss of 1.6 billion euros last year .
deutsche bank ag , germany 's biggest bank , said earlier this week that it expected write-downs of around 2.5 billion euros in the first quarter of 2008 .
ubs , europe 's largest bank , projected around 12 billion euros in write-downs following the us housing market crisis . not in the black despite the shakiness of the global market situation , steinbrueck said germany could still proceed with a pension increase planned for july 1 . " this increase is fair and important because it tells pensioners that they have not been left by the wayside , " steinbrueck said . the minister also told the european commission in a statement wednesday that germany expects to turn in a public deficit equivalent to 0.5 percent of gross domestic product this year . in 2007 , the country was able to announce a slight surplus of 70 million euros . the german finance ministry said the switch back to a deficit was the result of reforms to business taxes and unemployment allocations . the german public account is composed of the finances of federal , regional and municipal governments as well as the national social security system . experts say the federal government 's budget remains in the red , and is not expected to be balanced before 2011 . dw staff -lrb- als -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de music -pipe- 03.04.2008 critic explains allure of von karajan , 100 years and counting großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : great , but flawed : herbert von karajan -lrb- 1908-1989 -rrb- ahead of the 100th anniversary of the birth of famous orchestra director and conductor herbert von karajan on april 5 , dw-world.de talked about the maestro as a cultural icon with james oestreich of the new york times . in 1955 , von karajan - classical music 's most prolific recording artist - was named director of the berlin philharmonic orchestra , and was credited with creating its clean and distinctive sound during his 35-year tenure .
he was also chief conductor of the vienna symphony orchestra , and the guiding force behind the salzburg festival , where he conducted for 33 years .
karajan died july 16 , 1989 . dw-world.de spoke with james oestreich , music and dance editor at the new york times , about von karajan 's significance in music history . dw-world.de : these days you ca n't look anywhere in the german media without seeing a story or documentary or article about the life of herbert von karajan .
what 's all the fuss about ? james oestreich : he was probably the most recorded conductor of his time .
it was a time when long-playing records were really taking off , and then digital recording came in and the cd came in , and he was riding that technology through the whole thing . he recorded everything , all the time , and he re-recorded things .
he recorded the brahms symphonies three times , i believe , and the beethoven symphonies three times .
so he was simply everywhere . to boot , he was in many ways a fantastic conductor .
he had his shortcomings , as many people do .
but what he did well , he did extremely well .
and he had at that time one of the world 's greatest orchestras , if not the world 's greatest orchestra , performing for him . bildunterschrift : karajan conducts the berlin philharmonic in 1987 can you name a highlight ? his 1960s recordings of the beethoven symphonies were classic .
they were the way i , among many others , got to know the beethoven symphonies .
so they were kind of my standard , and many people 's standard for those works . what effect does a superstar conductor have on an orchestra ?
is it purely good news - more revenue and publicity - or can it also be damaging ? well it can be either .
in this case , he and the orchestra were so closely identified after so many years , and it was the coming together of two superstar names : karajan and the berlin philharmonic . ...
a music director is n't just a conductor .
he is someone who builds the orchestra in addition to conducting it .
in this case , karajan had built up this orchestra over a number of years , and made it into a sensational machine .
they played beautifully for him . to what do you attribute the ongoing interest in karajan ? well , there is the factor of permanence , for one thing .
it helps karajan and hurts people today .
it used to be that people 's vinyl lps would wear down and become unplayable .
now , digital recordings are permanent .
so there are these recordings that were the standard of their time , and they remain with us , and become standards of this time , too . it makes it difficult for people to come up with recording projects today , because all these standards are still readily available . in karajan 's case , there was also this international renown that he had .
when japan was warming to classical music - to put it mildly - 20 or 30 years ago , karajan was almost synonymous with classical music there .
so there is a built-in audience all around the world for his recordings . karajan had an international career , but was still very much a german and austrian conductor .
now an englishman , sir simon rattle , leads the berlin philharmonic . does nationality have a role in orchestras today ? it has become less relevant .
it used to be that orchestras from different countries had different sounds - the russians had very piercing brass instruments , the germans had tremendous warmth in their string sound .
as conductors travel around the world , and players go from orchestra to orchestra , and sometimes from country to country , those things have greatly diminished , in the last 30 or 40 years . that 's the way of the world .
but some of us yearn , to some extent , for the old days , when there were those characteristic sounds of orchestras .
when nobody could play german music like the germans and nobody could play french music like the french . one of the most frequently debated aspects of karajan 's life is the fact that he joined the nazi party in 1933 .
modern biographers have argued it was a political career move , rather than an ideological one .
still , he conducted for hitler and other top nazis , who revered him .
how important is this aspect of his biography ? bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : german composer and conductor richard strauss well , it is a very important aspect .
and he is far from alone in any of this .
-lsb- german conductor wilhelm -rsb- furtwaengler , of course , had many of the same problems ... and -lsb- german composer -rsb- richard strauss was the head of the nazi music chamber .
so karajan was far from alone . it 's a very unfortunate aspect of his biography , but it does n't mitigate his music making in any way , i do n't think .
there were a lot of bad things happening in those days , and he was part of it . if you read about karajan in the press , it is hard to find anyone neutral .
the musicians who played for him adored him , as did a large public .
yet many writers today criticize his sound as being too " cold " and technical , and take his perfectionism to task .
what 's your take ? well , i do n't find his music making cold .
it was certainly very lush , and that was problematic in some ways .
i remember a recording came out of bach and stravinsky , and for me the funny thing about that record is that karajan was out of his depth on both ends .
his big , lush bach sound is totally out of date today , now that the early music movement has brought back the smallness of sound from the baroque era .
and in the case of stravinsky - a very angular , modern sound - again , karajan 's sound is very lush and rich .
it missed the angles and it missed a lot of the music as a result . so , it was a style that did n't suit all types of music , but the music it suited , it suited very well .
there is a recording late in his life of mahler 's 9th symphony that is the opposite of cold .
its one of the great recordings ever made .
so i 'm not sure what people have in mind when they use a blanket term like cold to describe his music making . karajan was also known for leading an extravagant lifestyle , flying jets and driving race cars .
he was also criticized by some for ostensibly forcing concert ticket prices so high that only the wealthy could attend .
how did this affect the public 's view of him ? bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : karajan steps off the jet with his wife , eliette -lrb- left -rrb- and daughter isabella well , i do n't think karajan set concert prices .
karajan certainly made a lot of money and demanded a lot of money , but he was n't alone in that .
concerts were very expensive , especially at salzburg .
but it is far from just karajan .
yo yo ma , itzhak perlman - all sorts of people were demanding huge amounts of money .
and that 's what sent ticket prices soaring . so did his luxury lifestyle image act in his favor , or against him ? i think it humanized him .
toscanini was put on a pedestal by music lovers for a long time .
in this case it brought karajan in to a real world that people could identify with , or wished they had ...
i 'm sure the image was certainly part of the package . how do you suppose karajan will be remembered ? i think there are a lot of generalizations going around this year , and i think generalizations are always risky .
i do n't want to see him swamped , and go down in history with words like " cold " attached and " luxury " attached .
he was many things .
he was a very complex figure , and he was a great musician . interview : jennifer abramsohn send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

he was also chief conductor of the vienna symphony orchestra , and the guiding force behind the salzburg festival , where he conducted for 33 years .
karajan died july 16 , 1989 . dw-world.de spoke with james oestreich , music and dance editor at the new york times , about von karajan 's significance in music history . dw-world.de : these days you ca n't look anywhere in the german media without seeing a story or documentary or article about the life of herbert von karajan .
what 's all the fuss about ? james oestreich : he was probably the most recorded conductor of his time .
it was a time when long-playing records were really taking off , and then digital recording came in and the cd came in , and he was riding that technology through the whole thing . he recorded everything , all the time , and he re-recorded things .
he recorded the brahms symphonies three times , i believe , and the beethoven symphonies three times .
so he was simply everywhere . to boot , he was in many ways a fantastic conductor .
he had his shortcomings , as many people do .
but what he did well , he did extremely well .
and he had at that time one of the world 's greatest orchestras , if not the world 's greatest orchestra , performing for him . bildunterschrift : karajan conducts the berlin philharmonic in 1987 can you name a highlight ? his 1960s recordings of the beethoven symphonies were classic .
they were the way i , among many others , got to know the beethoven symphonies .
so they were kind of my standard , and many people 's standard for those works . what effect does a superstar conductor have on an orchestra ?
is it purely good news - more revenue and publicity - or can it also be damaging ? well it can be either .
in this case , he and the orchestra were so closely identified after so many years , and it was the coming together of two superstar names : karajan and the berlin philharmonic . ...
a music director is n't just a conductor .
he is someone who builds the orchestra in addition to conducting it .
in this case , karajan had built up this orchestra over a number of years , and made it into a sensational machine .
they played beautifully for him . to what do you attribute the ongoing interest in karajan ? well , there is the factor of permanence , for one thing .
it helps karajan and hurts people today .
it used to be that people 's vinyl lps would wear down and become unplayable .
now , digital recordings are permanent .
so there are these recordings that were the standard of their time , and they remain with us , and become standards of this time , too . it makes it difficult for people to come up with recording projects today , because all these standards are still readily available . in karajan 's case , there was also this international renown that he had .
when japan was warming to classical music - to put it mildly - 20 or 30 years ago , karajan was almost synonymous with classical music there .
so there is a built-in audience all around the world for his recordings . karajan had an international career , but was still very much a german and austrian conductor .
now an englishman , sir simon rattle , leads the berlin philharmonic . does nationality have a role in orchestras today ? it has become less relevant .
it used to be that orchestras from different countries had different sounds - the russians had very piercing brass instruments , the germans had tremendous warmth in their string sound .
as conductors travel around the world , and players go from orchestra to orchestra , and sometimes from country to country , those things have greatly diminished , in the last 30 or 40 years . that 's the way of the world .
but some of us yearn , to some extent , for the old days , when there were those characteristic sounds of orchestras .
when nobody could play german music like the germans and nobody could play french music like the french . one of the most frequently debated aspects of karajan 's life is the fact that he joined the nazi party in 1933 .
modern biographers have argued it was a political career move , rather than an ideological one .
still , he conducted for hitler and other top nazis , who revered him .
how important is this aspect of his biography ? bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : german composer and conductor richard strauss well , it is a very important aspect .
and he is far from alone in any of this .
-lsb- german conductor wilhelm -rsb- furtwaengler , of course , had many of the same problems ... and -lsb- german composer -rsb- richard strauss was the head of the nazi music chamber .
so karajan was far from alone . it 's a very unfortunate aspect of his biography , but it does n't mitigate his music making in any way , i do n't think .
there were a lot of bad things happening in those days , and he was part of it . if you read about karajan in the press , it is hard to find anyone neutral .
the musicians who played for him adored him , as did a large public .
yet many writers today criticize his sound as being too " cold " and technical , and take his perfectionism to task .
what 's your take ? well , i do n't find his music making cold .
it was certainly very lush , and that was problematic in some ways .
i remember a recording came out of bach and stravinsky , and for me the funny thing about that record is that karajan was out of his depth on both ends .
his big , lush bach sound is totally out of date today , now that the early music movement has brought back the smallness of sound from the baroque era .
and in the case of stravinsky - a very angular , modern sound - again , karajan 's sound is very lush and rich .
it missed the angles and it missed a lot of the music as a result . so , it was a style that did n't suit all types of music , but the music it suited , it suited very well .
there is a recording late in his life of mahler 's 9th symphony that is the opposite of cold .
its one of the great recordings ever made .
so i 'm not sure what people have in mind when they use a blanket term like cold to describe his music making . karajan was also known for leading an extravagant lifestyle , flying jets and driving race cars .
he was also criticized by some for ostensibly forcing concert ticket prices so high that only the wealthy could attend .
how did this affect the public 's view of him ? bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : karajan steps off the jet with his wife , eliette -lrb- left -rrb- and daughter isabella well , i do n't think karajan set concert prices .
karajan certainly made a lot of money and demanded a lot of money , but he was n't alone in that .
concerts were very expensive , especially at salzburg .
but it is far from just karajan .
yo yo ma , itzhak perlman - all sorts of people were demanding huge amounts of money .
and that 's what sent ticket prices soaring . so did his luxury lifestyle image act in his favor , or against him ? i think it humanized him .
toscanini was put on a pedestal by music lovers for a long time .
in this case it brought karajan in to a real world that people could identify with , or wished they had ...
i 'm sure the image was certainly part of the package . how do you suppose karajan will be remembered ? i think there are a lot of generalizations going around this year , and i think generalizations are always risky .
i do n't want to see him swamped , and go down in history with words like " cold " attached and " luxury " attached .
he was many things .
he was a very complex figure , and he was a great musician . interview : jennifer abramsohn send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de music -pipe- 03.04.2008 critic explains allure of von karajan , 100 years and counting großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : great , but flawed : herbert von karajan -lrb- 1908-1989 -rrb- ahead of the 100th anniversary of the birth of famous orchestra director and conductor herbert von karajan on april 5 , dw-world.de talked about the maestro as a cultural icon with james oestreich of the new york times . in 1955 , von karajan - classical music 's most prolific recording artist - was named director of the berlin philharmonic orchestra , and was credited with creating its clean and distinctive sound during his 35-year tenure .
he was also chief conductor of the vienna symphony orchestra , and the guiding force behind the salzburg festival , where he conducted for 33 years .
karajan died july 16 , 1989 . dw-world.de spoke with james oestreich , music and dance editor at the new york times , about von karajan 's significance in music history . dw-world.de : these days you ca n't look anywhere in the german media without seeing a story or documentary or article about the life of herbert von karajan .
what 's all the fuss about ? james oestreich : he was probably the most recorded conductor of his time .
it was a time when long-playing records were really taking off , and then digital recording came in and the cd came in , and he was riding that technology through the whole thing . he recorded everything , all the time , and he re-recorded things .
he recorded the brahms symphonies three times , i believe , and the beethoven symphonies three times .
so he was simply everywhere . to boot , he was in many ways a fantastic conductor .
he had his shortcomings , as many people do .
but what he did well , he did extremely well .
and he had at that time one of the world 's greatest orchestras , if not the world 's greatest orchestra , performing for him . bildunterschrift : karajan conducts the berlin philharmonic in 1987 can you name a highlight ? his 1960s recordings of the beethoven symphonies were classic .
they were the way i , among many others , got to know the beethoven symphonies .
so they were kind of my standard , and many people 's standard for those works . what effect does a superstar conductor have on an orchestra ?
is it purely good news - more revenue and publicity - or can it also be damaging ? well it can be either .
in this case , he and the orchestra were so closely identified after so many years , and it was the coming together of two superstar names : karajan and the berlin philharmonic . ...
a music director is n't just a conductor .
he is someone who builds the orchestra in addition to conducting it .
in this case , karajan had built up this orchestra over a number of years , and made it into a sensational machine .
they played beautifully for him . to what do you attribute the ongoing interest in karajan ? well , there is the factor of permanence , for one thing .
it helps karajan and hurts people today .
it used to be that people 's vinyl lps would wear down and become unplayable .
now , digital recordings are permanent .
so there are these recordings that were the standard of their time , and they remain with us , and become standards of this time , too . it makes it difficult for people to come up with recording projects today , because all these standards are still readily available . in karajan 's case , there was also this international renown that he had .
when japan was warming to classical music - to put it mildly - 20 or 30 years ago , karajan was almost synonymous with classical music there .
so there is a built-in audience all around the world for his recordings . karajan had an international career , but was still very much a german and austrian conductor .
now an englishman , sir simon rattle , leads the berlin philharmonic . does nationality have a role in orchestras today ? it has become less relevant .
it used to be that orchestras from different countries had different sounds - the russians had very piercing brass instruments , the germans had tremendous warmth in their string sound .
as conductors travel around the world , and players go from orchestra to orchestra , and sometimes from country to country , those things have greatly diminished , in the last 30 or 40 years . that 's the way of the world .
but some of us yearn , to some extent , for the old days , when there were those characteristic sounds of orchestras .
when nobody could play german music like the germans and nobody could play french music like the french . one of the most frequently debated aspects of karajan 's life is the fact that he joined the nazi party in 1933 .
modern biographers have argued it was a political career move , rather than an ideological one .
still , he conducted for hitler and other top nazis , who revered him .
how important is this aspect of his biography ? bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : german composer and conductor richard strauss well , it is a very important aspect .
and he is far from alone in any of this .
-lsb- german conductor wilhelm -rsb- furtwaengler , of course , had many of the same problems ... and -lsb- german composer -rsb- richard strauss was the head of the nazi music chamber .
so karajan was far from alone . it 's a very unfortunate aspect of his biography , but it does n't mitigate his music making in any way , i do n't think .
there were a lot of bad things happening in those days , and he was part of it . if you read about karajan in the press , it is hard to find anyone neutral .
the musicians who played for him adored him , as did a large public .
yet many writers today criticize his sound as being too " cold " and technical , and take his perfectionism to task .
what 's your take ? well , i do n't find his music making cold .
it was certainly very lush , and that was problematic in some ways .
i remember a recording came out of bach and stravinsky , and for me the funny thing about that record is that karajan was out of his depth on both ends .
his big , lush bach sound is totally out of date today , now that the early music movement has brought back the smallness of sound from the baroque era .
and in the case of stravinsky - a very angular , modern sound - again , karajan 's sound is very lush and rich .
it missed the angles and it missed a lot of the music as a result . so , it was a style that did n't suit all types of music , but the music it suited , it suited very well .
there is a recording late in his life of mahler 's 9th symphony that is the opposite of cold .
its one of the great recordings ever made .
so i 'm not sure what people have in mind when they use a blanket term like cold to describe his music making . karajan was also known for leading an extravagant lifestyle , flying jets and driving race cars .
he was also criticized by some for ostensibly forcing concert ticket prices so high that only the wealthy could attend .
how did this affect the public 's view of him ? bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : karajan steps off the jet with his wife , eliette -lrb- left -rrb- and daughter isabella well , i do n't think karajan set concert prices .
karajan certainly made a lot of money and demanded a lot of money , but he was n't alone in that .
concerts were very expensive , especially at salzburg .
but it is far from just karajan .
yo yo ma , itzhak perlman - all sorts of people were demanding huge amounts of money .
and that 's what sent ticket prices soaring . so did his luxury lifestyle image act in his favor , or against him ? i think it humanized him .
toscanini was put on a pedestal by music lovers for a long time .
in this case it brought karajan in to a real world that people could identify with , or wished they had ...
i 'm sure the image was certainly part of the package . how do you suppose karajan will be remembered ? i think there are a lot of generalizations going around this year , and i think generalizations are always risky .
i do n't want to see him swamped , and go down in history with words like " cold " attached and " luxury " attached .
he was many things .
he was a very complex figure , and he was a great musician . interview : jennifer abramsohn send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

a music director is n't just a conductor .
he is someone who builds the orchestra in addition to conducting it .
in this case , karajan had built up this orchestra over a number of years , and made it into a sensational machine .
they played beautifully for him . to what do you attribute the ongoing interest in karajan ? well , there is the factor of permanence , for one thing .
it helps karajan and hurts people today .
it used to be that people 's vinyl lps would wear down and become unplayable .
now , digital recordings are permanent .
so there are these recordings that were the standard of their time , and they remain with us , and become standards of this time , too . it makes it difficult for people to come up with recording projects today , because all these standards are still readily available . in karajan 's case , there was also this international renown that he had .
when japan was warming to classical music - to put it mildly - 20 or 30 years ago , karajan was almost synonymous with classical music there .
so there is a built-in audience all around the world for his recordings . karajan had an international career , but was still very much a german and austrian conductor .
now an englishman , sir simon rattle , leads the berlin philharmonic . does nationality have a role in orchestras today ? it has become less relevant .
it used to be that orchestras from different countries had different sounds - the russians had very piercing brass instruments , the germans had tremendous warmth in their string sound .
as conductors travel around the world , and players go from orchestra to orchestra , and sometimes from country to country , those things have greatly diminished , in the last 30 or 40 years . that 's the way of the world .
but some of us yearn , to some extent , for the old days , when there were those characteristic sounds of orchestras .
when nobody could play german music like the germans and nobody could play french music like the french . one of the most frequently debated aspects of karajan 's life is the fact that he joined the nazi party in 1933 .
modern biographers have argued it was a political career move , rather than an ideological one .
still , he conducted for hitler and other top nazis , who revered him .
how important is this aspect of his biography ? bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : german composer and conductor richard strauss well , it is a very important aspect .
and he is far from alone in any of this .
-lsb- german conductor wilhelm -rsb- furtwaengler , of course , had many of the same problems ... and -lsb- german composer -rsb- richard strauss was the head of the nazi music chamber .
so karajan was far from alone . it 's a very unfortunate aspect of his biography , but it does n't mitigate his music making in any way , i do n't think .
there were a lot of bad things happening in those days , and he was part of it . if you read about karajan in the press , it is hard to find anyone neutral .
the musicians who played for him adored him , as did a large public .
yet many writers today criticize his sound as being too " cold " and technical , and take his perfectionism to task .
what 's your take ? well , i do n't find his music making cold .
it was certainly very lush , and that was problematic in some ways .
i remember a recording came out of bach and stravinsky , and for me the funny thing about that record is that karajan was out of his depth on both ends .
his big , lush bach sound is totally out of date today , now that the early music movement has brought back the smallness of sound from the baroque era .
and in the case of stravinsky - a very angular , modern sound - again , karajan 's sound is very lush and rich .
it missed the angles and it missed a lot of the music as a result . so , it was a style that did n't suit all types of music , but the music it suited , it suited very well .
there is a recording late in his life of mahler 's 9th symphony that is the opposite of cold .
its one of the great recordings ever made .
so i 'm not sure what people have in mind when they use a blanket term like cold to describe his music making . karajan was also known for leading an extravagant lifestyle , flying jets and driving race cars .
he was also criticized by some for ostensibly forcing concert ticket prices so high that only the wealthy could attend .
how did this affect the public 's view of him ? bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : karajan steps off the jet with his wife , eliette -lrb- left -rrb- and daughter isabella well , i do n't think karajan set concert prices .
karajan certainly made a lot of money and demanded a lot of money , but he was n't alone in that .
concerts were very expensive , especially at salzburg .
but it is far from just karajan .
yo yo ma , itzhak perlman - all sorts of people were demanding huge amounts of money .
and that 's what sent ticket prices soaring . so did his luxury lifestyle image act in his favor , or against him ? i think it humanized him .
toscanini was put on a pedestal by music lovers for a long time .
in this case it brought karajan in to a real world that people could identify with , or wished they had ...
i 'm sure the image was certainly part of the package . how do you suppose karajan will be remembered ? i think there are a lot of generalizations going around this year , and i think generalizations are always risky .
i do n't want to see him swamped , and go down in history with words like " cold " attached and " luxury " attached .
he was many things .
he was a very complex figure , and he was a great musician . interview : jennifer abramsohn send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

" today more nations stepped forward with offers that will raise that total again , and very substantially , " nato secretary general jaap de hoop scheffer said at a news conference with afghan president hamid karzai and un secretary-general ban ki-moon . scheffer did not say how many troops were offered and referred specifically only to an offer by france to send an additional battalion , about 800 troops .
but he said it satisfied a canadian demand for reinforcements in its sector in southern afghanistan . the nato-led force in afghanistan currently numbers around 47,000 soliders . aiming for self-sufficiency the document , endorsed by the 26 nato members and by the 14 non-nato countries which contribute forces to the un-mandated operation , was welcomed by karzai . " i am thankful for the strategic vision that you have offered on behalf of isaf ...
afghanistan is now better placed to take responsibility for its own security , " said karzai . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : there are currently 47,000 nato-led troops in afghanistan isaf forces have been fighting the taliban but have also been training the afghan military to do the same .
the document underlines the importance in making afghan security forces self-sufficient and taking the lead in counter-insurgency operations .
it also highlights helping the afghan government to extend good governance , reconstruction and development throughout the country . on thursday , karzai announced that as from august , afghan forces would finally be able to take over security operations in the capital kabul . france steps up earlier thursday , french president nicolas sarkozy confirmed that his country would be sending an additional 700 soldiers to the east , thus helping alleviate us and canadian concerns that isaf is overstretched . the offer came amid french plans for a return to nato 's military command next year after more than four decades of absence . isaf has grown by some 4,000 soldiers to about 47,000 in recent months , and more troops are ready to step in from poland , the czech republic and other allies . with their strategic vision document , the allies vowed to support the afghan leadership , bring together civilian and military efforts , and increase cooperation with afghanistan 's neighbors , " especially pakistan . " it also urged nato members to provide " maximum possible flexibility " in the use of their troops and to fill the current shortfalls in manning levels - two issues which have sparked bitter disagreements in the past . a deep rift had emerged within nato over the past months , with some countries , spearheaded by the united states , insisting on the need to fight the insurgents and others , like germany and italy , placing the emphasis on the civilian nature of the isaf mission . two in , three out in a major rebuff to us president george w bush who is attending the last summit of the transatlantic alliance as us president , european leaders kept georgia and ukraine waiting at nato 's doorstep thursday .
they did , however , welcome albania and croatia . bush , eager to burnish his foreign policy legacy in the waning months of a presidency tarnished by iraq , had pushed hard for georgia and ukraine to be allowed into the nato club .
scheffer said nato would offer georgia and ukraine " intensive engagement " , along with a vague promise of membership sometime down the line .
" we agree today that these countries will become members of nato , " he told reporters .
" that is quite something . "
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : german chancellor merkel and french president sarkozy opposed membership bids by ukraine and georgia the membership bids of ukraine and georgia , two former soviet republics , are strongly opposed by russia .
both germany and france , wary of alienating moscow , also resisted opening the door to georgia and ukraine . meanwhile , strong protests erupted in skopje after macedonia 's bid for an invitation was effectively vetoed by greece in a long-running dispute over macedonia 's official name . athens maintains that allowing its northern neighbor to call itself " macedonia " would imply a territorial claim on the greek province of the same name , and insists that it will not approve macedonia 's nato membership until the issue is resolved . macedonian delegates walked out of the summit in response , with foreign minister antonio milososki accusing greece of using an " irrelevant argument of ancient times . " russia urged to link missile defences with us on the thorny issue of a us missile defense shield in europe , nato leaders also asked experts to draw up options for a missile system that would complement the us anti-missile shield and provide cover to some allies left out in the cold , a statement said .
they also urged russia to consider linking up its missile defences to the us shield - despite moscow 's hostility towards it .
washington said last year it wanted to install 10 missile interceptors in poland and a radar base in the czech republic to cover us territory and that of some european allies , and wanted it operational by 2013 .
the shield is aimed at countering attacks from " rogue states " such as iran but russia fears it could pose a direct challenge to its security . dw staff -lrb- sp -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

the two countries will become the 27th and 28th members of nato once the accession and ratification process has been finalized , which alliance officials hope will be done within a year . dw staff -lrb- jp -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

" whatever the cost , however difficult , we can not afford it , we must win , " he had said ahead of the summit . in paris , a sarkozy advisor said prior to the summit that the french president had set out conditions for the extra french troops in a letter to nato allies , including an increase in international aid to afghanistan . " he calls for a coordinated strategy whose goal will be a stable afghanistan , reconciled with itself and free of terrorism and drug trafficking , " the advisor said . according to reuters news agency , france is expected to seek us backing for its drive to bolster european union military structures during the second half of next year . reviewing membership for georgia and ukraine bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : canada is now to stay in afghanistan until 2011 but while the us welcomed the french offer of more troops , it met wednesday with strong opposition from paris and berlin over the question of the alliance 's eastwards enlargement - primarily out of fear of provoking moscow . bush had strongly urged skeptical european allies earlier to reward both countries for their democratic revolutions and not to allow russia , which is not a nato member , a veto over the alliance 's decisions . alliance leaders failed to agree to offer ukraine and georgia a membership action plan -lrb- map -rrb- , a gateway to eventual membership , but did confirm thursday that ukraine and georgia would one day become members of the north atlantic alliance , secretary-general jaap de hoop scheffer said . " we agree today that these countries will become member nations , " he said , adding that prospects for their membership plans would be reviewed in december . france and germany had led opposition to the move , saying it was premature when public support for nato was barely 30 percent in ukraine , and georgia did not control all its territory due to frozen conflicts with russian-backed separatists . " we have reached the conclusion that it is too early to give both countries membership action plan status , " german chancellor angela merkel had said on arrival at the summit . a senior georgian diplomat has told the bbc that the " no " to georgia will be widely seen as a victory for russia , which has long been expressing concerns over nato 's eastward expansion . croatia and albania sit at the table bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : merkel does not support nato 's eastwards push greece , meanwhile , dug its heels in over accession by macedonia , unless the country changed its name to recognize athens ' concerns regarding greece 's northern region with the same name - prompting fresh concerns about stability in the balkans .
officials said thursday that the alliance decided not to invite macedonia to join until the dispute is solved . according to a macedonian government spokesman , allied leaders meeting in bucharest had authorized their ambassadors to issue the invitation as soon as the name issue , which has festered for 17 years , is resolved . " we have agreed that an invitation to the former yugoslav republic of macedonia will be issued as soon as a mutually acceptable solution to the name issue has been reached , " nato 's secretary-general jaap de hoop scheffer told a news conference . two other balkan countries - croatia and albania - were , however , invited to join the defense alliance and sat at nato 's table for the first time thursday .

merkel calls on brazil to make biofuel production sustainable as biofuels fall from grace , a new generation grabs spotlight germany defends biofuels , hedges bets on energy goals german minister calls for reversal of eu agricultural policy environment -pipe- 03.04.2008 german cars ca n't handle biofuels , environment plan at risk großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : experts said too many cars in germany would n't be able to handle biofuel blends the german government 's plan to introduce a new biofuel blend may now be postponed .
far too many cars are not able to process the fuel , industry sources said , putting a dent in the environment plan . auto industry sources said on that more than 2 million cars in germany would not be able to handle biofuels , thereby exceeding a 1-million limit the german government had set as a pre-condition for use . the sources said that some 330,000 cars made by german manufacturers , as well as more than 2 million imported cars , could not run on the new fuel and that the cars ' owners would be forced to fill up with higher octane , more expensive types of gas . the controversial plan to include a 10-percent biofuel blend plans could be slowed if it seemed likely that vehicle engines would be damaged by the mixture , a spokesperson for the german environment ministry said on wednesday , april 2 . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : biofuel blends are part of a larger german environment plan that includes reducing emissions environment minister sigmar gabriel had earlier said he would annul a government decree for the fuel , called e-10 , be introduced if too many cars were unable to run on it . " we wo n't put this regulation into effect if more than 1 million vehicles are affected , " gabriel told the stuttgarter nachrichten newspaper . part of a larger emissions reduction plan the german law would require regular gasoline to be mixed with 10 percent plant-based ethanol , called " e-10 , " and diesel to be mixed with 7 percent fuel made of plant origin by next year .
by 2020 , the ratio is supposed to rise to 17 percent . it is part of a larger plan to curb emissions , with eu states agreeing last year to reduce emissions by at least one-fifth by 2020 from 1990 levels , to use 20 percent of renewable energy sources in power production and 10 percent of biofuels from crops for transportation , also by 2020 . a change in the biofuel plan would demand possibly altering the overall targets . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : rapeseed can also be used as a biofuel adac , germany 's central motoring club , said that biofuels would damage the hoses and gaskets in 3 million cars on german roads , forcing those car owners to buy a more expensive , non-plant super grade of gas instead .
adac called for the introduction of e-10 to be delayed until 2012 . gabriel has said he will await figures from the auto industry on the number of cars actually unable to use the fuel before making a final decision on whether or not to introduce the plan . environmentalists critical of biofuel farming environmentalist organizations are critical of the plan themselves , albeit for a different reason .
greenpeace said on wednesday that the german plan to blend diesel with biodiesel to combat climate change is detrimental . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : diesel , unleaded , super , and biofuel blends are showing up at the pumps the group said it had tested fossil diesel sold at over 40 filling stations across germany to determine which vegetable oils were used in compulsory biodiesel blends .
it found that around 20 percent was soy oil rather than rapeseed oil from the german harvest . greenpeace said in a statement that germany 's blending policy would not help to fight global warming since soy oil imports largely came from south america , where tropical rain forests were being slashed to cultivate soybeans . " huge areas of tropical rain forests are being destroyed for the new plantations , for example in argentina , " the organization said . but , germany 's biofuels industry association told reuters news service that greenpeace 's charges were unjustified , and that soy oil comes from north america , argentina and brazil . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : straw turned into biofuel ?
you bet !
" soy oil from the us and argentina does not have rain forest issues , " vdb chief executive petra sprick said . "
imports from brazil are largely handled by major trading houses such as adm , bunge and cargill , which have voluntary agreements only to purchase soy oil from sustainable agriculture and not from areas using cleared tropical rain forests . " germany made the blending of biodiesel with fossil diesel at oil refineries compulsory in january 2007 as part of its policies to combat global warming .
fossil diesel must contain 4.4 percent biodiesel . biofuel farming is also driving up world food prices , such as for corn and grains - which are used to make ethanol . dw staff -lrb- als -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

far too many cars are not able to process the fuel , industry sources said , putting a dent in the environment plan . auto industry sources said on that more than 2 million cars in germany would not be able to handle biofuels , thereby exceeding a 1-million limit the german government had set as a pre-condition for use . the sources said that some 330,000 cars made by german manufacturers , as well as more than 2 million imported cars , could not run on the new fuel and that the cars ' owners would be forced to fill up with higher octane , more expensive types of gas . the controversial plan to include a 10-percent biofuel blend plans could be slowed if it seemed likely that vehicle engines would be damaged by the mixture , a spokesperson for the german environment ministry said on wednesday , april 2 . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : biofuel blends are part of a larger german environment plan that includes reducing emissions environment minister sigmar gabriel had earlier said he would annul a government decree for the fuel , called e-10 , be introduced if too many cars were unable to run on it . " we wo n't put this regulation into effect if more than 1 million vehicles are affected , " gabriel told the stuttgarter nachrichten newspaper . part of a larger emissions reduction plan the german law would require regular gasoline to be mixed with 10 percent plant-based ethanol , called " e-10 , " and diesel to be mixed with 7 percent fuel made of plant origin by next year .
by 2020 , the ratio is supposed to rise to 17 percent . it is part of a larger plan to curb emissions , with eu states agreeing last year to reduce emissions by at least one-fifth by 2020 from 1990 levels , to use 20 percent of renewable energy sources in power production and 10 percent of biofuels from crops for transportation , also by 2020 . a change in the biofuel plan would demand possibly altering the overall targets . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : rapeseed can also be used as a biofuel adac , germany 's central motoring club , said that biofuels would damage the hoses and gaskets in 3 million cars on german roads , forcing those car owners to buy a more expensive , non-plant super grade of gas instead .
adac called for the introduction of e-10 to be delayed until 2012 . gabriel has said he will await figures from the auto industry on the number of cars actually unable to use the fuel before making a final decision on whether or not to introduce the plan . environmentalists critical of biofuel farming environmentalist organizations are critical of the plan themselves , albeit for a different reason .

it found that around 20 percent was soy oil rather than rapeseed oil from the german harvest . greenpeace said in a statement that germany 's blending policy would not help to fight global warming since soy oil imports largely came from south america , where tropical rain forests were being slashed to cultivate soybeans . " huge areas of tropical rain forests are being destroyed for the new plantations , for example in argentina , " the organization said . but , germany 's biofuels industry association told reuters news service that greenpeace 's charges were unjustified , and that soy oil comes from north america , argentina and brazil . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : straw turned into biofuel ?

imports from brazil are largely handled by major trading houses such as adm , bunge and cargill , which have voluntary agreements only to purchase soy oil from sustainable agriculture and not from areas using cleared tropical rain forests . " germany made the blending of biodiesel with fossil diesel at oil refineries compulsory in january 2007 as part of its policies to combat global warming .

the carmaker called the program disproportionate , illegal and unfair . the german luxury sports car maker lodged papers at the royal courts of justice on wednesday , april 2 , in a bid to stop london mayor ken livingstone 's proposed charge . under the mayor 's plan , from october , people with cars that emit more than 225 grams of carbon dioxide per kilometer - such as sports utility vehicles and high-powered performance cars - will pay a daily charge of 25 pounds -lrb- $ 49.70 , 31.75 euros -rrb- to drive into central london . " not only is this new tax on motorists unfair , it is also a disproportionate and illegal use of power by the mayor , " said andy goss , managing director of porsche cars gb , after the judicial review papers were filed . " the porsche case is about protecting london and londoners from a new tax that will not only fail to reduce carbon dioxide emissions in central london , but also increase congestion and damage air quality . " a judge will now have to decide within the next few days whether to proceed with the case . not backing down livingstone appeared to be unswayed by porsche 's criticism and vowed to fight the legal action . " porsche 's self-serving legal action shows their continuing contempt for the views of londoners , " he said .
" porsche should be using its engineering expertise to create low-polluting cars , not its lawyers to oppose the democratic wishes of londoners . according to a recent poll , 61 percent of londoners approve of increasing the congestion tax for gas-guzzling vehicles . he added : " londoners , not car manufacturers , should be the ones to decide how to tackle pollution in their city .
i will vigorously contest porsche 's legal action . " elections might change things however , the pollution charge may never be imposed . londoners vote in mayoral elections on may 1 and opinion polls have put livingstone 's main rival boris johnson in the lead .
the conservative candidate has vowed to ditch livingstone 's plan . it is the latest program targeting london 's traffic pollution and congestion problems . for five years , london has been assessing drivers a daily congestion charge , now set at eight pounds , to drive into the central city and a large swath around it .
the fee was designed to tackle the bottlenecks that have turned much of london into a parking lot . the uk capital is the biggest urban area in the world to charge such a toll and city officials from around the globe have considered copying the idea . dw staff -lrb- jam -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

the opening is now scheduled for december . no precise opening date has been set for the prestige project , which will be supplanting a more modest corporate museum , but the inauguration is expected to take place by the end of the year , the carmaker said on wednesday , april 2 . construction of what has been billed as a new architectural landmark for the region began in 2005 at the company campus in the suburb of zuffenhausen , and was supposed to have been completed early last year . the 5,600 square meters -lrb- 60,277 square feet -rrb- of display space is to showcase 80 immaculately preserved porsche cars , replacing the old , 600-square-meter museum , which only had room for 20 of the company 's collection of 300 historic cars . but the ambitious scale of the undertaking caused hitches early on .
designed by the delugan meissl architectural office in vienna , the triangular museum built on concrete stilts is a unique project requiring complex engineering - and it soon became clear that the original completion deadline would not be met , despite the 40 different companies hired to see it through . at a press conference wednesday , spokesman anton hunger moreover said the budget of 50 million euros -lrb- $ 78 million -rrb- had proved insufficient and would rise to a " high two-digit number in the millions . " building the best bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the mercedes museum recent years have seen germany 's luxury carmakers racing to build the biggest and best museum , with bmw in munich and volkswagen in wolfsburg among the companies spending fortunes on exhibition spaces and theme parks . porsche 's eagerly-awaited futuristic-looking museum is specifically designed to rival the nearby mercedes-benz center , an 83 million euro facility hailed an architectural masterpiece when it opened in 2006 , and one which fast became a popular tourist magnet . positioned directly outside the main gate of the daimler factory in the untertuerkheim district , the spiral building was designed by the un studio of amsterdam and is based on a unique cloverleaf concept using three overlapping circles with the center removed to form a triangular atrium . the building 's height and " double helix " interior were designed to maximize space , providing 16,500 square meters of exhibition premises on a footprint of just 4,800 square meters .
clad in shimmering silver panels , the museum houses 80 passenger cars , 40 commercial trucks , and 40 racing cars and trucks with more than 1,500 displays from the company 's 120-year history . long-time rivalry bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : mercedes dominates the stuttgart skyline porsche was determined not to be outstripped .
but in fact , the company has long stood in the shadow of mercedes down in baden-wuerttemberg . stuttgart 's industrial heritage is a source of much pride to locals , and the region has always profited from the ongoing rivalry between the luxury carmakers , with each company trying to up its profile by funding competing museums and arenas . but ultimately , the city tends to identify most with the mercedes-benz brand , and the daimler firm has succeeded most obviously in conquering the stuttgart skyline . in comparison , porsche is something of a poor relation , forever trying to emulate and outdo its rival mercedes .
and in the race to erect the best museum , porsche , for the time being , is lagging behind . dw staff -lrb- jp -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

karajan died july 16 , 1989 . dw-world.de spoke with james oestreich , music and dance editor at the new york times , about von karajan 's significance in music history . dw-world.de : these days you ca n't look anywhere in the german media without seeing a story or documentary or article about the life of herbert von karajan .
what 's all the fuss about ? james oestreich : he was probably the most recorded conductor of his time .
it was a time when long-playing records were really taking off , and then digital recording came in and the cd came in , and he was riding that technology through the whole thing . he recorded everything , all the time , and he re-recorded things .
he recorded the brahms symphonies three times , i believe , and the beethoven symphonies three times .
so he was simply everywhere . to boot , he was in many ways a fantastic conductor .
he had his shortcomings , as many people do .
but what he did well , he did extremely well .
and he had at that time one of the world 's greatest orchestras , if not the world 's greatest orchestra , performing for him . bildunterschrift : karajan conducts the berlin philharmonic in 1987 can you name a highlight ? his 1960s recordings of the beethoven symphonies were classic .
they were the way i , among many others , got to know the beethoven symphonies .
so they were kind of my standard , and many people 's standard for those works . what effect does a superstar conductor have on an orchestra ?
is it purely good news - more revenue and publicity - or can it also be damaging ? well it can be either .
in this case , he and the orchestra were so closely identified after so many years , and it was the coming together of two superstar names : karajan and the berlin philharmonic . ...
a music director is n't just a conductor .
he is someone who builds the orchestra in addition to conducting it .
in this case , karajan had built up this orchestra over a number of years , and made it into a sensational machine .
they played beautifully for him . to what do you attribute the ongoing interest in karajan ? well , there is the factor of permanence , for one thing .
it helps karajan and hurts people today .
it used to be that people 's vinyl lps would wear down and become unplayable .
now , digital recordings are permanent .
so there are these recordings that were the standard of their time , and they remain with us , and become standards of this time , too . it makes it difficult for people to come up with recording projects today , because all these standards are still readily available . in karajan 's case , there was also this international renown that he had .
when japan was warming to classical music - to put it mildly - 20 or 30 years ago , karajan was almost synonymous with classical music there .
so there is a built-in audience all around the world for his recordings . karajan had an international career , but was still very much a german and austrian conductor .
now an englishman , sir simon rattle , leads the berlin philharmonic . does nationality have a role in orchestras today ? it has become less relevant .
it used to be that orchestras from different countries had different sounds - the russians had very piercing brass instruments , the germans had tremendous warmth in their string sound .
as conductors travel around the world , and players go from orchestra to orchestra , and sometimes from country to country , those things have greatly diminished , in the last 30 or 40 years . that 's the way of the world .
but some of us yearn , to some extent , for the old days , when there were those characteristic sounds of orchestras .
when nobody could play german music like the germans and nobody could play french music like the french . one of the most frequently debated aspects of karajan 's life is the fact that he joined the nazi party in 1933 .
modern biographers have argued it was a political career move , rather than an ideological one .
still , he conducted for hitler and other top nazis , who revered him .
how important is this aspect of his biography ? bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : german composer and conductor richard strauss well , it is a very important aspect .
and he is far from alone in any of this .
-lsb- german conductor wilhelm -rsb- furtwaengler , of course , had many of the same problems ... and -lsb- german composer -rsb- richard strauss was the head of the nazi music chamber .
so karajan was far from alone . it 's a very unfortunate aspect of his biography , but it does n't mitigate his music making in any way , i do n't think .
there were a lot of bad things happening in those days , and he was part of it . if you read about karajan in the press , it is hard to find anyone neutral .
the musicians who played for him adored him , as did a large public .
yet many writers today criticize his sound as being too " cold " and technical , and take his perfectionism to task .
what 's your take ? well , i do n't find his music making cold .
it was certainly very lush , and that was problematic in some ways .
i remember a recording came out of bach and stravinsky , and for me the funny thing about that record is that karajan was out of his depth on both ends .
his big , lush bach sound is totally out of date today , now that the early music movement has brought back the smallness of sound from the baroque era .
and in the case of stravinsky - a very angular , modern sound - again , karajan 's sound is very lush and rich .
it missed the angles and it missed a lot of the music as a result . so , it was a style that did n't suit all types of music , but the music it suited , it suited very well .
there is a recording late in his life of mahler 's 9th symphony that is the opposite of cold .
its one of the great recordings ever made .
so i 'm not sure what people have in mind when they use a blanket term like cold to describe his music making . karajan was also known for leading an extravagant lifestyle , flying jets and driving race cars .
he was also criticized by some for ostensibly forcing concert ticket prices so high that only the wealthy could attend .
how did this affect the public 's view of him ? bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : karajan steps off the jet with his wife , eliette -lrb- left -rrb- and daughter isabella well , i do n't think karajan set concert prices .
karajan certainly made a lot of money and demanded a lot of money , but he was n't alone in that .
concerts were very expensive , especially at salzburg .
but it is far from just karajan .
yo yo ma , itzhak perlman - all sorts of people were demanding huge amounts of money .
and that 's what sent ticket prices soaring . so did his luxury lifestyle image act in his favor , or against him ? i think it humanized him .
toscanini was put on a pedestal by music lovers for a long time .
in this case it brought karajan in to a real world that people could identify with , or wished they had ...
i 'm sure the image was certainly part of the package . how do you suppose karajan will be remembered ? i think there are a lot of generalizations going around this year , and i think generalizations are always risky .
i do n't want to see him swamped , and go down in history with words like " cold " attached and " luxury " attached .
he was many things .
he was a very complex figure , and he was a great musician . interview : jennifer abramsohn send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

croatia and albania were formally invited to join , while macedonia was not . nato leaders were set on thursday , april 3 , to endorse a planned us missile shield for europe , a senior us official told reporters . the final summit statement would " recognize the substantive contribution to the protection of the allies " from the missile defense system to be deployed in the czech republic and poland , the official told reporters . " the united states and the czech republic are pleased to announce the completion of negotiations on a missile-defense agreement .

ottawa had said it would pull its 2,500 troops out next year if reinforcements were not forthcoming . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : sarkozy said france was willing to deploy additional troops to afghanistan french president nicolas sarkozy had said earlier france would send a battalion of troops to the east of afghanistan as part of efforts to bolster the 47,000-strong peacekeeping force . " i have decided to reinforce the french military presence with one battalion deployed in the east region , " president nicolas sarkozy said in a speech delivered at the summit , the afp news agency reported . the offer , which french military sources put at between 800 and 1,000 soldiers , came amid french plans for a return to nato 's military command next year after more than four decades of absence . " at the end of the french presidency of the european union , the moment will have come to conclude this process and to make the necessary decisions for france to take its full place in nato 's structures , " sarkozy said .
paris is set to take over the rotating eu presidency in july . staying in afghanistan as long as it takes it was good news for us president george w. bush , who on wednesday had urged nato allies to send more troops to afghanistan , stressing that the 26-nation trans-atlantic alliance could not afford to lose its battle against taliban insurgents and al qaeda militants .
as yet , only a few countries have answered his call . " whatever the cost , however difficult , we can not afford it , we must win , " he had said ahead of the summit . in paris , a sarkozy advisor said prior to the summit that the french president had set out conditions for the extra french troops in a letter to nato allies , including an increase in international aid to afghanistan .

" we agree today that these countries will become member nations , " he said , adding that prospects for their membership plans would be reviewed in december . france and germany had led opposition to the move , saying it was premature when public support for nato was barely 30 percent in ukraine , and georgia did not control all its territory due to frozen conflicts with russian-backed separatists . " we have reached the conclusion that it is too early to give both countries membership action plan status , " german chancellor angela merkel had said on arrival at the summit . a senior georgian diplomat has told the bbc that the " no " to georgia will be widely seen as a victory for russia , which has long been expressing concerns over nato 's eastward expansion . croatia and albania sit at the table bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : merkel does not support nato 's eastwards push greece , meanwhile , dug its heels in over accession by macedonia , unless the country changed its name to recognize athens ' concerns regarding greece 's northern region with the same name - prompting fresh concerns about stability in the balkans .
officials said thursday that the alliance decided not to invite macedonia to join until the dispute is solved . according to a macedonian government spokesman , allied leaders meeting in bucharest had authorized their ambassadors to issue the invitation as soon as the name issue , which has festered for 17 years , is resolved . " we have agreed that an invitation to the former yugoslav republic of macedonia will be issued as soon as a mutually acceptable solution to the name issue has been reached , " nato 's secretary-general jaap de hoop scheffer told a news conference . two other balkan countries - croatia and albania - were , however , invited to join the defense alliance and sat at nato 's table for the first time thursday .

far too many cars are not able to process the fuel , industry sources said , putting a dent in the environment plan . auto industry sources said on that more than 2 million cars in germany would not be able to handle biofuels , thereby exceeding a 1-million limit the german government had set as a pre-condition for use . the sources said that some 330,000 cars made by german manufacturers , as well as more than 2 million imported cars , could not run on the new fuel and that the cars ' owners would be forced to fill up with higher octane , more expensive types of gas . the controversial plan to include a 10-percent biofuel blend plans could be slowed if it seemed likely that vehicle engines would be damaged by the mixture , a spokesperson for the german environment ministry said on wednesday , april 2 . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : biofuel blends are part of a larger german environment plan that includes reducing emissions environment minister sigmar gabriel had earlier said he would annul a government decree for the fuel , called e-10 , be introduced if too many cars were unable to run on it . " we wo n't put this regulation into effect if more than 1 million vehicles are affected , " gabriel told the stuttgarter nachrichten newspaper . part of a larger emissions reduction plan the german law would require regular gasoline to be mixed with 10 percent plant-based ethanol , called " e-10 , " and diesel to be mixed with 7 percent fuel made of plant origin by next year .
by 2020 , the ratio is supposed to rise to 17 percent . it is part of a larger plan to curb emissions , with eu states agreeing last year to reduce emissions by at least one-fifth by 2020 from 1990 levels , to use 20 percent of renewable energy sources in power production and 10 percent of biofuels from crops for transportation , also by 2020 . a change in the biofuel plan would demand possibly altering the overall targets . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : rapeseed can also be used as a biofuel adac , germany 's central motoring club , said that biofuels would damage the hoses and gaskets in 3 million cars on german roads , forcing those car owners to buy a more expensive , non-plant super grade of gas instead .
adac called for the introduction of e-10 to be delayed until 2012 . gabriel has said he will await figures from the auto industry on the number of cars actually unable to use the fuel before making a final decision on whether or not to introduce the plan . environmentalists critical of biofuel farming environmentalist organizations are critical of the plan themselves , albeit for a different reason .
greenpeace said on wednesday that the german plan to blend diesel with biodiesel to combat climate change is detrimental . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : diesel , unleaded , super , and biofuel blends are showing up at the pumps the group said it had tested fossil diesel sold at over 40 filling stations across germany to determine which vegetable oils were used in compulsory biodiesel blends .
it found that around 20 percent was soy oil rather than rapeseed oil from the german harvest . greenpeace said in a statement that germany 's blending policy would not help to fight global warming since soy oil imports largely came from south america , where tropical rain forests were being slashed to cultivate soybeans . " huge areas of tropical rain forests are being destroyed for the new plantations , for example in argentina , " the organization said . but , germany 's biofuels industry association told reuters news service that greenpeace 's charges were unjustified , and that soy oil comes from north america , argentina and brazil . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : straw turned into biofuel ?
you bet !
" soy oil from the us and argentina does not have rain forest issues , " vdb chief executive petra sprick said . "
imports from brazil are largely handled by major trading houses such as adm , bunge and cargill , which have voluntary agreements only to purchase soy oil from sustainable agriculture and not from areas using cleared tropical rain forests . " germany made the blending of biodiesel with fossil diesel at oil refineries compulsory in january 2007 as part of its policies to combat global warming .
fossil diesel must contain 4.4 percent biodiesel . biofuel farming is also driving up world food prices , such as for corn and grains - which are used to make ethanol . dw staff -lrb- als -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

the late collector 's stockpiling instinct was so intense he drove himself out of his own home . over-eager collecting - it can come about through a variety of ways .
often it involves someone with a lot of time on their hands , a home shopping channel and a telephone .

soon enough , another order 's been placed .
it can go downhill from here .
the recent case of a 71-year-old man who had a need to stockpile likely did n't involve tv shopping - this man 's primary passion was guns .
the estate lawyer sent out to look at the man 's apartment in the western city of aachen after his death found 71 rifles , revolvers , and pistols along with other weapons he had built himself .
" there were 71 guns - one for each year of his life , " said police spokesman paul kemen .
" he also had 41 cases of ammunition and five walking sticks fitted with retractable blades . "
the man did not have a permit to own weapons , and retractable blades are illegal in germany .
although guns were a special love , the collector did n't limit himself to just weapons .
according to neighbors , the man , who lived alone , collected everything from garden tools to watches .
" the house was stuffed to the rafters , " heiner hautermans , a reporter at the aachener nachrichten newspaper , told reuters .
" by the end , the neighbors said he had to sleep in a hotel sometimes because there was no more room . " dw staff -lrb- jam -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

the recent case of a 71-year-old man who had a need to stockpile likely did n't involve tv shopping - this man 's primary passion was guns .
the estate lawyer sent out to look at the man 's apartment in the western city of aachen after his death found 71 rifles , revolvers , and pistols along with other weapons he had built himself .
" there were 71 guns - one for each year of his life , " said police spokesman paul kemen .
" he also had 41 cases of ammunition and five walking sticks fitted with retractable blades . "
the man did not have a permit to own weapons , and retractable blades are illegal in germany .
although guns were a special love , the collector did n't limit himself to just weapons .
according to neighbors , the man , who lived alone , collected everything from garden tools to watches .
" the house was stuffed to the rafters , " heiner hautermans , a reporter at the aachener nachrichten newspaper , told reuters .
" by the end , the neighbors said he had to sleep in a hotel sometimes because there was no more room . " dw staff -lrb- jam -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de music -pipe- 03.04.2008 critic explains allure of von karajan , 100 years and counting großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : great , but flawed : herbert von karajan -lrb- 1908-1989 -rrb- ahead of the 100th anniversary of the birth of famous orchestra director and conductor herbert von karajan on april 5 , dw-world.de talked about the maestro as a cultural icon with james oestreich of the new york times . in 1955 , von karajan - classical music 's most prolific recording artist - was named director of the berlin philharmonic orchestra , and was credited with creating its clean and distinctive sound during his 35-year tenure .
he was also chief conductor of the vienna symphony orchestra , and the guiding force behind the salzburg festival , where he conducted for 33 years .
karajan died july 16 , 1989 . dw-world.de spoke with james oestreich , music and dance editor at the new york times , about von karajan 's significance in music history . dw-world.de : these days you ca n't look anywhere in the german media without seeing a story or documentary or article about the life of herbert von karajan .
what 's all the fuss about ? james oestreich : he was probably the most recorded conductor of his time .
it was a time when long-playing records were really taking off , and then digital recording came in and the cd came in , and he was riding that technology through the whole thing . he recorded everything , all the time , and he re-recorded things .
he recorded the brahms symphonies three times , i believe , and the beethoven symphonies three times .
so he was simply everywhere . to boot , he was in many ways a fantastic conductor .
he had his shortcomings , as many people do .
but what he did well , he did extremely well .
and he had at that time one of the world 's greatest orchestras , if not the world 's greatest orchestra , performing for him . bildunterschrift : karajan conducts the berlin philharmonic in 1987 can you name a highlight ? his 1960s recordings of the beethoven symphonies were classic .
they were the way i , among many others , got to know the beethoven symphonies .
so they were kind of my standard , and many people 's standard for those works . what effect does a superstar conductor have on an orchestra ?
is it purely good news - more revenue and publicity - or can it also be damaging ? well it can be either .
in this case , he and the orchestra were so closely identified after so many years , and it was the coming together of two superstar names : karajan and the berlin philharmonic . ...
a music director is n't just a conductor .
he is someone who builds the orchestra in addition to conducting it .
in this case , karajan had built up this orchestra over a number of years , and made it into a sensational machine .
they played beautifully for him . to what do you attribute the ongoing interest in karajan ? well , there is the factor of permanence , for one thing .
it helps karajan and hurts people today .
it used to be that people 's vinyl lps would wear down and become unplayable .
now , digital recordings are permanent .
so there are these recordings that were the standard of their time , and they remain with us , and become standards of this time , too . it makes it difficult for people to come up with recording projects today , because all these standards are still readily available . in karajan 's case , there was also this international renown that he had .
when japan was warming to classical music - to put it mildly - 20 or 30 years ago , karajan was almost synonymous with classical music there .
so there is a built-in audience all around the world for his recordings . karajan had an international career , but was still very much a german and austrian conductor .
now an englishman , sir simon rattle , leads the berlin philharmonic . does nationality have a role in orchestras today ? it has become less relevant .
it used to be that orchestras from different countries had different sounds - the russians had very piercing brass instruments , the germans had tremendous warmth in their string sound .
as conductors travel around the world , and players go from orchestra to orchestra , and sometimes from country to country , those things have greatly diminished , in the last 30 or 40 years . that 's the way of the world .
but some of us yearn , to some extent , for the old days , when there were those characteristic sounds of orchestras .
when nobody could play german music like the germans and nobody could play french music like the french . one of the most frequently debated aspects of karajan 's life is the fact that he joined the nazi party in 1933 .
modern biographers have argued it was a political career move , rather than an ideological one .
still , he conducted for hitler and other top nazis , who revered him .
how important is this aspect of his biography ? bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : german composer and conductor richard strauss well , it is a very important aspect .
and he is far from alone in any of this .
-lsb- german conductor wilhelm -rsb- furtwaengler , of course , had many of the same problems ... and -lsb- german composer -rsb- richard strauss was the head of the nazi music chamber .
so karajan was far from alone . it 's a very unfortunate aspect of his biography , but it does n't mitigate his music making in any way , i do n't think .
there were a lot of bad things happening in those days , and he was part of it . if you read about karajan in the press , it is hard to find anyone neutral .
the musicians who played for him adored him , as did a large public .
yet many writers today criticize his sound as being too " cold " and technical , and take his perfectionism to task .
what 's your take ? well , i do n't find his music making cold .
it was certainly very lush , and that was problematic in some ways .
i remember a recording came out of bach and stravinsky , and for me the funny thing about that record is that karajan was out of his depth on both ends .
his big , lush bach sound is totally out of date today , now that the early music movement has brought back the smallness of sound from the baroque era .
and in the case of stravinsky - a very angular , modern sound - again , karajan 's sound is very lush and rich .
it missed the angles and it missed a lot of the music as a result . so , it was a style that did n't suit all types of music , but the music it suited , it suited very well .
there is a recording late in his life of mahler 's 9th symphony that is the opposite of cold .
its one of the great recordings ever made .
so i 'm not sure what people have in mind when they use a blanket term like cold to describe his music making . karajan was also known for leading an extravagant lifestyle , flying jets and driving race cars .
he was also criticized by some for ostensibly forcing concert ticket prices so high that only the wealthy could attend .
how did this affect the public 's view of him ? bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : karajan steps off the jet with his wife , eliette -lrb- left -rrb- and daughter isabella well , i do n't think karajan set concert prices .
karajan certainly made a lot of money and demanded a lot of money , but he was n't alone in that .
concerts were very expensive , especially at salzburg .
but it is far from just karajan .
yo yo ma , itzhak perlman - all sorts of people were demanding huge amounts of money .
and that 's what sent ticket prices soaring . so did his luxury lifestyle image act in his favor , or against him ? i think it humanized him .
toscanini was put on a pedestal by music lovers for a long time .
in this case it brought karajan in to a real world that people could identify with , or wished they had ...
i 'm sure the image was certainly part of the package . how do you suppose karajan will be remembered ? i think there are a lot of generalizations going around this year , and i think generalizations are always risky .
i do n't want to see him swamped , and go down in history with words like " cold " attached and " luxury " attached .
he was many things .
he was a very complex figure , and he was a great musician . interview : jennifer abramsohn send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

the carmaker called the program disproportionate , illegal and unfair . the german luxury sports car maker lodged papers at the royal courts of justice on wednesday , april 2 , in a bid to stop london mayor ken livingstone 's proposed charge . under the mayor 's plan , from october , people with cars that emit more than 225 grams of carbon dioxide per kilometer - such as sports utility vehicles and high-powered performance cars - will pay a daily charge of 25 pounds -lrb- $ 49.70 , 31.75 euros -rrb- to drive into central london . " not only is this new tax on motorists unfair , it is also a disproportionate and illegal use of power by the mayor , " said andy goss , managing director of porsche cars gb , after the judicial review papers were filed . " the porsche case is about protecting london and londoners from a new tax that will not only fail to reduce carbon dioxide emissions in central london , but also increase congestion and damage air quality . " a judge will now have to decide within the next few days whether to proceed with the case . not backing down livingstone appeared to be unswayed by porsche 's criticism and vowed to fight the legal action . " porsche 's self-serving legal action shows their continuing contempt for the views of londoners , " he said .
" porsche should be using its engineering expertise to create low-polluting cars , not its lawyers to oppose the democratic wishes of londoners . according to a recent poll , 61 percent of londoners approve of increasing the congestion tax for gas-guzzling vehicles . he added : " londoners , not car manufacturers , should be the ones to decide how to tackle pollution in their city .
i will vigorously contest porsche 's legal action . " elections might change things however , the pollution charge may never be imposed . londoners vote in mayoral elections on may 1 and opinion polls have put livingstone 's main rival boris johnson in the lead .
the conservative candidate has vowed to ditch livingstone 's plan . it is the latest program targeting london 's traffic pollution and congestion problems . for five years , london has been assessing drivers a daily congestion charge , now set at eight pounds , to drive into the central city and a large swath around it .
the fee was designed to tackle the bottlenecks that have turned much of london into a parking lot . the uk capital is the biggest urban area in the world to charge such a toll and city officials from around the globe have considered copying the idea . dw staff -lrb- jam -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de music -pipe- 03.04.2008 critic explains allure of von karajan , 100 years and counting großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : great , but flawed : herbert von karajan -lrb- 1908-1989 -rrb- ahead of the 100th anniversary of the birth of famous orchestra director and conductor herbert von karajan on april 5 , dw-world.de talked about the maestro as a cultural icon with james oestreich of the new york times . in 1955 , von karajan - classical music 's most prolific recording artist - was named director of the berlin philharmonic orchestra , and was credited with creating its clean and distinctive sound during his 35-year tenure .
he was also chief conductor of the vienna symphony orchestra , and the guiding force behind the salzburg festival , where he conducted for 33 years .
karajan died july 16 , 1989 . dw-world.de spoke with james oestreich , music and dance editor at the new york times , about von karajan 's significance in music history . dw-world.de : these days you ca n't look anywhere in the german media without seeing a story or documentary or article about the life of herbert von karajan .
what 's all the fuss about ? james oestreich : he was probably the most recorded conductor of his time .
it was a time when long-playing records were really taking off , and then digital recording came in and the cd came in , and he was riding that technology through the whole thing . he recorded everything , all the time , and he re-recorded things .
he recorded the brahms symphonies three times , i believe , and the beethoven symphonies three times .
so he was simply everywhere . to boot , he was in many ways a fantastic conductor .
he had his shortcomings , as many people do .
but what he did well , he did extremely well .
and he had at that time one of the world 's greatest orchestras , if not the world 's greatest orchestra , performing for him . bildunterschrift : karajan conducts the berlin philharmonic in 1987 can you name a highlight ? his 1960s recordings of the beethoven symphonies were classic .
they were the way i , among many others , got to know the beethoven symphonies .
so they were kind of my standard , and many people 's standard for those works . what effect does a superstar conductor have on an orchestra ?
is it purely good news - more revenue and publicity - or can it also be damaging ? well it can be either .
in this case , he and the orchestra were so closely identified after so many years , and it was the coming together of two superstar names : karajan and the berlin philharmonic . ...
a music director is n't just a conductor .
he is someone who builds the orchestra in addition to conducting it .
in this case , karajan had built up this orchestra over a number of years , and made it into a sensational machine .
they played beautifully for him . to what do you attribute the ongoing interest in karajan ? well , there is the factor of permanence , for one thing .
it helps karajan and hurts people today .
it used to be that people 's vinyl lps would wear down and become unplayable .
now , digital recordings are permanent .
so there are these recordings that were the standard of their time , and they remain with us , and become standards of this time , too . it makes it difficult for people to come up with recording projects today , because all these standards are still readily available . in karajan 's case , there was also this international renown that he had .
when japan was warming to classical music - to put it mildly - 20 or 30 years ago , karajan was almost synonymous with classical music there .
so there is a built-in audience all around the world for his recordings . karajan had an international career , but was still very much a german and austrian conductor .
now an englishman , sir simon rattle , leads the berlin philharmonic . does nationality have a role in orchestras today ? it has become less relevant .
it used to be that orchestras from different countries had different sounds - the russians had very piercing brass instruments , the germans had tremendous warmth in their string sound .
as conductors travel around the world , and players go from orchestra to orchestra , and sometimes from country to country , those things have greatly diminished , in the last 30 or 40 years . that 's the way of the world .
but some of us yearn , to some extent , for the old days , when there were those characteristic sounds of orchestras .
when nobody could play german music like the germans and nobody could play french music like the french . one of the most frequently debated aspects of karajan 's life is the fact that he joined the nazi party in 1933 .
modern biographers have argued it was a political career move , rather than an ideological one .
still , he conducted for hitler and other top nazis , who revered him .
how important is this aspect of his biography ? bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : german composer and conductor richard strauss well , it is a very important aspect .
and he is far from alone in any of this .
-lsb- german conductor wilhelm -rsb- furtwaengler , of course , had many of the same problems ... and -lsb- german composer -rsb- richard strauss was the head of the nazi music chamber .
so karajan was far from alone . it 's a very unfortunate aspect of his biography , but it does n't mitigate his music making in any way , i do n't think .
there were a lot of bad things happening in those days , and he was part of it . if you read about karajan in the press , it is hard to find anyone neutral .
the musicians who played for him adored him , as did a large public .
yet many writers today criticize his sound as being too " cold " and technical , and take his perfectionism to task .
what 's your take ? well , i do n't find his music making cold .
it was certainly very lush , and that was problematic in some ways .
i remember a recording came out of bach and stravinsky , and for me the funny thing about that record is that karajan was out of his depth on both ends .
his big , lush bach sound is totally out of date today , now that the early music movement has brought back the smallness of sound from the baroque era .
and in the case of stravinsky - a very angular , modern sound - again , karajan 's sound is very lush and rich .
it missed the angles and it missed a lot of the music as a result . so , it was a style that did n't suit all types of music , but the music it suited , it suited very well .
there is a recording late in his life of mahler 's 9th symphony that is the opposite of cold .
its one of the great recordings ever made .
so i 'm not sure what people have in mind when they use a blanket term like cold to describe his music making . karajan was also known for leading an extravagant lifestyle , flying jets and driving race cars .
he was also criticized by some for ostensibly forcing concert ticket prices so high that only the wealthy could attend .
how did this affect the public 's view of him ? bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : karajan steps off the jet with his wife , eliette -lrb- left -rrb- and daughter isabella well , i do n't think karajan set concert prices .
karajan certainly made a lot of money and demanded a lot of money , but he was n't alone in that .
concerts were very expensive , especially at salzburg .
but it is far from just karajan .
yo yo ma , itzhak perlman - all sorts of people were demanding huge amounts of money .
and that 's what sent ticket prices soaring . so did his luxury lifestyle image act in his favor , or against him ? i think it humanized him .
toscanini was put on a pedestal by music lovers for a long time .
in this case it brought karajan in to a real world that people could identify with , or wished they had ...
i 'm sure the image was certainly part of the package . how do you suppose karajan will be remembered ? i think there are a lot of generalizations going around this year , and i think generalizations are always risky .
i do n't want to see him swamped , and go down in history with words like " cold " attached and " luxury " attached .
he was many things .
he was a very complex figure , and he was a great musician . interview : jennifer abramsohn send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

karajan died july 16 , 1989 . dw-world.de spoke with james oestreich , music and dance editor at the new york times , about von karajan 's significance in music history . dw-world.de : these days you ca n't look anywhere in the german media without seeing a story or documentary or article about the life of herbert von karajan .
what 's all the fuss about ? james oestreich : he was probably the most recorded conductor of his time .
it was a time when long-playing records were really taking off , and then digital recording came in and the cd came in , and he was riding that technology through the whole thing . he recorded everything , all the time , and he re-recorded things .
he recorded the brahms symphonies three times , i believe , and the beethoven symphonies three times .
so he was simply everywhere . to boot , he was in many ways a fantastic conductor .
he had his shortcomings , as many people do .
but what he did well , he did extremely well .
and he had at that time one of the world 's greatest orchestras , if not the world 's greatest orchestra , performing for him . bildunterschrift : karajan conducts the berlin philharmonic in 1987 can you name a highlight ? his 1960s recordings of the beethoven symphonies were classic .
they were the way i , among many others , got to know the beethoven symphonies .
so they were kind of my standard , and many people 's standard for those works . what effect does a superstar conductor have on an orchestra ?
is it purely good news - more revenue and publicity - or can it also be damaging ? well it can be either .
in this case , he and the orchestra were so closely identified after so many years , and it was the coming together of two superstar names : karajan and the berlin philharmonic . ...
a music director is n't just a conductor .
he is someone who builds the orchestra in addition to conducting it .
in this case , karajan had built up this orchestra over a number of years , and made it into a sensational machine .
they played beautifully for him . to what do you attribute the ongoing interest in karajan ? well , there is the factor of permanence , for one thing .
it helps karajan and hurts people today .
it used to be that people 's vinyl lps would wear down and become unplayable .
now , digital recordings are permanent .
so there are these recordings that were the standard of their time , and they remain with us , and become standards of this time , too . it makes it difficult for people to come up with recording projects today , because all these standards are still readily available . in karajan 's case , there was also this international renown that he had .
when japan was warming to classical music - to put it mildly - 20 or 30 years ago , karajan was almost synonymous with classical music there .
so there is a built-in audience all around the world for his recordings . karajan had an international career , but was still very much a german and austrian conductor .
now an englishman , sir simon rattle , leads the berlin philharmonic . does nationality have a role in orchestras today ? it has become less relevant .
it used to be that orchestras from different countries had different sounds - the russians had very piercing brass instruments , the germans had tremendous warmth in their string sound .
as conductors travel around the world , and players go from orchestra to orchestra , and sometimes from country to country , those things have greatly diminished , in the last 30 or 40 years . that 's the way of the world .
but some of us yearn , to some extent , for the old days , when there were those characteristic sounds of orchestras .
when nobody could play german music like the germans and nobody could play french music like the french . one of the most frequently debated aspects of karajan 's life is the fact that he joined the nazi party in 1933 .
modern biographers have argued it was a political career move , rather than an ideological one .
still , he conducted for hitler and other top nazis , who revered him .
how important is this aspect of his biography ? bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : german composer and conductor richard strauss well , it is a very important aspect .
and he is far from alone in any of this .
-lsb- german conductor wilhelm -rsb- furtwaengler , of course , had many of the same problems ... and -lsb- german composer -rsb- richard strauss was the head of the nazi music chamber .
so karajan was far from alone . it 's a very unfortunate aspect of his biography , but it does n't mitigate his music making in any way , i do n't think .
there were a lot of bad things happening in those days , and he was part of it . if you read about karajan in the press , it is hard to find anyone neutral .
the musicians who played for him adored him , as did a large public .
yet many writers today criticize his sound as being too " cold " and technical , and take his perfectionism to task .
what 's your take ? well , i do n't find his music making cold .
it was certainly very lush , and that was problematic in some ways .
i remember a recording came out of bach and stravinsky , and for me the funny thing about that record is that karajan was out of his depth on both ends .
his big , lush bach sound is totally out of date today , now that the early music movement has brought back the smallness of sound from the baroque era .
and in the case of stravinsky - a very angular , modern sound - again , karajan 's sound is very lush and rich .
it missed the angles and it missed a lot of the music as a result . so , it was a style that did n't suit all types of music , but the music it suited , it suited very well .
there is a recording late in his life of mahler 's 9th symphony that is the opposite of cold .
its one of the great recordings ever made .
so i 'm not sure what people have in mind when they use a blanket term like cold to describe his music making . karajan was also known for leading an extravagant lifestyle , flying jets and driving race cars .
he was also criticized by some for ostensibly forcing concert ticket prices so high that only the wealthy could attend .
how did this affect the public 's view of him ? bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : karajan steps off the jet with his wife , eliette -lrb- left -rrb- and daughter isabella well , i do n't think karajan set concert prices .
karajan certainly made a lot of money and demanded a lot of money , but he was n't alone in that .
concerts were very expensive , especially at salzburg .
but it is far from just karajan .
yo yo ma , itzhak perlman - all sorts of people were demanding huge amounts of money .
and that 's what sent ticket prices soaring . so did his luxury lifestyle image act in his favor , or against him ? i think it humanized him .
toscanini was put on a pedestal by music lovers for a long time .
in this case it brought karajan in to a real world that people could identify with , or wished they had ...
i 'm sure the image was certainly part of the package . how do you suppose karajan will be remembered ? i think there are a lot of generalizations going around this year , and i think generalizations are always risky .
i do n't want to see him swamped , and go down in history with words like " cold " attached and " luxury " attached .
he was many things .
he was a very complex figure , and he was a great musician . interview : jennifer abramsohn send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

the carmaker called the program disproportionate , illegal and unfair . the german luxury sports car maker lodged papers at the royal courts of justice on wednesday , april 2 , in a bid to stop london mayor ken livingstone 's proposed charge . under the mayor 's plan , from october , people with cars that emit more than 225 grams of carbon dioxide per kilometer - such as sports utility vehicles and high-powered performance cars - will pay a daily charge of 25 pounds -lrb- $ 49.70 , 31.75 euros -rrb- to drive into central london . " not only is this new tax on motorists unfair , it is also a disproportionate and illegal use of power by the mayor , " said andy goss , managing director of porsche cars gb , after the judicial review papers were filed . " the porsche case is about protecting london and londoners from a new tax that will not only fail to reduce carbon dioxide emissions in central london , but also increase congestion and damage air quality . " a judge will now have to decide within the next few days whether to proceed with the case . not backing down livingstone appeared to be unswayed by porsche 's criticism and vowed to fight the legal action . " porsche 's self-serving legal action shows their continuing contempt for the views of londoners , " he said .
" porsche should be using its engineering expertise to create low-polluting cars , not its lawyers to oppose the democratic wishes of londoners . according to a recent poll , 61 percent of londoners approve of increasing the congestion tax for gas-guzzling vehicles . he added : " londoners , not car manufacturers , should be the ones to decide how to tackle pollution in their city .
i will vigorously contest porsche 's legal action . " elections might change things however , the pollution charge may never be imposed . londoners vote in mayoral elections on may 1 and opinion polls have put livingstone 's main rival boris johnson in the lead .

the late collector 's stockpiling instinct was so intense he drove himself out of his own home . over-eager collecting - it can come about through a variety of ways .
often it involves someone with a lot of time on their hands , a home shopping channel and a telephone .
before long , the packages start to arrive , giving the recipient a temporary frisson of excitement that quickly wears off .
soon enough , another order 's been placed .
it can go downhill from here .
the recent case of a 71-year-old man who had a need to stockpile likely did n't involve tv shopping - this man 's primary passion was guns .
the estate lawyer sent out to look at the man 's apartment in the western city of aachen after his death found 71 rifles , revolvers , and pistols along with other weapons he had built himself .
" there were 71 guns - one for each year of his life , " said police spokesman paul kemen .
" he also had 41 cases of ammunition and five walking sticks fitted with retractable blades . "
the man did not have a permit to own weapons , and retractable blades are illegal in germany .
although guns were a special love , the collector did n't limit himself to just weapons .
according to neighbors , the man , who lived alone , collected everything from garden tools to watches .
" the house was stuffed to the rafters , " heiner hautermans , a reporter at the aachener nachrichten newspaper , told reuters .

the carmaker called the program disproportionate , illegal and unfair . the german luxury sports car maker lodged papers at the royal courts of justice on wednesday , april 2 , in a bid to stop london mayor ken livingstone 's proposed charge . under the mayor 's plan , from october , people with cars that emit more than 225 grams of carbon dioxide per kilometer - such as sports utility vehicles and high-powered performance cars - will pay a daily charge of 25 pounds -lrb- $ 49.70 , 31.75 euros -rrb- to drive into central london . " not only is this new tax on motorists unfair , it is also a disproportionate and illegal use of power by the mayor , " said andy goss , managing director of porsche cars gb , after the judicial review papers were filed . " the porsche case is about protecting london and londoners from a new tax that will not only fail to reduce carbon dioxide emissions in central london , but also increase congestion and damage air quality . " a judge will now have to decide within the next few days whether to proceed with the case . not backing down livingstone appeared to be unswayed by porsche 's criticism and vowed to fight the legal action . " porsche 's self-serving legal action shows their continuing contempt for the views of londoners , " he said .
" porsche should be using its engineering expertise to create low-polluting cars , not its lawyers to oppose the democratic wishes of londoners . according to a recent poll , 61 percent of londoners approve of increasing the congestion tax for gas-guzzling vehicles . he added : " londoners , not car manufacturers , should be the ones to decide how to tackle pollution in their city .
i will vigorously contest porsche 's legal action . " elections might change things however , the pollution charge may never be imposed . londoners vote in mayoral elections on may 1 and opinion polls have put livingstone 's main rival boris johnson in the lead .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de music -pipe- 03.04.2008 critic explains allure of von karajan , 100 years and counting großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : great , but flawed : herbert von karajan -lrb- 1908-1989 -rrb- ahead of the 100th anniversary of the birth of famous orchestra director and conductor herbert von karajan on april 5 , dw-world.de talked about the maestro as a cultural icon with james oestreich of the new york times . in 1955 , von karajan - classical music 's most prolific recording artist - was named director of the berlin philharmonic orchestra , and was credited with creating its clean and distinctive sound during his 35-year tenure .
he was also chief conductor of the vienna symphony orchestra , and the guiding force behind the salzburg festival , where he conducted for 33 years .
karajan died july 16 , 1989 . dw-world.de spoke with james oestreich , music and dance editor at the new york times , about von karajan 's significance in music history . dw-world.de : these days you ca n't look anywhere in the german media without seeing a story or documentary or article about the life of herbert von karajan .
what 's all the fuss about ? james oestreich : he was probably the most recorded conductor of his time .
it was a time when long-playing records were really taking off , and then digital recording came in and the cd came in , and he was riding that technology through the whole thing . he recorded everything , all the time , and he re-recorded things .
he recorded the brahms symphonies three times , i believe , and the beethoven symphonies three times .
so he was simply everywhere . to boot , he was in many ways a fantastic conductor .
he had his shortcomings , as many people do .
but what he did well , he did extremely well .
and he had at that time one of the world 's greatest orchestras , if not the world 's greatest orchestra , performing for him . bildunterschrift : karajan conducts the berlin philharmonic in 1987 can you name a highlight ? his 1960s recordings of the beethoven symphonies were classic .
they were the way i , among many others , got to know the beethoven symphonies .
so they were kind of my standard , and many people 's standard for those works . what effect does a superstar conductor have on an orchestra ?
is it purely good news - more revenue and publicity - or can it also be damaging ? well it can be either .
in this case , he and the orchestra were so closely identified after so many years , and it was the coming together of two superstar names : karajan and the berlin philharmonic . ...
a music director is n't just a conductor .
he is someone who builds the orchestra in addition to conducting it .
in this case , karajan had built up this orchestra over a number of years , and made it into a sensational machine .
they played beautifully for him . to what do you attribute the ongoing interest in karajan ? well , there is the factor of permanence , for one thing .
it helps karajan and hurts people today .
it used to be that people 's vinyl lps would wear down and become unplayable .
now , digital recordings are permanent .
so there are these recordings that were the standard of their time , and they remain with us , and become standards of this time , too . it makes it difficult for people to come up with recording projects today , because all these standards are still readily available . in karajan 's case , there was also this international renown that he had .
when japan was warming to classical music - to put it mildly - 20 or 30 years ago , karajan was almost synonymous with classical music there .
so there is a built-in audience all around the world for his recordings . karajan had an international career , but was still very much a german and austrian conductor .
now an englishman , sir simon rattle , leads the berlin philharmonic . does nationality have a role in orchestras today ? it has become less relevant .
it used to be that orchestras from different countries had different sounds - the russians had very piercing brass instruments , the germans had tremendous warmth in their string sound .
as conductors travel around the world , and players go from orchestra to orchestra , and sometimes from country to country , those things have greatly diminished , in the last 30 or 40 years . that 's the way of the world .
but some of us yearn , to some extent , for the old days , when there were those characteristic sounds of orchestras .
when nobody could play german music like the germans and nobody could play french music like the french . one of the most frequently debated aspects of karajan 's life is the fact that he joined the nazi party in 1933 .
modern biographers have argued it was a political career move , rather than an ideological one .
still , he conducted for hitler and other top nazis , who revered him .
how important is this aspect of his biography ? bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : german composer and conductor richard strauss well , it is a very important aspect .
and he is far from alone in any of this .
-lsb- german conductor wilhelm -rsb- furtwaengler , of course , had many of the same problems ... and -lsb- german composer -rsb- richard strauss was the head of the nazi music chamber .
so karajan was far from alone . it 's a very unfortunate aspect of his biography , but it does n't mitigate his music making in any way , i do n't think .
there were a lot of bad things happening in those days , and he was part of it . if you read about karajan in the press , it is hard to find anyone neutral .
the musicians who played for him adored him , as did a large public .
yet many writers today criticize his sound as being too " cold " and technical , and take his perfectionism to task .
what 's your take ? well , i do n't find his music making cold .
it was certainly very lush , and that was problematic in some ways .
i remember a recording came out of bach and stravinsky , and for me the funny thing about that record is that karajan was out of his depth on both ends .
his big , lush bach sound is totally out of date today , now that the early music movement has brought back the smallness of sound from the baroque era .
and in the case of stravinsky - a very angular , modern sound - again , karajan 's sound is very lush and rich .
it missed the angles and it missed a lot of the music as a result . so , it was a style that did n't suit all types of music , but the music it suited , it suited very well .
there is a recording late in his life of mahler 's 9th symphony that is the opposite of cold .
its one of the great recordings ever made .
so i 'm not sure what people have in mind when they use a blanket term like cold to describe his music making . karajan was also known for leading an extravagant lifestyle , flying jets and driving race cars .
he was also criticized by some for ostensibly forcing concert ticket prices so high that only the wealthy could attend .
how did this affect the public 's view of him ? bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : karajan steps off the jet with his wife , eliette -lrb- left -rrb- and daughter isabella well , i do n't think karajan set concert prices .
karajan certainly made a lot of money and demanded a lot of money , but he was n't alone in that .
concerts were very expensive , especially at salzburg .
but it is far from just karajan .
yo yo ma , itzhak perlman - all sorts of people were demanding huge amounts of money .
and that 's what sent ticket prices soaring . so did his luxury lifestyle image act in his favor , or against him ? i think it humanized him .
toscanini was put on a pedestal by music lovers for a long time .
in this case it brought karajan in to a real world that people could identify with , or wished they had ...
i 'm sure the image was certainly part of the package . how do you suppose karajan will be remembered ? i think there are a lot of generalizations going around this year , and i think generalizations are always risky .
i do n't want to see him swamped , and go down in history with words like " cold " attached and " luxury " attached .
he was many things .
he was a very complex figure , and he was a great musician . interview : jennifer abramsohn send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

" building the best bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the mercedes museum recent years have seen germany 's luxury carmakers racing to build the biggest and best museum , with bmw in munich and volkswagen in wolfsburg among the companies spending fortunes on exhibition spaces and theme parks . porsche 's eagerly-awaited futuristic-looking museum is specifically designed to rival the nearby mercedes-benz center , an 83 million euro facility hailed an architectural masterpiece when it opened in 2006 , and one which fast became a popular tourist magnet . positioned directly outside the main gate of the daimler factory in the untertuerkheim district , the spiral building was designed by the un studio of amsterdam and is based on a unique cloverleaf concept using three overlapping circles with the center removed to form a triangular atrium . the building 's height and " double helix " interior were designed to maximize space , providing 16,500 square meters of exhibition premises on a footprint of just 4,800 square meters .
clad in shimmering silver panels , the museum houses 80 passenger cars , 40 commercial trucks , and 40 racing cars and trucks with more than 1,500 displays from the company 's 120-year history . long-time rivalry bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : mercedes dominates the stuttgart skyline porsche was determined not to be outstripped .
but in fact , the company has long stood in the shadow of mercedes down in baden-wuerttemberg . stuttgart 's industrial heritage is a source of much pride to locals , and the region has always profited from the ongoing rivalry between the luxury carmakers , with each company trying to up its profile by funding competing museums and arenas . but ultimately , the city tends to identify most with the mercedes-benz brand , and the daimler firm has succeeded most obviously in conquering the stuttgart skyline . in comparison , porsche is something of a poor relation , forever trying to emulate and outdo its rival mercedes .
and in the race to erect the best museum , porsche , for the time being , is lagging behind . dw staff -lrb- jp -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

the late collector 's stockpiling instinct was so intense he drove himself out of his own home . over-eager collecting - it can come about through a variety of ways .
often it involves someone with a lot of time on their hands , a home shopping channel and a telephone .
before long , the packages start to arrive , giving the recipient a temporary frisson of excitement that quickly wears off .
soon enough , another order 's been placed .
it can go downhill from here .
the recent case of a 71-year-old man who had a need to stockpile likely did n't involve tv shopping - this man 's primary passion was guns .
the estate lawyer sent out to look at the man 's apartment in the western city of aachen after his death found 71 rifles , revolvers , and pistols along with other weapons he had built himself .
" there were 71 guns - one for each year of his life , " said police spokesman paul kemen .
" he also had 41 cases of ammunition and five walking sticks fitted with retractable blades . "
the man did not have a permit to own weapons , and retractable blades are illegal in germany .
although guns were a special love , the collector did n't limit himself to just weapons .
according to neighbors , the man , who lived alone , collected everything from garden tools to watches .
" the house was stuffed to the rafters , " heiner hautermans , a reporter at the aachener nachrichten newspaper , told reuters .

merkel calls on brazil to make biofuel production sustainable as biofuels fall from grace , a new generation grabs spotlight germany defends biofuels , hedges bets on energy goals german minister calls for reversal of eu agricultural policy environment -pipe- 03.04.2008 german cars ca n't handle biofuels , environment plan at risk großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : experts said too many cars in germany would n't be able to handle biofuel blends the german government 's plan to introduce a new biofuel blend may now be postponed .
far too many cars are not able to process the fuel , industry sources said , putting a dent in the environment plan . auto industry sources said on that more than 2 million cars in germany would not be able to handle biofuels , thereby exceeding a 1-million limit the german government had set as a pre-condition for use . the sources said that some 330,000 cars made by german manufacturers , as well as more than 2 million imported cars , could not run on the new fuel and that the cars ' owners would be forced to fill up with higher octane , more expensive types of gas . the controversial plan to include a 10-percent biofuel blend plans could be slowed if it seemed likely that vehicle engines would be damaged by the mixture , a spokesperson for the german environment ministry said on wednesday , april 2 . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : biofuel blends are part of a larger german environment plan that includes reducing emissions environment minister sigmar gabriel had earlier said he would annul a government decree for the fuel , called e-10 , be introduced if too many cars were unable to run on it . " we wo n't put this regulation into effect if more than 1 million vehicles are affected , " gabriel told the stuttgarter nachrichten newspaper . part of a larger emissions reduction plan the german law would require regular gasoline to be mixed with 10 percent plant-based ethanol , called " e-10 , " and diesel to be mixed with 7 percent fuel made of plant origin by next year .
by 2020 , the ratio is supposed to rise to 17 percent . it is part of a larger plan to curb emissions , with eu states agreeing last year to reduce emissions by at least one-fifth by 2020 from 1990 levels , to use 20 percent of renewable energy sources in power production and 10 percent of biofuels from crops for transportation , also by 2020 . a change in the biofuel plan would demand possibly altering the overall targets . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : rapeseed can also be used as a biofuel adac , germany 's central motoring club , said that biofuels would damage the hoses and gaskets in 3 million cars on german roads , forcing those car owners to buy a more expensive , non-plant super grade of gas instead .
adac called for the introduction of e-10 to be delayed until 2012 . gabriel has said he will await figures from the auto industry on the number of cars actually unable to use the fuel before making a final decision on whether or not to introduce the plan . environmentalists critical of biofuel farming environmentalist organizations are critical of the plan themselves , albeit for a different reason .
greenpeace said on wednesday that the german plan to blend diesel with biodiesel to combat climate change is detrimental . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : diesel , unleaded , super , and biofuel blends are showing up at the pumps the group said it had tested fossil diesel sold at over 40 filling stations across germany to determine which vegetable oils were used in compulsory biodiesel blends .
it found that around 20 percent was soy oil rather than rapeseed oil from the german harvest . greenpeace said in a statement that germany 's blending policy would not help to fight global warming since soy oil imports largely came from south america , where tropical rain forests were being slashed to cultivate soybeans . " huge areas of tropical rain forests are being destroyed for the new plantations , for example in argentina , " the organization said . but , germany 's biofuels industry association told reuters news service that greenpeace 's charges were unjustified , and that soy oil comes from north america , argentina and brazil . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : straw turned into biofuel ?
you bet !
" soy oil from the us and argentina does not have rain forest issues , " vdb chief executive petra sprick said . "
imports from brazil are largely handled by major trading houses such as adm , bunge and cargill , which have voluntary agreements only to purchase soy oil from sustainable agriculture and not from areas using cleared tropical rain forests . " germany made the blending of biodiesel with fossil diesel at oil refineries compulsory in january 2007 as part of its policies to combat global warming .
fossil diesel must contain 4.4 percent biodiesel . biofuel farming is also driving up world food prices , such as for corn and grains - which are used to make ethanol . dw staff -lrb- als -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

croatia and albania were formally invited to join , while macedonia was not . nato leaders were set on thursday , april 3 , to endorse a planned us missile shield for europe , a senior us official told reporters . the final summit statement would " recognize the substantive contribution to the protection of the allies " from the missile defense system to be deployed in the czech republic and poland , the official told reporters . " the united states and the czech republic are pleased to announce the completion of negotiations on a missile-defense agreement .
we plan to sign the agreement in the near future , " a statement said . french commitment the us official also said that president george w. bush had confirmed to the summit leaders that the us will be able to move some of its troops to afghanistan 's south once france sends a battalion of troops to the east of afghanistan , meeting canada 's conditions to keep troops in afghanistan until 2011 , the official said .
ottawa had said it would pull its 2,500 troops out next year if reinforcements were not forthcoming . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : sarkozy said france was willing to deploy additional troops to afghanistan french president nicolas sarkozy had said earlier france would send a battalion of troops to the east of afghanistan as part of efforts to bolster the 47,000-strong peacekeeping force . " i have decided to reinforce the french military presence with one battalion deployed in the east region , " president nicolas sarkozy said in a speech delivered at the summit , the afp news agency reported . the offer , which french military sources put at between 800 and 1,000 soldiers , came amid french plans for a return to nato 's military command next year after more than four decades of absence . " at the end of the french presidency of the european union , the moment will have come to conclude this process and to make the necessary decisions for france to take its full place in nato 's structures , " sarkozy said .
paris is set to take over the rotating eu presidency in july . staying in afghanistan as long as it takes it was good news for us president george w. bush , who on wednesday had urged nato allies to send more troops to afghanistan , stressing that the 26-nation trans-atlantic alliance could not afford to lose its battle against taliban insurgents and al qaeda militants .
as yet , only a few countries have answered his call . " whatever the cost , however difficult , we can not afford it , we must win , " he had said ahead of the summit . in paris , a sarkozy advisor said prior to the summit that the french president had set out conditions for the extra french troops in a letter to nato allies , including an increase in international aid to afghanistan . " he calls for a coordinated strategy whose goal will be a stable afghanistan , reconciled with itself and free of terrorism and drug trafficking , " the advisor said . according to reuters news agency , france is expected to seek us backing for its drive to bolster european union military structures during the second half of next year . reviewing membership for georgia and ukraine bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : canada is now to stay in afghanistan until 2011 but while the us welcomed the french offer of more troops , it met wednesday with strong opposition from paris and berlin over the question of the alliance 's eastwards enlargement - primarily out of fear of provoking moscow . bush had strongly urged skeptical european allies earlier to reward both countries for their democratic revolutions and not to allow russia , which is not a nato member , a veto over the alliance 's decisions . alliance leaders failed to agree to offer ukraine and georgia a membership action plan -lrb- map -rrb- , a gateway to eventual membership , but did confirm thursday that ukraine and georgia would one day become members of the north atlantic alliance , secretary-general jaap de hoop scheffer said . " we agree today that these countries will become member nations , " he said , adding that prospects for their membership plans would be reviewed in december . france and germany had led opposition to the move , saying it was premature when public support for nato was barely 30 percent in ukraine , and georgia did not control all its territory due to frozen conflicts with russian-backed separatists . " we have reached the conclusion that it is too early to give both countries membership action plan status , " german chancellor angela merkel had said on arrival at the summit . a senior georgian diplomat has told the bbc that the " no " to georgia will be widely seen as a victory for russia , which has long been expressing concerns over nato 's eastward expansion . croatia and albania sit at the table bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : merkel does not support nato 's eastwards push greece , meanwhile , dug its heels in over accession by macedonia , unless the country changed its name to recognize athens ' concerns regarding greece 's northern region with the same name - prompting fresh concerns about stability in the balkans .
officials said thursday that the alliance decided not to invite macedonia to join until the dispute is solved . according to a macedonian government spokesman , allied leaders meeting in bucharest had authorized their ambassadors to issue the invitation as soon as the name issue , which has festered for 17 years , is resolved . " we have agreed that an invitation to the former yugoslav republic of macedonia will be issued as soon as a mutually acceptable solution to the name issue has been reached , " nato 's secretary-general jaap de hoop scheffer told a news conference . two other balkan countries - croatia and albania - were , however , invited to join the defense alliance and sat at nato 's table for the first time thursday .
the two countries will become the 27th and 28th members of nato once the accession and ratification process has been finalized , which alliance officials hope will be done within a year . dw staff -lrb- jp -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

croatia and albania were formally invited to join , while macedonia was not . nato leaders were set on thursday , april 3 , to endorse a planned us missile shield for europe , a senior us official told reporters . the final summit statement would " recognize the substantive contribution to the protection of the allies " from the missile defense system to be deployed in the czech republic and poland , the official told reporters . " the united states and the czech republic are pleased to announce the completion of negotiations on a missile-defense agreement .
we plan to sign the agreement in the near future , " a statement said . french commitment the us official also said that president george w. bush had confirmed to the summit leaders that the us will be able to move some of its troops to afghanistan 's south once france sends a battalion of troops to the east of afghanistan , meeting canada 's conditions to keep troops in afghanistan until 2011 , the official said .
ottawa had said it would pull its 2,500 troops out next year if reinforcements were not forthcoming . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : sarkozy said france was willing to deploy additional troops to afghanistan french president nicolas sarkozy had said earlier france would send a battalion of troops to the east of afghanistan as part of efforts to bolster the 47,000-strong peacekeeping force . " i have decided to reinforce the french military presence with one battalion deployed in the east region , " president nicolas sarkozy said in a speech delivered at the summit , the afp news agency reported . the offer , which french military sources put at between 800 and 1,000 soldiers , came amid french plans for a return to nato 's military command next year after more than four decades of absence . " at the end of the french presidency of the european union , the moment will have come to conclude this process and to make the necessary decisions for france to take its full place in nato 's structures , " sarkozy said .
paris is set to take over the rotating eu presidency in july . staying in afghanistan as long as it takes it was good news for us president george w. bush , who on wednesday had urged nato allies to send more troops to afghanistan , stressing that the 26-nation trans-atlantic alliance could not afford to lose its battle against taliban insurgents and al qaeda militants .
as yet , only a few countries have answered his call . " whatever the cost , however difficult , we can not afford it , we must win , " he had said ahead of the summit . in paris , a sarkozy advisor said prior to the summit that the french president had set out conditions for the extra french troops in a letter to nato allies , including an increase in international aid to afghanistan . " he calls for a coordinated strategy whose goal will be a stable afghanistan , reconciled with itself and free of terrorism and drug trafficking , " the advisor said . according to reuters news agency , france is expected to seek us backing for its drive to bolster european union military structures during the second half of next year . reviewing membership for georgia and ukraine bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : canada is now to stay in afghanistan until 2011 but while the us welcomed the french offer of more troops , it met wednesday with strong opposition from paris and berlin over the question of the alliance 's eastwards enlargement - primarily out of fear of provoking moscow . bush had strongly urged skeptical european allies earlier to reward both countries for their democratic revolutions and not to allow russia , which is not a nato member , a veto over the alliance 's decisions . alliance leaders failed to agree to offer ukraine and georgia a membership action plan -lrb- map -rrb- , a gateway to eventual membership , but did confirm thursday that ukraine and georgia would one day become members of the north atlantic alliance , secretary-general jaap de hoop scheffer said . " we agree today that these countries will become member nations , " he said , adding that prospects for their membership plans would be reviewed in december . france and germany had led opposition to the move , saying it was premature when public support for nato was barely 30 percent in ukraine , and georgia did not control all its territory due to frozen conflicts with russian-backed separatists . " we have reached the conclusion that it is too early to give both countries membership action plan status , " german chancellor angela merkel had said on arrival at the summit . a senior georgian diplomat has told the bbc that the " no " to georgia will be widely seen as a victory for russia , which has long been expressing concerns over nato 's eastward expansion . croatia and albania sit at the table bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : merkel does not support nato 's eastwards push greece , meanwhile , dug its heels in over accession by macedonia , unless the country changed its name to recognize athens ' concerns regarding greece 's northern region with the same name - prompting fresh concerns about stability in the balkans .
officials said thursday that the alliance decided not to invite macedonia to join until the dispute is solved . according to a macedonian government spokesman , allied leaders meeting in bucharest had authorized their ambassadors to issue the invitation as soon as the name issue , which has festered for 17 years , is resolved . " we have agreed that an invitation to the former yugoslav republic of macedonia will be issued as soon as a mutually acceptable solution to the name issue has been reached , " nato 's secretary-general jaap de hoop scheffer told a news conference . two other balkan countries - croatia and albania - were , however , invited to join the defense alliance and sat at nato 's table for the first time thursday .
the two countries will become the 27th and 28th members of nato once the accession and ratification process has been finalized , which alliance officials hope will be done within a year . dw staff -lrb- jp -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

soon enough , another order 's been placed .
it can go downhill from here .
the recent case of a 71-year-old man who had a need to stockpile likely did n't involve tv shopping - this man 's primary passion was guns .
the estate lawyer sent out to look at the man 's apartment in the western city of aachen after his death found 71 rifles , revolvers , and pistols along with other weapons he had built himself .
" there were 71 guns - one for each year of his life , " said police spokesman paul kemen .
" he also had 41 cases of ammunition and five walking sticks fitted with retractable blades . "
the man did not have a permit to own weapons , and retractable blades are illegal in germany .
although guns were a special love , the collector did n't limit himself to just weapons .
according to neighbors , the man , who lived alone , collected everything from garden tools to watches .
" the house was stuffed to the rafters , " heiner hautermans , a reporter at the aachener nachrichten newspaper , told reuters .
" by the end , the neighbors said he had to sleep in a hotel sometimes because there was no more room . " dw staff -lrb- jam -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de music -pipe- 03.04.2008 critic explains allure of von karajan , 100 years and counting großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : great , but flawed : herbert von karajan -lrb- 1908-1989 -rrb- ahead of the 100th anniversary of the birth of famous orchestra director and conductor herbert von karajan on april 5 , dw-world.de talked about the maestro as a cultural icon with james oestreich of the new york times . in 1955 , von karajan - classical music 's most prolific recording artist - was named director of the berlin philharmonic orchestra , and was credited with creating its clean and distinctive sound during his 35-year tenure .
he was also chief conductor of the vienna symphony orchestra , and the guiding force behind the salzburg festival , where he conducted for 33 years .
karajan died july 16 , 1989 . dw-world.de spoke with james oestreich , music and dance editor at the new york times , about von karajan 's significance in music history . dw-world.de : these days you ca n't look anywhere in the german media without seeing a story or documentary or article about the life of herbert von karajan .
what 's all the fuss about ? james oestreich : he was probably the most recorded conductor of his time .
it was a time when long-playing records were really taking off , and then digital recording came in and the cd came in , and he was riding that technology through the whole thing . he recorded everything , all the time , and he re-recorded things .
he recorded the brahms symphonies three times , i believe , and the beethoven symphonies three times .
so he was simply everywhere . to boot , he was in many ways a fantastic conductor .
he had his shortcomings , as many people do .
but what he did well , he did extremely well .
and he had at that time one of the world 's greatest orchestras , if not the world 's greatest orchestra , performing for him . bildunterschrift : karajan conducts the berlin philharmonic in 1987 can you name a highlight ? his 1960s recordings of the beethoven symphonies were classic .
they were the way i , among many others , got to know the beethoven symphonies .
so they were kind of my standard , and many people 's standard for those works . what effect does a superstar conductor have on an orchestra ?
is it purely good news - more revenue and publicity - or can it also be damaging ? well it can be either .
in this case , he and the orchestra were so closely identified after so many years , and it was the coming together of two superstar names : karajan and the berlin philharmonic . ...
a music director is n't just a conductor .
he is someone who builds the orchestra in addition to conducting it .
in this case , karajan had built up this orchestra over a number of years , and made it into a sensational machine .
they played beautifully for him . to what do you attribute the ongoing interest in karajan ? well , there is the factor of permanence , for one thing .
it helps karajan and hurts people today .
it used to be that people 's vinyl lps would wear down and become unplayable .
now , digital recordings are permanent .
so there are these recordings that were the standard of their time , and they remain with us , and become standards of this time , too . it makes it difficult for people to come up with recording projects today , because all these standards are still readily available . in karajan 's case , there was also this international renown that he had .
when japan was warming to classical music - to put it mildly - 20 or 30 years ago , karajan was almost synonymous with classical music there .
so there is a built-in audience all around the world for his recordings . karajan had an international career , but was still very much a german and austrian conductor .
now an englishman , sir simon rattle , leads the berlin philharmonic . does nationality have a role in orchestras today ? it has become less relevant .
it used to be that orchestras from different countries had different sounds - the russians had very piercing brass instruments , the germans had tremendous warmth in their string sound .
as conductors travel around the world , and players go from orchestra to orchestra , and sometimes from country to country , those things have greatly diminished , in the last 30 or 40 years . that 's the way of the world .
but some of us yearn , to some extent , for the old days , when there were those characteristic sounds of orchestras .
when nobody could play german music like the germans and nobody could play french music like the french . one of the most frequently debated aspects of karajan 's life is the fact that he joined the nazi party in 1933 .
modern biographers have argued it was a political career move , rather than an ideological one .
still , he conducted for hitler and other top nazis , who revered him .
how important is this aspect of his biography ? bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : german composer and conductor richard strauss well , it is a very important aspect .
and he is far from alone in any of this .
-lsb- german conductor wilhelm -rsb- furtwaengler , of course , had many of the same problems ... and -lsb- german composer -rsb- richard strauss was the head of the nazi music chamber .
so karajan was far from alone . it 's a very unfortunate aspect of his biography , but it does n't mitigate his music making in any way , i do n't think .
there were a lot of bad things happening in those days , and he was part of it . if you read about karajan in the press , it is hard to find anyone neutral .
the musicians who played for him adored him , as did a large public .
yet many writers today criticize his sound as being too " cold " and technical , and take his perfectionism to task .
what 's your take ? well , i do n't find his music making cold .
it was certainly very lush , and that was problematic in some ways .
i remember a recording came out of bach and stravinsky , and for me the funny thing about that record is that karajan was out of his depth on both ends .
his big , lush bach sound is totally out of date today , now that the early music movement has brought back the smallness of sound from the baroque era .
and in the case of stravinsky - a very angular , modern sound - again , karajan 's sound is very lush and rich .
it missed the angles and it missed a lot of the music as a result . so , it was a style that did n't suit all types of music , but the music it suited , it suited very well .
there is a recording late in his life of mahler 's 9th symphony that is the opposite of cold .
its one of the great recordings ever made .
so i 'm not sure what people have in mind when they use a blanket term like cold to describe his music making . karajan was also known for leading an extravagant lifestyle , flying jets and driving race cars .
he was also criticized by some for ostensibly forcing concert ticket prices so high that only the wealthy could attend .
how did this affect the public 's view of him ? bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : karajan steps off the jet with his wife , eliette -lrb- left -rrb- and daughter isabella well , i do n't think karajan set concert prices .
karajan certainly made a lot of money and demanded a lot of money , but he was n't alone in that .
concerts were very expensive , especially at salzburg .
but it is far from just karajan .
yo yo ma , itzhak perlman - all sorts of people were demanding huge amounts of money .
and that 's what sent ticket prices soaring . so did his luxury lifestyle image act in his favor , or against him ? i think it humanized him .
toscanini was put on a pedestal by music lovers for a long time .
in this case it brought karajan in to a real world that people could identify with , or wished they had ...
i 'm sure the image was certainly part of the package . how do you suppose karajan will be remembered ? i think there are a lot of generalizations going around this year , and i think generalizations are always risky .
i do n't want to see him swamped , and go down in history with words like " cold " attached and " luxury " attached .
he was many things .
he was a very complex figure , and he was a great musician . interview : jennifer abramsohn send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

he was also chief conductor of the vienna symphony orchestra , and the guiding force behind the salzburg festival , where he conducted for 33 years .
karajan died july 16 , 1989 . dw-world.de spoke with james oestreich , music and dance editor at the new york times , about von karajan 's significance in music history . dw-world.de : these days you ca n't look anywhere in the german media without seeing a story or documentary or article about the life of herbert von karajan .
what 's all the fuss about ? james oestreich : he was probably the most recorded conductor of his time .
it was a time when long-playing records were really taking off , and then digital recording came in and the cd came in , and he was riding that technology through the whole thing . he recorded everything , all the time , and he re-recorded things .
he recorded the brahms symphonies three times , i believe , and the beethoven symphonies three times .
so he was simply everywhere . to boot , he was in many ways a fantastic conductor .
he had his shortcomings , as many people do .
but what he did well , he did extremely well .
and he had at that time one of the world 's greatest orchestras , if not the world 's greatest orchestra , performing for him . bildunterschrift : karajan conducts the berlin philharmonic in 1987 can you name a highlight ? his 1960s recordings of the beethoven symphonies were classic .
they were the way i , among many others , got to know the beethoven symphonies .
so they were kind of my standard , and many people 's standard for those works . what effect does a superstar conductor have on an orchestra ?
is it purely good news - more revenue and publicity - or can it also be damaging ? well it can be either .
in this case , he and the orchestra were so closely identified after so many years , and it was the coming together of two superstar names : karajan and the berlin philharmonic . ...
a music director is n't just a conductor .
he is someone who builds the orchestra in addition to conducting it .
in this case , karajan had built up this orchestra over a number of years , and made it into a sensational machine .
they played beautifully for him . to what do you attribute the ongoing interest in karajan ? well , there is the factor of permanence , for one thing .
it helps karajan and hurts people today .
it used to be that people 's vinyl lps would wear down and become unplayable .
now , digital recordings are permanent .
so there are these recordings that were the standard of their time , and they remain with us , and become standards of this time , too . it makes it difficult for people to come up with recording projects today , because all these standards are still readily available . in karajan 's case , there was also this international renown that he had .
when japan was warming to classical music - to put it mildly - 20 or 30 years ago , karajan was almost synonymous with classical music there .
so there is a built-in audience all around the world for his recordings . karajan had an international career , but was still very much a german and austrian conductor .
now an englishman , sir simon rattle , leads the berlin philharmonic . does nationality have a role in orchestras today ? it has become less relevant .
it used to be that orchestras from different countries had different sounds - the russians had very piercing brass instruments , the germans had tremendous warmth in their string sound .
as conductors travel around the world , and players go from orchestra to orchestra , and sometimes from country to country , those things have greatly diminished , in the last 30 or 40 years . that 's the way of the world .
but some of us yearn , to some extent , for the old days , when there were those characteristic sounds of orchestras .
when nobody could play german music like the germans and nobody could play french music like the french . one of the most frequently debated aspects of karajan 's life is the fact that he joined the nazi party in 1933 .
modern biographers have argued it was a political career move , rather than an ideological one .
still , he conducted for hitler and other top nazis , who revered him .
how important is this aspect of his biography ? bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : german composer and conductor richard strauss well , it is a very important aspect .
and he is far from alone in any of this .
-lsb- german conductor wilhelm -rsb- furtwaengler , of course , had many of the same problems ... and -lsb- german composer -rsb- richard strauss was the head of the nazi music chamber .
so karajan was far from alone . it 's a very unfortunate aspect of his biography , but it does n't mitigate his music making in any way , i do n't think .
there were a lot of bad things happening in those days , and he was part of it . if you read about karajan in the press , it is hard to find anyone neutral .
the musicians who played for him adored him , as did a large public .
yet many writers today criticize his sound as being too " cold " and technical , and take his perfectionism to task .
what 's your take ? well , i do n't find his music making cold .

the carmaker called the program disproportionate , illegal and unfair . the german luxury sports car maker lodged papers at the royal courts of justice on wednesday , april 2 , in a bid to stop london mayor ken livingstone 's proposed charge . under the mayor 's plan , from october , people with cars that emit more than 225 grams of carbon dioxide per kilometer - such as sports utility vehicles and high-powered performance cars - will pay a daily charge of 25 pounds -lrb- $ 49.70 , 31.75 euros -rrb- to drive into central london . " not only is this new tax on motorists unfair , it is also a disproportionate and illegal use of power by the mayor , " said andy goss , managing director of porsche cars gb , after the judicial review papers were filed . " the porsche case is about protecting london and londoners from a new tax that will not only fail to reduce carbon dioxide emissions in central london , but also increase congestion and damage air quality . " a judge will now have to decide within the next few days whether to proceed with the case . not backing down livingstone appeared to be unswayed by porsche 's criticism and vowed to fight the legal action . " porsche 's self-serving legal action shows their continuing contempt for the views of londoners , " he said .
" porsche should be using its engineering expertise to create low-polluting cars , not its lawyers to oppose the democratic wishes of londoners . according to a recent poll , 61 percent of londoners approve of increasing the congestion tax for gas-guzzling vehicles . he added : " londoners , not car manufacturers , should be the ones to decide how to tackle pollution in their city .
i will vigorously contest porsche 's legal action . " elections might change things however , the pollution charge may never be imposed . londoners vote in mayoral elections on may 1 and opinion polls have put livingstone 's main rival boris johnson in the lead .
the conservative candidate has vowed to ditch livingstone 's plan . it is the latest program targeting london 's traffic pollution and congestion problems . for five years , london has been assessing drivers a daily congestion charge , now set at eight pounds , to drive into the central city and a large swath around it .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de nato -pipe- 03.04.2008 nato vows to bolster troops in afghanistan großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : afghan president karzai , with un chief ban ki-moon at the nato summit nato allies meeting in romania at a major alliance summit reconfirmed their " long-term commitment " to afghanistan and pledged to substantially beef up troop numbers in the country . nato leaders reaffirmed their long-term commitment to afghanistan on thursday with a document designed to bridge strategic divisions over the nature of the international security assistance force -lrb- isaf -rrb- mission . the four-page " strategic vision " called on nato members to maintain a " shared long-term commitment " to isaf in its aim to help the people of afghanistan " build an enduring , stable , secure , prosperous and democratic state " that is free of violence and terrorism . " today more nations stepped forward with offers that will raise that total again , and very substantially , " nato secretary general jaap de hoop scheffer said at a news conference with afghan president hamid karzai and un secretary-general ban ki-moon . scheffer did not say how many troops were offered and referred specifically only to an offer by france to send an additional battalion , about 800 troops .
but he said it satisfied a canadian demand for reinforcements in its sector in southern afghanistan . the nato-led force in afghanistan currently numbers around 47,000 soliders . aiming for self-sufficiency the document , endorsed by the 26 nato members and by the 14 non-nato countries which contribute forces to the un-mandated operation , was welcomed by karzai . " i am thankful for the strategic vision that you have offered on behalf of isaf ...
afghanistan is now better placed to take responsibility for its own security , " said karzai . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : there are currently 47,000 nato-led troops in afghanistan isaf forces have been fighting the taliban but have also been training the afghan military to do the same .
the document underlines the importance in making afghan security forces self-sufficient and taking the lead in counter-insurgency operations .
it also highlights helping the afghan government to extend good governance , reconstruction and development throughout the country . on thursday , karzai announced that as from august , afghan forces would finally be able to take over security operations in the capital kabul . france steps up earlier thursday , french president nicolas sarkozy confirmed that his country would be sending an additional 700 soldiers to the east , thus helping alleviate us and canadian concerns that isaf is overstretched . the offer came amid french plans for a return to nato 's military command next year after more than four decades of absence . isaf has grown by some 4,000 soldiers to about 47,000 in recent months , and more troops are ready to step in from poland , the czech republic and other allies . with their strategic vision document , the allies vowed to support the afghan leadership , bring together civilian and military efforts , and increase cooperation with afghanistan 's neighbors , " especially pakistan . " it also urged nato members to provide " maximum possible flexibility " in the use of their troops and to fill the current shortfalls in manning levels - two issues which have sparked bitter disagreements in the past . a deep rift had emerged within nato over the past months , with some countries , spearheaded by the united states , insisting on the need to fight the insurgents and others , like germany and italy , placing the emphasis on the civilian nature of the isaf mission . two in , three out in a major rebuff to us president george w bush who is attending the last summit of the transatlantic alliance as us president , european leaders kept georgia and ukraine waiting at nato 's doorstep thursday .
they did , however , welcome albania and croatia . bush , eager to burnish his foreign policy legacy in the waning months of a presidency tarnished by iraq , had pushed hard for georgia and ukraine to be allowed into the nato club .
scheffer said nato would offer georgia and ukraine " intensive engagement " , along with a vague promise of membership sometime down the line .
" we agree today that these countries will become members of nato , " he told reporters .
" that is quite something . "
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : german chancellor merkel and french president sarkozy opposed membership bids by ukraine and georgia the membership bids of ukraine and georgia , two former soviet republics , are strongly opposed by russia .
both germany and france , wary of alienating moscow , also resisted opening the door to georgia and ukraine . meanwhile , strong protests erupted in skopje after macedonia 's bid for an invitation was effectively vetoed by greece in a long-running dispute over macedonia 's official name . athens maintains that allowing its northern neighbor to call itself " macedonia " would imply a territorial claim on the greek province of the same name , and insists that it will not approve macedonia 's nato membership until the issue is resolved . macedonian delegates walked out of the summit in response , with foreign minister antonio milososki accusing greece of using an " irrelevant argument of ancient times . " russia urged to link missile defences with us on the thorny issue of a us missile defense shield in europe , nato leaders also asked experts to draw up options for a missile system that would complement the us anti-missile shield and provide cover to some allies left out in the cold , a statement said .
they also urged russia to consider linking up its missile defences to the us shield - despite moscow 's hostility towards it .
washington said last year it wanted to install 10 missile interceptors in poland and a radar base in the czech republic to cover us territory and that of some european allies , and wanted it operational by 2013 .
the shield is aimed at countering attacks from " rogue states " such as iran but russia fears it could pose a direct challenge to its security . dw staff -lrb- sp -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?
dw-world.de rows still simmering on day two of nato summit discussions at the nato summit focused on the alliance 's mission in afghanistan and a planned new missile shield for europe .

" today more nations stepped forward with offers that will raise that total again , and very substantially , " nato secretary general jaap de hoop scheffer said at a news conference with afghan president hamid karzai and un secretary-general ban ki-moon . scheffer did not say how many troops were offered and referred specifically only to an offer by france to send an additional battalion , about 800 troops .
but he said it satisfied a canadian demand for reinforcements in its sector in southern afghanistan . the nato-led force in afghanistan currently numbers around 47,000 soliders . aiming for self-sufficiency the document , endorsed by the 26 nato members and by the 14 non-nato countries which contribute forces to the un-mandated operation , was welcomed by karzai . " i am thankful for the strategic vision that you have offered on behalf of isaf ...
afghanistan is now better placed to take responsibility for its own security , " said karzai . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : there are currently 47,000 nato-led troops in afghanistan isaf forces have been fighting the taliban but have also been training the afghan military to do the same .
the document underlines the importance in making afghan security forces self-sufficient and taking the lead in counter-insurgency operations .
it also highlights helping the afghan government to extend good governance , reconstruction and development throughout the country . on thursday , karzai announced that as from august , afghan forces would finally be able to take over security operations in the capital kabul . france steps up earlier thursday , french president nicolas sarkozy confirmed that his country would be sending an additional 700 soldiers to the east , thus helping alleviate us and canadian concerns that isaf is overstretched . the offer came amid french plans for a return to nato 's military command next year after more than four decades of absence . isaf has grown by some 4,000 soldiers to about 47,000 in recent months , and more troops are ready to step in from poland , the czech republic and other allies . with their strategic vision document , the allies vowed to support the afghan leadership , bring together civilian and military efforts , and increase cooperation with afghanistan 's neighbors , " especially pakistan . " it also urged nato members to provide " maximum possible flexibility " in the use of their troops and to fill the current shortfalls in manning levels - two issues which have sparked bitter disagreements in the past . a deep rift had emerged within nato over the past months , with some countries , spearheaded by the united states , insisting on the need to fight the insurgents and others , like germany and italy , placing the emphasis on the civilian nature of the isaf mission . two in , three out in a major rebuff to us president george w bush who is attending the last summit of the transatlantic alliance as us president , european leaders kept georgia and ukraine waiting at nato 's doorstep thursday .
they did , however , welcome albania and croatia . bush , eager to burnish his foreign policy legacy in the waning months of a presidency tarnished by iraq , had pushed hard for georgia and ukraine to be allowed into the nato club .
scheffer said nato would offer georgia and ukraine " intensive engagement " , along with a vague promise of membership sometime down the line .
" we agree today that these countries will become members of nato , " he told reporters .
" that is quite something . "

both germany and france , wary of alienating moscow , also resisted opening the door to georgia and ukraine . meanwhile , strong protests erupted in skopje after macedonia 's bid for an invitation was effectively vetoed by greece in a long-running dispute over macedonia 's official name . athens maintains that allowing its northern neighbor to call itself " macedonia " would imply a territorial claim on the greek province of the same name , and insists that it will not approve macedonia 's nato membership until the issue is resolved . macedonian delegates walked out of the summit in response , with foreign minister antonio milososki accusing greece of using an " irrelevant argument of ancient times . " russia urged to link missile defences with us on the thorny issue of a us missile defense shield in europe , nato leaders also asked experts to draw up options for a missile system that would complement the us anti-missile shield and provide cover to some allies left out in the cold , a statement said .
they also urged russia to consider linking up its missile defences to the us shield - despite moscow 's hostility towards it .
washington said last year it wanted to install 10 missile interceptors in poland and a radar base in the czech republic to cover us territory and that of some european allies , and wanted it operational by 2013 .

croatia and albania were formally invited to join , while macedonia was not . nato leaders were set on thursday , april 3 , to endorse a planned us missile shield for europe , a senior us official told reporters . the final summit statement would " recognize the substantive contribution to the protection of the allies " from the missile defense system to be deployed in the czech republic and poland , the official told reporters . " the united states and the czech republic are pleased to announce the completion of negotiations on a missile-defense agreement .
we plan to sign the agreement in the near future , " a statement said . french commitment the us official also said that president george w. bush had confirmed to the summit leaders that the us will be able to move some of its troops to afghanistan 's south once france sends a battalion of troops to the east of afghanistan , meeting canada 's conditions to keep troops in afghanistan until 2011 , the official said .
ottawa had said it would pull its 2,500 troops out next year if reinforcements were not forthcoming . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : sarkozy said france was willing to deploy additional troops to afghanistan french president nicolas sarkozy had said earlier france would send a battalion of troops to the east of afghanistan as part of efforts to bolster the 47,000-strong peacekeeping force . " i have decided to reinforce the french military presence with one battalion deployed in the east region , " president nicolas sarkozy said in a speech delivered at the summit , the afp news agency reported . the offer , which french military sources put at between 800 and 1,000 soldiers , came amid french plans for a return to nato 's military command next year after more than four decades of absence . " at the end of the french presidency of the european union , the moment will have come to conclude this process and to make the necessary decisions for france to take its full place in nato 's structures , " sarkozy said .
paris is set to take over the rotating eu presidency in july . staying in afghanistan as long as it takes it was good news for us president george w. bush , who on wednesday had urged nato allies to send more troops to afghanistan , stressing that the 26-nation trans-atlantic alliance could not afford to lose its battle against taliban insurgents and al qaeda militants .
as yet , only a few countries have answered his call . " whatever the cost , however difficult , we can not afford it , we must win , " he had said ahead of the summit . in paris , a sarkozy advisor said prior to the summit that the french president had set out conditions for the extra french troops in a letter to nato allies , including an increase in international aid to afghanistan . " he calls for a coordinated strategy whose goal will be a stable afghanistan , reconciled with itself and free of terrorism and drug trafficking , " the advisor said . according to reuters news agency , france is expected to seek us backing for its drive to bolster european union military structures during the second half of next year . reviewing membership for georgia and ukraine bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : canada is now to stay in afghanistan until 2011 but while the us welcomed the french offer of more troops , it met wednesday with strong opposition from paris and berlin over the question of the alliance 's eastwards enlargement - primarily out of fear of provoking moscow . bush had strongly urged skeptical european allies earlier to reward both countries for their democratic revolutions and not to allow russia , which is not a nato member , a veto over the alliance 's decisions . alliance leaders failed to agree to offer ukraine and georgia a membership action plan -lrb- map -rrb- , a gateway to eventual membership , but did confirm thursday that ukraine and georgia would one day become members of the north atlantic alliance , secretary-general jaap de hoop scheffer said . " we agree today that these countries will become member nations , " he said , adding that prospects for their membership plans would be reviewed in december . france and germany had led opposition to the move , saying it was premature when public support for nato was barely 30 percent in ukraine , and georgia did not control all its territory due to frozen conflicts with russian-backed separatists . " we have reached the conclusion that it is too early to give both countries membership action plan status , " german chancellor angela merkel had said on arrival at the summit . a senior georgian diplomat has told the bbc that the " no " to georgia will be widely seen as a victory for russia , which has long been expressing concerns over nato 's eastward expansion . croatia and albania sit at the table bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : merkel does not support nato 's eastwards push greece , meanwhile , dug its heels in over accession by macedonia , unless the country changed its name to recognize athens ' concerns regarding greece 's northern region with the same name - prompting fresh concerns about stability in the balkans .
officials said thursday that the alliance decided not to invite macedonia to join until the dispute is solved . according to a macedonian government spokesman , allied leaders meeting in bucharest had authorized their ambassadors to issue the invitation as soon as the name issue , which has festered for 17 years , is resolved . " we have agreed that an invitation to the former yugoslav republic of macedonia will be issued as soon as a mutually acceptable solution to the name issue has been reached , " nato 's secretary-general jaap de hoop scheffer told a news conference . two other balkan countries - croatia and albania - were , however , invited to join the defense alliance and sat at nato 's table for the first time thursday .
the two countries will become the 27th and 28th members of nato once the accession and ratification process has been finalized , which alliance officials hope will be done within a year . dw staff -lrb- jp -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de music -pipe- 03.04.2008 critic explains allure of von karajan , 100 years and counting großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : great , but flawed : herbert von karajan -lrb- 1908-1989 -rrb- ahead of the 100th anniversary of the birth of famous orchestra director and conductor herbert von karajan on april 5 , dw-world.de talked about the maestro as a cultural icon with james oestreich of the new york times . in 1955 , von karajan - classical music 's most prolific recording artist - was named director of the berlin philharmonic orchestra , and was credited with creating its clean and distinctive sound during his 35-year tenure .
he was also chief conductor of the vienna symphony orchestra , and the guiding force behind the salzburg festival , where he conducted for 33 years .
karajan died july 16 , 1989 . dw-world.de spoke with james oestreich , music and dance editor at the new york times , about von karajan 's significance in music history . dw-world.de : these days you ca n't look anywhere in the german media without seeing a story or documentary or article about the life of herbert von karajan .
what 's all the fuss about ? james oestreich : he was probably the most recorded conductor of his time .
it was a time when long-playing records were really taking off , and then digital recording came in and the cd came in , and he was riding that technology through the whole thing . he recorded everything , all the time , and he re-recorded things .
he recorded the brahms symphonies three times , i believe , and the beethoven symphonies three times .
so he was simply everywhere . to boot , he was in many ways a fantastic conductor .
he had his shortcomings , as many people do .
but what he did well , he did extremely well .
and he had at that time one of the world 's greatest orchestras , if not the world 's greatest orchestra , performing for him . bildunterschrift : karajan conducts the berlin philharmonic in 1987 can you name a highlight ? his 1960s recordings of the beethoven symphonies were classic .
they were the way i , among many others , got to know the beethoven symphonies .
so they were kind of my standard , and many people 's standard for those works . what effect does a superstar conductor have on an orchestra ?
is it purely good news - more revenue and publicity - or can it also be damaging ? well it can be either .
in this case , he and the orchestra were so closely identified after so many years , and it was the coming together of two superstar names : karajan and the berlin philharmonic . ...
a music director is n't just a conductor .
he is someone who builds the orchestra in addition to conducting it .
in this case , karajan had built up this orchestra over a number of years , and made it into a sensational machine .
they played beautifully for him . to what do you attribute the ongoing interest in karajan ? well , there is the factor of permanence , for one thing .
it helps karajan and hurts people today .
it used to be that people 's vinyl lps would wear down and become unplayable .
now , digital recordings are permanent .
so there are these recordings that were the standard of their time , and they remain with us , and become standards of this time , too . it makes it difficult for people to come up with recording projects today , because all these standards are still readily available . in karajan 's case , there was also this international renown that he had .
when japan was warming to classical music - to put it mildly - 20 or 30 years ago , karajan was almost synonymous with classical music there .
so there is a built-in audience all around the world for his recordings . karajan had an international career , but was still very much a german and austrian conductor .
now an englishman , sir simon rattle , leads the berlin philharmonic . does nationality have a role in orchestras today ? it has become less relevant .
it used to be that orchestras from different countries had different sounds - the russians had very piercing brass instruments , the germans had tremendous warmth in their string sound .
as conductors travel around the world , and players go from orchestra to orchestra , and sometimes from country to country , those things have greatly diminished , in the last 30 or 40 years . that 's the way of the world .
but some of us yearn , to some extent , for the old days , when there were those characteristic sounds of orchestras .
when nobody could play german music like the germans and nobody could play french music like the french . one of the most frequently debated aspects of karajan 's life is the fact that he joined the nazi party in 1933 .
modern biographers have argued it was a political career move , rather than an ideological one .
still , he conducted for hitler and other top nazis , who revered him .
how important is this aspect of his biography ? bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : german composer and conductor richard strauss well , it is a very important aspect .
and he is far from alone in any of this .
-lsb- german conductor wilhelm -rsb- furtwaengler , of course , had many of the same problems ... and -lsb- german composer -rsb- richard strauss was the head of the nazi music chamber .
so karajan was far from alone . it 's a very unfortunate aspect of his biography , but it does n't mitigate his music making in any way , i do n't think .
there were a lot of bad things happening in those days , and he was part of it . if you read about karajan in the press , it is hard to find anyone neutral .
the musicians who played for him adored him , as did a large public .
yet many writers today criticize his sound as being too " cold " and technical , and take his perfectionism to task .
what 's your take ? well , i do n't find his music making cold .
it was certainly very lush , and that was problematic in some ways .
i remember a recording came out of bach and stravinsky , and for me the funny thing about that record is that karajan was out of his depth on both ends .
his big , lush bach sound is totally out of date today , now that the early music movement has brought back the smallness of sound from the baroque era .
and in the case of stravinsky - a very angular , modern sound - again , karajan 's sound is very lush and rich .
it missed the angles and it missed a lot of the music as a result . so , it was a style that did n't suit all types of music , but the music it suited , it suited very well .
there is a recording late in his life of mahler 's 9th symphony that is the opposite of cold .
its one of the great recordings ever made .
so i 'm not sure what people have in mind when they use a blanket term like cold to describe his music making . karajan was also known for leading an extravagant lifestyle , flying jets and driving race cars .
he was also criticized by some for ostensibly forcing concert ticket prices so high that only the wealthy could attend .
how did this affect the public 's view of him ? bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : karajan steps off the jet with his wife , eliette -lrb- left -rrb- and daughter isabella well , i do n't think karajan set concert prices .
karajan certainly made a lot of money and demanded a lot of money , but he was n't alone in that .
concerts were very expensive , especially at salzburg .
but it is far from just karajan .
yo yo ma , itzhak perlman - all sorts of people were demanding huge amounts of money .
and that 's what sent ticket prices soaring . so did his luxury lifestyle image act in his favor , or against him ? i think it humanized him .
toscanini was put on a pedestal by music lovers for a long time .
in this case it brought karajan in to a real world that people could identify with , or wished they had ...
i 'm sure the image was certainly part of the package . how do you suppose karajan will be remembered ? i think there are a lot of generalizations going around this year , and i think generalizations are always risky .
i do n't want to see him swamped , and go down in history with words like " cold " attached and " luxury " attached .
he was many things .

the carmaker called the program disproportionate , illegal and unfair . the german luxury sports car maker lodged papers at the royal courts of justice on wednesday , april 2 , in a bid to stop london mayor ken livingstone 's proposed charge . under the mayor 's plan , from october , people with cars that emit more than 225 grams of carbon dioxide per kilometer - such as sports utility vehicles and high-powered performance cars - will pay a daily charge of 25 pounds -lrb- $ 49.70 , 31.75 euros -rrb- to drive into central london . " not only is this new tax on motorists unfair , it is also a disproportionate and illegal use of power by the mayor , " said andy goss , managing director of porsche cars gb , after the judicial review papers were filed . " the porsche case is about protecting london and londoners from a new tax that will not only fail to reduce carbon dioxide emissions in central london , but also increase congestion and damage air quality . " a judge will now have to decide within the next few days whether to proceed with the case . not backing down livingstone appeared to be unswayed by porsche 's criticism and vowed to fight the legal action . " porsche 's self-serving legal action shows their continuing contempt for the views of londoners , " he said .
" porsche should be using its engineering expertise to create low-polluting cars , not its lawyers to oppose the democratic wishes of londoners . according to a recent poll , 61 percent of londoners approve of increasing the congestion tax for gas-guzzling vehicles . he added : " londoners , not car manufacturers , should be the ones to decide how to tackle pollution in their city .
i will vigorously contest porsche 's legal action . " elections might change things however , the pollution charge may never be imposed . londoners vote in mayoral elections on may 1 and opinion polls have put livingstone 's main rival boris johnson in the lead .
the conservative candidate has vowed to ditch livingstone 's plan . it is the latest program targeting london 's traffic pollution and congestion problems . for five years , london has been assessing drivers a daily congestion charge , now set at eight pounds , to drive into the central city and a large swath around it .
the fee was designed to tackle the bottlenecks that have turned much of london into a parking lot . the uk capital is the biggest urban area in the world to charge such a toll and city officials from around the globe have considered copying the idea . dw staff -lrb- jam -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

merkel calls on brazil to make biofuel production sustainable as biofuels fall from grace , a new generation grabs spotlight germany defends biofuels , hedges bets on energy goals german minister calls for reversal of eu agricultural policy environment -pipe- 03.04.2008 german cars ca n't handle biofuels , environment plan at risk großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : experts said too many cars in germany would n't be able to handle biofuel blends the german government 's plan to introduce a new biofuel blend may now be postponed .
far too many cars are not able to process the fuel , industry sources said , putting a dent in the environment plan . auto industry sources said on that more than 2 million cars in germany would not be able to handle biofuels , thereby exceeding a 1-million limit the german government had set as a pre-condition for use . the sources said that some 330,000 cars made by german manufacturers , as well as more than 2 million imported cars , could not run on the new fuel and that the cars ' owners would be forced to fill up with higher octane , more expensive types of gas . the controversial plan to include a 10-percent biofuel blend plans could be slowed if it seemed likely that vehicle engines would be damaged by the mixture , a spokesperson for the german environment ministry said on wednesday , april 2 . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : biofuel blends are part of a larger german environment plan that includes reducing emissions environment minister sigmar gabriel had earlier said he would annul a government decree for the fuel , called e-10 , be introduced if too many cars were unable to run on it . " we wo n't put this regulation into effect if more than 1 million vehicles are affected , " gabriel told the stuttgarter nachrichten newspaper . part of a larger emissions reduction plan the german law would require regular gasoline to be mixed with 10 percent plant-based ethanol , called " e-10 , " and diesel to be mixed with 7 percent fuel made of plant origin by next year .
by 2020 , the ratio is supposed to rise to 17 percent . it is part of a larger plan to curb emissions , with eu states agreeing last year to reduce emissions by at least one-fifth by 2020 from 1990 levels , to use 20 percent of renewable energy sources in power production and 10 percent of biofuels from crops for transportation , also by 2020 . a change in the biofuel plan would demand possibly altering the overall targets . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : rapeseed can also be used as a biofuel adac , germany 's central motoring club , said that biofuels would damage the hoses and gaskets in 3 million cars on german roads , forcing those car owners to buy a more expensive , non-plant super grade of gas instead .
adac called for the introduction of e-10 to be delayed until 2012 . gabriel has said he will await figures from the auto industry on the number of cars actually unable to use the fuel before making a final decision on whether or not to introduce the plan . environmentalists critical of biofuel farming environmentalist organizations are critical of the plan themselves , albeit for a different reason .
greenpeace said on wednesday that the german plan to blend diesel with biodiesel to combat climate change is detrimental . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : diesel , unleaded , super , and biofuel blends are showing up at the pumps the group said it had tested fossil diesel sold at over 40 filling stations across germany to determine which vegetable oils were used in compulsory biodiesel blends .
it found that around 20 percent was soy oil rather than rapeseed oil from the german harvest . greenpeace said in a statement that germany 's blending policy would not help to fight global warming since soy oil imports largely came from south america , where tropical rain forests were being slashed to cultivate soybeans . " huge areas of tropical rain forests are being destroyed for the new plantations , for example in argentina , " the organization said . but , germany 's biofuels industry association told reuters news service that greenpeace 's charges were unjustified , and that soy oil comes from north america , argentina and brazil . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : straw turned into biofuel ?
you bet !
" soy oil from the us and argentina does not have rain forest issues , " vdb chief executive petra sprick said . "
imports from brazil are largely handled by major trading houses such as adm , bunge and cargill , which have voluntary agreements only to purchase soy oil from sustainable agriculture and not from areas using cleared tropical rain forests . " germany made the blending of biodiesel with fossil diesel at oil refineries compulsory in january 2007 as part of its policies to combat global warming .
fossil diesel must contain 4.4 percent biodiesel . biofuel farming is also driving up world food prices , such as for corn and grains - which are used to make ethanol . dw staff -lrb- als -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

he was also chief conductor of the vienna symphony orchestra , and the guiding force behind the salzburg festival , where he conducted for 33 years .
karajan died july 16 , 1989 . dw-world.de spoke with james oestreich , music and dance editor at the new york times , about von karajan 's significance in music history . dw-world.de : these days you ca n't look anywhere in the german media without seeing a story or documentary or article about the life of herbert von karajan .
what 's all the fuss about ? james oestreich : he was probably the most recorded conductor of his time .
it was a time when long-playing records were really taking off , and then digital recording came in and the cd came in , and he was riding that technology through the whole thing . he recorded everything , all the time , and he re-recorded things .
he recorded the brahms symphonies three times , i believe , and the beethoven symphonies three times .
so he was simply everywhere . to boot , he was in many ways a fantastic conductor .
he had his shortcomings , as many people do .
but what he did well , he did extremely well .
and he had at that time one of the world 's greatest orchestras , if not the world 's greatest orchestra , performing for him . bildunterschrift : karajan conducts the berlin philharmonic in 1987 can you name a highlight ? his 1960s recordings of the beethoven symphonies were classic .
they were the way i , among many others , got to know the beethoven symphonies .
so they were kind of my standard , and many people 's standard for those works . what effect does a superstar conductor have on an orchestra ?
is it purely good news - more revenue and publicity - or can it also be damaging ? well it can be either .
in this case , he and the orchestra were so closely identified after so many years , and it was the coming together of two superstar names : karajan and the berlin philharmonic . ...
a music director is n't just a conductor .
he is someone who builds the orchestra in addition to conducting it .
in this case , karajan had built up this orchestra over a number of years , and made it into a sensational machine .
they played beautifully for him . to what do you attribute the ongoing interest in karajan ? well , there is the factor of permanence , for one thing .
it helps karajan and hurts people today .
it used to be that people 's vinyl lps would wear down and become unplayable .
now , digital recordings are permanent .
so there are these recordings that were the standard of their time , and they remain with us , and become standards of this time , too . it makes it difficult for people to come up with recording projects today , because all these standards are still readily available . in karajan 's case , there was also this international renown that he had .
when japan was warming to classical music - to put it mildly - 20 or 30 years ago , karajan was almost synonymous with classical music there .
so there is a built-in audience all around the world for his recordings . karajan had an international career , but was still very much a german and austrian conductor .
now an englishman , sir simon rattle , leads the berlin philharmonic . does nationality have a role in orchestras today ? it has become less relevant .
it used to be that orchestras from different countries had different sounds - the russians had very piercing brass instruments , the germans had tremendous warmth in their string sound .
as conductors travel around the world , and players go from orchestra to orchestra , and sometimes from country to country , those things have greatly diminished , in the last 30 or 40 years . that 's the way of the world .
but some of us yearn , to some extent , for the old days , when there were those characteristic sounds of orchestras .
when nobody could play german music like the germans and nobody could play french music like the french . one of the most frequently debated aspects of karajan 's life is the fact that he joined the nazi party in 1933 .
modern biographers have argued it was a political career move , rather than an ideological one .
still , he conducted for hitler and other top nazis , who revered him .
how important is this aspect of his biography ? bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : german composer and conductor richard strauss well , it is a very important aspect .
and he is far from alone in any of this .
-lsb- german conductor wilhelm -rsb- furtwaengler , of course , had many of the same problems ... and -lsb- german composer -rsb- richard strauss was the head of the nazi music chamber .
so karajan was far from alone . it 's a very unfortunate aspect of his biography , but it does n't mitigate his music making in any way , i do n't think .
there were a lot of bad things happening in those days , and he was part of it . if you read about karajan in the press , it is hard to find anyone neutral .
the musicians who played for him adored him , as did a large public .
yet many writers today criticize his sound as being too " cold " and technical , and take his perfectionism to task .
what 's your take ? well , i do n't find his music making cold .
it was certainly very lush , and that was problematic in some ways .
i remember a recording came out of bach and stravinsky , and for me the funny thing about that record is that karajan was out of his depth on both ends .
his big , lush bach sound is totally out of date today , now that the early music movement has brought back the smallness of sound from the baroque era .
and in the case of stravinsky - a very angular , modern sound - again , karajan 's sound is very lush and rich .
it missed the angles and it missed a lot of the music as a result . so , it was a style that did n't suit all types of music , but the music it suited , it suited very well .
there is a recording late in his life of mahler 's 9th symphony that is the opposite of cold .
its one of the great recordings ever made .
so i 'm not sure what people have in mind when they use a blanket term like cold to describe his music making . karajan was also known for leading an extravagant lifestyle , flying jets and driving race cars .
he was also criticized by some for ostensibly forcing concert ticket prices so high that only the wealthy could attend .
how did this affect the public 's view of him ? bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : karajan steps off the jet with his wife , eliette -lrb- left -rrb- and daughter isabella well , i do n't think karajan set concert prices .
karajan certainly made a lot of money and demanded a lot of money , but he was n't alone in that .
concerts were very expensive , especially at salzburg .
but it is far from just karajan .
yo yo ma , itzhak perlman - all sorts of people were demanding huge amounts of money .
and that 's what sent ticket prices soaring . so did his luxury lifestyle image act in his favor , or against him ? i think it humanized him .
toscanini was put on a pedestal by music lovers for a long time .
in this case it brought karajan in to a real world that people could identify with , or wished they had ...
i 'm sure the image was certainly part of the package . how do you suppose karajan will be remembered ? i think there are a lot of generalizations going around this year , and i think generalizations are always risky .
i do n't want to see him swamped , and go down in history with words like " cold " attached and " luxury " attached .
he was many things .
he was a very complex figure , and he was a great musician . interview : jennifer abramsohn send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

so there are these recordings that were the standard of their time , and they remain with us , and become standards of this time , too . it makes it difficult for people to come up with recording projects today , because all these standards are still readily available . in karajan 's case , there was also this international renown that he had .
when japan was warming to classical music - to put it mildly - 20 or 30 years ago , karajan was almost synonymous with classical music there .
so there is a built-in audience all around the world for his recordings . karajan had an international career , but was still very much a german and austrian conductor .
now an englishman , sir simon rattle , leads the berlin philharmonic . does nationality have a role in orchestras today ? it has become less relevant .
it used to be that orchestras from different countries had different sounds - the russians had very piercing brass instruments , the germans had tremendous warmth in their string sound .
as conductors travel around the world , and players go from orchestra to orchestra , and sometimes from country to country , those things have greatly diminished , in the last 30 or 40 years . that 's the way of the world .
but some of us yearn , to some extent , for the old days , when there were those characteristic sounds of orchestras .
when nobody could play german music like the germans and nobody could play french music like the french . one of the most frequently debated aspects of karajan 's life is the fact that he joined the nazi party in 1933 .
modern biographers have argued it was a political career move , rather than an ideological one .
still , he conducted for hitler and other top nazis , who revered him .
how important is this aspect of his biography ? bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : german composer and conductor richard strauss well , it is a very important aspect .
and he is far from alone in any of this .
-lsb- german conductor wilhelm -rsb- furtwaengler , of course , had many of the same problems ... and -lsb- german composer -rsb- richard strauss was the head of the nazi music chamber .
so karajan was far from alone . it 's a very unfortunate aspect of his biography , but it does n't mitigate his music making in any way , i do n't think .
there were a lot of bad things happening in those days , and he was part of it . if you read about karajan in the press , it is hard to find anyone neutral .
the musicians who played for him adored him , as did a large public .
yet many writers today criticize his sound as being too " cold " and technical , and take his perfectionism to task .
what 's your take ? well , i do n't find his music making cold .
it was certainly very lush , and that was problematic in some ways .
i remember a recording came out of bach and stravinsky , and for me the funny thing about that record is that karajan was out of his depth on both ends .
his big , lush bach sound is totally out of date today , now that the early music movement has brought back the smallness of sound from the baroque era .
and in the case of stravinsky - a very angular , modern sound - again , karajan 's sound is very lush and rich .
it missed the angles and it missed a lot of the music as a result . so , it was a style that did n't suit all types of music , but the music it suited , it suited very well .
there is a recording late in his life of mahler 's 9th symphony that is the opposite of cold .
its one of the great recordings ever made .
so i 'm not sure what people have in mind when they use a blanket term like cold to describe his music making . karajan was also known for leading an extravagant lifestyle , flying jets and driving race cars .
he was also criticized by some for ostensibly forcing concert ticket prices so high that only the wealthy could attend .
how did this affect the public 's view of him ? bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : karajan steps off the jet with his wife , eliette -lrb- left -rrb- and daughter isabella well , i do n't think karajan set concert prices .
karajan certainly made a lot of money and demanded a lot of money , but he was n't alone in that .
concerts were very expensive , especially at salzburg .
but it is far from just karajan .
yo yo ma , itzhak perlman - all sorts of people were demanding huge amounts of money .
and that 's what sent ticket prices soaring . so did his luxury lifestyle image act in his favor , or against him ? i think it humanized him .
toscanini was put on a pedestal by music lovers for a long time .
in this case it brought karajan in to a real world that people could identify with , or wished they had ...
i 'm sure the image was certainly part of the package . how do you suppose karajan will be remembered ? i think there are a lot of generalizations going around this year , and i think generalizations are always risky .
i do n't want to see him swamped , and go down in history with words like " cold " attached and " luxury " attached .
he was many things .
he was a very complex figure , and he was a great musician . interview : jennifer abramsohn send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

the opening is now scheduled for december . no precise opening date has been set for the prestige project , which will be supplanting a more modest corporate museum , but the inauguration is expected to take place by the end of the year , the carmaker said on wednesday , april 2 . construction of what has been billed as a new architectural landmark for the region began in 2005 at the company campus in the suburb of zuffenhausen , and was supposed to have been completed early last year . the 5,600 square meters -lrb- 60,277 square feet -rrb- of display space is to showcase 80 immaculately preserved porsche cars , replacing the old , 600-square-meter museum , which only had room for 20 of the company 's collection of 300 historic cars . but the ambitious scale of the undertaking caused hitches early on .
designed by the delugan meissl architectural office in vienna , the triangular museum built on concrete stilts is a unique project requiring complex engineering - and it soon became clear that the original completion deadline would not be met , despite the 40 different companies hired to see it through . at a press conference wednesday , spokesman anton hunger moreover said the budget of 50 million euros -lrb- $ 78 million -rrb- had proved insufficient and would rise to a " high two-digit number in the millions . " building the best bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the mercedes museum recent years have seen germany 's luxury carmakers racing to build the biggest and best museum , with bmw in munich and volkswagen in wolfsburg among the companies spending fortunes on exhibition spaces and theme parks . porsche 's eagerly-awaited futuristic-looking museum is specifically designed to rival the nearby mercedes-benz center , an 83 million euro facility hailed an architectural masterpiece when it opened in 2006 , and one which fast became a popular tourist magnet . positioned directly outside the main gate of the daimler factory in the untertuerkheim district , the spiral building was designed by the un studio of amsterdam and is based on a unique cloverleaf concept using three overlapping circles with the center removed to form a triangular atrium . the building 's height and " double helix " interior were designed to maximize space , providing 16,500 square meters of exhibition premises on a footprint of just 4,800 square meters .
clad in shimmering silver panels , the museum houses 80 passenger cars , 40 commercial trucks , and 40 racing cars and trucks with more than 1,500 displays from the company 's 120-year history . long-time rivalry bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : mercedes dominates the stuttgart skyline porsche was determined not to be outstripped .
but in fact , the company has long stood in the shadow of mercedes down in baden-wuerttemberg . stuttgart 's industrial heritage is a source of much pride to locals , and the region has always profited from the ongoing rivalry between the luxury carmakers , with each company trying to up its profile by funding competing museums and arenas . but ultimately , the city tends to identify most with the mercedes-benz brand , and the daimler firm has succeeded most obviously in conquering the stuttgart skyline . in comparison , porsche is something of a poor relation , forever trying to emulate and outdo its rival mercedes .
and in the race to erect the best museum , porsche , for the time being , is lagging behind . dw staff -lrb- jp -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

the late collector 's stockpiling instinct was so intense he drove himself out of his own home . over-eager collecting - it can come about through a variety of ways .
often it involves someone with a lot of time on their hands , a home shopping channel and a telephone .
before long , the packages start to arrive , giving the recipient a temporary frisson of excitement that quickly wears off .
soon enough , another order 's been placed .
it can go downhill from here .
the recent case of a 71-year-old man who had a need to stockpile likely did n't involve tv shopping - this man 's primary passion was guns .
the estate lawyer sent out to look at the man 's apartment in the western city of aachen after his death found 71 rifles , revolvers , and pistols along with other weapons he had built himself .
" there were 71 guns - one for each year of his life , " said police spokesman paul kemen .
" he also had 41 cases of ammunition and five walking sticks fitted with retractable blades . "
the man did not have a permit to own weapons , and retractable blades are illegal in germany .
although guns were a special love , the collector did n't limit himself to just weapons .
according to neighbors , the man , who lived alone , collected everything from garden tools to watches .
" the house was stuffed to the rafters , " heiner hautermans , a reporter at the aachener nachrichten newspaper , told reuters .
" by the end , the neighbors said he had to sleep in a hotel sometimes because there was no more room . " dw staff -lrb- jam -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

" today more nations stepped forward with offers that will raise that total again , and very substantially , " nato secretary general jaap de hoop scheffer said at a news conference with afghan president hamid karzai and un secretary-general ban ki-moon . scheffer did not say how many troops were offered and referred specifically only to an offer by france to send an additional battalion , about 800 troops .
but he said it satisfied a canadian demand for reinforcements in its sector in southern afghanistan . the nato-led force in afghanistan currently numbers around 47,000 soliders . aiming for self-sufficiency the document , endorsed by the 26 nato members and by the 14 non-nato countries which contribute forces to the un-mandated operation , was welcomed by karzai . " i am thankful for the strategic vision that you have offered on behalf of isaf ...
afghanistan is now better placed to take responsibility for its own security , " said karzai . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : there are currently 47,000 nato-led troops in afghanistan isaf forces have been fighting the taliban but have also been training the afghan military to do the same .
the document underlines the importance in making afghan security forces self-sufficient and taking the lead in counter-insurgency operations .
it also highlights helping the afghan government to extend good governance , reconstruction and development throughout the country . on thursday , karzai announced that as from august , afghan forces would finally be able to take over security operations in the capital kabul . france steps up earlier thursday , french president nicolas sarkozy confirmed that his country would be sending an additional 700 soldiers to the east , thus helping alleviate us and canadian concerns that isaf is overstretched . the offer came amid french plans for a return to nato 's military command next year after more than four decades of absence . isaf has grown by some 4,000 soldiers to about 47,000 in recent months , and more troops are ready to step in from poland , the czech republic and other allies . with their strategic vision document , the allies vowed to support the afghan leadership , bring together civilian and military efforts , and increase cooperation with afghanistan 's neighbors , " especially pakistan . " it also urged nato members to provide " maximum possible flexibility " in the use of their troops and to fill the current shortfalls in manning levels - two issues which have sparked bitter disagreements in the past . a deep rift had emerged within nato over the past months , with some countries , spearheaded by the united states , insisting on the need to fight the insurgents and others , like germany and italy , placing the emphasis on the civilian nature of the isaf mission . two in , three out in a major rebuff to us president george w bush who is attending the last summit of the transatlantic alliance as us president , european leaders kept georgia and ukraine waiting at nato 's doorstep thursday .
they did , however , welcome albania and croatia . bush , eager to burnish his foreign policy legacy in the waning months of a presidency tarnished by iraq , had pushed hard for georgia and ukraine to be allowed into the nato club .
scheffer said nato would offer georgia and ukraine " intensive engagement " , along with a vague promise of membership sometime down the line .
" we agree today that these countries will become members of nato , " he told reporters .
" that is quite something . "
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : german chancellor merkel and french president sarkozy opposed membership bids by ukraine and georgia the membership bids of ukraine and georgia , two former soviet republics , are strongly opposed by russia .
both germany and france , wary of alienating moscow , also resisted opening the door to georgia and ukraine . meanwhile , strong protests erupted in skopje after macedonia 's bid for an invitation was effectively vetoed by greece in a long-running dispute over macedonia 's official name . athens maintains that allowing its northern neighbor to call itself " macedonia " would imply a territorial claim on the greek province of the same name , and insists that it will not approve macedonia 's nato membership until the issue is resolved . macedonian delegates walked out of the summit in response , with foreign minister antonio milososki accusing greece of using an " irrelevant argument of ancient times . " russia urged to link missile defences with us on the thorny issue of a us missile defense shield in europe , nato leaders also asked experts to draw up options for a missile system that would complement the us anti-missile shield and provide cover to some allies left out in the cold , a statement said .
they also urged russia to consider linking up its missile defences to the us shield - despite moscow 's hostility towards it .
washington said last year it wanted to install 10 missile interceptors in poland and a radar base in the czech republic to cover us territory and that of some european allies , and wanted it operational by 2013 .
the shield is aimed at countering attacks from " rogue states " such as iran but russia fears it could pose a direct challenge to its security . dw staff -lrb- sp -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

" today more nations stepped forward with offers that will raise that total again , and very substantially , " nato secretary general jaap de hoop scheffer said at a news conference with afghan president hamid karzai and un secretary-general ban ki-moon . scheffer did not say how many troops were offered and referred specifically only to an offer by france to send an additional battalion , about 800 troops .

the document underlines the importance in making afghan security forces self-sufficient and taking the lead in counter-insurgency operations .
it also highlights helping the afghan government to extend good governance , reconstruction and development throughout the country . on thursday , karzai announced that as from august , afghan forces would finally be able to take over security operations in the capital kabul . france steps up earlier thursday , french president nicolas sarkozy confirmed that his country would be sending an additional 700 soldiers to the east , thus helping alleviate us and canadian concerns that isaf is overstretched . the offer came amid french plans for a return to nato 's military command next year after more than four decades of absence . isaf has grown by some 4,000 soldiers to about 47,000 in recent months , and more troops are ready to step in from poland , the czech republic and other allies . with their strategic vision document , the allies vowed to support the afghan leadership , bring together civilian and military efforts , and increase cooperation with afghanistan 's neighbors , " especially pakistan .

the carmaker called the program disproportionate , illegal and unfair . the german luxury sports car maker lodged papers at the royal courts of justice on wednesday , april 2 , in a bid to stop london mayor ken livingstone 's proposed charge . under the mayor 's plan , from october , people with cars that emit more than 225 grams of carbon dioxide per kilometer - such as sports utility vehicles and high-powered performance cars - will pay a daily charge of 25 pounds -lrb- $ 49.70 , 31.75 euros -rrb- to drive into central london . " not only is this new tax on motorists unfair , it is also a disproportionate and illegal use of power by the mayor , " said andy goss , managing director of porsche cars gb , after the judicial review papers were filed . " the porsche case is about protecting london and londoners from a new tax that will not only fail to reduce carbon dioxide emissions in central london , but also increase congestion and damage air quality . " a judge will now have to decide within the next few days whether to proceed with the case . not backing down livingstone appeared to be unswayed by porsche 's criticism and vowed to fight the legal action . " porsche 's self-serving legal action shows their continuing contempt for the views of londoners , " he said .
" porsche should be using its engineering expertise to create low-polluting cars , not its lawyers to oppose the democratic wishes of londoners . according to a recent poll , 61 percent of londoners approve of increasing the congestion tax for gas-guzzling vehicles . he added : " londoners , not car manufacturers , should be the ones to decide how to tackle pollution in their city .
i will vigorously contest porsche 's legal action . " elections might change things however , the pollution charge may never be imposed . londoners vote in mayoral elections on may 1 and opinion polls have put livingstone 's main rival boris johnson in the lead .
the conservative candidate has vowed to ditch livingstone 's plan . it is the latest program targeting london 's traffic pollution and congestion problems . for five years , london has been assessing drivers a daily congestion charge , now set at eight pounds , to drive into the central city and a large swath around it .
the fee was designed to tackle the bottlenecks that have turned much of london into a parking lot . the uk capital is the biggest urban area in the world to charge such a toll and city officials from around the globe have considered copying the idea . dw staff -lrb- jam -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

the opening is now scheduled for december . no precise opening date has been set for the prestige project , which will be supplanting a more modest corporate museum , but the inauguration is expected to take place by the end of the year , the carmaker said on wednesday , april 2 . construction of what has been billed as a new architectural landmark for the region began in 2005 at the company campus in the suburb of zuffenhausen , and was supposed to have been completed early last year . the 5,600 square meters -lrb- 60,277 square feet -rrb- of display space is to showcase 80 immaculately preserved porsche cars , replacing the old , 600-square-meter museum , which only had room for 20 of the company 's collection of 300 historic cars . but the ambitious scale of the undertaking caused hitches early on .
designed by the delugan meissl architectural office in vienna , the triangular museum built on concrete stilts is a unique project requiring complex engineering - and it soon became clear that the original completion deadline would not be met , despite the 40 different companies hired to see it through . at a press conference wednesday , spokesman anton hunger moreover said the budget of 50 million euros -lrb- $ 78 million -rrb- had proved insufficient and would rise to a " high two-digit number in the millions . " building the best bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the mercedes museum recent years have seen germany 's luxury carmakers racing to build the biggest and best museum , with bmw in munich and volkswagen in wolfsburg among the companies spending fortunes on exhibition spaces and theme parks . porsche 's eagerly-awaited futuristic-looking museum is specifically designed to rival the nearby mercedes-benz center , an 83 million euro facility hailed an architectural masterpiece when it opened in 2006 , and one which fast became a popular tourist magnet . positioned directly outside the main gate of the daimler factory in the untertuerkheim district , the spiral building was designed by the un studio of amsterdam and is based on a unique cloverleaf concept using three overlapping circles with the center removed to form a triangular atrium . the building 's height and " double helix " interior were designed to maximize space , providing 16,500 square meters of exhibition premises on a footprint of just 4,800 square meters .
clad in shimmering silver panels , the museum houses 80 passenger cars , 40 commercial trucks , and 40 racing cars and trucks with more than 1,500 displays from the company 's 120-year history . long-time rivalry bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : mercedes dominates the stuttgart skyline porsche was determined not to be outstripped .
but in fact , the company has long stood in the shadow of mercedes down in baden-wuerttemberg . stuttgart 's industrial heritage is a source of much pride to locals , and the region has always profited from the ongoing rivalry between the luxury carmakers , with each company trying to up its profile by funding competing museums and arenas . but ultimately , the city tends to identify most with the mercedes-benz brand , and the daimler firm has succeeded most obviously in conquering the stuttgart skyline . in comparison , porsche is something of a poor relation , forever trying to emulate and outdo its rival mercedes .
and in the race to erect the best museum , porsche , for the time being , is lagging behind . dw staff -lrb- jp -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

the carmaker called the program disproportionate , illegal and unfair . the german luxury sports car maker lodged papers at the royal courts of justice on wednesday , april 2 , in a bid to stop london mayor ken livingstone 's proposed charge . under the mayor 's plan , from october , people with cars that emit more than 225 grams of carbon dioxide per kilometer - such as sports utility vehicles and high-powered performance cars - will pay a daily charge of 25 pounds -lrb- $ 49.70 , 31.75 euros -rrb- to drive into central london . " not only is this new tax on motorists unfair , it is also a disproportionate and illegal use of power by the mayor , " said andy goss , managing director of porsche cars gb , after the judicial review papers were filed . " the porsche case is about protecting london and londoners from a new tax that will not only fail to reduce carbon dioxide emissions in central london , but also increase congestion and damage air quality . " a judge will now have to decide within the next few days whether to proceed with the case . not backing down livingstone appeared to be unswayed by porsche 's criticism and vowed to fight the legal action . " porsche 's self-serving legal action shows their continuing contempt for the views of londoners , " he said .
" porsche should be using its engineering expertise to create low-polluting cars , not its lawyers to oppose the democratic wishes of londoners . according to a recent poll , 61 percent of londoners approve of increasing the congestion tax for gas-guzzling vehicles . he added : " londoners , not car manufacturers , should be the ones to decide how to tackle pollution in their city .
i will vigorously contest porsche 's legal action . " elections might change things however , the pollution charge may never be imposed . londoners vote in mayoral elections on may 1 and opinion polls have put livingstone 's main rival boris johnson in the lead .
the conservative candidate has vowed to ditch livingstone 's plan . it is the latest program targeting london 's traffic pollution and congestion problems . for five years , london has been assessing drivers a daily congestion charge , now set at eight pounds , to drive into the central city and a large swath around it .

the opening is now scheduled for december . no precise opening date has been set for the prestige project , which will be supplanting a more modest corporate museum , but the inauguration is expected to take place by the end of the year , the carmaker said on wednesday , april 2 . construction of what has been billed as a new architectural landmark for the region began in 2005 at the company campus in the suburb of zuffenhausen , and was supposed to have been completed early last year . the 5,600 square meters -lrb- 60,277 square feet -rrb- of display space is to showcase 80 immaculately preserved porsche cars , replacing the old , 600-square-meter museum , which only had room for 20 of the company 's collection of 300 historic cars . but the ambitious scale of the undertaking caused hitches early on .
designed by the delugan meissl architectural office in vienna , the triangular museum built on concrete stilts is a unique project requiring complex engineering - and it soon became clear that the original completion deadline would not be met , despite the 40 different companies hired to see it through . at a press conference wednesday , spokesman anton hunger moreover said the budget of 50 million euros -lrb- $ 78 million -rrb- had proved insufficient and would rise to a " high two-digit number in the millions . " building the best bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the mercedes museum recent years have seen germany 's luxury carmakers racing to build the biggest and best museum , with bmw in munich and volkswagen in wolfsburg among the companies spending fortunes on exhibition spaces and theme parks . porsche 's eagerly-awaited futuristic-looking museum is specifically designed to rival the nearby mercedes-benz center , an 83 million euro facility hailed an architectural masterpiece when it opened in 2006 , and one which fast became a popular tourist magnet . positioned directly outside the main gate of the daimler factory in the untertuerkheim district , the spiral building was designed by the un studio of amsterdam and is based on a unique cloverleaf concept using three overlapping circles with the center removed to form a triangular atrium . the building 's height and " double helix " interior were designed to maximize space , providing 16,500 square meters of exhibition premises on a footprint of just 4,800 square meters .
clad in shimmering silver panels , the museum houses 80 passenger cars , 40 commercial trucks , and 40 racing cars and trucks with more than 1,500 displays from the company 's 120-year history . long-time rivalry bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : mercedes dominates the stuttgart skyline porsche was determined not to be outstripped .
but in fact , the company has long stood in the shadow of mercedes down in baden-wuerttemberg . stuttgart 's industrial heritage is a source of much pride to locals , and the region has always profited from the ongoing rivalry between the luxury carmakers , with each company trying to up its profile by funding competing museums and arenas . but ultimately , the city tends to identify most with the mercedes-benz brand , and the daimler firm has succeeded most obviously in conquering the stuttgart skyline . in comparison , porsche is something of a poor relation , forever trying to emulate and outdo its rival mercedes .
and in the race to erect the best museum , porsche , for the time being , is lagging behind . dw staff -lrb- jp -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

" today more nations stepped forward with offers that will raise that total again , and very substantially , " nato secretary general jaap de hoop scheffer said at a news conference with afghan president hamid karzai and un secretary-general ban ki-moon . scheffer did not say how many troops were offered and referred specifically only to an offer by france to send an additional battalion , about 800 troops .
but he said it satisfied a canadian demand for reinforcements in its sector in southern afghanistan . the nato-led force in afghanistan currently numbers around 47,000 soliders . aiming for self-sufficiency the document , endorsed by the 26 nato members and by the 14 non-nato countries which contribute forces to the un-mandated operation , was welcomed by karzai . " i am thankful for the strategic vision that you have offered on behalf of isaf ...

the document underlines the importance in making afghan security forces self-sufficient and taking the lead in counter-insurgency operations .
it also highlights helping the afghan government to extend good governance , reconstruction and development throughout the country . on thursday , karzai announced that as from august , afghan forces would finally be able to take over security operations in the capital kabul . france steps up earlier thursday , french president nicolas sarkozy confirmed that his country would be sending an additional 700 soldiers to the east , thus helping alleviate us and canadian concerns that isaf is overstretched . the offer came amid french plans for a return to nato 's military command next year after more than four decades of absence . isaf has grown by some 4,000 soldiers to about 47,000 in recent months , and more troops are ready to step in from poland , the czech republic and other allies . with their strategic vision document , the allies vowed to support the afghan leadership , bring together civilian and military efforts , and increase cooperation with afghanistan 's neighbors , " especially pakistan . " it also urged nato members to provide " maximum possible flexibility " in the use of their troops and to fill the current shortfalls in manning levels - two issues which have sparked bitter disagreements in the past . a deep rift had emerged within nato over the past months , with some countries , spearheaded by the united states , insisting on the need to fight the insurgents and others , like germany and italy , placing the emphasis on the civilian nature of the isaf mission . two in , three out in a major rebuff to us president george w bush who is attending the last summit of the transatlantic alliance as us president , european leaders kept georgia and ukraine waiting at nato 's doorstep thursday .
they did , however , welcome albania and croatia . bush , eager to burnish his foreign policy legacy in the waning months of a presidency tarnished by iraq , had pushed hard for georgia and ukraine to be allowed into the nato club .
scheffer said nato would offer georgia and ukraine " intensive engagement " , along with a vague promise of membership sometime down the line .
" we agree today that these countries will become members of nato , " he told reporters .
" that is quite something . "

both germany and france , wary of alienating moscow , also resisted opening the door to georgia and ukraine . meanwhile , strong protests erupted in skopje after macedonia 's bid for an invitation was effectively vetoed by greece in a long-running dispute over macedonia 's official name . athens maintains that allowing its northern neighbor to call itself " macedonia " would imply a territorial claim on the greek province of the same name , and insists that it will not approve macedonia 's nato membership until the issue is resolved . macedonian delegates walked out of the summit in response , with foreign minister antonio milososki accusing greece of using an " irrelevant argument of ancient times . " russia urged to link missile defences with us on the thorny issue of a us missile defense shield in europe , nato leaders also asked experts to draw up options for a missile system that would complement the us anti-missile shield and provide cover to some allies left out in the cold , a statement said .
they also urged russia to consider linking up its missile defences to the us shield - despite moscow 's hostility towards it .
washington said last year it wanted to install 10 missile interceptors in poland and a radar base in the czech republic to cover us territory and that of some european allies , and wanted it operational by 2013 .
the shield is aimed at countering attacks from " rogue states " such as iran but russia fears it could pose a direct challenge to its security . dw staff -lrb- sp -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

scheffer said nato would offer georgia and ukraine " intensive engagement " , along with a vague promise of membership sometime down the line .
" we agree today that these countries will become members of nato , " he told reporters .
" that is quite something . "

both germany and france , wary of alienating moscow , also resisted opening the door to georgia and ukraine . meanwhile , strong protests erupted in skopje after macedonia 's bid for an invitation was effectively vetoed by greece in a long-running dispute over macedonia 's official name . athens maintains that allowing its northern neighbor to call itself " macedonia " would imply a territorial claim on the greek province of the same name , and insists that it will not approve macedonia 's nato membership until the issue is resolved . macedonian delegates walked out of the summit in response , with foreign minister antonio milososki accusing greece of using an " irrelevant argument of ancient times . " russia urged to link missile defences with us on the thorny issue of a us missile defense shield in europe , nato leaders also asked experts to draw up options for a missile system that would complement the us anti-missile shield and provide cover to some allies left out in the cold , a statement said .
they also urged russia to consider linking up its missile defences to the us shield - despite moscow 's hostility towards it .
washington said last year it wanted to install 10 missile interceptors in poland and a radar base in the czech republic to cover us territory and that of some european allies , and wanted it operational by 2013 .
the shield is aimed at countering attacks from " rogue states " such as iran but russia fears it could pose a direct challenge to its security . dw staff -lrb- sp -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

merkel calls on brazil to make biofuel production sustainable as biofuels fall from grace , a new generation grabs spotlight germany defends biofuels , hedges bets on energy goals german minister calls for reversal of eu agricultural policy environment -pipe- 03.04.2008 german cars ca n't handle biofuels , environment plan at risk großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : experts said too many cars in germany would n't be able to handle biofuel blends the german government 's plan to introduce a new biofuel blend may now be postponed .
far too many cars are not able to process the fuel , industry sources said , putting a dent in the environment plan . auto industry sources said on that more than 2 million cars in germany would not be able to handle biofuels , thereby exceeding a 1-million limit the german government had set as a pre-condition for use . the sources said that some 330,000 cars made by german manufacturers , as well as more than 2 million imported cars , could not run on the new fuel and that the cars ' owners would be forced to fill up with higher octane , more expensive types of gas . the controversial plan to include a 10-percent biofuel blend plans could be slowed if it seemed likely that vehicle engines would be damaged by the mixture , a spokesperson for the german environment ministry said on wednesday , april 2 . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : biofuel blends are part of a larger german environment plan that includes reducing emissions environment minister sigmar gabriel had earlier said he would annul a government decree for the fuel , called e-10 , be introduced if too many cars were unable to run on it . " we wo n't put this regulation into effect if more than 1 million vehicles are affected , " gabriel told the stuttgarter nachrichten newspaper . part of a larger emissions reduction plan the german law would require regular gasoline to be mixed with 10 percent plant-based ethanol , called " e-10 , " and diesel to be mixed with 7 percent fuel made of plant origin by next year .
by 2020 , the ratio is supposed to rise to 17 percent . it is part of a larger plan to curb emissions , with eu states agreeing last year to reduce emissions by at least one-fifth by 2020 from 1990 levels , to use 20 percent of renewable energy sources in power production and 10 percent of biofuels from crops for transportation , also by 2020 . a change in the biofuel plan would demand possibly altering the overall targets . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : rapeseed can also be used as a biofuel adac , germany 's central motoring club , said that biofuels would damage the hoses and gaskets in 3 million cars on german roads , forcing those car owners to buy a more expensive , non-plant super grade of gas instead .
adac called for the introduction of e-10 to be delayed until 2012 . gabriel has said he will await figures from the auto industry on the number of cars actually unable to use the fuel before making a final decision on whether or not to introduce the plan . environmentalists critical of biofuel farming environmentalist organizations are critical of the plan themselves , albeit for a different reason .
greenpeace said on wednesday that the german plan to blend diesel with biodiesel to combat climate change is detrimental . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : diesel , unleaded , super , and biofuel blends are showing up at the pumps the group said it had tested fossil diesel sold at over 40 filling stations across germany to determine which vegetable oils were used in compulsory biodiesel blends .
it found that around 20 percent was soy oil rather than rapeseed oil from the german harvest . greenpeace said in a statement that germany 's blending policy would not help to fight global warming since soy oil imports largely came from south america , where tropical rain forests were being slashed to cultivate soybeans . " huge areas of tropical rain forests are being destroyed for the new plantations , for example in argentina , " the organization said . but , germany 's biofuels industry association told reuters news service that greenpeace 's charges were unjustified , and that soy oil comes from north america , argentina and brazil . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : straw turned into biofuel ?
you bet !
" soy oil from the us and argentina does not have rain forest issues , " vdb chief executive petra sprick said . "
imports from brazil are largely handled by major trading houses such as adm , bunge and cargill , which have voluntary agreements only to purchase soy oil from sustainable agriculture and not from areas using cleared tropical rain forests . " germany made the blending of biodiesel with fossil diesel at oil refineries compulsory in january 2007 as part of its policies to combat global warming .
fossil diesel must contain 4.4 percent biodiesel . biofuel farming is also driving up world food prices , such as for corn and grains - which are used to make ethanol . dw staff -lrb- als -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de nato -pipe- 03.04.2008 nato vows to bolster troops in afghanistan großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : afghan president karzai , with un chief ban ki-moon at the nato summit nato allies meeting in romania at a major alliance summit reconfirmed their " long-term commitment " to afghanistan and pledged to substantially beef up troop numbers in the country . nato leaders reaffirmed their long-term commitment to afghanistan on thursday with a document designed to bridge strategic divisions over the nature of the international security assistance force -lrb- isaf -rrb- mission . the four-page " strategic vision " called on nato members to maintain a " shared long-term commitment " to isaf in its aim to help the people of afghanistan " build an enduring , stable , secure , prosperous and democratic state " that is free of violence and terrorism . " today more nations stepped forward with offers that will raise that total again , and very substantially , " nato secretary general jaap de hoop scheffer said at a news conference with afghan president hamid karzai and un secretary-general ban ki-moon . scheffer did not say how many troops were offered and referred specifically only to an offer by france to send an additional battalion , about 800 troops .
but he said it satisfied a canadian demand for reinforcements in its sector in southern afghanistan . the nato-led force in afghanistan currently numbers around 47,000 soliders . aiming for self-sufficiency the document , endorsed by the 26 nato members and by the 14 non-nato countries which contribute forces to the un-mandated operation , was welcomed by karzai . " i am thankful for the strategic vision that you have offered on behalf of isaf ...
afghanistan is now better placed to take responsibility for its own security , " said karzai . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : there are currently 47,000 nato-led troops in afghanistan isaf forces have been fighting the taliban but have also been training the afghan military to do the same .
the document underlines the importance in making afghan security forces self-sufficient and taking the lead in counter-insurgency operations .
it also highlights helping the afghan government to extend good governance , reconstruction and development throughout the country . on thursday , karzai announced that as from august , afghan forces would finally be able to take over security operations in the capital kabul . france steps up earlier thursday , french president nicolas sarkozy confirmed that his country would be sending an additional 700 soldiers to the east , thus helping alleviate us and canadian concerns that isaf is overstretched . the offer came amid french plans for a return to nato 's military command next year after more than four decades of absence . isaf has grown by some 4,000 soldiers to about 47,000 in recent months , and more troops are ready to step in from poland , the czech republic and other allies . with their strategic vision document , the allies vowed to support the afghan leadership , bring together civilian and military efforts , and increase cooperation with afghanistan 's neighbors , " especially pakistan . " it also urged nato members to provide " maximum possible flexibility " in the use of their troops and to fill the current shortfalls in manning levels - two issues which have sparked bitter disagreements in the past . a deep rift had emerged within nato over the past months , with some countries , spearheaded by the united states , insisting on the need to fight the insurgents and others , like germany and italy , placing the emphasis on the civilian nature of the isaf mission . two in , three out in a major rebuff to us president george w bush who is attending the last summit of the transatlantic alliance as us president , european leaders kept georgia and ukraine waiting at nato 's doorstep thursday .
they did , however , welcome albania and croatia . bush , eager to burnish his foreign policy legacy in the waning months of a presidency tarnished by iraq , had pushed hard for georgia and ukraine to be allowed into the nato club .
scheffer said nato would offer georgia and ukraine " intensive engagement " , along with a vague promise of membership sometime down the line .
" we agree today that these countries will become members of nato , " he told reporters .
" that is quite something . "
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : german chancellor merkel and french president sarkozy opposed membership bids by ukraine and georgia the membership bids of ukraine and georgia , two former soviet republics , are strongly opposed by russia .
both germany and france , wary of alienating moscow , also resisted opening the door to georgia and ukraine . meanwhile , strong protests erupted in skopje after macedonia 's bid for an invitation was effectively vetoed by greece in a long-running dispute over macedonia 's official name . athens maintains that allowing its northern neighbor to call itself " macedonia " would imply a territorial claim on the greek province of the same name , and insists that it will not approve macedonia 's nato membership until the issue is resolved . macedonian delegates walked out of the summit in response , with foreign minister antonio milososki accusing greece of using an " irrelevant argument of ancient times . " russia urged to link missile defences with us on the thorny issue of a us missile defense shield in europe , nato leaders also asked experts to draw up options for a missile system that would complement the us anti-missile shield and provide cover to some allies left out in the cold , a statement said .
they also urged russia to consider linking up its missile defences to the us shield - despite moscow 's hostility towards it .
washington said last year it wanted to install 10 missile interceptors in poland and a radar base in the czech republic to cover us territory and that of some european allies , and wanted it operational by 2013 .
the shield is aimed at countering attacks from " rogue states " such as iran but russia fears it could pose a direct challenge to its security . dw staff -lrb- sp -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

croatia and albania were formally invited to join , while macedonia was not . nato leaders were set on thursday , april 3 , to endorse a planned us missile shield for europe , a senior us official told reporters . the final summit statement would " recognize the substantive contribution to the protection of the allies " from the missile defense system to be deployed in the czech republic and poland , the official told reporters . " the united states and the czech republic are pleased to announce the completion of negotiations on a missile-defense agreement .
we plan to sign the agreement in the near future , " a statement said . french commitment the us official also said that president george w. bush had confirmed to the summit leaders that the us will be able to move some of its troops to afghanistan 's south once france sends a battalion of troops to the east of afghanistan , meeting canada 's conditions to keep troops in afghanistan until 2011 , the official said .
ottawa had said it would pull its 2,500 troops out next year if reinforcements were not forthcoming . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : sarkozy said france was willing to deploy additional troops to afghanistan french president nicolas sarkozy had said earlier france would send a battalion of troops to the east of afghanistan as part of efforts to bolster the 47,000-strong peacekeeping force . " i have decided to reinforce the french military presence with one battalion deployed in the east region , " president nicolas sarkozy said in a speech delivered at the summit , the afp news agency reported . the offer , which french military sources put at between 800 and 1,000 soldiers , came amid french plans for a return to nato 's military command next year after more than four decades of absence . " at the end of the french presidency of the european union , the moment will have come to conclude this process and to make the necessary decisions for france to take its full place in nato 's structures , " sarkozy said .
paris is set to take over the rotating eu presidency in july . staying in afghanistan as long as it takes it was good news for us president george w. bush , who on wednesday had urged nato allies to send more troops to afghanistan , stressing that the 26-nation trans-atlantic alliance could not afford to lose its battle against taliban insurgents and al qaeda militants .
as yet , only a few countries have answered his call . " whatever the cost , however difficult , we can not afford it , we must win , " he had said ahead of the summit . in paris , a sarkozy advisor said prior to the summit that the french president had set out conditions for the extra french troops in a letter to nato allies , including an increase in international aid to afghanistan .

" we have reached the conclusion that it is too early to give both countries membership action plan status , " german chancellor angela merkel had said on arrival at the summit . a senior georgian diplomat has told the bbc that the " no " to georgia will be widely seen as a victory for russia , which has long been expressing concerns over nato 's eastward expansion . croatia and albania sit at the table bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : merkel does not support nato 's eastwards push greece , meanwhile , dug its heels in over accession by macedonia , unless the country changed its name to recognize athens ' concerns regarding greece 's northern region with the same name - prompting fresh concerns about stability in the balkans .
officials said thursday that the alliance decided not to invite macedonia to join until the dispute is solved . according to a macedonian government spokesman , allied leaders meeting in bucharest had authorized their ambassadors to issue the invitation as soon as the name issue , which has festered for 17 years , is resolved . " we have agreed that an invitation to the former yugoslav republic of macedonia will be issued as soon as a mutually acceptable solution to the name issue has been reached , " nato 's secretary-general jaap de hoop scheffer told a news conference . two other balkan countries - croatia and albania - were , however , invited to join the defense alliance and sat at nato 's table for the first time thursday .

" today more nations stepped forward with offers that will raise that total again , and very substantially , " nato secretary general jaap de hoop scheffer said at a news conference with afghan president hamid karzai and un secretary-general ban ki-moon . scheffer did not say how many troops were offered and referred specifically only to an offer by france to send an additional battalion , about 800 troops .
but he said it satisfied a canadian demand for reinforcements in its sector in southern afghanistan . the nato-led force in afghanistan currently numbers around 47,000 soliders . aiming for self-sufficiency the document , endorsed by the 26 nato members and by the 14 non-nato countries which contribute forces to the un-mandated operation , was welcomed by karzai . " i am thankful for the strategic vision that you have offered on behalf of isaf ...
afghanistan is now better placed to take responsibility for its own security , " said karzai . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : there are currently 47,000 nato-led troops in afghanistan isaf forces have been fighting the taliban but have also been training the afghan military to do the same .
the document underlines the importance in making afghan security forces self-sufficient and taking the lead in counter-insurgency operations .

" today more nations stepped forward with offers that will raise that total again , and very substantially , " nato secretary general jaap de hoop scheffer said at a news conference with afghan president hamid karzai and un secretary-general ban ki-moon . scheffer did not say how many troops were offered and referred specifically only to an offer by france to send an additional battalion , about 800 troops .
but he said it satisfied a canadian demand for reinforcements in its sector in southern afghanistan . the nato-led force in afghanistan currently numbers around 47,000 soliders . aiming for self-sufficiency the document , endorsed by the 26 nato members and by the 14 non-nato countries which contribute forces to the un-mandated operation , was welcomed by karzai . " i am thankful for the strategic vision that you have offered on behalf of isaf ...
afghanistan is now better placed to take responsibility for its own security , " said karzai . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : there are currently 47,000 nato-led troops in afghanistan isaf forces have been fighting the taliban but have also been training the afghan military to do the same .
the document underlines the importance in making afghan security forces self-sufficient and taking the lead in counter-insurgency operations .
it also highlights helping the afghan government to extend good governance , reconstruction and development throughout the country . on thursday , karzai announced that as from august , afghan forces would finally be able to take over security operations in the capital kabul . france steps up earlier thursday , french president nicolas sarkozy confirmed that his country would be sending an additional 700 soldiers to the east , thus helping alleviate us and canadian concerns that isaf is overstretched . the offer came amid french plans for a return to nato 's military command next year after more than four decades of absence . isaf has grown by some 4,000 soldiers to about 47,000 in recent months , and more troops are ready to step in from poland , the czech republic and other allies . with their strategic vision document , the allies vowed to support the afghan leadership , bring together civilian and military efforts , and increase cooperation with afghanistan 's neighbors , " especially pakistan .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de music -pipe- 03.04.2008 critic explains allure of von karajan , 100 years and counting großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : great , but flawed : herbert von karajan -lrb- 1908-1989 -rrb- ahead of the 100th anniversary of the birth of famous orchestra director and conductor herbert von karajan on april 5 , dw-world.de talked about the maestro as a cultural icon with james oestreich of the new york times . in 1955 , von karajan - classical music 's most prolific recording artist - was named director of the berlin philharmonic orchestra , and was credited with creating its clean and distinctive sound during his 35-year tenure .
he was also chief conductor of the vienna symphony orchestra , and the guiding force behind the salzburg festival , where he conducted for 33 years .
karajan died july 16 , 1989 . dw-world.de spoke with james oestreich , music and dance editor at the new york times , about von karajan 's significance in music history . dw-world.de : these days you ca n't look anywhere in the german media without seeing a story or documentary or article about the life of herbert von karajan .
what 's all the fuss about ? james oestreich : he was probably the most recorded conductor of his time .
it was a time when long-playing records were really taking off , and then digital recording came in and the cd came in , and he was riding that technology through the whole thing . he recorded everything , all the time , and he re-recorded things .
he recorded the brahms symphonies three times , i believe , and the beethoven symphonies three times .
so he was simply everywhere . to boot , he was in many ways a fantastic conductor .
he had his shortcomings , as many people do .
but what he did well , he did extremely well .
and he had at that time one of the world 's greatest orchestras , if not the world 's greatest orchestra , performing for him . bildunterschrift : karajan conducts the berlin philharmonic in 1987 can you name a highlight ? his 1960s recordings of the beethoven symphonies were classic .
they were the way i , among many others , got to know the beethoven symphonies .
so they were kind of my standard , and many people 's standard for those works . what effect does a superstar conductor have on an orchestra ?
is it purely good news - more revenue and publicity - or can it also be damaging ? well it can be either .
in this case , he and the orchestra were so closely identified after so many years , and it was the coming together of two superstar names : karajan and the berlin philharmonic . ...
a music director is n't just a conductor .
he is someone who builds the orchestra in addition to conducting it .
in this case , karajan had built up this orchestra over a number of years , and made it into a sensational machine .
they played beautifully for him . to what do you attribute the ongoing interest in karajan ? well , there is the factor of permanence , for one thing .
it helps karajan and hurts people today .
it used to be that people 's vinyl lps would wear down and become unplayable .
now , digital recordings are permanent .
so there are these recordings that were the standard of their time , and they remain with us , and become standards of this time , too . it makes it difficult for people to come up with recording projects today , because all these standards are still readily available . in karajan 's case , there was also this international renown that he had .
when japan was warming to classical music - to put it mildly - 20 or 30 years ago , karajan was almost synonymous with classical music there .
so there is a built-in audience all around the world for his recordings . karajan had an international career , but was still very much a german and austrian conductor .
now an englishman , sir simon rattle , leads the berlin philharmonic . does nationality have a role in orchestras today ? it has become less relevant .
it used to be that orchestras from different countries had different sounds - the russians had very piercing brass instruments , the germans had tremendous warmth in their string sound .
as conductors travel around the world , and players go from orchestra to orchestra , and sometimes from country to country , those things have greatly diminished , in the last 30 or 40 years . that 's the way of the world .
but some of us yearn , to some extent , for the old days , when there were those characteristic sounds of orchestras .
when nobody could play german music like the germans and nobody could play french music like the french . one of the most frequently debated aspects of karajan 's life is the fact that he joined the nazi party in 1933 .
modern biographers have argued it was a political career move , rather than an ideological one .
still , he conducted for hitler and other top nazis , who revered him .
how important is this aspect of his biography ? bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : german composer and conductor richard strauss well , it is a very important aspect .
and he is far from alone in any of this .
-lsb- german conductor wilhelm -rsb- furtwaengler , of course , had many of the same problems ... and -lsb- german composer -rsb- richard strauss was the head of the nazi music chamber .
so karajan was far from alone . it 's a very unfortunate aspect of his biography , but it does n't mitigate his music making in any way , i do n't think .
there were a lot of bad things happening in those days , and he was part of it . if you read about karajan in the press , it is hard to find anyone neutral .
the musicians who played for him adored him , as did a large public .
yet many writers today criticize his sound as being too " cold " and technical , and take his perfectionism to task .
what 's your take ? well , i do n't find his music making cold .
it was certainly very lush , and that was problematic in some ways .
i remember a recording came out of bach and stravinsky , and for me the funny thing about that record is that karajan was out of his depth on both ends .
his big , lush bach sound is totally out of date today , now that the early music movement has brought back the smallness of sound from the baroque era .
and in the case of stravinsky - a very angular , modern sound - again , karajan 's sound is very lush and rich .
it missed the angles and it missed a lot of the music as a result . so , it was a style that did n't suit all types of music , but the music it suited , it suited very well .
there is a recording late in his life of mahler 's 9th symphony that is the opposite of cold .
its one of the great recordings ever made .
so i 'm not sure what people have in mind when they use a blanket term like cold to describe his music making . karajan was also known for leading an extravagant lifestyle , flying jets and driving race cars .
he was also criticized by some for ostensibly forcing concert ticket prices so high that only the wealthy could attend .
how did this affect the public 's view of him ? bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : karajan steps off the jet with his wife , eliette -lrb- left -rrb- and daughter isabella well , i do n't think karajan set concert prices .
karajan certainly made a lot of money and demanded a lot of money , but he was n't alone in that .
concerts were very expensive , especially at salzburg .
but it is far from just karajan .
yo yo ma , itzhak perlman - all sorts of people were demanding huge amounts of money .
and that 's what sent ticket prices soaring . so did his luxury lifestyle image act in his favor , or against him ? i think it humanized him .
toscanini was put on a pedestal by music lovers for a long time .
in this case it brought karajan in to a real world that people could identify with , or wished they had ...
i 'm sure the image was certainly part of the package . how do you suppose karajan will be remembered ? i think there are a lot of generalizations going around this year , and i think generalizations are always risky .
i do n't want to see him swamped , and go down in history with words like " cold " attached and " luxury " attached .
he was many things .
he was a very complex figure , and he was a great musician . interview : jennifer abramsohn send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

he was also chief conductor of the vienna symphony orchestra , and the guiding force behind the salzburg festival , where he conducted for 33 years .
karajan died july 16 , 1989 . dw-world.de spoke with james oestreich , music and dance editor at the new york times , about von karajan 's significance in music history . dw-world.de : these days you ca n't look anywhere in the german media without seeing a story or documentary or article about the life of herbert von karajan .
what 's all the fuss about ? james oestreich : he was probably the most recorded conductor of his time .
it was a time when long-playing records were really taking off , and then digital recording came in and the cd came in , and he was riding that technology through the whole thing . he recorded everything , all the time , and he re-recorded things .
he recorded the brahms symphonies three times , i believe , and the beethoven symphonies three times .
so he was simply everywhere . to boot , he was in many ways a fantastic conductor .
he had his shortcomings , as many people do .
but what he did well , he did extremely well .
and he had at that time one of the world 's greatest orchestras , if not the world 's greatest orchestra , performing for him . bildunterschrift : karajan conducts the berlin philharmonic in 1987 can you name a highlight ? his 1960s recordings of the beethoven symphonies were classic .
they were the way i , among many others , got to know the beethoven symphonies .
so they were kind of my standard , and many people 's standard for those works . what effect does a superstar conductor have on an orchestra ?
is it purely good news - more revenue and publicity - or can it also be damaging ? well it can be either .
in this case , he and the orchestra were so closely identified after so many years , and it was the coming together of two superstar names : karajan and the berlin philharmonic . ...
a music director is n't just a conductor .
he is someone who builds the orchestra in addition to conducting it .
in this case , karajan had built up this orchestra over a number of years , and made it into a sensational machine .
they played beautifully for him . to what do you attribute the ongoing interest in karajan ? well , there is the factor of permanence , for one thing .
it helps karajan and hurts people today .
it used to be that people 's vinyl lps would wear down and become unplayable .
now , digital recordings are permanent .
so there are these recordings that were the standard of their time , and they remain with us , and become standards of this time , too . it makes it difficult for people to come up with recording projects today , because all these standards are still readily available . in karajan 's case , there was also this international renown that he had .
when japan was warming to classical music - to put it mildly - 20 or 30 years ago , karajan was almost synonymous with classical music there .
so there is a built-in audience all around the world for his recordings . karajan had an international career , but was still very much a german and austrian conductor .
now an englishman , sir simon rattle , leads the berlin philharmonic . does nationality have a role in orchestras today ? it has become less relevant .
it used to be that orchestras from different countries had different sounds - the russians had very piercing brass instruments , the germans had tremendous warmth in their string sound .
as conductors travel around the world , and players go from orchestra to orchestra , and sometimes from country to country , those things have greatly diminished , in the last 30 or 40 years . that 's the way of the world .
but some of us yearn , to some extent , for the old days , when there were those characteristic sounds of orchestras .
when nobody could play german music like the germans and nobody could play french music like the french . one of the most frequently debated aspects of karajan 's life is the fact that he joined the nazi party in 1933 .
modern biographers have argued it was a political career move , rather than an ideological one .
still , he conducted for hitler and other top nazis , who revered him .
how important is this aspect of his biography ? bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : german composer and conductor richard strauss well , it is a very important aspect .
and he is far from alone in any of this .
-lsb- german conductor wilhelm -rsb- furtwaengler , of course , had many of the same problems ... and -lsb- german composer -rsb- richard strauss was the head of the nazi music chamber .

they were the way i , among many others , got to know the beethoven symphonies .
so they were kind of my standard , and many people 's standard for those works . what effect does a superstar conductor have on an orchestra ?
is it purely good news - more revenue and publicity - or can it also be damaging ? well it can be either .
in this case , he and the orchestra were so closely identified after so many years , and it was the coming together of two superstar names : karajan and the berlin philharmonic . ...
a music director is n't just a conductor .
he is someone who builds the orchestra in addition to conducting it .
in this case , karajan had built up this orchestra over a number of years , and made it into a sensational machine .
they played beautifully for him . to what do you attribute the ongoing interest in karajan ? well , there is the factor of permanence , for one thing .
it helps karajan and hurts people today .
it used to be that people 's vinyl lps would wear down and become unplayable .
now , digital recordings are permanent .
so there are these recordings that were the standard of their time , and they remain with us , and become standards of this time , too . it makes it difficult for people to come up with recording projects today , because all these standards are still readily available . in karajan 's case , there was also this international renown that he had .
when japan was warming to classical music - to put it mildly - 20 or 30 years ago , karajan was almost synonymous with classical music there .
so there is a built-in audience all around the world for his recordings . karajan had an international career , but was still very much a german and austrian conductor .
now an englishman , sir simon rattle , leads the berlin philharmonic . does nationality have a role in orchestras today ? it has become less relevant .
it used to be that orchestras from different countries had different sounds - the russians had very piercing brass instruments , the germans had tremendous warmth in their string sound .
as conductors travel around the world , and players go from orchestra to orchestra , and sometimes from country to country , those things have greatly diminished , in the last 30 or 40 years . that 's the way of the world .
but some of us yearn , to some extent , for the old days , when there were those characteristic sounds of orchestras .
when nobody could play german music like the germans and nobody could play french music like the french . one of the most frequently debated aspects of karajan 's life is the fact that he joined the nazi party in 1933 .
modern biographers have argued it was a political career move , rather than an ideological one .
still , he conducted for hitler and other top nazis , who revered him .
how important is this aspect of his biography ? bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : german composer and conductor richard strauss well , it is a very important aspect .
and he is far from alone in any of this .
-lsb- german conductor wilhelm -rsb- furtwaengler , of course , had many of the same problems ... and -lsb- german composer -rsb- richard strauss was the head of the nazi music chamber .
so karajan was far from alone . it 's a very unfortunate aspect of his biography , but it does n't mitigate his music making in any way , i do n't think .
there were a lot of bad things happening in those days , and he was part of it . if you read about karajan in the press , it is hard to find anyone neutral .
the musicians who played for him adored him , as did a large public .
yet many writers today criticize his sound as being too " cold " and technical , and take his perfectionism to task .
what 's your take ? well , i do n't find his music making cold .
it was certainly very lush , and that was problematic in some ways .
i remember a recording came out of bach and stravinsky , and for me the funny thing about that record is that karajan was out of his depth on both ends .
his big , lush bach sound is totally out of date today , now that the early music movement has brought back the smallness of sound from the baroque era .
and in the case of stravinsky - a very angular , modern sound - again , karajan 's sound is very lush and rich .
it missed the angles and it missed a lot of the music as a result . so , it was a style that did n't suit all types of music , but the music it suited , it suited very well .
there is a recording late in his life of mahler 's 9th symphony that is the opposite of cold .
its one of the great recordings ever made .
so i 'm not sure what people have in mind when they use a blanket term like cold to describe his music making . karajan was also known for leading an extravagant lifestyle , flying jets and driving race cars .
he was also criticized by some for ostensibly forcing concert ticket prices so high that only the wealthy could attend .
how did this affect the public 's view of him ? bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : karajan steps off the jet with his wife , eliette -lrb- left -rrb- and daughter isabella well , i do n't think karajan set concert prices .
karajan certainly made a lot of money and demanded a lot of money , but he was n't alone in that .
concerts were very expensive , especially at salzburg .
but it is far from just karajan .
yo yo ma , itzhak perlman - all sorts of people were demanding huge amounts of money .
and that 's what sent ticket prices soaring . so did his luxury lifestyle image act in his favor , or against him ? i think it humanized him .
toscanini was put on a pedestal by music lovers for a long time .
in this case it brought karajan in to a real world that people could identify with , or wished they had ...
i 'm sure the image was certainly part of the package . how do you suppose karajan will be remembered ? i think there are a lot of generalizations going around this year , and i think generalizations are always risky .
i do n't want to see him swamped , and go down in history with words like " cold " attached and " luxury " attached .
he was many things .
he was a very complex figure , and he was a great musician . interview : jennifer abramsohn send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

he was also chief conductor of the vienna symphony orchestra , and the guiding force behind the salzburg festival , where he conducted for 33 years .
karajan died july 16 , 1989 . dw-world.de spoke with james oestreich , music and dance editor at the new york times , about von karajan 's significance in music history . dw-world.de : these days you ca n't look anywhere in the german media without seeing a story or documentary or article about the life of herbert von karajan .
what 's all the fuss about ? james oestreich : he was probably the most recorded conductor of his time .
it was a time when long-playing records were really taking off , and then digital recording came in and the cd came in , and he was riding that technology through the whole thing . he recorded everything , all the time , and he re-recorded things .
he recorded the brahms symphonies three times , i believe , and the beethoven symphonies three times .
so he was simply everywhere . to boot , he was in many ways a fantastic conductor .
he had his shortcomings , as many people do .
but what he did well , he did extremely well .
and he had at that time one of the world 's greatest orchestras , if not the world 's greatest orchestra , performing for him . bildunterschrift : karajan conducts the berlin philharmonic in 1987 can you name a highlight ? his 1960s recordings of the beethoven symphonies were classic .

croatia and albania were formally invited to join , while macedonia was not . nato leaders were set on thursday , april 3 , to endorse a planned us missile shield for europe , a senior us official told reporters . the final summit statement would " recognize the substantive contribution to the protection of the allies " from the missile defense system to be deployed in the czech republic and poland , the official told reporters . " the united states and the czech republic are pleased to announce the completion of negotiations on a missile-defense agreement .
we plan to sign the agreement in the near future , " a statement said . french commitment the us official also said that president george w. bush had confirmed to the summit leaders that the us will be able to move some of its troops to afghanistan 's south once france sends a battalion of troops to the east of afghanistan , meeting canada 's conditions to keep troops in afghanistan until 2011 , the official said .
ottawa had said it would pull its 2,500 troops out next year if reinforcements were not forthcoming . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : sarkozy said france was willing to deploy additional troops to afghanistan french president nicolas sarkozy had said earlier france would send a battalion of troops to the east of afghanistan as part of efforts to bolster the 47,000-strong peacekeeping force . " i have decided to reinforce the french military presence with one battalion deployed in the east region , " president nicolas sarkozy said in a speech delivered at the summit , the afp news agency reported . the offer , which french military sources put at between 800 and 1,000 soldiers , came amid french plans for a return to nato 's military command next year after more than four decades of absence . " at the end of the french presidency of the european union , the moment will have come to conclude this process and to make the necessary decisions for france to take its full place in nato 's structures , " sarkozy said .
paris is set to take over the rotating eu presidency in july . staying in afghanistan as long as it takes it was good news for us president george w. bush , who on wednesday had urged nato allies to send more troops to afghanistan , stressing that the 26-nation trans-atlantic alliance could not afford to lose its battle against taliban insurgents and al qaeda militants .
as yet , only a few countries have answered his call . " whatever the cost , however difficult , we can not afford it , we must win , " he had said ahead of the summit . in paris , a sarkozy advisor said prior to the summit that the french president had set out conditions for the extra french troops in a letter to nato allies , including an increase in international aid to afghanistan . " he calls for a coordinated strategy whose goal will be a stable afghanistan , reconciled with itself and free of terrorism and drug trafficking , " the advisor said . according to reuters news agency , france is expected to seek us backing for its drive to bolster european union military structures during the second half of next year . reviewing membership for georgia and ukraine bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : canada is now to stay in afghanistan until 2011 but while the us welcomed the french offer of more troops , it met wednesday with strong opposition from paris and berlin over the question of the alliance 's eastwards enlargement - primarily out of fear of provoking moscow . bush had strongly urged skeptical european allies earlier to reward both countries for their democratic revolutions and not to allow russia , which is not a nato member , a veto over the alliance 's decisions . alliance leaders failed to agree to offer ukraine and georgia a membership action plan -lrb- map -rrb- , a gateway to eventual membership , but did confirm thursday that ukraine and georgia would one day become members of the north atlantic alliance , secretary-general jaap de hoop scheffer said . " we agree today that these countries will become member nations , " he said , adding that prospects for their membership plans would be reviewed in december . france and germany had led opposition to the move , saying it was premature when public support for nato was barely 30 percent in ukraine , and georgia did not control all its territory due to frozen conflicts with russian-backed separatists . " we have reached the conclusion that it is too early to give both countries membership action plan status , " german chancellor angela merkel had said on arrival at the summit . a senior georgian diplomat has told the bbc that the " no " to georgia will be widely seen as a victory for russia , which has long been expressing concerns over nato 's eastward expansion . croatia and albania sit at the table bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : merkel does not support nato 's eastwards push greece , meanwhile , dug its heels in over accession by macedonia , unless the country changed its name to recognize athens ' concerns regarding greece 's northern region with the same name - prompting fresh concerns about stability in the balkans .
officials said thursday that the alliance decided not to invite macedonia to join until the dispute is solved . according to a macedonian government spokesman , allied leaders meeting in bucharest had authorized their ambassadors to issue the invitation as soon as the name issue , which has festered for 17 years , is resolved . " we have agreed that an invitation to the former yugoslav republic of macedonia will be issued as soon as a mutually acceptable solution to the name issue has been reached , " nato 's secretary-general jaap de hoop scheffer told a news conference . two other balkan countries - croatia and albania - were , however , invited to join the defense alliance and sat at nato 's table for the first time thursday .
the two countries will become the 27th and 28th members of nato once the accession and ratification process has been finalized , which alliance officials hope will be done within a year . dw staff -lrb- jp -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

" today more nations stepped forward with offers that will raise that total again , and very substantially , " nato secretary general jaap de hoop scheffer said at a news conference with afghan president hamid karzai and un secretary-general ban ki-moon . scheffer did not say how many troops were offered and referred specifically only to an offer by france to send an additional battalion , about 800 troops .
but he said it satisfied a canadian demand for reinforcements in its sector in southern afghanistan . the nato-led force in afghanistan currently numbers around 47,000 soliders . aiming for self-sufficiency the document , endorsed by the 26 nato members and by the 14 non-nato countries which contribute forces to the un-mandated operation , was welcomed by karzai . " i am thankful for the strategic vision that you have offered on behalf of isaf ...
afghanistan is now better placed to take responsibility for its own security , " said karzai . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : there are currently 47,000 nato-led troops in afghanistan isaf forces have been fighting the taliban but have also been training the afghan military to do the same .
the document underlines the importance in making afghan security forces self-sufficient and taking the lead in counter-insurgency operations .
it also highlights helping the afghan government to extend good governance , reconstruction and development throughout the country . on thursday , karzai announced that as from august , afghan forces would finally be able to take over security operations in the capital kabul . france steps up earlier thursday , french president nicolas sarkozy confirmed that his country would be sending an additional 700 soldiers to the east , thus helping alleviate us and canadian concerns that isaf is overstretched . the offer came amid french plans for a return to nato 's military command next year after more than four decades of absence . isaf has grown by some 4,000 soldiers to about 47,000 in recent months , and more troops are ready to step in from poland , the czech republic and other allies . with their strategic vision document , the allies vowed to support the afghan leadership , bring together civilian and military efforts , and increase cooperation with afghanistan 's neighbors , " especially pakistan . " it also urged nato members to provide " maximum possible flexibility " in the use of their troops and to fill the current shortfalls in manning levels - two issues which have sparked bitter disagreements in the past . a deep rift had emerged within nato over the past months , with some countries , spearheaded by the united states , insisting on the need to fight the insurgents and others , like germany and italy , placing the emphasis on the civilian nature of the isaf mission . two in , three out in a major rebuff to us president george w bush who is attending the last summit of the transatlantic alliance as us president , european leaders kept georgia and ukraine waiting at nato 's doorstep thursday .
they did , however , welcome albania and croatia . bush , eager to burnish his foreign policy legacy in the waning months of a presidency tarnished by iraq , had pushed hard for georgia and ukraine to be allowed into the nato club .
scheffer said nato would offer georgia and ukraine " intensive engagement " , along with a vague promise of membership sometime down the line .
" we agree today that these countries will become members of nato , " he told reporters .
" that is quite something . "
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : german chancellor merkel and french president sarkozy opposed membership bids by ukraine and georgia the membership bids of ukraine and georgia , two former soviet republics , are strongly opposed by russia .
both germany and france , wary of alienating moscow , also resisted opening the door to georgia and ukraine . meanwhile , strong protests erupted in skopje after macedonia 's bid for an invitation was effectively vetoed by greece in a long-running dispute over macedonia 's official name . athens maintains that allowing its northern neighbor to call itself " macedonia " would imply a territorial claim on the greek province of the same name , and insists that it will not approve macedonia 's nato membership until the issue is resolved . macedonian delegates walked out of the summit in response , with foreign minister antonio milososki accusing greece of using an " irrelevant argument of ancient times . " russia urged to link missile defences with us on the thorny issue of a us missile defense shield in europe , nato leaders also asked experts to draw up options for a missile system that would complement the us anti-missile shield and provide cover to some allies left out in the cold , a statement said .
they also urged russia to consider linking up its missile defences to the us shield - despite moscow 's hostility towards it .
washington said last year it wanted to install 10 missile interceptors in poland and a radar base in the czech republic to cover us territory and that of some european allies , and wanted it operational by 2013 .
the shield is aimed at countering attacks from " rogue states " such as iran but russia fears it could pose a direct challenge to its security . dw staff -lrb- sp -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

" there were 71 guns - one for each year of his life , " said police spokesman paul kemen .
" he also had 41 cases of ammunition and five walking sticks fitted with retractable blades . "
the man did not have a permit to own weapons , and retractable blades are illegal in germany .
although guns were a special love , the collector did n't limit himself to just weapons .
according to neighbors , the man , who lived alone , collected everything from garden tools to watches .
" the house was stuffed to the rafters , " heiner hautermans , a reporter at the aachener nachrichten newspaper , told reuters .

" today more nations stepped forward with offers that will raise that total again , and very substantially , " nato secretary general jaap de hoop scheffer said at a news conference with afghan president hamid karzai and un secretary-general ban ki-moon . scheffer did not say how many troops were offered and referred specifically only to an offer by france to send an additional battalion , about 800 troops .
but he said it satisfied a canadian demand for reinforcements in its sector in southern afghanistan . the nato-led force in afghanistan currently numbers around 47,000 soliders . aiming for self-sufficiency the document , endorsed by the 26 nato members and by the 14 non-nato countries which contribute forces to the un-mandated operation , was welcomed by karzai .

the document underlines the importance in making afghan security forces self-sufficient and taking the lead in counter-insurgency operations .
it also highlights helping the afghan government to extend good governance , reconstruction and development throughout the country . on thursday , karzai announced that as from august , afghan forces would finally be able to take over security operations in the capital kabul . france steps up earlier thursday , french president nicolas sarkozy confirmed that his country would be sending an additional 700 soldiers to the east , thus helping alleviate us and canadian concerns that isaf is overstretched . the offer came amid french plans for a return to nato 's military command next year after more than four decades of absence . isaf has grown by some 4,000 soldiers to about 47,000 in recent months , and more troops are ready to step in from poland , the czech republic and other allies . with their strategic vision document , the allies vowed to support the afghan leadership , bring together civilian and military efforts , and increase cooperation with afghanistan 's neighbors , " especially pakistan . " it also urged nato members to provide " maximum possible flexibility " in the use of their troops and to fill the current shortfalls in manning levels - two issues which have sparked bitter disagreements in the past . a deep rift had emerged within nato over the past months , with some countries , spearheaded by the united states , insisting on the need to fight the insurgents and others , like germany and italy , placing the emphasis on the civilian nature of the isaf mission . two in , three out in a major rebuff to us president george w bush who is attending the last summit of the transatlantic alliance as us president , european leaders kept georgia and ukraine waiting at nato 's doorstep thursday .
they did , however , welcome albania and croatia . bush , eager to burnish his foreign policy legacy in the waning months of a presidency tarnished by iraq , had pushed hard for georgia and ukraine to be allowed into the nato club .
scheffer said nato would offer georgia and ukraine " intensive engagement " , along with a vague promise of membership sometime down the line .
" we agree today that these countries will become members of nato , " he told reporters .
" that is quite something . "
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : german chancellor merkel and french president sarkozy opposed membership bids by ukraine and georgia the membership bids of ukraine and georgia , two former soviet republics , are strongly opposed by russia .
both germany and france , wary of alienating moscow , also resisted opening the door to georgia and ukraine . meanwhile , strong protests erupted in skopje after macedonia 's bid for an invitation was effectively vetoed by greece in a long-running dispute over macedonia 's official name . athens maintains that allowing its northern neighbor to call itself " macedonia " would imply a territorial claim on the greek province of the same name , and insists that it will not approve macedonia 's nato membership until the issue is resolved . macedonian delegates walked out of the summit in response , with foreign minister antonio milososki accusing greece of using an " irrelevant argument of ancient times . " russia urged to link missile defences with us on the thorny issue of a us missile defense shield in europe , nato leaders also asked experts to draw up options for a missile system that would complement the us anti-missile shield and provide cover to some allies left out in the cold , a statement said .
they also urged russia to consider linking up its missile defences to the us shield - despite moscow 's hostility towards it .
washington said last year it wanted to install 10 missile interceptors in poland and a radar base in the czech republic to cover us territory and that of some european allies , and wanted it operational by 2013 .
the shield is aimed at countering attacks from " rogue states " such as iran but russia fears it could pose a direct challenge to its security . dw staff -lrb- sp -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de music -pipe- 03.04.2008 critic explains allure of von karajan , 100 years and counting großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : great , but flawed : herbert von karajan -lrb- 1908-1989 -rrb- ahead of the 100th anniversary of the birth of famous orchestra director and conductor herbert von karajan on april 5 , dw-world.de talked about the maestro as a cultural icon with james oestreich of the new york times . in 1955 , von karajan - classical music 's most prolific recording artist - was named director of the berlin philharmonic orchestra , and was credited with creating its clean and distinctive sound during his 35-year tenure .
he was also chief conductor of the vienna symphony orchestra , and the guiding force behind the salzburg festival , where he conducted for 33 years .
karajan died july 16 , 1989 . dw-world.de spoke with james oestreich , music and dance editor at the new york times , about von karajan 's significance in music history . dw-world.de : these days you ca n't look anywhere in the german media without seeing a story or documentary or article about the life of herbert von karajan .
what 's all the fuss about ? james oestreich : he was probably the most recorded conductor of his time .
it was a time when long-playing records were really taking off , and then digital recording came in and the cd came in , and he was riding that technology through the whole thing . he recorded everything , all the time , and he re-recorded things .
he recorded the brahms symphonies three times , i believe , and the beethoven symphonies three times .
so he was simply everywhere . to boot , he was in many ways a fantastic conductor .
he had his shortcomings , as many people do .
but what he did well , he did extremely well .
and he had at that time one of the world 's greatest orchestras , if not the world 's greatest orchestra , performing for him . bildunterschrift : karajan conducts the berlin philharmonic in 1987 can you name a highlight ? his 1960s recordings of the beethoven symphonies were classic .
they were the way i , among many others , got to know the beethoven symphonies .
so they were kind of my standard , and many people 's standard for those works . what effect does a superstar conductor have on an orchestra ?
is it purely good news - more revenue and publicity - or can it also be damaging ? well it can be either .
in this case , he and the orchestra were so closely identified after so many years , and it was the coming together of two superstar names : karajan and the berlin philharmonic . ...
a music director is n't just a conductor .
he is someone who builds the orchestra in addition to conducting it .
in this case , karajan had built up this orchestra over a number of years , and made it into a sensational machine .
they played beautifully for him . to what do you attribute the ongoing interest in karajan ? well , there is the factor of permanence , for one thing .
it helps karajan and hurts people today .
it used to be that people 's vinyl lps would wear down and become unplayable .
now , digital recordings are permanent .
so there are these recordings that were the standard of their time , and they remain with us , and become standards of this time , too . it makes it difficult for people to come up with recording projects today , because all these standards are still readily available . in karajan 's case , there was also this international renown that he had .
when japan was warming to classical music - to put it mildly - 20 or 30 years ago , karajan was almost synonymous with classical music there .
so there is a built-in audience all around the world for his recordings . karajan had an international career , but was still very much a german and austrian conductor .
now an englishman , sir simon rattle , leads the berlin philharmonic . does nationality have a role in orchestras today ? it has become less relevant .
it used to be that orchestras from different countries had different sounds - the russians had very piercing brass instruments , the germans had tremendous warmth in their string sound .
as conductors travel around the world , and players go from orchestra to orchestra , and sometimes from country to country , those things have greatly diminished , in the last 30 or 40 years . that 's the way of the world .
but some of us yearn , to some extent , for the old days , when there were those characteristic sounds of orchestras .
when nobody could play german music like the germans and nobody could play french music like the french . one of the most frequently debated aspects of karajan 's life is the fact that he joined the nazi party in 1933 .
modern biographers have argued it was a political career move , rather than an ideological one .
still , he conducted for hitler and other top nazis , who revered him .
how important is this aspect of his biography ? bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : german composer and conductor richard strauss well , it is a very important aspect .
and he is far from alone in any of this .
-lsb- german conductor wilhelm -rsb- furtwaengler , of course , had many of the same problems ... and -lsb- german composer -rsb- richard strauss was the head of the nazi music chamber .
so karajan was far from alone . it 's a very unfortunate aspect of his biography , but it does n't mitigate his music making in any way , i do n't think .
there were a lot of bad things happening in those days , and he was part of it . if you read about karajan in the press , it is hard to find anyone neutral .
the musicians who played for him adored him , as did a large public .
yet many writers today criticize his sound as being too " cold " and technical , and take his perfectionism to task .
what 's your take ? well , i do n't find his music making cold .
it was certainly very lush , and that was problematic in some ways .
i remember a recording came out of bach and stravinsky , and for me the funny thing about that record is that karajan was out of his depth on both ends .
his big , lush bach sound is totally out of date today , now that the early music movement has brought back the smallness of sound from the baroque era .
and in the case of stravinsky - a very angular , modern sound - again , karajan 's sound is very lush and rich .
it missed the angles and it missed a lot of the music as a result . so , it was a style that did n't suit all types of music , but the music it suited , it suited very well .
there is a recording late in his life of mahler 's 9th symphony that is the opposite of cold .
its one of the great recordings ever made .
so i 'm not sure what people have in mind when they use a blanket term like cold to describe his music making . karajan was also known for leading an extravagant lifestyle , flying jets and driving race cars .
he was also criticized by some for ostensibly forcing concert ticket prices so high that only the wealthy could attend .
how did this affect the public 's view of him ? bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : karajan steps off the jet with his wife , eliette -lrb- left -rrb- and daughter isabella well , i do n't think karajan set concert prices .
karajan certainly made a lot of money and demanded a lot of money , but he was n't alone in that .
concerts were very expensive , especially at salzburg .
but it is far from just karajan .
yo yo ma , itzhak perlman - all sorts of people were demanding huge amounts of money .
and that 's what sent ticket prices soaring . so did his luxury lifestyle image act in his favor , or against him ? i think it humanized him .
toscanini was put on a pedestal by music lovers for a long time .
in this case it brought karajan in to a real world that people could identify with , or wished they had ...
i 'm sure the image was certainly part of the package . how do you suppose karajan will be remembered ? i think there are a lot of generalizations going around this year , and i think generalizations are always risky .
i do n't want to see him swamped , and go down in history with words like " cold " attached and " luxury " attached .
he was many things .
he was a very complex figure , and he was a great musician . interview : jennifer abramsohn send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

" today more nations stepped forward with offers that will raise that total again , and very substantially , " nato secretary general jaap de hoop scheffer said at a news conference with afghan president hamid karzai and un secretary-general ban ki-moon . scheffer did not say how many troops were offered and referred specifically only to an offer by france to send an additional battalion , about 800 troops .
but he said it satisfied a canadian demand for reinforcements in its sector in southern afghanistan . the nato-led force in afghanistan currently numbers around 47,000 soliders . aiming for self-sufficiency the document , endorsed by the 26 nato members and by the 14 non-nato countries which contribute forces to the un-mandated operation , was welcomed by karzai .

the us says the french move will free up some of its troops to move to southern afghanistan , where canada had demanded nato reinforcements be sent .
the spokesman also said there was agreement at the summit that albania and croatia be invited to join nato .
but he said he did not expect speedy moves to admit ukraine and georgia .
french president nicolas sarkozy last week told the british parliament that france would send extra troops to afghanistan .
new members however , wednesday 's statement at the bucharest conference is the first confirmation that the move frees up enough us troops in the south to keep the canadian deployment onboard .
canada 's parliament voted last month to extend its military mission in volatile southern afghanistan to 2011 - but only if its allies sent reinforcements .
earlier , us president george w bush said he supported the admission of albania , croatia and macedonia .
he also called for membership action plans -lrb- map -rrb- to be extended to the former soviet republics of ukraine and georgia , despite vehement russian opposition .
on the first evening of the summit , nato spokesman james appathurai said there was a consensus that albania and croatia should be invited to begin accession talks .
" there is also a unanimous view within the alliance that the third country , the former yugoslav republic of macedonia , should as soon as possible be offered the opportunity to begin accession talks , " he said .
' clear path ' however , agreement to admit macedonia is being delayed by greece 's objections to the country 's name .
macedonia is also the name of a province in northern greece , and athens fears that this could imply a claim on its territory .
on ukraine and georgia , mr appathurai said : " i would be happy to be proved wrong but i do not expect map for georgia and ukraine . "
mr bush said on wednesday that georgia and ukraine should be offered " a clear path " towards the goal of nato membership .
but germany 's chancellor angela merkel said on arriving for the summit : " we have reached the conclusion that it is too early to give both countries map status . "
french prime minister francois fillon said of ukrainian and georgian membership : " we think that it is not the correct response to the balance of power in europe . "

the us says the french move will free up some of its troops to move to southern afghanistan , where canada had demanded nato reinforcements be sent .
the spokesman also said there was agreement at the summit that albania and croatia be invited to join nato .
but he said he did not expect speedy moves to admit ukraine and georgia .
french president nicolas sarkozy last week told the british parliament that france would send extra troops to afghanistan .
new members however , wednesday 's statement at the bucharest conference is the first confirmation that the move frees up enough us troops in the south to keep the canadian deployment onboard .
canada 's parliament voted last month to extend its military mission in volatile southern afghanistan to 2011 - but only if its allies sent reinforcements .
earlier , us president george w bush said he supported the admission of albania , croatia and macedonia .
he also called for membership action plans -lrb- map -rrb- to be extended to the former soviet republics of ukraine and georgia , despite vehement russian opposition .
on the first evening of the summit , nato spokesman james appathurai said there was a consensus that albania and croatia should be invited to begin accession talks .
" there is also a unanimous view within the alliance that the third country , the former yugoslav republic of macedonia , should as soon as possible be offered the opportunity to begin accession talks , " he said .
' clear path ' however , agreement to admit macedonia is being delayed by greece 's objections to the country 's name .
macedonia is also the name of a province in northern greece , and athens fears that this could imply a claim on its territory .
on ukraine and georgia , mr appathurai said : " i would be happy to be proved wrong but i do not expect map for georgia and ukraine . "
mr bush said on wednesday that georgia and ukraine should be offered " a clear path " towards the goal of nato membership .
but germany 's chancellor angela merkel said on arriving for the summit : " we have reached the conclusion that it is too early to give both countries map status . "
french prime minister francois fillon said of ukrainian and georgian membership : " we think that it is not the correct response to the balance of power in europe . "

however , figures recently released by hm revenue & customs -lrb- hmrc -rrb- , in its own performance report , show that the yield obtained from all of its counter evasion work has increased dramatically over the last fifteen years .
the money gleaned from reluctant taxpayers , both personal and corporate , has risen from £ 1.13bn in 1991-92 to a staggering £ 9.17bn in 2006-07 .
the money has come from a wide range of sources : from individuals and companies who had simply failed to fill in their forms , to investigations of outright tax dodgers .
the £ 400m in extra tax that will be coming from people who have been hiding money in offshore bank accounts does not feature in the figures yet .
but in 2006-07 the revenue gleaned an extra £ 834m from tighter scrutiny of corporate tax returns and more than £ 1bn from probing self-assessed tax returns .
this money was obtained by staff in the revenue 's routine network offices .
even more spectacular has the been the haul of cash gained by staff in the various specialist offices , who work on bigger examples of deliberate fraud .
their work gained the revenue an extra £ 3bn in corporation tax from employers , as well as £ 2.6bn dug up by the sort of specialist teams that have now been put to work on the offshore bank accounts .
value for money all these figures reflect the greater resources deployed by the revenue in its drive to counter fraud and evasion and also demonstrate an increase in the investigatory skills of the staff involved . "
the scale of tax evasion is continuing apparently unabated and on a massive scale " in the 10 years since the introduction of " self-assessment " , the revenue has been retraining its staff to develop their investigatory skills , rather than dealing with compliance and the preparation of assessments , as was previously the case .
there seems little room for doubt that the strategy has proven successful , given the nine-fold increase in the amount of tax recovered .
the published hmrc performance report shows that the average cost of collection is just over 1p for every pound of tax recovered , which represents a very good " return " on the money spent .
sadly , that is far from the end of the story .
the published statistics also suggest that the scale of tax evasion is continuing apparently unabated and on a massive scale .
prosecutions despite the widespread evidence of serious fraud , the rate at which the revenue has initiated prosecutions for false business accounts and tax returns has halved over the last 15 years .
in 1991-92 there were 134 convictions , falling to a low of 55 in 1995-96 .
this has marginally increased to 70 convictions in 2006-07 and demonstrates a clear reluctance on the part of the authorities to take tax evaders to court .
there have been a number of very high-profile cases over the years , however .
in 1987 , the case against lester piggott culminated in the former british champion jockey receiving a three-year term of imprisonment after pleading guilty to serious tax fraud charges .
one of the aggravating features had been that he had undergone two previous tax investigations , at the conclusion of which he had signed false statements of assets .
in their sights the " innocent until proven guilty " principle goes by the board when a prosecution is likely . "
in extreme cases , the revenue may resort to the infamous " dawn raid " " the tax inspector investigating the case is already convinced that the subject of the investigation has committed serious fraud .
the only question in his or her mind is whether the case is one of the majority , which is suitable for pecuniary settlement , or alternatively one of the very few which merits criminal prosecution .
the revenue has access to a phenomenal amount of information and is able to compare similar businesses operating in the same area on a product-by-product basis .
this in itself can be sufficient to provoke an investigation and the tax inspector will invite business owners to substantiate why their business is not making the same profit as comparable businesses in the same area .
it is , of course , notoriously difficult to prove a negative and can be extremely costly to do so .
there are many examples of business men and women simply paying the tax on the grounds that they can not afford the costs associated with defending themselves .
dawn raids in extreme cases , the revenue may resort to the infamous " dawn raid " where the taxpayer may be the subject of a raid , probably both at his home and at the business premises .
the revenue would almost certainly mount simultaneous raids on the taxpayer 's professional advisors .
that would be the case , even if neither set of advisors is suspected of wrongdoing .
in one case , a number of years ago , when a senior tax inspector operating in the revenue 's special compliance office was himself suspected of fraud , the revenue 's elite enquiry branch officers staged a dawn raid on the revenue 's special office just across the road .
effectively , one revenue department carried out a dawn raid on another revenue department .
computer databases there is no doubt that the revenue is becoming much more skilful in tackling tax evasion and is now using highly-developed computer programs to assist it in the process .
unfortunately , a great many people are operating businesses and failing to declare anything to the revenue .
this is particularly true of internet traders .
there is nothing wrong with getting rid of the odd unwanted item on sites such as ebay .
however , it is quite obvious that a number of individuals are actually trading through these websites and clearly have a stock of items for sale at a profit which is then hidden in an offshore bank account .
as time goes by and techniques improve , especially with the aid of sophisticated computer programmes , the crackdown will be felt in these areas also . "

however , figures recently released by hm revenue & customs -lrb- hmrc -rrb- , in its own performance report , show that the yield obtained from all of its counter evasion work has increased dramatically over the last fifteen years .
the money gleaned from reluctant taxpayers , both personal and corporate , has risen from £ 1.13bn in 1991-92 to a staggering £ 9.17bn in 2006-07 .
the money has come from a wide range of sources : from individuals and companies who had simply failed to fill in their forms , to investigations of outright tax dodgers .
the £ 400m in extra tax that will be coming from people who have been hiding money in offshore bank accounts does not feature in the figures yet .
but in 2006-07 the revenue gleaned an extra £ 834m from tighter scrutiny of corporate tax returns and more than £ 1bn from probing self-assessed tax returns .
this money was obtained by staff in the revenue 's routine network offices .
even more spectacular has the been the haul of cash gained by staff in the various specialist offices , who work on bigger examples of deliberate fraud .
their work gained the revenue an extra £ 3bn in corporation tax from employers , as well as £ 2.6bn dug up by the sort of specialist teams that have now been put to work on the offshore bank accounts .
value for money all these figures reflect the greater resources deployed by the revenue in its drive to counter fraud and evasion and also demonstrate an increase in the investigatory skills of the staff involved .
the scale of tax evasion is continuing apparently unabated and on a massive scale in the 10 years since the introduction of " self-assessment " , the revenue has been retraining its staff to develop their investigatory skills , rather than dealing with compliance and the preparation of assessments , as was previously the case .
there seems little room for doubt that the strategy has proven successful , given the nine-fold increase in the amount of tax recovered .
the published hmrc performance report shows that the average cost of collection is just over 1p for every pound of tax recovered , which represents a very good " return " on the money spent .
sadly , that is far from the end of the story .
the published statistics also suggest that the scale of tax evasion is continuing apparently unabated and on a massive scale .
prosecutions despite the widespread evidence of serious fraud , the rate at which the revenue has initiated prosecutions for false business accounts and tax returns has halved over the last 15 years .
laurence ford received 6 years in jail in 2006 for a vat fraud in 1991-92 there were 134 convictions , falling to a low of 55 in 1995-96 .
this has marginally increased to 70 convictions in 2006-07 and demonstrates a clear reluctance on the part of the authorities to take tax evaders to court .
there have been a number of very high-profile cases over the years , however .
in 1987 , the case against lester piggott culminated in the former british champion jockey receiving a three-year term of imprisonment after pleading guilty to serious tax fraud charges .
one of the aggravating features had been that he had undergone two previous tax investigations , at the conclusion of which he had signed false statements of assets .
in their sights the " innocent until proven guilty " principle goes by the board when a prosecution is likely .
in extreme cases , the revenue may resort to the infamous " dawn raid " the tax inspector investigating the case is already convinced that the subject of the investigation has committed serious fraud .
the only question in his or her mind is whether the case is one of the majority , which is suitable for pecuniary settlement , or alternatively one of the very few which merits criminal prosecution .
the revenue has access to a phenomenal amount of information and is able to compare similar businesses operating in the same area on a product-by-product basis .
this in itself can be sufficient to provoke an investigation and the tax inspector will invite business owners to substantiate why their business is not making the same profit as comparable businesses in the same area .
it is , of course , notoriously difficult to prove a negative and can be extremely costly to do so .
there are many examples of business men and women simply paying the tax on the grounds that they can not afford the costs associated with defending themselves .
dawn raids in extreme cases , the revenue may resort to the infamous " dawn raid " where the taxpayer may be the subject of a raid , probably both at his home and at the business premises .
the revenue would almost certainly mount simultaneous raids on the taxpayer 's professional advisors .
that would be the case , even if neither set of advisors is suspected of wrongdoing .
in one case , a number of years ago , when a senior tax inspector operating in the revenue 's special compliance office was himself suspected of fraud , the revenue 's elite enquiry branch officers staged a dawn raid on the revenue 's special office just across the road .
effectively , one revenue department carried out a dawn raid on another revenue department .
computer databases there is no doubt that the revenue is becoming much more skilful in tackling tax evasion and is now using highly-developed computer programs to assist it in the process .
unfortunately , a great many people are operating businesses and failing to declare anything to the revenue .
this is particularly true of internet traders .
there is nothing wrong with getting rid of the odd unwanted item on sites such as ebay .
however , it is quite obvious that a number of individuals are actually trading through these websites and clearly have a stock of items for sale at a profit which is then hidden in an offshore bank account .
as time goes by and techniques improve , especially with the aid of sophisticated computer programmes , the crackdown will be felt in these areas also .

on wednesday , uk-based rights group amnesty international accused beijing of carrying out a " wave of repression " ahead of the olympic games .

" hu spread malicious rumours , libel and instigation in an attempt to subvert the state 's political and socialist systems , " xinhua said , quoting the court ruling .
olympic claims mr hu 's conviction comes only two weeks after another activist , yang chunlin , was jailed on similar charges .
on wednesday , uk-based rights group amnesty international accused beijing of carrying out a " wave of repression " ahead of the olympic games .
the authorities were targeting those who criticised the government in a bid to present a stable and harmonious image when the games began in august , the group said .
in response , the china society for human rights studies accused amnesty of bias and of ignoring positive developments in the country 's human rights record .
last month , chinese premier wen jiabao was asked about hu jia 's case .
he said it should be handled according to the law .
" as for critics ' view that china is trying to increase its efforts to arrest dissidents ahead the olympic games , i think all these accusations are unfounded , " he said .

hu jia , 34 , was convicted of " inciting subversion of state power and the socialist system " , his lawyer said .
he has long campaigned for the environment , religious freedom and for the rights of people with hiv and aids .
his sentence comes a day after a rights group accused china of a campaign to silence dissent ahead of the olympics .
the us was " dismayed " by the verdict , a spokeswoman for the us embassy in beijing said , while the european union called for mr hu 's immediate release .
" we said very clearly before the trial that he should not have been detained in the first place and that he should be released and this remains our position , " beijing spokesman william fingleton told the french news agency afp .
internet articles hu jia 's case has attracted a great deal of international attention , both from rights groups and western diplomats .

" as lawyers we propose that hu jia appeal this sentence but it is up to him and we will wait for his decision , " mr li said .
" we have not had a chance to exchange ideas with him so far . "

touch my body , from her new album e = mc2 , is the new number one on the billboard hot 100 chart , and has also topped its download chart .
the achievement means she has now surpassed elvis presley 's 17 number ones .
the beatles are in front on 20 .
" i 'm just feeling really happy and grateful , " the 38-year-old performer told the associated press .
but she played down comparisons with presley and the beatles .
" i really can never put myself in the category of people who have not only revolutionised music but also changed the world , that 's a completely different era and time , " she said .
mariah carey 's number ones " in terms of my ethnicity , always feeling like an outsider , always feeling different ... for me it 's about saying , ' thank you lord , for giving me the faith to believe in myself when other people had written me off . "
but she added that she was now at the most enjoyable point of her career , and trying to set sales records was not a priority for her .
" i 've gone through enough of my life worrying about that kind of thing , " she said .
despite her us chart success , carey has only reached the uk 's top spot on two occasions - both times with cover versions .
the first was without you , originally recorded by badfinger and made popular by harry nilsson , which hit number one in 1994 .
six years later , she topped the chart with phil collins 's against all odds , which she sang with irish balladeers westlife .
madonna also made us chart history this week , when her track 4 minutes , featuring justin timberlake , became her 37th top 10 hit , breaking another record set by elvis presley .

but his lawyer , li fangping , was not happy .
" although he 's only been sentenced to three-and-a-half years , i still can not accept this judgement , " he told reporters outside the beijing courthouse .
before he heard the verdict , mr li was even blunter .
" as a lawyer , i think hu jia is innocent and should be released . "
hu jia was sent to prison for what many other people would not even consider a crime - he was convicted for writing five articles and giving two interviews .
the 34-year-old has long sought to publicise what he believes are injustices in china , concerning the environment , hiv / aids and human rights .
beijing 's first intermediate people 's court interpreted these acts as an attempt to subvert " the state 's political and socialist systems " .
human rights organisations see it differently - they believe the chinese authorities put the campaigner in prison to silence him ahead of the olympic games .
campaigners gather hu jia has become perhaps china 's most prominent activist , and journalists from all over the world waited outside the court to hear his sentence .
reporters were not allowed inside the court to hear it read out for themselves .
several other campaigners , mostly people trying to highlight their own particular grievances , had also gathered outside the court to protest .
one woman wanted justice for her son , claiming he had been beaten to death .
but most people had come to hear the judgement for mr hu .
about half an hour after entering the court to hear the sentence , his lawyer mr li came out to tell journalists what it was .
as well as being sent to prison , mr hu was deprived of political rights for one year .
the lawyer said his client and his family would decide later whether or not to appeal .
under chinese law , they have 10 days to make up their minds .
a little later , hu jia 's wife , zeng jinyan , also emerged from the court after attending the hearing with other family members .
holding back tears , she said she had not been allowed to see her husband .
she added that her husband had a liver complaint , which had been exacerbated by his time in detention .
" there were tiring , endless questions without sleep , " she said .
" when i saw him last , the most important thing i said to him was ' take good care of your health ' . "
ms zeng , who herself is a well-known rights campaigner , added that her husband showed little emotion when the sentence was announced .
hardening stance in an article published by xinhua , china 's state-run news agency , the authorities laid out their case against mr hu .

" as a lawyer , i think hu jia is innocent and should be released . "
hu jia was sent to prison for what many other people would not even consider a crime - he was convicted for writing five articles and giving two interviews .

mr hu 's wife said he had been subjected to " endless questions " but his lawyer , li fangping , was not happy .
" although he 's only been sentenced to three-and-a-half years , i still can not accept this judgement , " he told reporters outside the beijing courthouse .
before he heard the verdict , mr li was even blunter .
" as a lawyer , i think hu jia is innocent and should be released . "
hu jia was sent to prison for what many other people would not even consider a crime - he was convicted for writing five articles and giving two interviews .
the 34-year-old has long sought to publicise what he believes are injustices in china , concerning the environment , hiv / aids and human rights .
beijing 's first intermediate people 's court interpreted these acts as an attempt to subvert " the state 's political and socialist systems " .
human rights organisations see it differently - they believe the chinese authorities put the campaigner in prison to silence him ahead of the olympic games .
campaigners gather hu jia has become perhaps china 's most prominent activist , and journalists from all over the world waited outside the court to hear his sentence .
reporters were not allowed inside the court to hear it read out for themselves .
several other campaigners , mostly people trying to highlight their own particular grievances , had also gathered outside the court to protest .
petitioners gathered at the court to push their causes one woman wanted justice for her son , claiming he had been beaten to death .
but most people had come to hear the judgement for mr hu .
about half an hour after entering the court to hear the sentence , his lawyer mr li came out to tell journalists what it was .
as well as being sent to prison , mr hu was deprived of political rights for one year .
the lawyer said his client and his family would decide later whether or not to appeal .
under chinese law , they have 10 days to make up their minds .
a little later , hu jia 's wife , zeng jinyan , also emerged from the court after attending the hearing with other family members .
holding back tears , she said she had not been allowed to see her husband .
she added that her husband had a liver complaint , which had been exacerbated by his time in detention .
" there were tiring , endless questions without sleep , " she said .
" when i saw him last , the most important thing i said to him was ' take good care of your health ' . "
ms zeng , who herself is a well-known rights campaigner , added that her husband showed little emotion when the sentence was announced .
hardening stance in an article published by xinhua , china 's state-run news agency , the authorities laid out their case against mr hu .
mr hu 's jailing has caused an international outcry the article said mr hu wrote articles criticising the chinese political system , and accepted interviews from foreign journalists .
" hu spread malicious rumours , libel and instigation in an attempt to subvert the state 's political and socialist systems , " it said .
the xinhua article also claimed mr hu had been given a lenient sentence because he had confessed to his crimes .
but nicholas bequelin , of us-based human rights watch , said mr hu 's arrest , conviction and sentence was politically motivated .
" the jailing of china 's leading human rights activist reflects a further hardening of beijing 's stance towards dissent in the lead up to the games , " he said .
he also criticised the international olympic committee , which is currently meeting in beijing , for not speaking out about the human rights situation in china .
