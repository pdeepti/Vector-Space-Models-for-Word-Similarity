program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de food and drink -pipe- 22.01.2008 parmalat trial could open door for civil proceedings großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the shares might have crashed but the company kept on milking when things began to go sour at italian dairy company parmalat the company sued 45 italian and international banks .
on jan .
22 , a criminal trial began against four international banks charged with stock manipulation . parmalat was seen as a successful italian dairy company - until 2003 when it became a sensational fraud case .
behind the bright colored milk cartons - and even a soccer team - a financial black hole was growing .
as early as 1993 , parmalat officials allegedly began to cook the books .
on dec .
24 , 2003 , shareholders and bond holders did n't quite receive the christmas present they were after .
parmalat shares lost 97 percent and was de-listed from the stock exchange .
the chief executive officer and five former parmalat executives were arrested and a fraud investigation began .
in 2004 , auditors determined that parmalat had debts of around 14.3 billion euros -lrb- $ 20.9 billion -rrb- . two years after the spills were mopped up , a new parmalat emerged .
investors were n't buying into the milk or cream business , but the chance to recoup losses through a settlement with the banks and accounting firms accused of helping conceal its dire financial condition .
in the meantime , multiple legal skirmishes have been played out in courtrooms in parma and milan . on tuesday , jan .
22 , proceedings began in milan against four large international banks - citigroup , deutsche bank , morgan stanley and ubs - charged with stock manipulation of parmalat bonds sold in 2003 . if the banks are found guilty the banks could face fines of up to 5 million euros and have their profits seized .
a guilty ruling could also open the door to civil proceedings by investors . dw-world.de talked to beppe scienza , a lecturer in financial mathematics at the university of turin and author of the books " the cheated investors " and " stocks , policies and parmalat - what 's the worst ? "
he has been following the financial market for over 30 years . dw-world.de : parmalat was not a small or weak company - it was the eighth largest company in italy and a global brand .
how is it that the so-called coca cola of milk production began to go sour ? beppe scienza : the interesting thing about parmalat is that at the industrial level nothing changed .
the company continued to produce and so the industrial aspect remained untouched .
as for exactly how this happened , no one knows and no one has studied all the factors that led to the collapse .
however , these things often begin because someone is trying to cover up some kind of mistake or some kind of loss .
perhaps they invent an excuse to cover up an imbalance .
no one knows why this was done or where the money has ended up . it 's interesting to note that the parmalat dividends were n't very high and this , among other things , gave faith to investors .
when a dividend is very high there is usually a high risk , but when the dividend is , as in the case of parmalat , only a little high then it gives the idea that the company could be in difficulty , but it does n't indicate that it 's going to collapse . what could have been the role played by international banks , like deutsche bank , in the parmalat scandal ? i do n't think it was really that much different from the role of the italian banks .
they helped to sell shares .
some employee of the bank was probably corrupt , but the banks themselves must have known something .
like the italian banks , they were creditors so they had to replace the money . how important is what happens in the courtroom in milan over the next few months ? in order to write an honest history of what happened with parmalat , it is important because we might be able to understand the dynamics of what caused this to happen .
for the bond holders it could be important if there is a guilty verdict , because then it opens the door for civil cases to obtain compensation . will investors ever recover everything that they lost ? on a large scale : no .
a majority of investors wo n't recover what they lost .
in these cases where there 's a collapse and the money disappears , it 's better not to have the illusion that you will recover everything . what impact has the parmalat scandal had on the food industry in europe ? i think that it has little impact on the food industry .
it was n't really a bankruptcy in the sense that the company was closed down and assets sold off at auction .
the company continued production so from the industry point of view nothing changed . so it was only the investors who found themselves burnt by this scandal ? yes , and the creditors and the banks , which lost a big slice of their money . is the parmalat scandal the worst thing that has happened to italian investors ? the collapse of parmalat was used by the banks to convince individuals not to not buy shares or bonds but put their money into managed investment funds .
it 's true that investors lost a lot of money with parmalat , but if we look at managed investment funds then we discover that the loss to investors is around 20 billion euros .
now , the loss in italy from the parmalat scandal is around 3 billion euros .
unfortunately , the worst things that happen to italian investors are not these company collapses , but rather the mismanagement of managed investment funds . how new is the new parmalat - has anything changed ? the company has maintained the name and the production facilities , but for an investor the past story of parmalat has nothing to do with buying the stock today since all of the company 's debts were wiped out before its re-listing . interview : stephanie raison send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

on jan .
22 , a criminal trial began against four international banks charged with stock manipulation . parmalat was seen as a successful italian dairy company - until 2003 when it became a sensational fraud case .
behind the bright colored milk cartons - and even a soccer team - a financial black hole was growing .
as early as 1993 , parmalat officials allegedly began to cook the books .
on dec .
24 , 2003 , shareholders and bond holders did n't quite receive the christmas present they were after .
parmalat shares lost 97 percent and was de-listed from the stock exchange .
the chief executive officer and five former parmalat executives were arrested and a fraud investigation began .
in 2004 , auditors determined that parmalat had debts of around 14.3 billion euros -lrb- $ 20.9 billion -rrb- . two years after the spills were mopped up , a new parmalat emerged .
investors were n't buying into the milk or cream business , but the chance to recoup losses through a settlement with the banks and accounting firms accused of helping conceal its dire financial condition .
in the meantime , multiple legal skirmishes have been played out in courtrooms in parma and milan . on tuesday , jan .
22 , proceedings began in milan against four large international banks - citigroup , deutsche bank , morgan stanley and ubs - charged with stock manipulation of parmalat bonds sold in 2003 . if the banks are found guilty the banks could face fines of up to 5 million euros and have their profits seized .
a guilty ruling could also open the door to civil proceedings by investors . dw-world.de talked to beppe scienza , a lecturer in financial mathematics at the university of turin and author of the books " the cheated investors " and " stocks , policies and parmalat - what 's the worst ? "
he has been following the financial market for over 30 years . dw-world.de : parmalat was not a small or weak company - it was the eighth largest company in italy and a global brand .
how is it that the so-called coca cola of milk production began to go sour ? beppe scienza : the interesting thing about parmalat is that at the industrial level nothing changed .
the company continued to produce and so the industrial aspect remained untouched .
as for exactly how this happened , no one knows and no one has studied all the factors that led to the collapse .
however , these things often begin because someone is trying to cover up some kind of mistake or some kind of loss .
perhaps they invent an excuse to cover up an imbalance .
no one knows why this was done or where the money has ended up . it 's interesting to note that the parmalat dividends were n't very high and this , among other things , gave faith to investors .
when a dividend is very high there is usually a high risk , but when the dividend is , as in the case of parmalat , only a little high then it gives the idea that the company could be in difficulty , but it does n't indicate that it 's going to collapse . what could have been the role played by international banks , like deutsche bank , in the parmalat scandal ? i do n't think it was really that much different from the role of the italian banks .
they helped to sell shares .
some employee of the bank was probably corrupt , but the banks themselves must have known something .
like the italian banks , they were creditors so they had to replace the money . how important is what happens in the courtroom in milan over the next few months ? in order to write an honest history of what happened with parmalat , it is important because we might be able to understand the dynamics of what caused this to happen .
for the bond holders it could be important if there is a guilty verdict , because then it opens the door for civil cases to obtain compensation . will investors ever recover everything that they lost ? on a large scale : no .
a majority of investors wo n't recover what they lost .
in these cases where there 's a collapse and the money disappears , it 's better not to have the illusion that you will recover everything . what impact has the parmalat scandal had on the food industry in europe ? i think that it has little impact on the food industry .
it was n't really a bankruptcy in the sense that the company was closed down and assets sold off at auction .
the company continued production so from the industry point of view nothing changed . so it was only the investors who found themselves burnt by this scandal ? yes , and the creditors and the banks , which lost a big slice of their money . is the parmalat scandal the worst thing that has happened to italian investors ? the collapse of parmalat was used by the banks to convince individuals not to not buy shares or bonds but put their money into managed investment funds .
it 's true that investors lost a lot of money with parmalat , but if we look at managed investment funds then we discover that the loss to investors is around 20 billion euros .
now , the loss in italy from the parmalat scandal is around 3 billion euros .
unfortunately , the worst things that happen to italian investors are not these company collapses , but rather the mismanagement of managed investment funds . how new is the new parmalat - has anything changed ? the company has maintained the name and the production facilities , but for an investor the past story of parmalat has nothing to do with buying the stock today since all of the company 's debts were wiped out before its re-listing . interview : stephanie raison send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

how is it that the so-called coca cola of milk production began to go sour ? beppe scienza : the interesting thing about parmalat is that at the industrial level nothing changed .
the company continued to produce and so the industrial aspect remained untouched .
as for exactly how this happened , no one knows and no one has studied all the factors that led to the collapse .
however , these things often begin because someone is trying to cover up some kind of mistake or some kind of loss .
perhaps they invent an excuse to cover up an imbalance .
no one knows why this was done or where the money has ended up . it 's interesting to note that the parmalat dividends were n't very high and this , among other things , gave faith to investors .
when a dividend is very high there is usually a high risk , but when the dividend is , as in the case of parmalat , only a little high then it gives the idea that the company could be in difficulty , but it does n't indicate that it 's going to collapse . what could have been the role played by international banks , like deutsche bank , in the parmalat scandal ? i do n't think it was really that much different from the role of the italian banks .
they helped to sell shares .
some employee of the bank was probably corrupt , but the banks themselves must have known something .
like the italian banks , they were creditors so they had to replace the money . how important is what happens in the courtroom in milan over the next few months ? in order to write an honest history of what happened with parmalat , it is important because we might be able to understand the dynamics of what caused this to happen .
for the bond holders it could be important if there is a guilty verdict , because then it opens the door for civil cases to obtain compensation . will investors ever recover everything that they lost ? on a large scale : no .
a majority of investors wo n't recover what they lost .
in these cases where there 's a collapse and the money disappears , it 's better not to have the illusion that you will recover everything . what impact has the parmalat scandal had on the food industry in europe ? i think that it has little impact on the food industry .
it was n't really a bankruptcy in the sense that the company was closed down and assets sold off at auction .
the company continued production so from the industry point of view nothing changed . so it was only the investors who found themselves burnt by this scandal ? yes , and the creditors and the banks , which lost a big slice of their money . is the parmalat scandal the worst thing that has happened to italian investors ? the collapse of parmalat was used by the banks to convince individuals not to not buy shares or bonds but put their money into managed investment funds .
it 's true that investors lost a lot of money with parmalat , but if we look at managed investment funds then we discover that the loss to investors is around 20 billion euros .
now , the loss in italy from the parmalat scandal is around 3 billion euros .
unfortunately , the worst things that happen to italian investors are not these company collapses , but rather the mismanagement of managed investment funds . how new is the new parmalat - has anything changed ? the company has maintained the name and the production facilities , but for an investor the past story of parmalat has nothing to do with buying the stock today since all of the company 's debts were wiped out before its re-listing . interview : stephanie raison send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

" the church of scientology , of which cruise is a leading member , reacted furiously to a newspaper interview by german historian guido knopp in which he drew parallels between the hollywood star and nazi propaganda minister joseph goebbels . " bild am sonntag is grossly irresponsible for publishing horrendous and disgraceful claims about mr. cruise , " the church 's public affairs director , karin pouw said , referring to the german mass-selling tabloid which published the interview . pouw said the footage , which surfaced on the youtube web site this week , was a pirated , edited video taken from a three-hour event . " bild am sonntag has disgracefully misinterpreted mr cruise 's remarks , " pouw said .
" he was giving an acceptance speech for a humanitarian award bestowed in honor of his efforts for global literacy .
in doing so , he was urging other people to become involved in similar humanitarian activities to the betterment of all . historian says speech stirs ugly memories knopp , who works for german broadcaster zdf and heads their programs on contemporary history , said over the weekend that the mission impossible star 's speech to other scientology members , leaked on to the internet this week , was reminiscent of a 1943 speech by propaganda minister , joseph göbbels . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : knopp drew parallels between cruise 's speech and that of göbbels , right the speech that cruise made four years ago asks fellow members of the church : " should we clean this place up ? " knopp said it was sure to remind germans of göbbel 's notorious speech in berlin on feb .
18 , 1943 when he asked the audience : " do you want total war ? " " it may be the case that cruise 's delivery style is not uncommon in certain religious movements in the us , " knopp said .
" but for germans with an interest in history , that scene where he asks whether the scientologists should clean up the world and everyone shouts ' yes ' is inevitably reminiscent of göbbel 's notorious speech . " scientology deeply controversial in germany unlike the us , germany does not recognize scientology as a church and there are debates about whether to ban the organization .
the movement is often described as a sect that exploits its members financially .
in december , regional ministers agreed to investigate the possibility of banning it . cruise also sparked controversy in germany last year because of his role as a nazi resistance hero claus schenk von stauffenberg in a new film , " valkyrie " of which he is also the producer .
von stauffenberg led the failed valkyrie plot , from which the film takes its name , to assassinate adolf hitler in 1944 . cruise 's plans to film a part of the film at the german defense ministry in berlin , where stauffenberg was executed after the failed assassination attempt , met with resistance from german government officials because of his links with scientology . the officials later changed tack and allowed the filming to go ahead .
cruise 's role in scientology is examined in an explosive unauthorized biography of the actor by british writer andrew morton which hit shelves in the united states earlier this month . the publication of the book has been given wide coverage in german media .
it was described by scientology as " replete with lies . " karin pouw said germany had misunderstood the us actor . " anyone who knows mr cruise knows that he does not have a prejudicial bone in his body and that , unlike bild am sonntag and other german anti-religionists , he does not discriminate against any other religion , race or color .

it would n't be the first time two of germany 's christian churches share houses of worship . the catholic diocese of hildesheim in the northern state of lower saxony on monday , jan .
21 , asked the lutherans in the state for permission to hold religious services in their facilities . the diocese , one of 27 in germany , said it planned to close 80 of its 438 churches due to a budget crunch .
it will also require local communities to pay for the upkeep of dozens more . arend de vries , a senior official in lower saxony 's protestant church said he was open to the idea but would wait for an official request from the diocese before making the catholics an offer . church-goers dwindle both the protestant and catholic state churches can claim 26 million members each nationwide , who support them with a state-imposed church tax .
however , attendance and membership have sunk recently . only 14 percent of catholics attend mass on any given sunday and only 264 men volunteered to become priests last year , germany 's dpa news agency reported . many of the country 's churches , however , are historical landmarks and moves to close under-used houses of worship have come up against protests . if the lutherans in lower saxony agree to share worship space with local catholics , it would n't be a first .
de vries recalled that the two denominations held services in the same facilities after many churches were destroyed in world war two . dw staff -lrb- kjb -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de economy -pipe- 22.01.2008 effects of us recession could be held at bay , experts say großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : some experts said the us has become less important for the global economy global markets have plunged , partly due to fear of a recession in the united states , the world 's biggest economy .
but european experts say dynamic developing countries like china could offset us troubles . looking at the way the markets have plummeted , it appears an old adage rings true : " when the us sneezes , the rest of the world gets a cold . " panic spread across the frankfurt trading floor on monday , jan .
21 , when the country 's dax index experienced its biggest plunge since the sept .
11 , 2001 terrorist attacks in the united states . fears of a us recession , partly sparked by the recent credit crisis , and the possibility that it could lead to an international economic crisis also sent other european and asian into nose dives . over-sensitivity of markets ? bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : traders at the stock exchange in frankfurt tried to fend off panic yet , despite the panic , a majority of finance experts estimate the likelihood of a us recession at only 40 percent .
economists at german banks including dekabank and westlb assess the situation even more modestly , believing that a recession risk stands at only 25 percent . some analysts also point to a university of michigan consumer confidence reading for january , which last week stood at 80.5 percent , up from 75.5 percent in december .
this has led some to believe that consumer sentiment - which helps to drive markets - is up despite fears of a recession . but jörg krämer , chief economist at commerzbank , stressed the complexity of the situation . " we expect the us economy to stagnate in the first half of 2008 , which will feel like a recession , " he said . huge growth on chinese and indian markets bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : china could help balance out other markets other economic analysts have said that even if the us economy were to shrink , the rapidly expanding markets of developing countries in asia could offset a recession in the us , or at least minimize its effects .
after all , consumer growth rates in hong kong , china , thailand , malaysia and india tally up to 15 percent of the global economy . " the us economy is no longer as important for the world economic situation as it used to be , " said dutch world bank economist hans timmer . but krämer - and others - remains skeptical . " to be able to compensate for a us recession , growth in china would have to pick up even more , " said gabriele widmann , a dekabank analyst for the us market , adding that such growth would be difficult as the us is an important destination for asian goods . budgets and companies feeling the credit squeeze pessimists therefore fear that decreasing us demand for asian products could prompt a " domino effect . "
should american consumers lose their desire to buy , the dominos in the markets so dependent on exports to the us could start to tumble . " if growth of the us economy slows by one percent , business activity in germany likewise slows by a half percent , " krämer said . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : japanese and other asian stocks also plunged on monday furthermore , american financial market policies do not necessarily instill hope . us federal reserve bank chairman ben bernanke may have repeatedly lowered the prime interest rate since the mortgage crisis in the us erupted last year , but the lowered interest rates do not have the desired effect where they are most needed .
interest rates on the corporate bond and consumer credit markets have remained the same or have even risen . also , a multi-billion-dollar proposal by us president george w. bush last week to temporarily cut taxes and implement other measures to fend off a possible recession has failed to calm the financial mood . us business activity , after all , has often proven to be resistant to politics .
the wall street journal recently summarized it as such : " we have tried tax breaks before .
they do n't work . " dekabank economist widmann is also certain : " the plan will just be a flash in the pan .
it would only relieve the situation short-term . " angela göpfert -lrb- als -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

it remains uncertain whether they will manage to agree . foreign ministers from the united states , britain , china , france , russia and germany meet in berlin on tuesday , jan .
22 , to ratchet up pressure on teheran for defying international demands that it stop uranium enrichment activities that they fear could be used to make a bomb . the six world powers , which have been searching for common ground for months , are to discuss and thrash out a third un sanctions resolution against iran . german foreign minister frank-walter steinmeier said the meeting would show that iran has not eliminated international concerns . " i am very confident that we will come to a result that will show iran once again that our concerns are not eliminated , and the resolve of the international community of states - including russia and china - remains , " he said . few hopes of breakthrough bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : powerful interests at stake in iran - chinese leader hu jintao with russia 's putin but few expect a real breakthrough at the meeting due to lingering differences between security council members on the best way to deal with iran . eckart von klaeden , foreign policy spokesman for chancellor angela merkel 's christian democratic union -lrb- cdu -rrb- said it was vital that the international community showed a united front to tehran . " my fear is that moscow and beijing will express so many reservations that a much-needed sign of a determined common front wo n't be forthcoming , " von klaeden said in an interview with a german radio station . russia and china are reluctant to back new punitive measures against iran because of their important trade ties with the islamic republic .
russia recently stepped up uranium exports for iran 's busher nuclear power plant which tehran is building on the persian gulf . us plays down expectations the us in particular is pushing for a third round of un sanctions because washington insists that tehran has failed to fulfill key demands to halt work on its nuclear program and provide transparency .
according to diplomats , the us wants new sanctions against state-run iranian banks as well as firms that support tehran 's nuclear weapons program . the us administration 's own intelligence on iran has made it difficult to convince russia and china that tehran deserves new sanctions . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the west fears iran is trying to make a bomb a national intelligence estimate released in early december reported that iran abandoned its nuclear weapons program in 2003 , a conclusion that undermined us president george w. bush 's warnings about the iran threat . the us this week played down expectations of a breakthrough at the berlin summit . " we do n't yet have agreement on the elements or language of a -lrb- united nations -rrb- resolution , " state department spokesman sean mccormack said on friday , jan .
18 . " but we 're pushing forward on it and we 're optimistic that we will eventually be able to get a resolution .
we would have wished that we had had one by now but that is multilateral diplomacy . " steinmeier said the nie report contained both positive and negative news .
in addition to showing that iran had ended its enrichment program , the report also concluded that the country had been working on a weapons program . " the question remains : how far along were the iranians ? "
steinmeier said .
" for that we need the iaea in vienna . " as host of the meeting , steinmeier is to meet separately with us secretary of state condoleeza rice and his chinese counterpart , yang jiechi . iran says berlin meet useless iran , the world 's fourth-largest oil exporter , insists its uranium enrichment is aimed at generating electricity so that it can export more oil and gas . iran 's foreign ministry spokesman , mohammad-ali hosseini , on monday predicted that the berlin meeting would come to nothing . the view was echoed by another senior iranian official , ali aghamohammadi , a representative of supreme leader ayatollah ali khamenei on a powerful arbitration body . in an interview with reuters , aghamohammadi said the berlin meeting would not help defuse iran 's nuclear row with the west if the six powers continue to push for a new sanctions resolution on iran . " if they can find a way to turn the page , then things should be fine , " he said .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de media -pipe- 22.01.2008 experts : no ulterior motives behind french sarkozy-bruni affair großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : sarkozy 's refusal to confirm marriage rumors fuels even more press speculation nicolas sarkozy 's relationship with carla bruni has led to speculation that the french president is trying to cover up political problems .
but insiders say the affair sets a precedent in a totally different way . french president nicolas sarkozy has broken with precedent like no other occupant of the elysee palace . the son of a hungarian aristocrat and grandson of a greek-jewish doctor , he embodies the multi-ethnic diversity of france that is reflected in some of his cabinet choices .
half of all top ministerial posts are filled by women , the highest proportion ever in france .
sarkozy , whose gaullist party ump is right of center , has even poached some of the best minds from his socialist rivals , such as the unusual choice of bernard kouchner , a medical doctor , as foreign minister . in october , sarkozy became the first head of state not only to divorce , but to do so in office , which prompted the release of three best-selling books about his ex-wife , cecilia ciganer . " speedy sarko " captivates public with new love bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : sarkozy waited until after the elections to get divorced from cecilia then one saturday afternoon in mid-december he showed up in disneyland paris with his new flame , carla bruni .
since then , the public has been bombarded with images of the italian ex-supermodel turned pop singer and the details of her past relationships with rock stars , actors and france 's literati .
bruni 's uncanny physical resemblance to cecilia - both are tall , striking blue-eyed brunettes , has all of france putting the president on the psychoanalyst 's couch debating whether " speedy sarko " is now suddenly on the rebound after his ex had ceremoniously left him . in news reports , prime minister francois fillon had even complained that the president was behaving like a love-struck teenager at cabinet meetings . " he giggles , " said fillon in an interview with the widely respected french satirical newspaper le canard enchaine .
" when we talk to him , he does not always listen .
he cancels meetings , which is not like him . " on jan .
8 at a lengthy news conference , the 52-year-old president admitted to a " serious relationship " with bruni , 40 , and talked about the emotional pain of divorce .
but his refusal to confirm or deny marriage rumors has only fuelled even more press speculation about the couple 's intentions . no more taboos on discussing a president 's love life that sarkozy himself even discussed his private life at all in such a public forum however was remarkable and unprecedented in the annals of presidential history , according to french sociologists and media watchers . although the sexual peccadilloes of former presidents such as francois mitterrand , who had fathered a daughter out of wedlock , were long known to media insiders , there used to be a silent pact among journalists that the private lives of top politicians were off-limits , according to denis muzet , founder of the paris-based politics and media institute , mediascopie . " taboos have been lifted , " said muzet , who explained that once bernadette , the wife of former president jacques chirac published her popular memoirs about her husband 's infidelities , the floodgates started to open and in a sense liberated the couple from the constraints of the presidency . " the rules have been changing considerably since the death of princess diana 10 years ago , " he added .
" what i call ' peoplization of the press ' is so banal now that even the serious press jumps on the bandwagon . " sarkozy , whose political mentor was chirac , has simply gone much further than his predecessor in exposing his private life to public view . french press freer than ever to set the agenda bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the portrait of an attractive , harmonious family helps the presidential image " he wants to show that even presidents live , love and suffer like ordinary people , " said muzet , who dismissed suggestions that sarkozy is trying to divert the french from real problems their country faces from social unrest in the immigrant suburbs to rising consumer prices that have diminished purchasing power .
" he wants to show he is transparent and has nothing to hide , down to photos of him on the beach in his swimming trunks . " thierry saussez , a close personal advisor to the president who founded the corporate communications agency image et strategie europe , also emphasized that sarkozy is not trying to deflect the country 's focus from the economic slowdown by flaunting his private life as a few commentators have suggested .
the french press is now freer than ever to set the agenda , he said . " under mitterrand , journalists and others who knew about mitterrand 's illegitimate daughter were under tremendous pressure to keep his double life under wraps , " said saussez , who explained that the public has become so saturated with intimate images of their president enjoying the egyptian pyramids with bruni during the christmas holidays that it has contributed to a drop in the polls .
" and now it 's gone the other way with too much exposure of a president 's private life . " for the first time since sarkozy assumed office in may when he was riding a wave of popularity with two-thirds of the public supporting him , his approvals ratings have now dipped to below 50 percent , according to all pollsters .
but saussez was careful to point out that the bruni brouhaha is only part of the reason for the poll results . " the public needs assurances that the president is working hard and doing his job , not just having fun , " he said .
" but the french are also a very impatient people and they want the president to fix their problems right away . " are they getting married ? bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : bruni looks like a younger version of sarkozy 's ex-wife , who was also a model but did sarkozy have to make disneyland of all places , the site for his first very public outing with bruni ? " sarkozy is behaving in a way that no french president has , " said helene brunerie , a french artist living in germany .
" he 's divorced and suddenly in the arms of a top model . " on one hand i 'm glad that the press in france has the freedom to be so colorful and uninhibited , but the image of the french president that is being projected to the world is undignified , " she added , reflecting the view of many french citizens living abroad . to both sarkozy admirers and detractors , the image problem can at least be partially fixed if he tied the knot with bruni . for one it would solve sticky protocol problems when they travel abroad on official presidential visits as a couple .
on friday , the french president will be in india , where officials are beside themselves about whether to give bruni the first lady or the girlfriend treatment . saussez predicted that bruni will not go , thereby keeping the public guessing about his marital status .

" sarkozy , whose political mentor was chirac , has simply gone much further than his predecessor in exposing his private life to public view . french press freer than ever to set the agenda bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the portrait of an attractive , harmonious family helps the presidential image " he wants to show that even presidents live , love and suffer like ordinary people , " said muzet , who dismissed suggestions that sarkozy is trying to divert the french from real problems their country faces from social unrest in the immigrant suburbs to rising consumer prices that have diminished purchasing power .
" he wants to show he is transparent and has nothing to hide , down to photos of him on the beach in his swimming trunks . " thierry saussez , a close personal advisor to the president who founded the corporate communications agency image et strategie europe , also emphasized that sarkozy is not trying to deflect the country 's focus from the economic slowdown by flaunting his private life as a few commentators have suggested .
the french press is now freer than ever to set the agenda , he said . " under mitterrand , journalists and others who knew about mitterrand 's illegitimate daughter were under tremendous pressure to keep his double life under wraps , " said saussez , who explained that the public has become so saturated with intimate images of their president enjoying the egyptian pyramids with bruni during the christmas holidays that it has contributed to a drop in the polls .
" and now it 's gone the other way with too much exposure of a president 's private life . " for the first time since sarkozy assumed office in may when he was riding a wave of popularity with two-thirds of the public supporting him , his approvals ratings have now dipped to below 50 percent , according to all pollsters .
but saussez was careful to point out that the bruni brouhaha is only part of the reason for the poll results . " the public needs assurances that the president is working hard and doing his job , not just having fun , " he said .
" but the french are also a very impatient people and they want the president to fix their problems right away . " are they getting married ? bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : bruni looks like a younger version of sarkozy 's ex-wife , who was also a model but did sarkozy have to make disneyland of all places , the site for his first very public outing with bruni ? " sarkozy is behaving in a way that no french president has , " said helene brunerie , a french artist living in germany .
" he 's divorced and suddenly in the arms of a top model . " on one hand i 'm glad that the press in france has the freedom to be so colorful and uninhibited , but the image of the french president that is being projected to the world is undignified , " she added , reflecting the view of many french citizens living abroad . to both sarkozy admirers and detractors , the image problem can at least be partially fixed if he tied the knot with bruni . for one it would solve sticky protocol problems when they travel abroad on official presidential visits as a couple .
on friday , the french president will be in india , where officials are beside themselves about whether to give bruni the first lady or the girlfriend treatment . saussez predicted that bruni will not go , thereby keeping the public guessing about his marital status .

but european experts say dynamic developing countries like china could offset us troubles . looking at the way the markets have plummeted , it appears an old adage rings true : " when the us sneezes , the rest of the world gets a cold . " panic spread across the frankfurt trading floor on monday , jan .
21 , when the country 's dax index experienced its biggest plunge since the sept .
11 , 2001 terrorist attacks in the united states . fears of a us recession , partly sparked by the recent credit crisis , and the possibility that it could lead to an international economic crisis also sent other european and asian into nose dives . over-sensitivity of markets ? bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : traders at the stock exchange in frankfurt tried to fend off panic yet , despite the panic , a majority of finance experts estimate the likelihood of a us recession at only 40 percent .
economists at german banks including dekabank and westlb assess the situation even more modestly , believing that a recession risk stands at only 25 percent . some analysts also point to a university of michigan consumer confidence reading for january , which last week stood at 80.5 percent , up from 75.5 percent in december .
this has led some to believe that consumer sentiment - which helps to drive markets - is up despite fears of a recession . but jörg krämer , chief economist at commerzbank , stressed the complexity of the situation . " we expect the us economy to stagnate in the first half of 2008 , which will feel like a recession , " he said . huge growth on chinese and indian markets bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : china could help balance out other markets other economic analysts have said that even if the us economy were to shrink , the rapidly expanding markets of developing countries in asia could offset a recession in the us , or at least minimize its effects .
after all , consumer growth rates in hong kong , china , thailand , malaysia and india tally up to 15 percent of the global economy . " the us economy is no longer as important for the world economic situation as it used to be , " said dutch world bank economist hans timmer . but krämer - and others - remains skeptical . " to be able to compensate for a us recession , growth in china would have to pick up even more , " said gabriele widmann , a dekabank analyst for the us market , adding that such growth would be difficult as the us is an important destination for asian goods . budgets and companies feeling the credit squeeze pessimists therefore fear that decreasing us demand for asian products could prompt a " domino effect . "
should american consumers lose their desire to buy , the dominos in the markets so dependent on exports to the us could start to tumble . " if growth of the us economy slows by one percent , business activity in germany likewise slows by a half percent , " krämer said . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : japanese and other asian stocks also plunged on monday furthermore , american financial market policies do not necessarily instill hope . us federal reserve bank chairman ben bernanke may have repeatedly lowered the prime interest rate since the mortgage crisis in the us erupted last year , but the lowered interest rates do not have the desired effect where they are most needed .
interest rates on the corporate bond and consumer credit markets have remained the same or have even risen . also , a multi-billion-dollar proposal by us president george w. bush last week to temporarily cut taxes and implement other measures to fend off a possible recession has failed to calm the financial mood . us business activity , after all , has often proven to be resistant to politics .
the wall street journal recently summarized it as such : " we have tried tax breaks before .
they do n't work . " dekabank economist widmann is also certain : " the plan will just be a flash in the pan .
it would only relieve the situation short-term . " angela göpfert -lrb- als -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

he said the situation in the serbian province remains calm but not stable . brig. gen. robert bund commands the 2,200 soldiers that make up the german contingent in the nato-led kosovo protection force -lrb- kfor -rrb- . dw-world.de : how did you prepare yourself personally for your role as leader of the german contingent in kosovo ? robert bund : i consider myself generally well prepared , especially in the area of leadership , as a result of my previous career assignments during my 40 years of service with the bundeswehr .
moving through the various ranks from company commander -lsb- who is in charge of up to 200 servicemen and women -rsb- all the way up to brigade commander -lsb- who is responsible for some 5,000 soldiers -rsb- , you gain so much experience that you should be ready to successfully confront all the challenges of a foreign operation . like any other soldier , i went through the whole range of preparatory training for this mission .
one hostage exercise we did left an impression .
role-players had to act as realistically as possible and were constantly monitored by psychologists . to round off my technical preparation , i studied the history and the political and social conditions in kosovo intensively .
and , of course , there were intensive talks with my wife and our children as well as with the members of my home church , the free protestant church , to emotionally prepare me for my long tour .
support from family and community makes it easier to take on the burdens of an operation abroad and the separation from home and it can be transformed into something positive . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : better living conditions will keep youth from joining radical groups , said bund how do you motivate your troops ? the leadership principle that i try to put into practice is based on two pillars .
the first pillar is trust . i treat all servicemen and women with unrestricted trust .
this means that i take each one seriously as an individual - with their questions , problems and specialized knowledge .
every single soldier is a specialist in his or her field , and i put my trust in their skills , even in our daily contact with each other .
but this trust also means that each person must be aware of their responsibility , too , and has to act accordingly - that is , responsibly .
i firmly demand this of everyone . the second pillar is comradeship .
back in germany , comradeship is a basic principle , but it plays a much more important role in a foreign operation .
i see comradeship as independent of rank or chain of command .
a particularly important point for me in this respect is looking after each other , taking notice of and dealing with one another in a positive manner and being aware of when others need help . in addition , i continually try to get a feel for the general mood , take notice of problems and explain my position on a whole range of different issues during our meetings .
in other words , i try to stay in touch with my soldiers . i also make use of the camp 's radio station , where all soldiers have the opportunity to ask questions on the air or in writing .
i respond to them during a question-and-answer broadcast called " commander on air . " what have you learned about the culture in kosovo ?
which aspects interest you the most ? i am most interested in the evolution of the political process .
europe and the us have clearly expressed their positions on the matter and the people in kosovo put all their trust in the support from these countries - and their expectations are high . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the people of kosovo want to decide on their future for themselves , said bund i have learned that these people are highly aware of their situation .
they know that never before in their history have they been so close to a potentially historic decision and that anything that deviates from normalcy would jeopardize the current decision process , possibly setting it back for years .
however , they 're not going to wait forever .
that is why we assess the situation as calm but not stable . i have also learned that the people in kosovo are among the youngest in europe .
the average age of the kosovo albanians is about 27 years .
this means that economic development over the next few years is extremely important .
only a significant improvement of the living conditions can prevent the young people from joining more radical movements .
improvement means secure electrical power supply 24 hours a day and modern roads and railway connections to the outside world . what surprised me is the way islam is practiced here .
here in kosovo i was able to gain insight into islamic practices through my many meetings with religious leaders .
i was very impressed that , when the catholic bishop consecrated a new altar , members off different faiths attended the mass and ate together afterwards . on the whole , the people in kosovo want to finally decide for themselves about their future after their long and , at times , tragic history . what is the everyday routine like for you and your soldiers ? the daily routine of my soldiers varies greatly , depending on their respective tasks .
but the overall conditions are the same for all of them .
every soldier without shift duty , night-time operations or other duties works monday through friday from 7:30 a.m. to 7:30 p.m. , but there are many who work beyond that .
on saturday , we start an hour later and on sunday duty is from 1:30 p.m. to 6:30 p.m. another special thing on sunday is that , at 11:00 , we hold our religious service in our small church , which was built by our soldiers a few years ago .
we are always accompanied by our church choir , which i sing in myself . my own daily routine depends on whether talks with politicians or other people are on my schedule .
the morning hours are especially important to me because i can prepare myself for the tasks ahead .
a half hour of bible study helps me get into the mood to go to work . after that , i have various appointments that are coordinated by my military assistant and aide de camp .
there are negotiations with civic representatives , briefings with my advisors and commanders and , of course , visits with the troops at the different field camps in and around prizren . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : kosovo 's political leaders , fatmir sejdiu , left , and hashim thaci , expect much of the eu normally , i am busy every day from about 7:00 a.m. to 9:00 p.m.
but , of course , i am available for all members of the german contingent outside those hours , too . what is your personal goal in kosovo ?
what do you want to leave behind ? the most important goal is get all servicemen and women home again safely . apart from that , i want to contribute to seeing our mission accomplished as well as possible .
to ensure a safe and secure environment and freedom of movement for all ethnic groups .
that the people of kosovo have a positive perspective on their future , and that our servicemen and women are recognized for continuing the tradition of their predecessor under the motto " helping others help themselves . " i want to ensure that , within the framework of our civil-military cooperation , we continue to contribute to the building of a kosovar society and , above all , give the children a better future by building schools and helping them with job qualifications . apart from our military mission we have been able to directly help people living below the poverty threshold with a variety of initiatives supported by donations from germany .
in addition , we 've been able to provide school materials to students . if this has succeeded in assuring the survival of at least a few people or facilitated learning , it is a big enough legacy . interview : kate bowen send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de media -pipe- 22.01.2008 experts : no ulterior motives behind french sarkozy-bruni affair großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : sarkozy 's refusal to confirm marriage rumors fuels even more press speculation nicolas sarkozy 's relationship with carla bruni has led to speculation that the french president is trying to cover up political problems .
but insiders say the affair sets a precedent in a totally different way . french president nicolas sarkozy has broken with precedent like no other occupant of the elysee palace . the son of a hungarian aristocrat and grandson of a greek-jewish doctor , he embodies the multi-ethnic diversity of france that is reflected in some of his cabinet choices .
half of all top ministerial posts are filled by women , the highest proportion ever in france .
sarkozy , whose gaullist party ump is right of center , has even poached some of the best minds from his socialist rivals , such as the unusual choice of bernard kouchner , a medical doctor , as foreign minister . in october , sarkozy became the first head of state not only to divorce , but to do so in office , which prompted the release of three best-selling books about his ex-wife , cecilia ciganer . " speedy sarko " captivates public with new love bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : sarkozy waited until after the elections to get divorced from cecilia then one saturday afternoon in mid-december he showed up in disneyland paris with his new flame , carla bruni .
since then , the public has been bombarded with images of the italian ex-supermodel turned pop singer and the details of her past relationships with rock stars , actors and france 's literati .
bruni 's uncanny physical resemblance to cecilia - both are tall , striking blue-eyed brunettes , has all of france putting the president on the psychoanalyst 's couch debating whether " speedy sarko " is now suddenly on the rebound after his ex had ceremoniously left him . in news reports , prime minister francois fillon had even complained that the president was behaving like a love-struck teenager at cabinet meetings . " he giggles , " said fillon in an interview with the widely respected french satirical newspaper le canard enchaine .
" when we talk to him , he does not always listen .
he cancels meetings , which is not like him . " on jan .
8 at a lengthy news conference , the 52-year-old president admitted to a " serious relationship " with bruni , 40 , and talked about the emotional pain of divorce .
but his refusal to confirm or deny marriage rumors has only fuelled even more press speculation about the couple 's intentions . no more taboos on discussing a president 's love life that sarkozy himself even discussed his private life at all in such a public forum however was remarkable and unprecedented in the annals of presidential history , according to french sociologists and media watchers . although the sexual peccadilloes of former presidents such as francois mitterrand , who had fathered a daughter out of wedlock , were long known to media insiders , there used to be a silent pact among journalists that the private lives of top politicians were off-limits , according to denis muzet , founder of the paris-based politics and media institute , mediascopie . " taboos have been lifted , " said muzet , who explained that once bernadette , the wife of former president jacques chirac published her popular memoirs about her husband 's infidelities , the floodgates started to open and in a sense liberated the couple from the constraints of the presidency . " the rules have been changing considerably since the death of princess diana 10 years ago , " he added .
" what i call ' peoplization of the press ' is so banal now that even the serious press jumps on the bandwagon . " sarkozy , whose political mentor was chirac , has simply gone much further than his predecessor in exposing his private life to public view . french press freer than ever to set the agenda bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the portrait of an attractive , harmonious family helps the presidential image " he wants to show that even presidents live , love and suffer like ordinary people , " said muzet , who dismissed suggestions that sarkozy is trying to divert the french from real problems their country faces from social unrest in the immigrant suburbs to rising consumer prices that have diminished purchasing power .
" he wants to show he is transparent and has nothing to hide , down to photos of him on the beach in his swimming trunks . " thierry saussez , a close personal advisor to the president who founded the corporate communications agency image et strategie europe , also emphasized that sarkozy is not trying to deflect the country 's focus from the economic slowdown by flaunting his private life as a few commentators have suggested .
the french press is now freer than ever to set the agenda , he said . " under mitterrand , journalists and others who knew about mitterrand 's illegitimate daughter were under tremendous pressure to keep his double life under wraps , " said saussez , who explained that the public has become so saturated with intimate images of their president enjoying the egyptian pyramids with bruni during the christmas holidays that it has contributed to a drop in the polls .

but european experts say dynamic developing countries like china could offset us troubles . looking at the way the markets have plummeted , it appears an old adage rings true : " when the us sneezes , the rest of the world gets a cold . " panic spread across the frankfurt trading floor on monday , jan .
21 , when the country 's dax index experienced its biggest plunge since the sept .
11 , 2001 terrorist attacks in the united states . fears of a us recession , partly sparked by the recent credit crisis , and the possibility that it could lead to an international economic crisis also sent other european and asian into nose dives . over-sensitivity of markets ? bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : traders at the stock exchange in frankfurt tried to fend off panic yet , despite the panic , a majority of finance experts estimate the likelihood of a us recession at only 40 percent .
economists at german banks including dekabank and westlb assess the situation even more modestly , believing that a recession risk stands at only 25 percent . some analysts also point to a university of michigan consumer confidence reading for january , which last week stood at 80.5 percent , up from 75.5 percent in december .
this has led some to believe that consumer sentiment - which helps to drive markets - is up despite fears of a recession . but jörg krämer , chief economist at commerzbank , stressed the complexity of the situation . " we expect the us economy to stagnate in the first half of 2008 , which will feel like a recession , " he said . huge growth on chinese and indian markets bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : china could help balance out other markets other economic analysts have said that even if the us economy were to shrink , the rapidly expanding markets of developing countries in asia could offset a recession in the us , or at least minimize its effects .
after all , consumer growth rates in hong kong , china , thailand , malaysia and india tally up to 15 percent of the global economy . " the us economy is no longer as important for the world economic situation as it used to be , " said dutch world bank economist hans timmer . but krämer - and others - remains skeptical . " to be able to compensate for a us recession , growth in china would have to pick up even more , " said gabriele widmann , a dekabank analyst for the us market , adding that such growth would be difficult as the us is an important destination for asian goods . budgets and companies feeling the credit squeeze pessimists therefore fear that decreasing us demand for asian products could prompt a " domino effect . "
should american consumers lose their desire to buy , the dominos in the markets so dependent on exports to the us could start to tumble . " if growth of the us economy slows by one percent , business activity in germany likewise slows by a half percent , " krämer said . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : japanese and other asian stocks also plunged on monday furthermore , american financial market policies do not necessarily instill hope . us federal reserve bank chairman ben bernanke may have repeatedly lowered the prime interest rate since the mortgage crisis in the us erupted last year , but the lowered interest rates do not have the desired effect where they are most needed .
interest rates on the corporate bond and consumer credit markets have remained the same or have even risen . also , a multi-billion-dollar proposal by us president george w. bush last week to temporarily cut taxes and implement other measures to fend off a possible recession has failed to calm the financial mood . us business activity , after all , has often proven to be resistant to politics .
the wall street journal recently summarized it as such : " we have tried tax breaks before .
they do n't work . " dekabank economist widmann is also certain : " the plan will just be a flash in the pan .
it would only relieve the situation short-term . " angela göpfert -lrb- als -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

he said the situation in the serbian province remains calm but not stable . brig. gen. robert bund commands the 2,200 soldiers that make up the german contingent in the nato-led kosovo protection force -lrb- kfor -rrb- . dw-world.de : how did you prepare yourself personally for your role as leader of the german contingent in kosovo ? robert bund : i consider myself generally well prepared , especially in the area of leadership , as a result of my previous career assignments during my 40 years of service with the bundeswehr .
moving through the various ranks from company commander -lsb- who is in charge of up to 200 servicemen and women -rsb- all the way up to brigade commander -lsb- who is responsible for some 5,000 soldiers -rsb- , you gain so much experience that you should be ready to successfully confront all the challenges of a foreign operation . like any other soldier , i went through the whole range of preparatory training for this mission .
one hostage exercise we did left an impression .
role-players had to act as realistically as possible and were constantly monitored by psychologists . to round off my technical preparation , i studied the history and the political and social conditions in kosovo intensively .
and , of course , there were intensive talks with my wife and our children as well as with the members of my home church , the free protestant church , to emotionally prepare me for my long tour .
support from family and community makes it easier to take on the burdens of an operation abroad and the separation from home and it can be transformed into something positive . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : better living conditions will keep youth from joining radical groups , said bund how do you motivate your troops ? the leadership principle that i try to put into practice is based on two pillars .
the first pillar is trust . i treat all servicemen and women with unrestricted trust .
this means that i take each one seriously as an individual - with their questions , problems and specialized knowledge .
every single soldier is a specialist in his or her field , and i put my trust in their skills , even in our daily contact with each other .
but this trust also means that each person must be aware of their responsibility , too , and has to act accordingly - that is , responsibly .
i firmly demand this of everyone . the second pillar is comradeship .
back in germany , comradeship is a basic principle , but it plays a much more important role in a foreign operation .
i see comradeship as independent of rank or chain of command .
a particularly important point for me in this respect is looking after each other , taking notice of and dealing with one another in a positive manner and being aware of when others need help . in addition , i continually try to get a feel for the general mood , take notice of problems and explain my position on a whole range of different issues during our meetings .
in other words , i try to stay in touch with my soldiers . i also make use of the camp 's radio station , where all soldiers have the opportunity to ask questions on the air or in writing .
i respond to them during a question-and-answer broadcast called " commander on air . " what have you learned about the culture in kosovo ?
which aspects interest you the most ? i am most interested in the evolution of the political process .
europe and the us have clearly expressed their positions on the matter and the people in kosovo put all their trust in the support from these countries - and their expectations are high . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the people of kosovo want to decide on their future for themselves , said bund i have learned that these people are highly aware of their situation .
they know that never before in their history have they been so close to a potentially historic decision and that anything that deviates from normalcy would jeopardize the current decision process , possibly setting it back for years .
however , they 're not going to wait forever .
that is why we assess the situation as calm but not stable . i have also learned that the people in kosovo are among the youngest in europe .
the average age of the kosovo albanians is about 27 years .
this means that economic development over the next few years is extremely important .
only a significant improvement of the living conditions can prevent the young people from joining more radical movements .
improvement means secure electrical power supply 24 hours a day and modern roads and railway connections to the outside world . what surprised me is the way islam is practiced here .
here in kosovo i was able to gain insight into islamic practices through my many meetings with religious leaders .
i was very impressed that , when the catholic bishop consecrated a new altar , members off different faiths attended the mass and ate together afterwards . on the whole , the people in kosovo want to finally decide for themselves about their future after their long and , at times , tragic history . what is the everyday routine like for you and your soldiers ? the daily routine of my soldiers varies greatly , depending on their respective tasks .
but the overall conditions are the same for all of them .
every soldier without shift duty , night-time operations or other duties works monday through friday from 7:30 a.m. to 7:30 p.m. , but there are many who work beyond that .
on saturday , we start an hour later and on sunday duty is from 1:30 p.m. to 6:30 p.m. another special thing on sunday is that , at 11:00 , we hold our religious service in our small church , which was built by our soldiers a few years ago .
we are always accompanied by our church choir , which i sing in myself . my own daily routine depends on whether talks with politicians or other people are on my schedule .
the morning hours are especially important to me because i can prepare myself for the tasks ahead .
a half hour of bible study helps me get into the mood to go to work . after that , i have various appointments that are coordinated by my military assistant and aide de camp .
there are negotiations with civic representatives , briefings with my advisors and commanders and , of course , visits with the troops at the different field camps in and around prizren . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : kosovo 's political leaders , fatmir sejdiu , left , and hashim thaci , expect much of the eu normally , i am busy every day from about 7:00 a.m. to 9:00 p.m.
but , of course , i am available for all members of the german contingent outside those hours , too . what is your personal goal in kosovo ?
what do you want to leave behind ? the most important goal is get all servicemen and women home again safely . apart from that , i want to contribute to seeing our mission accomplished as well as possible .
to ensure a safe and secure environment and freedom of movement for all ethnic groups .
that the people of kosovo have a positive perspective on their future , and that our servicemen and women are recognized for continuing the tradition of their predecessor under the motto " helping others help themselves . " i want to ensure that , within the framework of our civil-military cooperation , we continue to contribute to the building of a kosovar society and , above all , give the children a better future by building schools and helping them with job qualifications . apart from our military mission we have been able to directly help people living below the poverty threshold with a variety of initiatives supported by donations from germany .
in addition , we 've been able to provide school materials to students . if this has succeeded in assuring the survival of at least a few people or facilitated learning , it is a big enough legacy . interview : kate bowen send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

it remains uncertain whether they will manage to agree . foreign ministers from the united states , britain , china , france , russia and germany meet in berlin on tuesday , jan .
22 , to ratchet up pressure on teheran for defying international demands that it stop uranium enrichment activities that they fear could be used to make a bomb . the six world powers , which have been searching for common ground for months , are to discuss and thrash out a third un sanctions resolution against iran . german foreign minister frank-walter steinmeier said the meeting would show that iran has not eliminated international concerns . " i am very confident that we will come to a result that will show iran once again that our concerns are not eliminated , and the resolve of the international community of states - including russia and china - remains , " he said . few hopes of breakthrough bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : powerful interests at stake in iran - chinese leader hu jintao with russia 's putin but few expect a real breakthrough at the meeting due to lingering differences between security council members on the best way to deal with iran . eckart von klaeden , foreign policy spokesman for chancellor angela merkel 's christian democratic union -lrb- cdu -rrb- said it was vital that the international community showed a united front to tehran . " my fear is that moscow and beijing will express so many reservations that a much-needed sign of a determined common front wo n't be forthcoming , " von klaeden said in an interview with a german radio station . russia and china are reluctant to back new punitive measures against iran because of their important trade ties with the islamic republic .
russia recently stepped up uranium exports for iran 's busher nuclear power plant which tehran is building on the persian gulf . us plays down expectations the us in particular is pushing for a third round of un sanctions because washington insists that tehran has failed to fulfill key demands to halt work on its nuclear program and provide transparency .
according to diplomats , the us wants new sanctions against state-run iranian banks as well as firms that support tehran 's nuclear weapons program . the us administration 's own intelligence on iran has made it difficult to convince russia and china that tehran deserves new sanctions . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the west fears iran is trying to make a bomb a national intelligence estimate released in early december reported that iran abandoned its nuclear weapons program in 2003 , a conclusion that undermined us president george w. bush 's warnings about the iran threat . the us this week played down expectations of a breakthrough at the berlin summit . " we do n't yet have agreement on the elements or language of a -lrb- united nations -rrb- resolution , " state department spokesman sean mccormack said on friday , jan .
18 . " but we 're pushing forward on it and we 're optimistic that we will eventually be able to get a resolution .
we would have wished that we had had one by now but that is multilateral diplomacy . " steinmeier said the nie report contained both positive and negative news .
in addition to showing that iran had ended its enrichment program , the report also concluded that the country had been working on a weapons program . " the question remains : how far along were the iranians ? "
steinmeier said .
" for that we need the iaea in vienna . " as host of the meeting , steinmeier is to meet separately with us secretary of state condoleeza rice and his chinese counterpart , yang jiechi . iran says berlin meet useless iran , the world 's fourth-largest oil exporter , insists its uranium enrichment is aimed at generating electricity so that it can export more oil and gas . iran 's foreign ministry spokesman , mohammad-ali hosseini , on monday predicted that the berlin meeting would come to nothing . the view was echoed by another senior iranian official , ali aghamohammadi , a representative of supreme leader ayatollah ali khamenei on a powerful arbitration body . in an interview with reuters , aghamohammadi said the berlin meeting would not help defuse iran 's nuclear row with the west if the six powers continue to push for a new sanctions resolution on iran . " if they can find a way to turn the page , then things should be fine , " he said .
" if they want to continue their trend to push for another resolution , even a very weak one , i do n't think it can solve anything . " dw staff -lrb- sp -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

he said the situation in the serbian province remains calm but not stable . brig. gen. robert bund commands the 2,200 soldiers that make up the german contingent in the nato-led kosovo protection force -lrb- kfor -rrb- . dw-world.de : how did you prepare yourself personally for your role as leader of the german contingent in kosovo ? robert bund : i consider myself generally well prepared , especially in the area of leadership , as a result of my previous career assignments during my 40 years of service with the bundeswehr .
moving through the various ranks from company commander -lsb- who is in charge of up to 200 servicemen and women -rsb- all the way up to brigade commander -lsb- who is responsible for some 5,000 soldiers -rsb- , you gain so much experience that you should be ready to successfully confront all the challenges of a foreign operation . like any other soldier , i went through the whole range of preparatory training for this mission .
one hostage exercise we did left an impression .
role-players had to act as realistically as possible and were constantly monitored by psychologists . to round off my technical preparation , i studied the history and the political and social conditions in kosovo intensively .
and , of course , there were intensive talks with my wife and our children as well as with the members of my home church , the free protestant church , to emotionally prepare me for my long tour .
support from family and community makes it easier to take on the burdens of an operation abroad and the separation from home and it can be transformed into something positive . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : better living conditions will keep youth from joining radical groups , said bund how do you motivate your troops ? the leadership principle that i try to put into practice is based on two pillars .
the first pillar is trust . i treat all servicemen and women with unrestricted trust .
this means that i take each one seriously as an individual - with their questions , problems and specialized knowledge .
every single soldier is a specialist in his or her field , and i put my trust in their skills , even in our daily contact with each other .
but this trust also means that each person must be aware of their responsibility , too , and has to act accordingly - that is , responsibly .
i firmly demand this of everyone . the second pillar is comradeship .
back in germany , comradeship is a basic principle , but it plays a much more important role in a foreign operation .
i see comradeship as independent of rank or chain of command .
a particularly important point for me in this respect is looking after each other , taking notice of and dealing with one another in a positive manner and being aware of when others need help . in addition , i continually try to get a feel for the general mood , take notice of problems and explain my position on a whole range of different issues during our meetings .
in other words , i try to stay in touch with my soldiers . i also make use of the camp 's radio station , where all soldiers have the opportunity to ask questions on the air or in writing .
i respond to them during a question-and-answer broadcast called " commander on air . " what have you learned about the culture in kosovo ?
which aspects interest you the most ? i am most interested in the evolution of the political process .
europe and the us have clearly expressed their positions on the matter and the people in kosovo put all their trust in the support from these countries - and their expectations are high . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the people of kosovo want to decide on their future for themselves , said bund i have learned that these people are highly aware of their situation .
they know that never before in their history have they been so close to a potentially historic decision and that anything that deviates from normalcy would jeopardize the current decision process , possibly setting it back for years .
however , they 're not going to wait forever .
that is why we assess the situation as calm but not stable . i have also learned that the people in kosovo are among the youngest in europe .
the average age of the kosovo albanians is about 27 years .
this means that economic development over the next few years is extremely important .
only a significant improvement of the living conditions can prevent the young people from joining more radical movements .
improvement means secure electrical power supply 24 hours a day and modern roads and railway connections to the outside world . what surprised me is the way islam is practiced here .
here in kosovo i was able to gain insight into islamic practices through my many meetings with religious leaders .
i was very impressed that , when the catholic bishop consecrated a new altar , members off different faiths attended the mass and ate together afterwards . on the whole , the people in kosovo want to finally decide for themselves about their future after their long and , at times , tragic history . what is the everyday routine like for you and your soldiers ? the daily routine of my soldiers varies greatly , depending on their respective tasks .
but the overall conditions are the same for all of them .
every soldier without shift duty , night-time operations or other duties works monday through friday from 7:30 a.m. to 7:30 p.m. , but there are many who work beyond that .
on saturday , we start an hour later and on sunday duty is from 1:30 p.m. to 6:30 p.m. another special thing on sunday is that , at 11:00 , we hold our religious service in our small church , which was built by our soldiers a few years ago .
we are always accompanied by our church choir , which i sing in myself . my own daily routine depends on whether talks with politicians or other people are on my schedule .
the morning hours are especially important to me because i can prepare myself for the tasks ahead .
a half hour of bible study helps me get into the mood to go to work . after that , i have various appointments that are coordinated by my military assistant and aide de camp .
there are negotiations with civic representatives , briefings with my advisors and commanders and , of course , visits with the troops at the different field camps in and around prizren . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : kosovo 's political leaders , fatmir sejdiu , left , and hashim thaci , expect much of the eu normally , i am busy every day from about 7:00 a.m. to 9:00 p.m.
but , of course , i am available for all members of the german contingent outside those hours , too . what is your personal goal in kosovo ?
what do you want to leave behind ? the most important goal is get all servicemen and women home again safely . apart from that , i want to contribute to seeing our mission accomplished as well as possible .
to ensure a safe and secure environment and freedom of movement for all ethnic groups .
that the people of kosovo have a positive perspective on their future , and that our servicemen and women are recognized for continuing the tradition of their predecessor under the motto " helping others help themselves . " i want to ensure that , within the framework of our civil-military cooperation , we continue to contribute to the building of a kosovar society and , above all , give the children a better future by building schools and helping them with job qualifications . apart from our military mission we have been able to directly help people living below the poverty threshold with a variety of initiatives supported by donations from germany .
in addition , we 've been able to provide school materials to students . if this has succeeded in assuring the survival of at least a few people or facilitated learning , it is a big enough legacy . interview : kate bowen send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

he said the situation in the serbian province remains calm but not stable . brig. gen. robert bund commands the 2,200 soldiers that make up the german contingent in the nato-led kosovo protection force -lrb- kfor -rrb- . dw-world.de : how did you prepare yourself personally for your role as leader of the german contingent in kosovo ? robert bund : i consider myself generally well prepared , especially in the area of leadership , as a result of my previous career assignments during my 40 years of service with the bundeswehr .
moving through the various ranks from company commander -lsb- who is in charge of up to 200 servicemen and women -rsb- all the way up to brigade commander -lsb- who is responsible for some 5,000 soldiers -rsb- , you gain so much experience that you should be ready to successfully confront all the challenges of a foreign operation . like any other soldier , i went through the whole range of preparatory training for this mission .
one hostage exercise we did left an impression .
role-players had to act as realistically as possible and were constantly monitored by psychologists . to round off my technical preparation , i studied the history and the political and social conditions in kosovo intensively .
and , of course , there were intensive talks with my wife and our children as well as with the members of my home church , the free protestant church , to emotionally prepare me for my long tour .
support from family and community makes it easier to take on the burdens of an operation abroad and the separation from home and it can be transformed into something positive . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : better living conditions will keep youth from joining radical groups , said bund how do you motivate your troops ? the leadership principle that i try to put into practice is based on two pillars .
the first pillar is trust . i treat all servicemen and women with unrestricted trust .
this means that i take each one seriously as an individual - with their questions , problems and specialized knowledge .
every single soldier is a specialist in his or her field , and i put my trust in their skills , even in our daily contact with each other .
but this trust also means that each person must be aware of their responsibility , too , and has to act accordingly - that is , responsibly .
i firmly demand this of everyone . the second pillar is comradeship .
back in germany , comradeship is a basic principle , but it plays a much more important role in a foreign operation .
i see comradeship as independent of rank or chain of command .
a particularly important point for me in this respect is looking after each other , taking notice of and dealing with one another in a positive manner and being aware of when others need help . in addition , i continually try to get a feel for the general mood , take notice of problems and explain my position on a whole range of different issues during our meetings .
in other words , i try to stay in touch with my soldiers . i also make use of the camp 's radio station , where all soldiers have the opportunity to ask questions on the air or in writing .
i respond to them during a question-and-answer broadcast called " commander on air . " what have you learned about the culture in kosovo ?
which aspects interest you the most ? i am most interested in the evolution of the political process .
europe and the us have clearly expressed their positions on the matter and the people in kosovo put all their trust in the support from these countries - and their expectations are high . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the people of kosovo want to decide on their future for themselves , said bund i have learned that these people are highly aware of their situation .
they know that never before in their history have they been so close to a potentially historic decision and that anything that deviates from normalcy would jeopardize the current decision process , possibly setting it back for years .
however , they 're not going to wait forever .
that is why we assess the situation as calm but not stable . i have also learned that the people in kosovo are among the youngest in europe .
the average age of the kosovo albanians is about 27 years .
this means that economic development over the next few years is extremely important .
only a significant improvement of the living conditions can prevent the young people from joining more radical movements .
improvement means secure electrical power supply 24 hours a day and modern roads and railway connections to the outside world . what surprised me is the way islam is practiced here .
here in kosovo i was able to gain insight into islamic practices through my many meetings with religious leaders .
i was very impressed that , when the catholic bishop consecrated a new altar , members off different faiths attended the mass and ate together afterwards . on the whole , the people in kosovo want to finally decide for themselves about their future after their long and , at times , tragic history . what is the everyday routine like for you and your soldiers ? the daily routine of my soldiers varies greatly , depending on their respective tasks .
but the overall conditions are the same for all of them .
every soldier without shift duty , night-time operations or other duties works monday through friday from 7:30 a.m. to 7:30 p.m. , but there are many who work beyond that .
on saturday , we start an hour later and on sunday duty is from 1:30 p.m. to 6:30 p.m. another special thing on sunday is that , at 11:00 , we hold our religious service in our small church , which was built by our soldiers a few years ago .
we are always accompanied by our church choir , which i sing in myself . my own daily routine depends on whether talks with politicians or other people are on my schedule .
the morning hours are especially important to me because i can prepare myself for the tasks ahead .
a half hour of bible study helps me get into the mood to go to work . after that , i have various appointments that are coordinated by my military assistant and aide de camp .
there are negotiations with civic representatives , briefings with my advisors and commanders and , of course , visits with the troops at the different field camps in and around prizren . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : kosovo 's political leaders , fatmir sejdiu , left , and hashim thaci , expect much of the eu normally , i am busy every day from about 7:00 a.m. to 9:00 p.m.
but , of course , i am available for all members of the german contingent outside those hours , too . what is your personal goal in kosovo ?
what do you want to leave behind ? the most important goal is get all servicemen and women home again safely . apart from that , i want to contribute to seeing our mission accomplished as well as possible .
to ensure a safe and secure environment and freedom of movement for all ethnic groups .
that the people of kosovo have a positive perspective on their future , and that our servicemen and women are recognized for continuing the tradition of their predecessor under the motto " helping others help themselves . " i want to ensure that , within the framework of our civil-military cooperation , we continue to contribute to the building of a kosovar society and , above all , give the children a better future by building schools and helping them with job qualifications . apart from our military mission we have been able to directly help people living below the poverty threshold with a variety of initiatives supported by donations from germany .
in addition , we 've been able to provide school materials to students . if this has succeeded in assuring the survival of at least a few people or facilitated learning , it is a big enough legacy . interview : kate bowen send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

22 , that its talks with finnish cell-phone maker nokia had been unsuccessful , but vowed to continue the fight to keep a german factory open . plant workers and german labor groups have been furious about mobile-phone manufacturer nokia 's decision to shut down the plant in the western german city of bochum and move most of the operation to romania , where labor costs are significantly lower . on monday , nokia 's chief executive olli-pekka kallasvuo , representatives of the bochum plant and the ig metall trade union met in helsinki for what was called a " preliminary contact " by company spokeswoman arja suominen . " it was an unofficial meeting and we shall now start official talks , " suominen told ap news agency , but gave no details . a spokesman for ig metall in düsseldorf told dpa news service of the meeting : " the management presented the closure plans again and repeated their inadequate and already known explanation of why .

" if the decision is not altered , and it would seem to be that way , then everything possible must be done to ensure the people affected have a future , " she said . the chancellor said that she had also spoken with ig metall 's huber , the head of the union representing most nokia staff in bochum . she said the decision to close the plant demonstrated that government subsidies to businesses were " not a perpetual guarantee " that a factory would stay open .

" he was giving an acceptance speech for a humanitarian award bestowed in honor of his efforts for global literacy .
in doing so , he was urging other people to become involved in similar humanitarian activities to the betterment of all . historian says speech stirs ugly memories knopp , who works for german broadcaster zdf and heads their programs on contemporary history , said over the weekend that the mission impossible star 's speech to other scientology members , leaked on to the internet this week , was reminiscent of a 1943 speech by propaganda minister , joseph göbbels . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : knopp drew parallels between cruise 's speech and that of göbbels , right the speech that cruise made four years ago asks fellow members of the church : " should we clean this place up ?

" scientology deeply controversial in germany unlike the us , germany does not recognize scientology as a church and there are debates about whether to ban the organization .
the movement is often described as a sect that exploits its members financially .
in december , regional ministers agreed to investigate the possibility of banning it . cruise also sparked controversy in germany last year because of his role as a nazi resistance hero claus schenk von stauffenberg in a new film , " valkyrie " of which he is also the producer .
von stauffenberg led the failed valkyrie plot , from which the film takes its name , to assassinate adolf hitler in 1944 . cruise 's plans to film a part of the film at the german defense ministry in berlin , where stauffenberg was executed after the failed assassination attempt , met with resistance from german government officials because of his links with scientology . the officials later changed tack and allowed the filming to go ahead .
cruise 's role in scientology is examined in an explosive unauthorized biography of the actor by british writer andrew morton which hit shelves in the united states earlier this month . the publication of the book has been given wide coverage in german media .
it was described by scientology as " replete with lies . " karin pouw said germany had misunderstood the us actor .

cruise 's role in scientology is examined in an explosive unauthorized biography of the actor by british writer andrew morton which hit shelves in the united states earlier this month . the publication of the book has been given wide coverage in german media .
it was described by scientology as " replete with lies . " karin pouw said germany had misunderstood the us actor .

" the church of scientology , of which cruise is a leading member , reacted furiously to a newspaper interview by german historian guido knopp in which he drew parallels between the hollywood star and nazi propaganda minister joseph goebbels . " bild am sonntag is grossly irresponsible for publishing horrendous and disgraceful claims about mr. cruise , " the church 's public affairs director , karin pouw said , referring to the german mass-selling tabloid which published the interview . pouw said the footage , which surfaced on the youtube web site this week , was a pirated , edited video taken from a three-hour event . " bild am sonntag has disgracefully misinterpreted mr cruise 's remarks , " pouw said .
" he was giving an acceptance speech for a humanitarian award bestowed in honor of his efforts for global literacy .
in doing so , he was urging other people to become involved in similar humanitarian activities to the betterment of all . historian says speech stirs ugly memories knopp , who works for german broadcaster zdf and heads their programs on contemporary history , said over the weekend that the mission impossible star 's speech to other scientology members , leaked on to the internet this week , was reminiscent of a 1943 speech by propaganda minister , joseph göbbels . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : knopp drew parallels between cruise 's speech and that of göbbels , right the speech that cruise made four years ago asks fellow members of the church : " should we clean this place up ? " knopp said it was sure to remind germans of göbbel 's notorious speech in berlin on feb .
18 , 1943 when he asked the audience : " do you want total war ? " " it may be the case that cruise 's delivery style is not uncommon in certain religious movements in the us , " knopp said .
" but for germans with an interest in history , that scene where he asks whether the scientologists should clean up the world and everyone shouts ' yes ' is inevitably reminiscent of göbbel 's notorious speech . " scientology deeply controversial in germany unlike the us , germany does not recognize scientology as a church and there are debates about whether to ban the organization .
the movement is often described as a sect that exploits its members financially .
in december , regional ministers agreed to investigate the possibility of banning it . cruise also sparked controversy in germany last year because of his role as a nazi resistance hero claus schenk von stauffenberg in a new film , " valkyrie " of which he is also the producer .

on jan .
22 , a criminal trial began against four international banks charged with stock manipulation . parmalat was seen as a successful italian dairy company - until 2003 when it became a sensational fraud case .
behind the bright colored milk cartons - and even a soccer team - a financial black hole was growing .
as early as 1993 , parmalat officials allegedly began to cook the books .
on dec .
24 , 2003 , shareholders and bond holders did n't quite receive the christmas present they were after .
parmalat shares lost 97 percent and was de-listed from the stock exchange .
the chief executive officer and five former parmalat executives were arrested and a fraud investigation began .
in 2004 , auditors determined that parmalat had debts of around 14.3 billion euros -lrb- $ 20.9 billion -rrb- . two years after the spills were mopped up , a new parmalat emerged .
investors were n't buying into the milk or cream business , but the chance to recoup losses through a settlement with the banks and accounting firms accused of helping conceal its dire financial condition .
in the meantime , multiple legal skirmishes have been played out in courtrooms in parma and milan . on tuesday , jan .
22 , proceedings began in milan against four large international banks - citigroup , deutsche bank , morgan stanley and ubs - charged with stock manipulation of parmalat bonds sold in 2003 . if the banks are found guilty the banks could face fines of up to 5 million euros and have their profits seized .
a guilty ruling could also open the door to civil proceedings by investors . dw-world.de talked to beppe scienza , a lecturer in financial mathematics at the university of turin and author of the books " the cheated investors " and " stocks , policies and parmalat - what 's the worst ? "
he has been following the financial market for over 30 years . dw-world.de : parmalat was not a small or weak company - it was the eighth largest company in italy and a global brand .
how is it that the so-called coca cola of milk production began to go sour ? beppe scienza : the interesting thing about parmalat is that at the industrial level nothing changed .
the company continued to produce and so the industrial aspect remained untouched .
as for exactly how this happened , no one knows and no one has studied all the factors that led to the collapse .
however , these things often begin because someone is trying to cover up some kind of mistake or some kind of loss .
perhaps they invent an excuse to cover up an imbalance .
no one knows why this was done or where the money has ended up . it 's interesting to note that the parmalat dividends were n't very high and this , among other things , gave faith to investors .
when a dividend is very high there is usually a high risk , but when the dividend is , as in the case of parmalat , only a little high then it gives the idea that the company could be in difficulty , but it does n't indicate that it 's going to collapse . what could have been the role played by international banks , like deutsche bank , in the parmalat scandal ? i do n't think it was really that much different from the role of the italian banks .
they helped to sell shares .
some employee of the bank was probably corrupt , but the banks themselves must have known something .
like the italian banks , they were creditors so they had to replace the money . how important is what happens in the courtroom in milan over the next few months ? in order to write an honest history of what happened with parmalat , it is important because we might be able to understand the dynamics of what caused this to happen .
for the bond holders it could be important if there is a guilty verdict , because then it opens the door for civil cases to obtain compensation . will investors ever recover everything that they lost ? on a large scale : no .
a majority of investors wo n't recover what they lost .
in these cases where there 's a collapse and the money disappears , it 's better not to have the illusion that you will recover everything . what impact has the parmalat scandal had on the food industry in europe ? i think that it has little impact on the food industry .
it was n't really a bankruptcy in the sense that the company was closed down and assets sold off at auction .
the company continued production so from the industry point of view nothing changed . so it was only the investors who found themselves burnt by this scandal ? yes , and the creditors and the banks , which lost a big slice of their money . is the parmalat scandal the worst thing that has happened to italian investors ? the collapse of parmalat was used by the banks to convince individuals not to not buy shares or bonds but put their money into managed investment funds .
it 's true that investors lost a lot of money with parmalat , but if we look at managed investment funds then we discover that the loss to investors is around 20 billion euros .
now , the loss in italy from the parmalat scandal is around 3 billion euros .
unfortunately , the worst things that happen to italian investors are not these company collapses , but rather the mismanagement of managed investment funds . how new is the new parmalat - has anything changed ? the company has maintained the name and the production facilities , but for an investor the past story of parmalat has nothing to do with buying the stock today since all of the company 's debts were wiped out before its re-listing . interview : stephanie raison send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

investors were n't buying into the milk or cream business , but the chance to recoup losses through a settlement with the banks and accounting firms accused of helping conceal its dire financial condition .
in the meantime , multiple legal skirmishes have been played out in courtrooms in parma and milan . on tuesday , jan .
22 , proceedings began in milan against four large international banks - citigroup , deutsche bank , morgan stanley and ubs - charged with stock manipulation of parmalat bonds sold in 2003 . if the banks are found guilty the banks could face fines of up to 5 million euros and have their profits seized .
a guilty ruling could also open the door to civil proceedings by investors . dw-world.de talked to beppe scienza , a lecturer in financial mathematics at the university of turin and author of the books " the cheated investors " and " stocks , policies and parmalat - what 's the worst ? "
he has been following the financial market for over 30 years . dw-world.de : parmalat was not a small or weak company - it was the eighth largest company in italy and a global brand .
how is it that the so-called coca cola of milk production began to go sour ? beppe scienza : the interesting thing about parmalat is that at the industrial level nothing changed .
the company continued to produce and so the industrial aspect remained untouched .
as for exactly how this happened , no one knows and no one has studied all the factors that led to the collapse .
however , these things often begin because someone is trying to cover up some kind of mistake or some kind of loss .
perhaps they invent an excuse to cover up an imbalance .
no one knows why this was done or where the money has ended up . it 's interesting to note that the parmalat dividends were n't very high and this , among other things , gave faith to investors .
when a dividend is very high there is usually a high risk , but when the dividend is , as in the case of parmalat , only a little high then it gives the idea that the company could be in difficulty , but it does n't indicate that it 's going to collapse . what could have been the role played by international banks , like deutsche bank , in the parmalat scandal ? i do n't think it was really that much different from the role of the italian banks .
they helped to sell shares .
some employee of the bank was probably corrupt , but the banks themselves must have known something .
like the italian banks , they were creditors so they had to replace the money . how important is what happens in the courtroom in milan over the next few months ? in order to write an honest history of what happened with parmalat , it is important because we might be able to understand the dynamics of what caused this to happen .
for the bond holders it could be important if there is a guilty verdict , because then it opens the door for civil cases to obtain compensation . will investors ever recover everything that they lost ? on a large scale : no .
a majority of investors wo n't recover what they lost .
in these cases where there 's a collapse and the money disappears , it 's better not to have the illusion that you will recover everything . what impact has the parmalat scandal had on the food industry in europe ? i think that it has little impact on the food industry .
it was n't really a bankruptcy in the sense that the company was closed down and assets sold off at auction .
the company continued production so from the industry point of view nothing changed . so it was only the investors who found themselves burnt by this scandal ? yes , and the creditors and the banks , which lost a big slice of their money . is the parmalat scandal the worst thing that has happened to italian investors ? the collapse of parmalat was used by the banks to convince individuals not to not buy shares or bonds but put their money into managed investment funds .
it 's true that investors lost a lot of money with parmalat , but if we look at managed investment funds then we discover that the loss to investors is around 20 billion euros .
now , the loss in italy from the parmalat scandal is around 3 billion euros .
unfortunately , the worst things that happen to italian investors are not these company collapses , but rather the mismanagement of managed investment funds . how new is the new parmalat - has anything changed ? the company has maintained the name and the production facilities , but for an investor the past story of parmalat has nothing to do with buying the stock today since all of the company 's debts were wiped out before its re-listing . interview : stephanie raison send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

he said the situation in the serbian province remains calm but not stable . brig. gen. robert bund commands the 2,200 soldiers that make up the german contingent in the nato-led kosovo protection force -lrb- kfor -rrb- . dw-world.de : how did you prepare yourself personally for your role as leader of the german contingent in kosovo ? robert bund : i consider myself generally well prepared , especially in the area of leadership , as a result of my previous career assignments during my 40 years of service with the bundeswehr .
moving through the various ranks from company commander -lsb- who is in charge of up to 200 servicemen and women -rsb- all the way up to brigade commander -lsb- who is responsible for some 5,000 soldiers -rsb- , you gain so much experience that you should be ready to successfully confront all the challenges of a foreign operation . like any other soldier , i went through the whole range of preparatory training for this mission .
one hostage exercise we did left an impression .
role-players had to act as realistically as possible and were constantly monitored by psychologists . to round off my technical preparation , i studied the history and the political and social conditions in kosovo intensively .
and , of course , there were intensive talks with my wife and our children as well as with the members of my home church , the free protestant church , to emotionally prepare me for my long tour .
support from family and community makes it easier to take on the burdens of an operation abroad and the separation from home and it can be transformed into something positive . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : better living conditions will keep youth from joining radical groups , said bund how do you motivate your troops ? the leadership principle that i try to put into practice is based on two pillars .
the first pillar is trust . i treat all servicemen and women with unrestricted trust .
this means that i take each one seriously as an individual - with their questions , problems and specialized knowledge .
every single soldier is a specialist in his or her field , and i put my trust in their skills , even in our daily contact with each other .
but this trust also means that each person must be aware of their responsibility , too , and has to act accordingly - that is , responsibly .
i firmly demand this of everyone . the second pillar is comradeship .
back in germany , comradeship is a basic principle , but it plays a much more important role in a foreign operation .
i see comradeship as independent of rank or chain of command .
a particularly important point for me in this respect is looking after each other , taking notice of and dealing with one another in a positive manner and being aware of when others need help . in addition , i continually try to get a feel for the general mood , take notice of problems and explain my position on a whole range of different issues during our meetings .
in other words , i try to stay in touch with my soldiers . i also make use of the camp 's radio station , where all soldiers have the opportunity to ask questions on the air or in writing .
i respond to them during a question-and-answer broadcast called " commander on air . " what have you learned about the culture in kosovo ?
which aspects interest you the most ? i am most interested in the evolution of the political process .
europe and the us have clearly expressed their positions on the matter and the people in kosovo put all their trust in the support from these countries - and their expectations are high . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the people of kosovo want to decide on their future for themselves , said bund i have learned that these people are highly aware of their situation .
they know that never before in their history have they been so close to a potentially historic decision and that anything that deviates from normalcy would jeopardize the current decision process , possibly setting it back for years .
however , they 're not going to wait forever .
that is why we assess the situation as calm but not stable . i have also learned that the people in kosovo are among the youngest in europe .
the average age of the kosovo albanians is about 27 years .
this means that economic development over the next few years is extremely important .
only a significant improvement of the living conditions can prevent the young people from joining more radical movements .
improvement means secure electrical power supply 24 hours a day and modern roads and railway connections to the outside world . what surprised me is the way islam is practiced here .
here in kosovo i was able to gain insight into islamic practices through my many meetings with religious leaders .
i was very impressed that , when the catholic bishop consecrated a new altar , members off different faiths attended the mass and ate together afterwards . on the whole , the people in kosovo want to finally decide for themselves about their future after their long and , at times , tragic history . what is the everyday routine like for you and your soldiers ? the daily routine of my soldiers varies greatly , depending on their respective tasks .
but the overall conditions are the same for all of them .
every soldier without shift duty , night-time operations or other duties works monday through friday from 7:30 a.m. to 7:30 p.m. , but there are many who work beyond that .
on saturday , we start an hour later and on sunday duty is from 1:30 p.m. to 6:30 p.m. another special thing on sunday is that , at 11:00 , we hold our religious service in our small church , which was built by our soldiers a few years ago .
we are always accompanied by our church choir , which i sing in myself . my own daily routine depends on whether talks with politicians or other people are on my schedule .
the morning hours are especially important to me because i can prepare myself for the tasks ahead .
a half hour of bible study helps me get into the mood to go to work . after that , i have various appointments that are coordinated by my military assistant and aide de camp .
there are negotiations with civic representatives , briefings with my advisors and commanders and , of course , visits with the troops at the different field camps in and around prizren . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : kosovo 's political leaders , fatmir sejdiu , left , and hashim thaci , expect much of the eu normally , i am busy every day from about 7:00 a.m. to 9:00 p.m.
but , of course , i am available for all members of the german contingent outside those hours , too . what is your personal goal in kosovo ?
what do you want to leave behind ? the most important goal is get all servicemen and women home again safely . apart from that , i want to contribute to seeing our mission accomplished as well as possible .
to ensure a safe and secure environment and freedom of movement for all ethnic groups .
that the people of kosovo have a positive perspective on their future , and that our servicemen and women are recognized for continuing the tradition of their predecessor under the motto " helping others help themselves . " i want to ensure that , within the framework of our civil-military cooperation , we continue to contribute to the building of a kosovar society and , above all , give the children a better future by building schools and helping them with job qualifications . apart from our military mission we have been able to directly help people living below the poverty threshold with a variety of initiatives supported by donations from germany .
in addition , we 've been able to provide school materials to students . if this has succeeded in assuring the survival of at least a few people or facilitated learning , it is a big enough legacy . interview : kate bowen send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

he said the situation in the serbian province remains calm but not stable . brig. gen. robert bund commands the 2,200 soldiers that make up the german contingent in the nato-led kosovo protection force -lrb- kfor -rrb- . dw-world.de : how did you prepare yourself personally for your role as leader of the german contingent in kosovo ? robert bund : i consider myself generally well prepared , especially in the area of leadership , as a result of my previous career assignments during my 40 years of service with the bundeswehr .
moving through the various ranks from company commander -lsb- who is in charge of up to 200 servicemen and women -rsb- all the way up to brigade commander -lsb- who is responsible for some 5,000 soldiers -rsb- , you gain so much experience that you should be ready to successfully confront all the challenges of a foreign operation . like any other soldier , i went through the whole range of preparatory training for this mission .
one hostage exercise we did left an impression .
role-players had to act as realistically as possible and were constantly monitored by psychologists . to round off my technical preparation , i studied the history and the political and social conditions in kosovo intensively .
and , of course , there were intensive talks with my wife and our children as well as with the members of my home church , the free protestant church , to emotionally prepare me for my long tour .
support from family and community makes it easier to take on the burdens of an operation abroad and the separation from home and it can be transformed into something positive . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : better living conditions will keep youth from joining radical groups , said bund how do you motivate your troops ? the leadership principle that i try to put into practice is based on two pillars .
the first pillar is trust . i treat all servicemen and women with unrestricted trust .
this means that i take each one seriously as an individual - with their questions , problems and specialized knowledge .
every single soldier is a specialist in his or her field , and i put my trust in their skills , even in our daily contact with each other .
but this trust also means that each person must be aware of their responsibility , too , and has to act accordingly - that is , responsibly .
i firmly demand this of everyone . the second pillar is comradeship .
back in germany , comradeship is a basic principle , but it plays a much more important role in a foreign operation .
i see comradeship as independent of rank or chain of command .
a particularly important point for me in this respect is looking after each other , taking notice of and dealing with one another in a positive manner and being aware of when others need help . in addition , i continually try to get a feel for the general mood , take notice of problems and explain my position on a whole range of different issues during our meetings .
in other words , i try to stay in touch with my soldiers . i also make use of the camp 's radio station , where all soldiers have the opportunity to ask questions on the air or in writing .
i respond to them during a question-and-answer broadcast called " commander on air . " what have you learned about the culture in kosovo ?
which aspects interest you the most ? i am most interested in the evolution of the political process .
europe and the us have clearly expressed their positions on the matter and the people in kosovo put all their trust in the support from these countries - and their expectations are high . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the people of kosovo want to decide on their future for themselves , said bund i have learned that these people are highly aware of their situation .
they know that never before in their history have they been so close to a potentially historic decision and that anything that deviates from normalcy would jeopardize the current decision process , possibly setting it back for years .
however , they 're not going to wait forever .
that is why we assess the situation as calm but not stable . i have also learned that the people in kosovo are among the youngest in europe .
the average age of the kosovo albanians is about 27 years .
this means that economic development over the next few years is extremely important .
only a significant improvement of the living conditions can prevent the young people from joining more radical movements .
improvement means secure electrical power supply 24 hours a day and modern roads and railway connections to the outside world . what surprised me is the way islam is practiced here .
here in kosovo i was able to gain insight into islamic practices through my many meetings with religious leaders .
i was very impressed that , when the catholic bishop consecrated a new altar , members off different faiths attended the mass and ate together afterwards . on the whole , the people in kosovo want to finally decide for themselves about their future after their long and , at times , tragic history . what is the everyday routine like for you and your soldiers ? the daily routine of my soldiers varies greatly , depending on their respective tasks .

a half hour of bible study helps me get into the mood to go to work . after that , i have various appointments that are coordinated by my military assistant and aide de camp .

he said the situation in the serbian province remains calm but not stable . brig. gen. robert bund commands the 2,200 soldiers that make up the german contingent in the nato-led kosovo protection force -lrb- kfor -rrb- . dw-world.de : how did you prepare yourself personally for your role as leader of the german contingent in kosovo ? robert bund : i consider myself generally well prepared , especially in the area of leadership , as a result of my previous career assignments during my 40 years of service with the bundeswehr .
moving through the various ranks from company commander -lsb- who is in charge of up to 200 servicemen and women -rsb- all the way up to brigade commander -lsb- who is responsible for some 5,000 soldiers -rsb- , you gain so much experience that you should be ready to successfully confront all the challenges of a foreign operation . like any other soldier , i went through the whole range of preparatory training for this mission .
one hostage exercise we did left an impression .
role-players had to act as realistically as possible and were constantly monitored by psychologists . to round off my technical preparation , i studied the history and the political and social conditions in kosovo intensively .
and , of course , there were intensive talks with my wife and our children as well as with the members of my home church , the free protestant church , to emotionally prepare me for my long tour .
support from family and community makes it easier to take on the burdens of an operation abroad and the separation from home and it can be transformed into something positive . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : better living conditions will keep youth from joining radical groups , said bund how do you motivate your troops ? the leadership principle that i try to put into practice is based on two pillars .
the first pillar is trust . i treat all servicemen and women with unrestricted trust .
this means that i take each one seriously as an individual - with their questions , problems and specialized knowledge .
every single soldier is a specialist in his or her field , and i put my trust in their skills , even in our daily contact with each other .
but this trust also means that each person must be aware of their responsibility , too , and has to act accordingly - that is , responsibly .
i firmly demand this of everyone . the second pillar is comradeship .
back in germany , comradeship is a basic principle , but it plays a much more important role in a foreign operation .
i see comradeship as independent of rank or chain of command .
a particularly important point for me in this respect is looking after each other , taking notice of and dealing with one another in a positive manner and being aware of when others need help . in addition , i continually try to get a feel for the general mood , take notice of problems and explain my position on a whole range of different issues during our meetings .
in other words , i try to stay in touch with my soldiers . i also make use of the camp 's radio station , where all soldiers have the opportunity to ask questions on the air or in writing .
i respond to them during a question-and-answer broadcast called " commander on air . " what have you learned about the culture in kosovo ?
which aspects interest you the most ? i am most interested in the evolution of the political process .
europe and the us have clearly expressed their positions on the matter and the people in kosovo put all their trust in the support from these countries - and their expectations are high . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the people of kosovo want to decide on their future for themselves , said bund i have learned that these people are highly aware of their situation .
they know that never before in their history have they been so close to a potentially historic decision and that anything that deviates from normalcy would jeopardize the current decision process , possibly setting it back for years .
however , they 're not going to wait forever .
that is why we assess the situation as calm but not stable . i have also learned that the people in kosovo are among the youngest in europe .
the average age of the kosovo albanians is about 27 years .
this means that economic development over the next few years is extremely important .
only a significant improvement of the living conditions can prevent the young people from joining more radical movements .
improvement means secure electrical power supply 24 hours a day and modern roads and railway connections to the outside world . what surprised me is the way islam is practiced here .
here in kosovo i was able to gain insight into islamic practices through my many meetings with religious leaders .
i was very impressed that , when the catholic bishop consecrated a new altar , members off different faiths attended the mass and ate together afterwards . on the whole , the people in kosovo want to finally decide for themselves about their future after their long and , at times , tragic history . what is the everyday routine like for you and your soldiers ? the daily routine of my soldiers varies greatly , depending on their respective tasks .
but the overall conditions are the same for all of them .
every soldier without shift duty , night-time operations or other duties works monday through friday from 7:30 a.m. to 7:30 p.m. , but there are many who work beyond that .
on saturday , we start an hour later and on sunday duty is from 1:30 p.m. to 6:30 p.m. another special thing on sunday is that , at 11:00 , we hold our religious service in our small church , which was built by our soldiers a few years ago .
we are always accompanied by our church choir , which i sing in myself . my own daily routine depends on whether talks with politicians or other people are on my schedule .
the morning hours are especially important to me because i can prepare myself for the tasks ahead .
a half hour of bible study helps me get into the mood to go to work . after that , i have various appointments that are coordinated by my military assistant and aide de camp .
there are negotiations with civic representatives , briefings with my advisors and commanders and , of course , visits with the troops at the different field camps in and around prizren . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : kosovo 's political leaders , fatmir sejdiu , left , and hashim thaci , expect much of the eu normally , i am busy every day from about 7:00 a.m. to 9:00 p.m.
but , of course , i am available for all members of the german contingent outside those hours , too . what is your personal goal in kosovo ?
what do you want to leave behind ? the most important goal is get all servicemen and women home again safely . apart from that , i want to contribute to seeing our mission accomplished as well as possible .
to ensure a safe and secure environment and freedom of movement for all ethnic groups .
that the people of kosovo have a positive perspective on their future , and that our servicemen and women are recognized for continuing the tradition of their predecessor under the motto " helping others help themselves . " i want to ensure that , within the framework of our civil-military cooperation , we continue to contribute to the building of a kosovar society and , above all , give the children a better future by building schools and helping them with job qualifications . apart from our military mission we have been able to directly help people living below the poverty threshold with a variety of initiatives supported by donations from germany .
in addition , we 've been able to provide school materials to students . if this has succeeded in assuring the survival of at least a few people or facilitated learning , it is a big enough legacy . interview : kate bowen send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

economists at german banks including dekabank and westlb assess the situation even more modestly , believing that a recession risk stands at only 25 percent . some analysts also point to a university of michigan consumer confidence reading for january , which last week stood at 80.5 percent , up from 75.5 percent in december .
this has led some to believe that consumer sentiment - which helps to drive markets - is up despite fears of a recession . but jörg krämer , chief economist at commerzbank , stressed the complexity of the situation . " we expect the us economy to stagnate in the first half of 2008 , which will feel like a recession , " he said . huge growth on chinese and indian markets bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : china could help balance out other markets other economic analysts have said that even if the us economy were to shrink , the rapidly expanding markets of developing countries in asia could offset a recession in the us , or at least minimize its effects .
after all , consumer growth rates in hong kong , china , thailand , malaysia and india tally up to 15 percent of the global economy . " the us economy is no longer as important for the world economic situation as it used to be , " said dutch world bank economist hans timmer . but krämer - and others - remains skeptical . " to be able to compensate for a us recession , growth in china would have to pick up even more , " said gabriele widmann , a dekabank analyst for the us market , adding that such growth would be difficult as the us is an important destination for asian goods . budgets and companies feeling the credit squeeze pessimists therefore fear that decreasing us demand for asian products could prompt a " domino effect . "
should american consumers lose their desire to buy , the dominos in the markets so dependent on exports to the us could start to tumble . " if growth of the us economy slows by one percent , business activity in germany likewise slows by a half percent , " krämer said . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : japanese and other asian stocks also plunged on monday furthermore , american financial market policies do not necessarily instill hope . us federal reserve bank chairman ben bernanke may have repeatedly lowered the prime interest rate since the mortgage crisis in the us erupted last year , but the lowered interest rates do not have the desired effect where they are most needed .
interest rates on the corporate bond and consumer credit markets have remained the same or have even risen . also , a multi-billion-dollar proposal by us president george w. bush last week to temporarily cut taxes and implement other measures to fend off a possible recession has failed to calm the financial mood . us business activity , after all , has often proven to be resistant to politics .

it would n't be the first time two of germany 's christian churches share houses of worship . the catholic diocese of hildesheim in the northern state of lower saxony on monday , jan .
21 , asked the lutherans in the state for permission to hold religious services in their facilities . the diocese , one of 27 in germany , said it planned to close 80 of its 438 churches due to a budget crunch .
it will also require local communities to pay for the upkeep of dozens more . arend de vries , a senior official in lower saxony 's protestant church said he was open to the idea but would wait for an official request from the diocese before making the catholics an offer . church-goers dwindle both the protestant and catholic state churches can claim 26 million members each nationwide , who support them with a state-imposed church tax .
however , attendance and membership have sunk recently . only 14 percent of catholics attend mass on any given sunday and only 264 men volunteered to become priests last year , germany 's dpa news agency reported . many of the country 's churches , however , are historical landmarks and moves to close under-used houses of worship have come up against protests . if the lutherans in lower saxony agree to share worship space with local catholics , it would n't be a first .

he said the situation in the serbian province remains calm but not stable . brig. gen. robert bund commands the 2,200 soldiers that make up the german contingent in the nato-led kosovo protection force -lrb- kfor -rrb- . dw-world.de : how did you prepare yourself personally for your role as leader of the german contingent in kosovo ? robert bund : i consider myself generally well prepared , especially in the area of leadership , as a result of my previous career assignments during my 40 years of service with the bundeswehr .
moving through the various ranks from company commander -lsb- who is in charge of up to 200 servicemen and women -rsb- all the way up to brigade commander -lsb- who is responsible for some 5,000 soldiers -rsb- , you gain so much experience that you should be ready to successfully confront all the challenges of a foreign operation . like any other soldier , i went through the whole range of preparatory training for this mission .
one hostage exercise we did left an impression .
role-players had to act as realistically as possible and were constantly monitored by psychologists . to round off my technical preparation , i studied the history and the political and social conditions in kosovo intensively .
and , of course , there were intensive talks with my wife and our children as well as with the members of my home church , the free protestant church , to emotionally prepare me for my long tour .
support from family and community makes it easier to take on the burdens of an operation abroad and the separation from home and it can be transformed into something positive . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : better living conditions will keep youth from joining radical groups , said bund how do you motivate your troops ? the leadership principle that i try to put into practice is based on two pillars .
the first pillar is trust . i treat all servicemen and women with unrestricted trust .
this means that i take each one seriously as an individual - with their questions , problems and specialized knowledge .
every single soldier is a specialist in his or her field , and i put my trust in their skills , even in our daily contact with each other .
but this trust also means that each person must be aware of their responsibility , too , and has to act accordingly - that is , responsibly .
i firmly demand this of everyone . the second pillar is comradeship .
back in germany , comradeship is a basic principle , but it plays a much more important role in a foreign operation .
i see comradeship as independent of rank or chain of command .
a particularly important point for me in this respect is looking after each other , taking notice of and dealing with one another in a positive manner and being aware of when others need help . in addition , i continually try to get a feel for the general mood , take notice of problems and explain my position on a whole range of different issues during our meetings .
in other words , i try to stay in touch with my soldiers . i also make use of the camp 's radio station , where all soldiers have the opportunity to ask questions on the air or in writing .
i respond to them during a question-and-answer broadcast called " commander on air . " what have you learned about the culture in kosovo ?
which aspects interest you the most ? i am most interested in the evolution of the political process .
europe and the us have clearly expressed their positions on the matter and the people in kosovo put all their trust in the support from these countries - and their expectations are high . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the people of kosovo want to decide on their future for themselves , said bund i have learned that these people are highly aware of their situation .
they know that never before in their history have they been so close to a potentially historic decision and that anything that deviates from normalcy would jeopardize the current decision process , possibly setting it back for years .
however , they 're not going to wait forever .
that is why we assess the situation as calm but not stable . i have also learned that the people in kosovo are among the youngest in europe .
the average age of the kosovo albanians is about 27 years .
this means that economic development over the next few years is extremely important .
only a significant improvement of the living conditions can prevent the young people from joining more radical movements .
improvement means secure electrical power supply 24 hours a day and modern roads and railway connections to the outside world . what surprised me is the way islam is practiced here .
here in kosovo i was able to gain insight into islamic practices through my many meetings with religious leaders .
i was very impressed that , when the catholic bishop consecrated a new altar , members off different faiths attended the mass and ate together afterwards . on the whole , the people in kosovo want to finally decide for themselves about their future after their long and , at times , tragic history . what is the everyday routine like for you and your soldiers ? the daily routine of my soldiers varies greatly , depending on their respective tasks .
but the overall conditions are the same for all of them .
every soldier without shift duty , night-time operations or other duties works monday through friday from 7:30 a.m. to 7:30 p.m. , but there are many who work beyond that .
on saturday , we start an hour later and on sunday duty is from 1:30 p.m. to 6:30 p.m. another special thing on sunday is that , at 11:00 , we hold our religious service in our small church , which was built by our soldiers a few years ago .
we are always accompanied by our church choir , which i sing in myself . my own daily routine depends on whether talks with politicians or other people are on my schedule .
the morning hours are especially important to me because i can prepare myself for the tasks ahead .
a half hour of bible study helps me get into the mood to go to work . after that , i have various appointments that are coordinated by my military assistant and aide de camp .
there are negotiations with civic representatives , briefings with my advisors and commanders and , of course , visits with the troops at the different field camps in and around prizren . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : kosovo 's political leaders , fatmir sejdiu , left , and hashim thaci , expect much of the eu normally , i am busy every day from about 7:00 a.m. to 9:00 p.m.
but , of course , i am available for all members of the german contingent outside those hours , too . what is your personal goal in kosovo ?
what do you want to leave behind ? the most important goal is get all servicemen and women home again safely . apart from that , i want to contribute to seeing our mission accomplished as well as possible .
to ensure a safe and secure environment and freedom of movement for all ethnic groups .
that the people of kosovo have a positive perspective on their future , and that our servicemen and women are recognized for continuing the tradition of their predecessor under the motto " helping others help themselves . " i want to ensure that , within the framework of our civil-military cooperation , we continue to contribute to the building of a kosovar society and , above all , give the children a better future by building schools and helping them with job qualifications . apart from our military mission we have been able to directly help people living below the poverty threshold with a variety of initiatives supported by donations from germany .
in addition , we 've been able to provide school materials to students . if this has succeeded in assuring the survival of at least a few people or facilitated learning , it is a big enough legacy . interview : kate bowen send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de economy -pipe- 22.01.2008 effects of us recession could be held at bay , experts say großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : some experts said the us has become less important for the global economy global markets have plunged , partly due to fear of a recession in the united states , the world 's biggest economy .
but european experts say dynamic developing countries like china could offset us troubles . looking at the way the markets have plummeted , it appears an old adage rings true : " when the us sneezes , the rest of the world gets a cold . " panic spread across the frankfurt trading floor on monday , jan .
21 , when the country 's dax index experienced its biggest plunge since the sept .
11 , 2001 terrorist attacks in the united states . fears of a us recession , partly sparked by the recent credit crisis , and the possibility that it could lead to an international economic crisis also sent other european and asian into nose dives . over-sensitivity of markets ? bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : traders at the stock exchange in frankfurt tried to fend off panic yet , despite the panic , a majority of finance experts estimate the likelihood of a us recession at only 40 percent .
economists at german banks including dekabank and westlb assess the situation even more modestly , believing that a recession risk stands at only 25 percent . some analysts also point to a university of michigan consumer confidence reading for january , which last week stood at 80.5 percent , up from 75.5 percent in december .
this has led some to believe that consumer sentiment - which helps to drive markets - is up despite fears of a recession . but jörg krämer , chief economist at commerzbank , stressed the complexity of the situation . " we expect the us economy to stagnate in the first half of 2008 , which will feel like a recession , " he said . huge growth on chinese and indian markets bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : china could help balance out other markets other economic analysts have said that even if the us economy were to shrink , the rapidly expanding markets of developing countries in asia could offset a recession in the us , or at least minimize its effects .
after all , consumer growth rates in hong kong , china , thailand , malaysia and india tally up to 15 percent of the global economy . " the us economy is no longer as important for the world economic situation as it used to be , " said dutch world bank economist hans timmer . but krämer - and others - remains skeptical . " to be able to compensate for a us recession , growth in china would have to pick up even more , " said gabriele widmann , a dekabank analyst for the us market , adding that such growth would be difficult as the us is an important destination for asian goods . budgets and companies feeling the credit squeeze pessimists therefore fear that decreasing us demand for asian products could prompt a " domino effect . "
should american consumers lose their desire to buy , the dominos in the markets so dependent on exports to the us could start to tumble . " if growth of the us economy slows by one percent , business activity in germany likewise slows by a half percent , " krämer said . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : japanese and other asian stocks also plunged on monday furthermore , american financial market policies do not necessarily instill hope . us federal reserve bank chairman ben bernanke may have repeatedly lowered the prime interest rate since the mortgage crisis in the us erupted last year , but the lowered interest rates do not have the desired effect where they are most needed .
interest rates on the corporate bond and consumer credit markets have remained the same or have even risen . also , a multi-billion-dollar proposal by us president george w. bush last week to temporarily cut taxes and implement other measures to fend off a possible recession has failed to calm the financial mood . us business activity , after all , has often proven to be resistant to politics .
the wall street journal recently summarized it as such : " we have tried tax breaks before .
they do n't work . " dekabank economist widmann is also certain : " the plan will just be a flash in the pan .
it would only relieve the situation short-term . " angela göpfert -lrb- als -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

he said the situation in the serbian province remains calm but not stable . brig. gen. robert bund commands the 2,200 soldiers that make up the german contingent in the nato-led kosovo protection force -lrb- kfor -rrb- . dw-world.de : how did you prepare yourself personally for your role as leader of the german contingent in kosovo ? robert bund : i consider myself generally well prepared , especially in the area of leadership , as a result of my previous career assignments during my 40 years of service with the bundeswehr .
moving through the various ranks from company commander -lsb- who is in charge of up to 200 servicemen and women -rsb- all the way up to brigade commander -lsb- who is responsible for some 5,000 soldiers -rsb- , you gain so much experience that you should be ready to successfully confront all the challenges of a foreign operation . like any other soldier , i went through the whole range of preparatory training for this mission .
one hostage exercise we did left an impression .
role-players had to act as realistically as possible and were constantly monitored by psychologists . to round off my technical preparation , i studied the history and the political and social conditions in kosovo intensively .
and , of course , there were intensive talks with my wife and our children as well as with the members of my home church , the free protestant church , to emotionally prepare me for my long tour .
support from family and community makes it easier to take on the burdens of an operation abroad and the separation from home and it can be transformed into something positive . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : better living conditions will keep youth from joining radical groups , said bund how do you motivate your troops ? the leadership principle that i try to put into practice is based on two pillars .
the first pillar is trust . i treat all servicemen and women with unrestricted trust .
this means that i take each one seriously as an individual - with their questions , problems and specialized knowledge .
every single soldier is a specialist in his or her field , and i put my trust in their skills , even in our daily contact with each other .
but this trust also means that each person must be aware of their responsibility , too , and has to act accordingly - that is , responsibly .
i firmly demand this of everyone . the second pillar is comradeship .
back in germany , comradeship is a basic principle , but it plays a much more important role in a foreign operation .
i see comradeship as independent of rank or chain of command .
a particularly important point for me in this respect is looking after each other , taking notice of and dealing with one another in a positive manner and being aware of when others need help . in addition , i continually try to get a feel for the general mood , take notice of problems and explain my position on a whole range of different issues during our meetings .
in other words , i try to stay in touch with my soldiers . i also make use of the camp 's radio station , where all soldiers have the opportunity to ask questions on the air or in writing .
i respond to them during a question-and-answer broadcast called " commander on air . " what have you learned about the culture in kosovo ?
which aspects interest you the most ? i am most interested in the evolution of the political process .
europe and the us have clearly expressed their positions on the matter and the people in kosovo put all their trust in the support from these countries - and their expectations are high . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the people of kosovo want to decide on their future for themselves , said bund i have learned that these people are highly aware of their situation .
they know that never before in their history have they been so close to a potentially historic decision and that anything that deviates from normalcy would jeopardize the current decision process , possibly setting it back for years .
however , they 're not going to wait forever .
that is why we assess the situation as calm but not stable . i have also learned that the people in kosovo are among the youngest in europe .
the average age of the kosovo albanians is about 27 years .
this means that economic development over the next few years is extremely important .
only a significant improvement of the living conditions can prevent the young people from joining more radical movements .
improvement means secure electrical power supply 24 hours a day and modern roads and railway connections to the outside world . what surprised me is the way islam is practiced here .
here in kosovo i was able to gain insight into islamic practices through my many meetings with religious leaders .
i was very impressed that , when the catholic bishop consecrated a new altar , members off different faiths attended the mass and ate together afterwards . on the whole , the people in kosovo want to finally decide for themselves about their future after their long and , at times , tragic history . what is the everyday routine like for you and your soldiers ? the daily routine of my soldiers varies greatly , depending on their respective tasks .
but the overall conditions are the same for all of them .
every soldier without shift duty , night-time operations or other duties works monday through friday from 7:30 a.m. to 7:30 p.m. , but there are many who work beyond that .
on saturday , we start an hour later and on sunday duty is from 1:30 p.m. to 6:30 p.m. another special thing on sunday is that , at 11:00 , we hold our religious service in our small church , which was built by our soldiers a few years ago .
we are always accompanied by our church choir , which i sing in myself . my own daily routine depends on whether talks with politicians or other people are on my schedule .
the morning hours are especially important to me because i can prepare myself for the tasks ahead .
a half hour of bible study helps me get into the mood to go to work . after that , i have various appointments that are coordinated by my military assistant and aide de camp .
there are negotiations with civic representatives , briefings with my advisors and commanders and , of course , visits with the troops at the different field camps in and around prizren . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : kosovo 's political leaders , fatmir sejdiu , left , and hashim thaci , expect much of the eu normally , i am busy every day from about 7:00 a.m. to 9:00 p.m.
but , of course , i am available for all members of the german contingent outside those hours , too . what is your personal goal in kosovo ?
what do you want to leave behind ? the most important goal is get all servicemen and women home again safely . apart from that , i want to contribute to seeing our mission accomplished as well as possible .
to ensure a safe and secure environment and freedom of movement for all ethnic groups .
that the people of kosovo have a positive perspective on their future , and that our servicemen and women are recognized for continuing the tradition of their predecessor under the motto " helping others help themselves . " i want to ensure that , within the framework of our civil-military cooperation , we continue to contribute to the building of a kosovar society and , above all , give the children a better future by building schools and helping them with job qualifications . apart from our military mission we have been able to directly help people living below the poverty threshold with a variety of initiatives supported by donations from germany .
in addition , we 've been able to provide school materials to students . if this has succeeded in assuring the survival of at least a few people or facilitated learning , it is a big enough legacy . interview : kate bowen send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de economy -pipe- 22.01.2008 effects of us recession could be held at bay , experts say großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : some experts said the us has become less important for the global economy global markets have plunged , partly due to fear of a recession in the united states , the world 's biggest economy .
but european experts say dynamic developing countries like china could offset us troubles . looking at the way the markets have plummeted , it appears an old adage rings true : " when the us sneezes , the rest of the world gets a cold . " panic spread across the frankfurt trading floor on monday , jan .
21 , when the country 's dax index experienced its biggest plunge since the sept .
11 , 2001 terrorist attacks in the united states . fears of a us recession , partly sparked by the recent credit crisis , and the possibility that it could lead to an international economic crisis also sent other european and asian into nose dives . over-sensitivity of markets ? bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : traders at the stock exchange in frankfurt tried to fend off panic yet , despite the panic , a majority of finance experts estimate the likelihood of a us recession at only 40 percent .
economists at german banks including dekabank and westlb assess the situation even more modestly , believing that a recession risk stands at only 25 percent . some analysts also point to a university of michigan consumer confidence reading for january , which last week stood at 80.5 percent , up from 75.5 percent in december .
this has led some to believe that consumer sentiment - which helps to drive markets - is up despite fears of a recession . but jörg krämer , chief economist at commerzbank , stressed the complexity of the situation . " we expect the us economy to stagnate in the first half of 2008 , which will feel like a recession , " he said . huge growth on chinese and indian markets bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : china could help balance out other markets other economic analysts have said that even if the us economy were to shrink , the rapidly expanding markets of developing countries in asia could offset a recession in the us , or at least minimize its effects .
after all , consumer growth rates in hong kong , china , thailand , malaysia and india tally up to 15 percent of the global economy . " the us economy is no longer as important for the world economic situation as it used to be , " said dutch world bank economist hans timmer . but krämer - and others - remains skeptical . " to be able to compensate for a us recession , growth in china would have to pick up even more , " said gabriele widmann , a dekabank analyst for the us market , adding that such growth would be difficult as the us is an important destination for asian goods . budgets and companies feeling the credit squeeze pessimists therefore fear that decreasing us demand for asian products could prompt a " domino effect . "
should american consumers lose their desire to buy , the dominos in the markets so dependent on exports to the us could start to tumble . " if growth of the us economy slows by one percent , business activity in germany likewise slows by a half percent , " krämer said . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : japanese and other asian stocks also plunged on monday furthermore , american financial market policies do not necessarily instill hope . us federal reserve bank chairman ben bernanke may have repeatedly lowered the prime interest rate since the mortgage crisis in the us erupted last year , but the lowered interest rates do not have the desired effect where they are most needed .
interest rates on the corporate bond and consumer credit markets have remained the same or have even risen . also , a multi-billion-dollar proposal by us president george w. bush last week to temporarily cut taxes and implement other measures to fend off a possible recession has failed to calm the financial mood . us business activity , after all , has often proven to be resistant to politics .
the wall street journal recently summarized it as such : " we have tried tax breaks before .
they do n't work . " dekabank economist widmann is also certain : " the plan will just be a flash in the pan .
it would only relieve the situation short-term . " angela göpfert -lrb- als -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

" the church of scientology , of which cruise is a leading member , reacted furiously to a newspaper interview by german historian guido knopp in which he drew parallels between the hollywood star and nazi propaganda minister joseph goebbels . " bild am sonntag is grossly irresponsible for publishing horrendous and disgraceful claims about mr. cruise , " the church 's public affairs director , karin pouw said , referring to the german mass-selling tabloid which published the interview . pouw said the footage , which surfaced on the youtube web site this week , was a pirated , edited video taken from a three-hour event . " bild am sonntag has disgracefully misinterpreted mr cruise 's remarks , " pouw said .
" he was giving an acceptance speech for a humanitarian award bestowed in honor of his efforts for global literacy .
in doing so , he was urging other people to become involved in similar humanitarian activities to the betterment of all . historian says speech stirs ugly memories knopp , who works for german broadcaster zdf and heads their programs on contemporary history , said over the weekend that the mission impossible star 's speech to other scientology members , leaked on to the internet this week , was reminiscent of a 1943 speech by propaganda minister , joseph göbbels . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : knopp drew parallels between cruise 's speech and that of göbbels , right the speech that cruise made four years ago asks fellow members of the church : " should we clean this place up ? " knopp said it was sure to remind germans of göbbel 's notorious speech in berlin on feb .
18 , 1943 when he asked the audience : " do you want total war ? " " it may be the case that cruise 's delivery style is not uncommon in certain religious movements in the us , " knopp said .
" but for germans with an interest in history , that scene where he asks whether the scientologists should clean up the world and everyone shouts ' yes ' is inevitably reminiscent of göbbel 's notorious speech . " scientology deeply controversial in germany unlike the us , germany does not recognize scientology as a church and there are debates about whether to ban the organization .
the movement is often described as a sect that exploits its members financially .
in december , regional ministers agreed to investigate the possibility of banning it . cruise also sparked controversy in germany last year because of his role as a nazi resistance hero claus schenk von stauffenberg in a new film , " valkyrie " of which he is also the producer .
von stauffenberg led the failed valkyrie plot , from which the film takes its name , to assassinate adolf hitler in 1944 . cruise 's plans to film a part of the film at the german defense ministry in berlin , where stauffenberg was executed after the failed assassination attempt , met with resistance from german government officials because of his links with scientology . the officials later changed tack and allowed the filming to go ahead .
cruise 's role in scientology is examined in an explosive unauthorized biography of the actor by british writer andrew morton which hit shelves in the united states earlier this month . the publication of the book has been given wide coverage in german media .
it was described by scientology as " replete with lies . " karin pouw said germany had misunderstood the us actor . " anyone who knows mr cruise knows that he does not have a prejudicial bone in his body and that , unlike bild am sonntag and other german anti-religionists , he does not discriminate against any other religion , race or color .

11 , 2001 .
but many european editorialists do n't see a need for major panic . " the fear that europe and asia will be infected by the us recession has sent the stock market plummeting , " wrote germany 's financial daily handelsblatt from düsseldorf .
" but panic is a bad advisor .
no investor can win by fleeing the market . -lsb- ... -rsb-
on the contrary , fear offers opportunities for hefty market returns in the next few months . " in germany , hope lies in private consumption , considering the recent recovery of the job market , " continued the paper .
" germans need a long time to bring themselves to purchase a car , furniture or other large items .

11 , 2001 the frankfurter allgemeine zeitung commented from germany 's financial capital on the main river that " there 's no reason for panic at the moment , " adding that there is " unfortunately also no reason for confidence . " " the severe setback in the german stock market destroyed the hope that has been fostered over the last few months that the german exchange could be uncoupled from international developments on the financial markets and that domestic stocks were more secure than american or european stocks . " the possibility ca n't be excluded that the situation in the industrial nations will become noticeably worse , " the paper wrote .
" there are many indications that the tendencies on the international stock markets will continue to be driven by developments in the united states . " paris ' liberation , on the other hand , found fault with politics and with the markets themselves .
it wrote tuesday that the financial markets , " heated by their ultraliberal dogmas , have rejected every attempt at regulation .
they have asserted that the divine market would find the remedy for its imbalance on its own .
but the only remedy that has resulted - as in all crises caused by speculation - is a crash . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : germans are cautious but strong buyers , wrote one paper " the whole thing would be tolerable if it just affected the irrational world of financial markets , which are getting a harsh blow from tumbling prices and the loss of capital , " the french paper opined .
" that 's how it goes in a world of crazy money , in which politics has abdicated and left it to the economy . " writing from london , the financial times said " data this year have confirmed trends that had looked worrying for months , such as the fallout from the us housing slump and the crisis in the credit markets " but that " it has brought no true shocks .
equity markets ' success in avoiding a sell-off for so long is more surprising than their recent and sudden capitulation . " big sell-offs are usually followed by a bounce , " continued the paper .
" but popular measures of sentiment had already turned so bearish by the end of last week that they signaled an imminent bounce .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de media -pipe- 22.01.2008 experts : no ulterior motives behind french sarkozy-bruni affair großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : sarkozy 's refusal to confirm marriage rumors fuels even more press speculation nicolas sarkozy 's relationship with carla bruni has led to speculation that the french president is trying to cover up political problems .
but insiders say the affair sets a precedent in a totally different way . french president nicolas sarkozy has broken with precedent like no other occupant of the elysee palace . the son of a hungarian aristocrat and grandson of a greek-jewish doctor , he embodies the multi-ethnic diversity of france that is reflected in some of his cabinet choices .
half of all top ministerial posts are filled by women , the highest proportion ever in france .
sarkozy , whose gaullist party ump is right of center , has even poached some of the best minds from his socialist rivals , such as the unusual choice of bernard kouchner , a medical doctor , as foreign minister . in october , sarkozy became the first head of state not only to divorce , but to do so in office , which prompted the release of three best-selling books about his ex-wife , cecilia ciganer . " speedy sarko " captivates public with new love bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : sarkozy waited until after the elections to get divorced from cecilia then one saturday afternoon in mid-december he showed up in disneyland paris with his new flame , carla bruni .
since then , the public has been bombarded with images of the italian ex-supermodel turned pop singer and the details of her past relationships with rock stars , actors and france 's literati .
bruni 's uncanny physical resemblance to cecilia - both are tall , striking blue-eyed brunettes , has all of france putting the president on the psychoanalyst 's couch debating whether " speedy sarko " is now suddenly on the rebound after his ex had ceremoniously left him . in news reports , prime minister francois fillon had even complained that the president was behaving like a love-struck teenager at cabinet meetings . " he giggles , " said fillon in an interview with the widely respected french satirical newspaper le canard enchaine .
" when we talk to him , he does not always listen .
he cancels meetings , which is not like him . " on jan .
8 at a lengthy news conference , the 52-year-old president admitted to a " serious relationship " with bruni , 40 , and talked about the emotional pain of divorce .
but his refusal to confirm or deny marriage rumors has only fuelled even more press speculation about the couple 's intentions . no more taboos on discussing a president 's love life that sarkozy himself even discussed his private life at all in such a public forum however was remarkable and unprecedented in the annals of presidential history , according to french sociologists and media watchers . although the sexual peccadilloes of former presidents such as francois mitterrand , who had fathered a daughter out of wedlock , were long known to media insiders , there used to be a silent pact among journalists that the private lives of top politicians were off-limits , according to denis muzet , founder of the paris-based politics and media institute , mediascopie . " taboos have been lifted , " said muzet , who explained that once bernadette , the wife of former president jacques chirac published her popular memoirs about her husband 's infidelities , the floodgates started to open and in a sense liberated the couple from the constraints of the presidency . " the rules have been changing considerably since the death of princess diana 10 years ago , " he added .
" what i call ' peoplization of the press ' is so banal now that even the serious press jumps on the bandwagon . " sarkozy , whose political mentor was chirac , has simply gone much further than his predecessor in exposing his private life to public view . french press freer than ever to set the agenda bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the portrait of an attractive , harmonious family helps the presidential image " he wants to show that even presidents live , love and suffer like ordinary people , " said muzet , who dismissed suggestions that sarkozy is trying to divert the french from real problems their country faces from social unrest in the immigrant suburbs to rising consumer prices that have diminished purchasing power .
" he wants to show he is transparent and has nothing to hide , down to photos of him on the beach in his swimming trunks . " thierry saussez , a close personal advisor to the president who founded the corporate communications agency image et strategie europe , also emphasized that sarkozy is not trying to deflect the country 's focus from the economic slowdown by flaunting his private life as a few commentators have suggested .
the french press is now freer than ever to set the agenda , he said . " under mitterrand , journalists and others who knew about mitterrand 's illegitimate daughter were under tremendous pressure to keep his double life under wraps , " said saussez , who explained that the public has become so saturated with intimate images of their president enjoying the egyptian pyramids with bruni during the christmas holidays that it has contributed to a drop in the polls .
" and now it 's gone the other way with too much exposure of a president 's private life . " for the first time since sarkozy assumed office in may when he was riding a wave of popularity with two-thirds of the public supporting him , his approvals ratings have now dipped to below 50 percent , according to all pollsters .
but saussez was careful to point out that the bruni brouhaha is only part of the reason for the poll results . " the public needs assurances that the president is working hard and doing his job , not just having fun , " he said .
" but the french are also a very impatient people and they want the president to fix their problems right away . " are they getting married ? bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : bruni looks like a younger version of sarkozy 's ex-wife , who was also a model but did sarkozy have to make disneyland of all places , the site for his first very public outing with bruni ? " sarkozy is behaving in a way that no french president has , " said helene brunerie , a french artist living in germany .
" he 's divorced and suddenly in the arms of a top model . " on one hand i 'm glad that the press in france has the freedom to be so colorful and uninhibited , but the image of the french president that is being projected to the world is undignified , " she added , reflecting the view of many french citizens living abroad . to both sarkozy admirers and detractors , the image problem can at least be partially fixed if he tied the knot with bruni . for one it would solve sticky protocol problems when they travel abroad on official presidential visits as a couple .
on friday , the french president will be in india , where officials are beside themselves about whether to give bruni the first lady or the girlfriend treatment . saussez predicted that bruni will not go , thereby keeping the public guessing about his marital status .

it would n't be the first time two of germany 's christian churches share houses of worship . the catholic diocese of hildesheim in the northern state of lower saxony on monday , jan .
21 , asked the lutherans in the state for permission to hold religious services in their facilities . the diocese , one of 27 in germany , said it planned to close 80 of its 438 churches due to a budget crunch .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de media -pipe- 22.01.2008 experts : no ulterior motives behind french sarkozy-bruni affair großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : sarkozy 's refusal to confirm marriage rumors fuels even more press speculation nicolas sarkozy 's relationship with carla bruni has led to speculation that the french president is trying to cover up political problems .
but insiders say the affair sets a precedent in a totally different way . french president nicolas sarkozy has broken with precedent like no other occupant of the elysee palace . the son of a hungarian aristocrat and grandson of a greek-jewish doctor , he embodies the multi-ethnic diversity of france that is reflected in some of his cabinet choices .
half of all top ministerial posts are filled by women , the highest proportion ever in france .
sarkozy , whose gaullist party ump is right of center , has even poached some of the best minds from his socialist rivals , such as the unusual choice of bernard kouchner , a medical doctor , as foreign minister . in october , sarkozy became the first head of state not only to divorce , but to do so in office , which prompted the release of three best-selling books about his ex-wife , cecilia ciganer . " speedy sarko " captivates public with new love bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : sarkozy waited until after the elections to get divorced from cecilia then one saturday afternoon in mid-december he showed up in disneyland paris with his new flame , carla bruni .
since then , the public has been bombarded with images of the italian ex-supermodel turned pop singer and the details of her past relationships with rock stars , actors and france 's literati .
bruni 's uncanny physical resemblance to cecilia - both are tall , striking blue-eyed brunettes , has all of france putting the president on the psychoanalyst 's couch debating whether " speedy sarko " is now suddenly on the rebound after his ex had ceremoniously left him . in news reports , prime minister francois fillon had even complained that the president was behaving like a love-struck teenager at cabinet meetings . " he giggles , " said fillon in an interview with the widely respected french satirical newspaper le canard enchaine .
" when we talk to him , he does not always listen .
he cancels meetings , which is not like him . " on jan .
8 at a lengthy news conference , the 52-year-old president admitted to a " serious relationship " with bruni , 40 , and talked about the emotional pain of divorce .
but his refusal to confirm or deny marriage rumors has only fuelled even more press speculation about the couple 's intentions . no more taboos on discussing a president 's love life that sarkozy himself even discussed his private life at all in such a public forum however was remarkable and unprecedented in the annals of presidential history , according to french sociologists and media watchers . although the sexual peccadilloes of former presidents such as francois mitterrand , who had fathered a daughter out of wedlock , were long known to media insiders , there used to be a silent pact among journalists that the private lives of top politicians were off-limits , according to denis muzet , founder of the paris-based politics and media institute , mediascopie . " taboos have been lifted , " said muzet , who explained that once bernadette , the wife of former president jacques chirac published her popular memoirs about her husband 's infidelities , the floodgates started to open and in a sense liberated the couple from the constraints of the presidency . " the rules have been changing considerably since the death of princess diana 10 years ago , " he added .
" what i call ' peoplization of the press ' is so banal now that even the serious press jumps on the bandwagon . " sarkozy , whose political mentor was chirac , has simply gone much further than his predecessor in exposing his private life to public view . french press freer than ever to set the agenda bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the portrait of an attractive , harmonious family helps the presidential image " he wants to show that even presidents live , love and suffer like ordinary people , " said muzet , who dismissed suggestions that sarkozy is trying to divert the french from real problems their country faces from social unrest in the immigrant suburbs to rising consumer prices that have diminished purchasing power .
" he wants to show he is transparent and has nothing to hide , down to photos of him on the beach in his swimming trunks . " thierry saussez , a close personal advisor to the president who founded the corporate communications agency image et strategie europe , also emphasized that sarkozy is not trying to deflect the country 's focus from the economic slowdown by flaunting his private life as a few commentators have suggested .
the french press is now freer than ever to set the agenda , he said . " under mitterrand , journalists and others who knew about mitterrand 's illegitimate daughter were under tremendous pressure to keep his double life under wraps , " said saussez , who explained that the public has become so saturated with intimate images of their president enjoying the egyptian pyramids with bruni during the christmas holidays that it has contributed to a drop in the polls .
" and now it 's gone the other way with too much exposure of a president 's private life . " for the first time since sarkozy assumed office in may when he was riding a wave of popularity with two-thirds of the public supporting him , his approvals ratings have now dipped to below 50 percent , according to all pollsters .
but saussez was careful to point out that the bruni brouhaha is only part of the reason for the poll results . " the public needs assurances that the president is working hard and doing his job , not just having fun , " he said .
" but the french are also a very impatient people and they want the president to fix their problems right away . " are they getting married ? bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : bruni looks like a younger version of sarkozy 's ex-wife , who was also a model but did sarkozy have to make disneyland of all places , the site for his first very public outing with bruni ? " sarkozy is behaving in a way that no french president has , " said helene brunerie , a french artist living in germany .
" he 's divorced and suddenly in the arms of a top model . " on one hand i 'm glad that the press in france has the freedom to be so colorful and uninhibited , but the image of the french president that is being projected to the world is undignified , " she added , reflecting the view of many french citizens living abroad . to both sarkozy admirers and detractors , the image problem can at least be partially fixed if he tied the knot with bruni . for one it would solve sticky protocol problems when they travel abroad on official presidential visits as a couple .
on friday , the french president will be in india , where officials are beside themselves about whether to give bruni the first lady or the girlfriend treatment . saussez predicted that bruni will not go , thereby keeping the public guessing about his marital status . " the president needs to get married , " he said . diana fong send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

but insiders say the affair sets a precedent in a totally different way . french president nicolas sarkozy has broken with precedent like no other occupant of the elysee palace . the son of a hungarian aristocrat and grandson of a greek-jewish doctor , he embodies the multi-ethnic diversity of france that is reflected in some of his cabinet choices .
half of all top ministerial posts are filled by women , the highest proportion ever in france .
sarkozy , whose gaullist party ump is right of center , has even poached some of the best minds from his socialist rivals , such as the unusual choice of bernard kouchner , a medical doctor , as foreign minister . in october , sarkozy became the first head of state not only to divorce , but to do so in office , which prompted the release of three best-selling books about his ex-wife , cecilia ciganer . " speedy sarko " captivates public with new love bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : sarkozy waited until after the elections to get divorced from cecilia then one saturday afternoon in mid-december he showed up in disneyland paris with his new flame , carla bruni .
since then , the public has been bombarded with images of the italian ex-supermodel turned pop singer and the details of her past relationships with rock stars , actors and france 's literati .
bruni 's uncanny physical resemblance to cecilia - both are tall , striking blue-eyed brunettes , has all of france putting the president on the psychoanalyst 's couch debating whether " speedy sarko " is now suddenly on the rebound after his ex had ceremoniously left him . in news reports , prime minister francois fillon had even complained that the president was behaving like a love-struck teenager at cabinet meetings . " he giggles , " said fillon in an interview with the widely respected french satirical newspaper le canard enchaine .
" when we talk to him , he does not always listen .
he cancels meetings , which is not like him . " on jan .
8 at a lengthy news conference , the 52-year-old president admitted to a " serious relationship " with bruni , 40 , and talked about the emotional pain of divorce .
but his refusal to confirm or deny marriage rumors has only fuelled even more press speculation about the couple 's intentions . no more taboos on discussing a president 's love life that sarkozy himself even discussed his private life at all in such a public forum however was remarkable and unprecedented in the annals of presidential history , according to french sociologists and media watchers . although the sexual peccadilloes of former presidents such as francois mitterrand , who had fathered a daughter out of wedlock , were long known to media insiders , there used to be a silent pact among journalists that the private lives of top politicians were off-limits , according to denis muzet , founder of the paris-based politics and media institute , mediascopie . " taboos have been lifted , " said muzet , who explained that once bernadette , the wife of former president jacques chirac published her popular memoirs about her husband 's infidelities , the floodgates started to open and in a sense liberated the couple from the constraints of the presidency . " the rules have been changing considerably since the death of princess diana 10 years ago , " he added .
" what i call ' peoplization of the press ' is so banal now that even the serious press jumps on the bandwagon . " sarkozy , whose political mentor was chirac , has simply gone much further than his predecessor in exposing his private life to public view . french press freer than ever to set the agenda bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the portrait of an attractive , harmonious family helps the presidential image " he wants to show that even presidents live , love and suffer like ordinary people , " said muzet , who dismissed suggestions that sarkozy is trying to divert the french from real problems their country faces from social unrest in the immigrant suburbs to rising consumer prices that have diminished purchasing power .
" he wants to show he is transparent and has nothing to hide , down to photos of him on the beach in his swimming trunks . " thierry saussez , a close personal advisor to the president who founded the corporate communications agency image et strategie europe , also emphasized that sarkozy is not trying to deflect the country 's focus from the economic slowdown by flaunting his private life as a few commentators have suggested .
the french press is now freer than ever to set the agenda , he said . " under mitterrand , journalists and others who knew about mitterrand 's illegitimate daughter were under tremendous pressure to keep his double life under wraps , " said saussez , who explained that the public has become so saturated with intimate images of their president enjoying the egyptian pyramids with bruni during the christmas holidays that it has contributed to a drop in the polls .
" and now it 's gone the other way with too much exposure of a president 's private life . " for the first time since sarkozy assumed office in may when he was riding a wave of popularity with two-thirds of the public supporting him , his approvals ratings have now dipped to below 50 percent , according to all pollsters .
but saussez was careful to point out that the bruni brouhaha is only part of the reason for the poll results . " the public needs assurances that the president is working hard and doing his job , not just having fun , " he said .
" but the french are also a very impatient people and they want the president to fix their problems right away . " are they getting married ? bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : bruni looks like a younger version of sarkozy 's ex-wife , who was also a model but did sarkozy have to make disneyland of all places , the site for his first very public outing with bruni ? " sarkozy is behaving in a way that no french president has , " said helene brunerie , a french artist living in germany .
" he 's divorced and suddenly in the arms of a top model . " on one hand i 'm glad that the press in france has the freedom to be so colorful and uninhibited , but the image of the french president that is being projected to the world is undignified , " she added , reflecting the view of many french citizens living abroad . to both sarkozy admirers and detractors , the image problem can at least be partially fixed if he tied the knot with bruni . for one it would solve sticky protocol problems when they travel abroad on official presidential visits as a couple .
on friday , the french president will be in india , where officials are beside themselves about whether to give bruni the first lady or the girlfriend treatment . saussez predicted that bruni will not go , thereby keeping the public guessing about his marital status .

but insiders say the affair sets a precedent in a totally different way . french president nicolas sarkozy has broken with precedent like no other occupant of the elysee palace . the son of a hungarian aristocrat and grandson of a greek-jewish doctor , he embodies the multi-ethnic diversity of france that is reflected in some of his cabinet choices .
half of all top ministerial posts are filled by women , the highest proportion ever in france .
sarkozy , whose gaullist party ump is right of center , has even poached some of the best minds from his socialist rivals , such as the unusual choice of bernard kouchner , a medical doctor , as foreign minister . in october , sarkozy became the first head of state not only to divorce , but to do so in office , which prompted the release of three best-selling books about his ex-wife , cecilia ciganer . " speedy sarko " captivates public with new love bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : sarkozy waited until after the elections to get divorced from cecilia then one saturday afternoon in mid-december he showed up in disneyland paris with his new flame , carla bruni .
since then , the public has been bombarded with images of the italian ex-supermodel turned pop singer and the details of her past relationships with rock stars , actors and france 's literati .
bruni 's uncanny physical resemblance to cecilia - both are tall , striking blue-eyed brunettes , has all of france putting the president on the psychoanalyst 's couch debating whether " speedy sarko " is now suddenly on the rebound after his ex had ceremoniously left him . in news reports , prime minister francois fillon had even complained that the president was behaving like a love-struck teenager at cabinet meetings . " he giggles , " said fillon in an interview with the widely respected french satirical newspaper le canard enchaine .
" when we talk to him , he does not always listen .
he cancels meetings , which is not like him . " on jan .
8 at a lengthy news conference , the 52-year-old president admitted to a " serious relationship " with bruni , 40 , and talked about the emotional pain of divorce .
but his refusal to confirm or deny marriage rumors has only fuelled even more press speculation about the couple 's intentions . no more taboos on discussing a president 's love life that sarkozy himself even discussed his private life at all in such a public forum however was remarkable and unprecedented in the annals of presidential history , according to french sociologists and media watchers . although the sexual peccadilloes of former presidents such as francois mitterrand , who had fathered a daughter out of wedlock , were long known to media insiders , there used to be a silent pact among journalists that the private lives of top politicians were off-limits , according to denis muzet , founder of the paris-based politics and media institute , mediascopie . " taboos have been lifted , " said muzet , who explained that once bernadette , the wife of former president jacques chirac published her popular memoirs about her husband 's infidelities , the floodgates started to open and in a sense liberated the couple from the constraints of the presidency . " the rules have been changing considerably since the death of princess diana 10 years ago , " he added .
" what i call ' peoplization of the press ' is so banal now that even the serious press jumps on the bandwagon . " sarkozy , whose political mentor was chirac , has simply gone much further than his predecessor in exposing his private life to public view . french press freer than ever to set the agenda bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the portrait of an attractive , harmonious family helps the presidential image " he wants to show that even presidents live , love and suffer like ordinary people , " said muzet , who dismissed suggestions that sarkozy is trying to divert the french from real problems their country faces from social unrest in the immigrant suburbs to rising consumer prices that have diminished purchasing power .
" he wants to show he is transparent and has nothing to hide , down to photos of him on the beach in his swimming trunks . " thierry saussez , a close personal advisor to the president who founded the corporate communications agency image et strategie europe , also emphasized that sarkozy is not trying to deflect the country 's focus from the economic slowdown by flaunting his private life as a few commentators have suggested .
the french press is now freer than ever to set the agenda , he said . " under mitterrand , journalists and others who knew about mitterrand 's illegitimate daughter were under tremendous pressure to keep his double life under wraps , " said saussez , who explained that the public has become so saturated with intimate images of their president enjoying the egyptian pyramids with bruni during the christmas holidays that it has contributed to a drop in the polls .
" and now it 's gone the other way with too much exposure of a president 's private life . " for the first time since sarkozy assumed office in may when he was riding a wave of popularity with two-thirds of the public supporting him , his approvals ratings have now dipped to below 50 percent , according to all pollsters .
but saussez was careful to point out that the bruni brouhaha is only part of the reason for the poll results . " the public needs assurances that the president is working hard and doing his job , not just having fun , " he said .
" but the french are also a very impatient people and they want the president to fix their problems right away . " are they getting married ? bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : bruni looks like a younger version of sarkozy 's ex-wife , who was also a model but did sarkozy have to make disneyland of all places , the site for his first very public outing with bruni ? " sarkozy is behaving in a way that no french president has , " said helene brunerie , a french artist living in germany .
" he 's divorced and suddenly in the arms of a top model . " on one hand i 'm glad that the press in france has the freedom to be so colorful and uninhibited , but the image of the french president that is being projected to the world is undignified , " she added , reflecting the view of many french citizens living abroad . to both sarkozy admirers and detractors , the image problem can at least be partially fixed if he tied the knot with bruni . for one it would solve sticky protocol problems when they travel abroad on official presidential visits as a couple .
on friday , the french president will be in india , where officials are beside themselves about whether to give bruni the first lady or the girlfriend treatment . saussez predicted that bruni will not go , thereby keeping the public guessing about his marital status . " the president needs to get married , " he said . diana fong send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de diplomacy -pipe- 22.01.2008 world powers meet in berlin to raise pressure on iran großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : some players have changed since this 2006 berlin meeting , but the picture will look similar the un security council 's five permanent members and germany meet in berlin tuesday to discuss a new resolution against iran for refusing to halt nuclear work .
it remains uncertain whether they will manage to agree . foreign ministers from the united states , britain , china , france , russia and germany meet in berlin on tuesday , jan .
22 , to ratchet up pressure on teheran for defying international demands that it stop uranium enrichment activities that they fear could be used to make a bomb . the six world powers , which have been searching for common ground for months , are to discuss and thrash out a third un sanctions resolution against iran . german foreign minister frank-walter steinmeier said the meeting would show that iran has not eliminated international concerns . " i am very confident that we will come to a result that will show iran once again that our concerns are not eliminated , and the resolve of the international community of states - including russia and china - remains , " he said . few hopes of breakthrough bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : powerful interests at stake in iran - chinese leader hu jintao with russia 's putin but few expect a real breakthrough at the meeting due to lingering differences between security council members on the best way to deal with iran . eckart von klaeden , foreign policy spokesman for chancellor angela merkel 's christian democratic union -lrb- cdu -rrb- said it was vital that the international community showed a united front to tehran . " my fear is that moscow and beijing will express so many reservations that a much-needed sign of a determined common front wo n't be forthcoming , " von klaeden said in an interview with a german radio station . russia and china are reluctant to back new punitive measures against iran because of their important trade ties with the islamic republic .
russia recently stepped up uranium exports for iran 's busher nuclear power plant which tehran is building on the persian gulf . us plays down expectations the us in particular is pushing for a third round of un sanctions because washington insists that tehran has failed to fulfill key demands to halt work on its nuclear program and provide transparency .
according to diplomats , the us wants new sanctions against state-run iranian banks as well as firms that support tehran 's nuclear weapons program . the us administration 's own intelligence on iran has made it difficult to convince russia and china that tehran deserves new sanctions . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the west fears iran is trying to make a bomb a national intelligence estimate released in early december reported that iran abandoned its nuclear weapons program in 2003 , a conclusion that undermined us president george w. bush 's warnings about the iran threat . the us this week played down expectations of a breakthrough at the berlin summit . " we do n't yet have agreement on the elements or language of a -lrb- united nations -rrb- resolution , " state department spokesman sean mccormack said on friday , jan .
18 . " but we 're pushing forward on it and we 're optimistic that we will eventually be able to get a resolution .
we would have wished that we had had one by now but that is multilateral diplomacy . " steinmeier said the nie report contained both positive and negative news .
in addition to showing that iran had ended its enrichment program , the report also concluded that the country had been working on a weapons program . " the question remains : how far along were the iranians ? "
steinmeier said .
" for that we need the iaea in vienna . " as host of the meeting , steinmeier is to meet separately with us secretary of state condoleeza rice and his chinese counterpart , yang jiechi . iran says berlin meet useless iran , the world 's fourth-largest oil exporter , insists its uranium enrichment is aimed at generating electricity so that it can export more oil and gas . iran 's foreign ministry spokesman , mohammad-ali hosseini , on monday predicted that the berlin meeting would come to nothing . the view was echoed by another senior iranian official , ali aghamohammadi , a representative of supreme leader ayatollah ali khamenei on a powerful arbitration body . in an interview with reuters , aghamohammadi said the berlin meeting would not help defuse iran 's nuclear row with the west if the six powers continue to push for a new sanctions resolution on iran . " if they can find a way to turn the page , then things should be fine , " he said .
" if they want to continue their trend to push for another resolution , even a very weak one , i do n't think it can solve anything . " dw staff -lrb- sp -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

" the church of scientology , of which cruise is a leading member , reacted furiously to a newspaper interview by german historian guido knopp in which he drew parallels between the hollywood star and nazi propaganda minister joseph goebbels . " bild am sonntag is grossly irresponsible for publishing horrendous and disgraceful claims about mr. cruise , " the church 's public affairs director , karin pouw said , referring to the german mass-selling tabloid which published the interview . pouw said the footage , which surfaced on the youtube web site this week , was a pirated , edited video taken from a three-hour event . " bild am sonntag has disgracefully misinterpreted mr cruise 's remarks , " pouw said .
" he was giving an acceptance speech for a humanitarian award bestowed in honor of his efforts for global literacy .
in doing so , he was urging other people to become involved in similar humanitarian activities to the betterment of all . historian says speech stirs ugly memories knopp , who works for german broadcaster zdf and heads their programs on contemporary history , said over the weekend that the mission impossible star 's speech to other scientology members , leaked on to the internet this week , was reminiscent of a 1943 speech by propaganda minister , joseph göbbels . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : knopp drew parallels between cruise 's speech and that of göbbels , right the speech that cruise made four years ago asks fellow members of the church : " should we clean this place up ?

18 , 1943 when he asked the audience : " do you want total war ? " " it may be the case that cruise 's delivery style is not uncommon in certain religious movements in the us , " knopp said .
" but for germans with an interest in history , that scene where he asks whether the scientologists should clean up the world and everyone shouts ' yes ' is inevitably reminiscent of göbbel 's notorious speech . " scientology deeply controversial in germany unlike the us , germany does not recognize scientology as a church and there are debates about whether to ban the organization .
the movement is often described as a sect that exploits its members financially .
in december , regional ministers agreed to investigate the possibility of banning it . cruise also sparked controversy in germany last year because of his role as a nazi resistance hero claus schenk von stauffenberg in a new film , " valkyrie " of which he is also the producer .
von stauffenberg led the failed valkyrie plot , from which the film takes its name , to assassinate adolf hitler in 1944 . cruise 's plans to film a part of the film at the german defense ministry in berlin , where stauffenberg was executed after the failed assassination attempt , met with resistance from german government officials because of his links with scientology . the officials later changed tack and allowed the filming to go ahead .
cruise 's role in scientology is examined in an explosive unauthorized biography of the actor by british writer andrew morton which hit shelves in the united states earlier this month . the publication of the book has been given wide coverage in german media .
it was described by scientology as " replete with lies . " karin pouw said germany had misunderstood the us actor .

it remains uncertain whether they will manage to agree . foreign ministers from the united states , britain , china , france , russia and germany meet in berlin on tuesday , jan .
22 , to ratchet up pressure on teheran for defying international demands that it stop uranium enrichment activities that they fear could be used to make a bomb . the six world powers , which have been searching for common ground for months , are to discuss and thrash out a third un sanctions resolution against iran . german foreign minister frank-walter steinmeier said the meeting would show that iran has not eliminated international concerns . " i am very confident that we will come to a result that will show iran once again that our concerns are not eliminated , and the resolve of the international community of states - including russia and china - remains , " he said . few hopes of breakthrough bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : powerful interests at stake in iran - chinese leader hu jintao with russia 's putin but few expect a real breakthrough at the meeting due to lingering differences between security council members on the best way to deal with iran . eckart von klaeden , foreign policy spokesman for chancellor angela merkel 's christian democratic union -lrb- cdu -rrb- said it was vital that the international community showed a united front to tehran .

22 , that its talks with finnish cell-phone maker nokia had been unsuccessful , but vowed to continue the fight to keep a german factory open . plant workers and german labor groups have been furious about mobile-phone manufacturer nokia 's decision to shut down the plant in the western german city of bochum and move most of the operation to romania , where labor costs are significantly lower . on monday , nokia 's chief executive olli-pekka kallasvuo , representatives of the bochum plant and the ig metall trade union met in helsinki for what was called a " preliminary contact " by company spokeswoman arja suominen . " it was an unofficial meeting and we shall now start official talks , " suominen told ap news agency , but gave no details . a spokesman for ig metall in düsseldorf told dpa news service of the meeting : " the management presented the closure plans again and repeated their inadequate and already known explanation of why . " chancellor spoke with nokia chief bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the closure would mean the loss of 2,300 jobs berthold huber , ig metall chief , told bavarian public television : " this will be a fierce conflict if there is no other way and the management does not change its mind . " ulrike kleinebrahm , the ig metall organizer in bochum , said labor groups were creating their own plan to keep the factory running .
she also called on german political leaders to keep up their pressure on nokia , a cue which chancellor angela merkel has taken . on tuesday , jan .
22 , merkel revealed that she had personally phoned nokia chief executive kallasvuo , to reproach him for plans to close germany 's last factory making nokia mobile phones . " i made clear to him that i had no sympathy for the entire communication and everything connected to it , " merkel told ndr public radio in an interview . she stressed that the federal economics ministry was still in talks with nokia - the world 's largest cell-phone manufacturer - about the closure , but said that both had agreed to keep the discussions confidential . however , merkel said she was skeptical that nokia would alter its decision . " if the decision is not altered , and it would seem to be that way , then everything possible must be done to ensure the people affected have a future , " she said . the chancellor said that she had also spoken with ig metall 's huber , the head of the union representing most nokia staff in bochum . she said the decision to close the plant demonstrated that government subsidies to businesses were " not a perpetual guarantee " that a factory would stay open .
however , she said subsidies were needed " in exceptional cases . " nokia has received over 80 million euros -lrb- $ 120 million -rrb- in state and federal subsidies during the 20 years of the plant 's existence in bochum . calls for nokia boycott bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : some say boycotting nokia would show need for social responsibility german news media have been reporting that the growing calls for a boycott of nokia products could force the company to offer the 2,300 staff the most expensive compensation plan in german corporate history . the chairman of the finnish branch of the activist network attac , mikko sauli , told dpa that the boycott was to protest nokia 's decision to close the plant , adding that the group was not suggesting that people should throw away " a perfectly functioning cell phone " because that would not be " ecologically sustainable . " sauli said attac finland was distributing the petition to other sister organizations , wanting to stress the need for an international " framework " guaranteeing " social responsibility . " attac , which stands for the " association for the taxation of financial transactions to aid citizens , " was founded in france in 1998 and has since expanded internationally , with branches in dozens of countries . dw staff -lrb- als -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

" the church of scientology , of which cruise is a leading member , reacted furiously to a newspaper interview by german historian guido knopp in which he drew parallels between the hollywood star and nazi propaganda minister joseph goebbels . " bild am sonntag is grossly irresponsible for publishing horrendous and disgraceful claims about mr. cruise , " the church 's public affairs director , karin pouw said , referring to the german mass-selling tabloid which published the interview . pouw said the footage , which surfaced on the youtube web site this week , was a pirated , edited video taken from a three-hour event . " bild am sonntag has disgracefully misinterpreted mr cruise 's remarks , " pouw said .
" he was giving an acceptance speech for a humanitarian award bestowed in honor of his efforts for global literacy .
in doing so , he was urging other people to become involved in similar humanitarian activities to the betterment of all . historian says speech stirs ugly memories knopp , who works for german broadcaster zdf and heads their programs on contemporary history , said over the weekend that the mission impossible star 's speech to other scientology members , leaked on to the internet this week , was reminiscent of a 1943 speech by propaganda minister , joseph göbbels . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : knopp drew parallels between cruise 's speech and that of göbbels , right the speech that cruise made four years ago asks fellow members of the church : " should we clean this place up ? " knopp said it was sure to remind germans of göbbel 's notorious speech in berlin on feb .
18 , 1943 when he asked the audience : " do you want total war ? " " it may be the case that cruise 's delivery style is not uncommon in certain religious movements in the us , " knopp said .
" but for germans with an interest in history , that scene where he asks whether the scientologists should clean up the world and everyone shouts ' yes ' is inevitably reminiscent of göbbel 's notorious speech . " scientology deeply controversial in germany unlike the us , germany does not recognize scientology as a church and there are debates about whether to ban the organization .
the movement is often described as a sect that exploits its members financially .
in december , regional ministers agreed to investigate the possibility of banning it . cruise also sparked controversy in germany last year because of his role as a nazi resistance hero claus schenk von stauffenberg in a new film , " valkyrie " of which he is also the producer .
von stauffenberg led the failed valkyrie plot , from which the film takes its name , to assassinate adolf hitler in 1944 . cruise 's plans to film a part of the film at the german defense ministry in berlin , where stauffenberg was executed after the failed assassination attempt , met with resistance from german government officials because of his links with scientology . the officials later changed tack and allowed the filming to go ahead .
cruise 's role in scientology is examined in an explosive unauthorized biography of the actor by british writer andrew morton which hit shelves in the united states earlier this month . the publication of the book has been given wide coverage in german media .
it was described by scientology as " replete with lies . " karin pouw said germany had misunderstood the us actor . " anyone who knows mr cruise knows that he does not have a prejudicial bone in his body and that , unlike bild am sonntag and other german anti-religionists , he does not discriminate against any other religion , race or color .

22 , that its talks with finnish cell-phone maker nokia had been unsuccessful , but vowed to continue the fight to keep a german factory open . plant workers and german labor groups have been furious about mobile-phone manufacturer nokia 's decision to shut down the plant in the western german city of bochum and move most of the operation to romania , where labor costs are significantly lower . on monday , nokia 's chief executive olli-pekka kallasvuo , representatives of the bochum plant and the ig metall trade union met in helsinki for what was called a " preliminary contact " by company spokeswoman arja suominen . " it was an unofficial meeting and we shall now start official talks , " suominen told ap news agency , but gave no details . a spokesman for ig metall in düsseldorf told dpa news service of the meeting : " the management presented the closure plans again and repeated their inadequate and already known explanation of why . " chancellor spoke with nokia chief bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the closure would mean the loss of 2,300 jobs berthold huber , ig metall chief , told bavarian public television : " this will be a fierce conflict if there is no other way and the management does not change its mind . " ulrike kleinebrahm , the ig metall organizer in bochum , said labor groups were creating their own plan to keep the factory running .
she also called on german political leaders to keep up their pressure on nokia , a cue which chancellor angela merkel has taken . on tuesday , jan .
22 , merkel revealed that she had personally phoned nokia chief executive kallasvuo , to reproach him for plans to close germany 's last factory making nokia mobile phones . " i made clear to him that i had no sympathy for the entire communication and everything connected to it , " merkel told ndr public radio in an interview . she stressed that the federal economics ministry was still in talks with nokia - the world 's largest cell-phone manufacturer - about the closure , but said that both had agreed to keep the discussions confidential . however , merkel said she was skeptical that nokia would alter its decision . " if the decision is not altered , and it would seem to be that way , then everything possible must be done to ensure the people affected have a future , " she said . the chancellor said that she had also spoken with ig metall 's huber , the head of the union representing most nokia staff in bochum . she said the decision to close the plant demonstrated that government subsidies to businesses were " not a perpetual guarantee " that a factory would stay open .
however , she said subsidies were needed " in exceptional cases . " nokia has received over 80 million euros -lrb- $ 120 million -rrb- in state and federal subsidies during the 20 years of the plant 's existence in bochum . calls for nokia boycott bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : some say boycotting nokia would show need for social responsibility german news media have been reporting that the growing calls for a boycott of nokia products could force the company to offer the 2,300 staff the most expensive compensation plan in german corporate history . the chairman of the finnish branch of the activist network attac , mikko sauli , told dpa that the boycott was to protest nokia 's decision to close the plant , adding that the group was not suggesting that people should throw away " a perfectly functioning cell phone " because that would not be " ecologically sustainable . " sauli said attac finland was distributing the petition to other sister organizations , wanting to stress the need for an international " framework " guaranteeing " social responsibility . " attac , which stands for the " association for the taxation of financial transactions to aid citizens , " was founded in france in 1998 and has since expanded internationally , with branches in dozens of countries . dw staff -lrb- als -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de economy -pipe- 22.01.2008 european press review : no reason to panic over stock plummet großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : european and asian markets continued to fall in early trading on tuesday asian and european stock markets plunged by as much as 7 percent on monday and the german dax experienced the worst drop since sept .
11 , 2001 .
but many european editorialists do n't see a need for major panic . " the fear that europe and asia will be infected by the us recession has sent the stock market plummeting , " wrote germany 's financial daily handelsblatt from düsseldorf .
" but panic is a bad advisor .
no investor can win by fleeing the market . -lsb- ... -rsb-
on the contrary , fear offers opportunities for hefty market returns in the next few months . " in germany , hope lies in private consumption , considering the recent recovery of the job market , " continued the paper .
" germans need a long time to bring themselves to purchase a car , furniture or other large items .
but as soon as they 've reached their decision , they bring in their high purchase power .
that helps industry and the stock market .
we will see considerably better days on the markets in the next few months . " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the dax sunk to its lowest point since sept .
11 , 2001 the frankfurter allgemeine zeitung commented from germany 's financial capital on the main river that " there 's no reason for panic at the moment , " adding that there is " unfortunately also no reason for confidence . " " the severe setback in the german stock market destroyed the hope that has been fostered over the last few months that the german exchange could be uncoupled from international developments on the financial markets and that domestic stocks were more secure than american or european stocks . " the possibility ca n't be excluded that the situation in the industrial nations will become noticeably worse , " the paper wrote .
" there are many indications that the tendencies on the international stock markets will continue to be driven by developments in the united states . " paris ' liberation , on the other hand , found fault with politics and with the markets themselves .
it wrote tuesday that the financial markets , " heated by their ultraliberal dogmas , have rejected every attempt at regulation .
they have asserted that the divine market would find the remedy for its imbalance on its own .
but the only remedy that has resulted - as in all crises caused by speculation - is a crash . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : germans are cautious but strong buyers , wrote one paper " the whole thing would be tolerable if it just affected the irrational world of financial markets , which are getting a harsh blow from tumbling prices and the loss of capital , " the french paper opined .
" that 's how it goes in a world of crazy money , in which politics has abdicated and left it to the economy . " writing from london , the financial times said " data this year have confirmed trends that had looked worrying for months , such as the fallout from the us housing slump and the crisis in the credit markets " but that " it has brought no true shocks .
equity markets ' success in avoiding a sell-off for so long is more surprising than their recent and sudden capitulation . " big sell-offs are usually followed by a bounce , " continued the paper .
" but popular measures of sentiment had already turned so bearish by the end of last week that they signaled an imminent bounce .
but that has not happened . -lrb- … -rrb- a bounce is likely before long .
but it will be a bounce within a bear market . " compiled by dw staff -lrb- kjb -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

on jan .
22 , a criminal trial began against four international banks charged with stock manipulation . parmalat was seen as a successful italian dairy company - until 2003 when it became a sensational fraud case .
behind the bright colored milk cartons - and even a soccer team - a financial black hole was growing .
as early as 1993 , parmalat officials allegedly began to cook the books .
on dec .
24 , 2003 , shareholders and bond holders did n't quite receive the christmas present they were after .
parmalat shares lost 97 percent and was de-listed from the stock exchange .
the chief executive officer and five former parmalat executives were arrested and a fraud investigation began .
in 2004 , auditors determined that parmalat had debts of around 14.3 billion euros -lrb- $ 20.9 billion -rrb- . two years after the spills were mopped up , a new parmalat emerged .
investors were n't buying into the milk or cream business , but the chance to recoup losses through a settlement with the banks and accounting firms accused of helping conceal its dire financial condition .
in the meantime , multiple legal skirmishes have been played out in courtrooms in parma and milan . on tuesday , jan .
22 , proceedings began in milan against four large international banks - citigroup , deutsche bank , morgan stanley and ubs - charged with stock manipulation of parmalat bonds sold in 2003 . if the banks are found guilty the banks could face fines of up to 5 million euros and have their profits seized .
a guilty ruling could also open the door to civil proceedings by investors . dw-world.de talked to beppe scienza , a lecturer in financial mathematics at the university of turin and author of the books " the cheated investors " and " stocks , policies and parmalat - what 's the worst ? "
he has been following the financial market for over 30 years . dw-world.de : parmalat was not a small or weak company - it was the eighth largest company in italy and a global brand .
how is it that the so-called coca cola of milk production began to go sour ? beppe scienza : the interesting thing about parmalat is that at the industrial level nothing changed .
the company continued to produce and so the industrial aspect remained untouched .
as for exactly how this happened , no one knows and no one has studied all the factors that led to the collapse .
however , these things often begin because someone is trying to cover up some kind of mistake or some kind of loss .
perhaps they invent an excuse to cover up an imbalance .
no one knows why this was done or where the money has ended up . it 's interesting to note that the parmalat dividends were n't very high and this , among other things , gave faith to investors .
when a dividend is very high there is usually a high risk , but when the dividend is , as in the case of parmalat , only a little high then it gives the idea that the company could be in difficulty , but it does n't indicate that it 's going to collapse . what could have been the role played by international banks , like deutsche bank , in the parmalat scandal ? i do n't think it was really that much different from the role of the italian banks .
they helped to sell shares .
some employee of the bank was probably corrupt , but the banks themselves must have known something .
like the italian banks , they were creditors so they had to replace the money . how important is what happens in the courtroom in milan over the next few months ? in order to write an honest history of what happened with parmalat , it is important because we might be able to understand the dynamics of what caused this to happen .
for the bond holders it could be important if there is a guilty verdict , because then it opens the door for civil cases to obtain compensation . will investors ever recover everything that they lost ? on a large scale : no .
a majority of investors wo n't recover what they lost .
in these cases where there 's a collapse and the money disappears , it 's better not to have the illusion that you will recover everything . what impact has the parmalat scandal had on the food industry in europe ? i think that it has little impact on the food industry .
it was n't really a bankruptcy in the sense that the company was closed down and assets sold off at auction .
the company continued production so from the industry point of view nothing changed . so it was only the investors who found themselves burnt by this scandal ? yes , and the creditors and the banks , which lost a big slice of their money . is the parmalat scandal the worst thing that has happened to italian investors ? the collapse of parmalat was used by the banks to convince individuals not to not buy shares or bonds but put their money into managed investment funds .
it 's true that investors lost a lot of money with parmalat , but if we look at managed investment funds then we discover that the loss to investors is around 20 billion euros .
now , the loss in italy from the parmalat scandal is around 3 billion euros .
unfortunately , the worst things that happen to italian investors are not these company collapses , but rather the mismanagement of managed investment funds . how new is the new parmalat - has anything changed ? the company has maintained the name and the production facilities , but for an investor the past story of parmalat has nothing to do with buying the stock today since all of the company 's debts were wiped out before its re-listing . interview : stephanie raison send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

on jan .
22 , a criminal trial began against four international banks charged with stock manipulation . parmalat was seen as a successful italian dairy company - until 2003 when it became a sensational fraud case .
behind the bright colored milk cartons - and even a soccer team - a financial black hole was growing .
as early as 1993 , parmalat officials allegedly began to cook the books .
on dec .
24 , 2003 , shareholders and bond holders did n't quite receive the christmas present they were after .
parmalat shares lost 97 percent and was de-listed from the stock exchange .
the chief executive officer and five former parmalat executives were arrested and a fraud investigation began .
in 2004 , auditors determined that parmalat had debts of around 14.3 billion euros -lrb- $ 20.9 billion -rrb- . two years after the spills were mopped up , a new parmalat emerged .
investors were n't buying into the milk or cream business , but the chance to recoup losses through a settlement with the banks and accounting firms accused of helping conceal its dire financial condition .
in the meantime , multiple legal skirmishes have been played out in courtrooms in parma and milan . on tuesday , jan .
22 , proceedings began in milan against four large international banks - citigroup , deutsche bank , morgan stanley and ubs - charged with stock manipulation of parmalat bonds sold in 2003 . if the banks are found guilty the banks could face fines of up to 5 million euros and have their profits seized .
a guilty ruling could also open the door to civil proceedings by investors . dw-world.de talked to beppe scienza , a lecturer in financial mathematics at the university of turin and author of the books " the cheated investors " and " stocks , policies and parmalat - what 's the worst ? "
he has been following the financial market for over 30 years . dw-world.de : parmalat was not a small or weak company - it was the eighth largest company in italy and a global brand .
how is it that the so-called coca cola of milk production began to go sour ? beppe scienza : the interesting thing about parmalat is that at the industrial level nothing changed .
the company continued to produce and so the industrial aspect remained untouched .
as for exactly how this happened , no one knows and no one has studied all the factors that led to the collapse .
however , these things often begin because someone is trying to cover up some kind of mistake or some kind of loss .
perhaps they invent an excuse to cover up an imbalance .
no one knows why this was done or where the money has ended up . it 's interesting to note that the parmalat dividends were n't very high and this , among other things , gave faith to investors .
when a dividend is very high there is usually a high risk , but when the dividend is , as in the case of parmalat , only a little high then it gives the idea that the company could be in difficulty , but it does n't indicate that it 's going to collapse . what could have been the role played by international banks , like deutsche bank , in the parmalat scandal ? i do n't think it was really that much different from the role of the italian banks .
they helped to sell shares .
some employee of the bank was probably corrupt , but the banks themselves must have known something .
like the italian banks , they were creditors so they had to replace the money . how important is what happens in the courtroom in milan over the next few months ? in order to write an honest history of what happened with parmalat , it is important because we might be able to understand the dynamics of what caused this to happen .
for the bond holders it could be important if there is a guilty verdict , because then it opens the door for civil cases to obtain compensation . will investors ever recover everything that they lost ? on a large scale : no .
a majority of investors wo n't recover what they lost .
in these cases where there 's a collapse and the money disappears , it 's better not to have the illusion that you will recover everything . what impact has the parmalat scandal had on the food industry in europe ? i think that it has little impact on the food industry .
it was n't really a bankruptcy in the sense that the company was closed down and assets sold off at auction .

when a dividend is very high there is usually a high risk , but when the dividend is , as in the case of parmalat , only a little high then it gives the idea that the company could be in difficulty , but it does n't indicate that it 's going to collapse . what could have been the role played by international banks , like deutsche bank , in the parmalat scandal ? i do n't think it was really that much different from the role of the italian banks .
they helped to sell shares .
some employee of the bank was probably corrupt , but the banks themselves must have known something .
like the italian banks , they were creditors so they had to replace the money . how important is what happens in the courtroom in milan over the next few months ? in order to write an honest history of what happened with parmalat , it is important because we might be able to understand the dynamics of what caused this to happen .
for the bond holders it could be important if there is a guilty verdict , because then it opens the door for civil cases to obtain compensation . will investors ever recover everything that they lost ? on a large scale : no .
a majority of investors wo n't recover what they lost .
in these cases where there 's a collapse and the money disappears , it 's better not to have the illusion that you will recover everything . what impact has the parmalat scandal had on the food industry in europe ? i think that it has little impact on the food industry .
it was n't really a bankruptcy in the sense that the company was closed down and assets sold off at auction .
the company continued production so from the industry point of view nothing changed . so it was only the investors who found themselves burnt by this scandal ? yes , and the creditors and the banks , which lost a big slice of their money . is the parmalat scandal the worst thing that has happened to italian investors ? the collapse of parmalat was used by the banks to convince individuals not to not buy shares or bonds but put their money into managed investment funds .
it 's true that investors lost a lot of money with parmalat , but if we look at managed investment funds then we discover that the loss to investors is around 20 billion euros .
now , the loss in italy from the parmalat scandal is around 3 billion euros .
unfortunately , the worst things that happen to italian investors are not these company collapses , but rather the mismanagement of managed investment funds . how new is the new parmalat - has anything changed ? the company has maintained the name and the production facilities , but for an investor the past story of parmalat has nothing to do with buying the stock today since all of the company 's debts were wiped out before its re-listing . interview : stephanie raison send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

" it was an unofficial meeting and we shall now start official talks , " suominen told ap news agency , but gave no details . a spokesman for ig metall in düsseldorf told dpa news service of the meeting : " the management presented the closure plans again and repeated their inadequate and already known explanation of why .

" if the decision is not altered , and it would seem to be that way , then everything possible must be done to ensure the people affected have a future , " she said . the chancellor said that she had also spoken with ig metall 's huber , the head of the union representing most nokia staff in bochum . she said the decision to close the plant demonstrated that government subsidies to businesses were " not a perpetual guarantee " that a factory would stay open .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de economy -pipe- 22.01.2008 effects of us recession could be held at bay , experts say großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : some experts said the us has become less important for the global economy global markets have plunged , partly due to fear of a recession in the united states , the world 's biggest economy .
but european experts say dynamic developing countries like china could offset us troubles . looking at the way the markets have plummeted , it appears an old adage rings true : " when the us sneezes , the rest of the world gets a cold . " panic spread across the frankfurt trading floor on monday , jan .
21 , when the country 's dax index experienced its biggest plunge since the sept .
11 , 2001 terrorist attacks in the united states . fears of a us recession , partly sparked by the recent credit crisis , and the possibility that it could lead to an international economic crisis also sent other european and asian into nose dives . over-sensitivity of markets ? bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : traders at the stock exchange in frankfurt tried to fend off panic yet , despite the panic , a majority of finance experts estimate the likelihood of a us recession at only 40 percent .
economists at german banks including dekabank and westlb assess the situation even more modestly , believing that a recession risk stands at only 25 percent . some analysts also point to a university of michigan consumer confidence reading for january , which last week stood at 80.5 percent , up from 75.5 percent in december .
this has led some to believe that consumer sentiment - which helps to drive markets - is up despite fears of a recession . but jörg krämer , chief economist at commerzbank , stressed the complexity of the situation . " we expect the us economy to stagnate in the first half of 2008 , which will feel like a recession , " he said . huge growth on chinese and indian markets bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : china could help balance out other markets other economic analysts have said that even if the us economy were to shrink , the rapidly expanding markets of developing countries in asia could offset a recession in the us , or at least minimize its effects .
after all , consumer growth rates in hong kong , china , thailand , malaysia and india tally up to 15 percent of the global economy . " the us economy is no longer as important for the world economic situation as it used to be , " said dutch world bank economist hans timmer . but krämer - and others - remains skeptical . " to be able to compensate for a us recession , growth in china would have to pick up even more , " said gabriele widmann , a dekabank analyst for the us market , adding that such growth would be difficult as the us is an important destination for asian goods . budgets and companies feeling the credit squeeze pessimists therefore fear that decreasing us demand for asian products could prompt a " domino effect . "
should american consumers lose their desire to buy , the dominos in the markets so dependent on exports to the us could start to tumble . " if growth of the us economy slows by one percent , business activity in germany likewise slows by a half percent , " krämer said . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : japanese and other asian stocks also plunged on monday furthermore , american financial market policies do not necessarily instill hope . us federal reserve bank chairman ben bernanke may have repeatedly lowered the prime interest rate since the mortgage crisis in the us erupted last year , but the lowered interest rates do not have the desired effect where they are most needed .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de economy -pipe- 22.01.2008 effects of us recession could be held at bay , experts say großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : some experts said the us has become less important for the global economy global markets have plunged , partly due to fear of a recession in the united states , the world 's biggest economy .
but european experts say dynamic developing countries like china could offset us troubles . looking at the way the markets have plummeted , it appears an old adage rings true : " when the us sneezes , the rest of the world gets a cold . " panic spread across the frankfurt trading floor on monday , jan .
21 , when the country 's dax index experienced its biggest plunge since the sept .
11 , 2001 terrorist attacks in the united states . fears of a us recession , partly sparked by the recent credit crisis , and the possibility that it could lead to an international economic crisis also sent other european and asian into nose dives . over-sensitivity of markets ? bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : traders at the stock exchange in frankfurt tried to fend off panic yet , despite the panic , a majority of finance experts estimate the likelihood of a us recession at only 40 percent .
economists at german banks including dekabank and westlb assess the situation even more modestly , believing that a recession risk stands at only 25 percent . some analysts also point to a university of michigan consumer confidence reading for january , which last week stood at 80.5 percent , up from 75.5 percent in december .
this has led some to believe that consumer sentiment - which helps to drive markets - is up despite fears of a recession . but jörg krämer , chief economist at commerzbank , stressed the complexity of the situation . " we expect the us economy to stagnate in the first half of 2008 , which will feel like a recession , " he said . huge growth on chinese and indian markets bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : china could help balance out other markets other economic analysts have said that even if the us economy were to shrink , the rapidly expanding markets of developing countries in asia could offset a recession in the us , or at least minimize its effects .
after all , consumer growth rates in hong kong , china , thailand , malaysia and india tally up to 15 percent of the global economy . " the us economy is no longer as important for the world economic situation as it used to be , " said dutch world bank economist hans timmer . but krämer - and others - remains skeptical . " to be able to compensate for a us recession , growth in china would have to pick up even more , " said gabriele widmann , a dekabank analyst for the us market , adding that such growth would be difficult as the us is an important destination for asian goods . budgets and companies feeling the credit squeeze pessimists therefore fear that decreasing us demand for asian products could prompt a " domino effect . "
should american consumers lose their desire to buy , the dominos in the markets so dependent on exports to the us could start to tumble . " if growth of the us economy slows by one percent , business activity in germany likewise slows by a half percent , " krämer said . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : japanese and other asian stocks also plunged on monday furthermore , american financial market policies do not necessarily instill hope . us federal reserve bank chairman ben bernanke may have repeatedly lowered the prime interest rate since the mortgage crisis in the us erupted last year , but the lowered interest rates do not have the desired effect where they are most needed .
interest rates on the corporate bond and consumer credit markets have remained the same or have even risen . also , a multi-billion-dollar proposal by us president george w. bush last week to temporarily cut taxes and implement other measures to fend off a possible recession has failed to calm the financial mood . us business activity , after all , has often proven to be resistant to politics .
the wall street journal recently summarized it as such : " we have tried tax breaks before .
they do n't work . " dekabank economist widmann is also certain : " the plan will just be a flash in the pan .
it would only relieve the situation short-term . " angela göpfert -lrb- als -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de media -pipe- 22.01.2008 experts : no ulterior motives behind french sarkozy-bruni affair großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : sarkozy 's refusal to confirm marriage rumors fuels even more press speculation nicolas sarkozy 's relationship with carla bruni has led to speculation that the french president is trying to cover up political problems .
but insiders say the affair sets a precedent in a totally different way . french president nicolas sarkozy has broken with precedent like no other occupant of the elysee palace . the son of a hungarian aristocrat and grandson of a greek-jewish doctor , he embodies the multi-ethnic diversity of france that is reflected in some of his cabinet choices .
half of all top ministerial posts are filled by women , the highest proportion ever in france .
sarkozy , whose gaullist party ump is right of center , has even poached some of the best minds from his socialist rivals , such as the unusual choice of bernard kouchner , a medical doctor , as foreign minister . in october , sarkozy became the first head of state not only to divorce , but to do so in office , which prompted the release of three best-selling books about his ex-wife , cecilia ciganer . " speedy sarko " captivates public with new love bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : sarkozy waited until after the elections to get divorced from cecilia then one saturday afternoon in mid-december he showed up in disneyland paris with his new flame , carla bruni .
since then , the public has been bombarded with images of the italian ex-supermodel turned pop singer and the details of her past relationships with rock stars , actors and france 's literati .
bruni 's uncanny physical resemblance to cecilia - both are tall , striking blue-eyed brunettes , has all of france putting the president on the psychoanalyst 's couch debating whether " speedy sarko " is now suddenly on the rebound after his ex had ceremoniously left him . in news reports , prime minister francois fillon had even complained that the president was behaving like a love-struck teenager at cabinet meetings . " he giggles , " said fillon in an interview with the widely respected french satirical newspaper le canard enchaine .
" when we talk to him , he does not always listen .
he cancels meetings , which is not like him . " on jan .
8 at a lengthy news conference , the 52-year-old president admitted to a " serious relationship " with bruni , 40 , and talked about the emotional pain of divorce .
but his refusal to confirm or deny marriage rumors has only fuelled even more press speculation about the couple 's intentions . no more taboos on discussing a president 's love life that sarkozy himself even discussed his private life at all in such a public forum however was remarkable and unprecedented in the annals of presidential history , according to french sociologists and media watchers . although the sexual peccadilloes of former presidents such as francois mitterrand , who had fathered a daughter out of wedlock , were long known to media insiders , there used to be a silent pact among journalists that the private lives of top politicians were off-limits , according to denis muzet , founder of the paris-based politics and media institute , mediascopie . " taboos have been lifted , " said muzet , who explained that once bernadette , the wife of former president jacques chirac published her popular memoirs about her husband 's infidelities , the floodgates started to open and in a sense liberated the couple from the constraints of the presidency . " the rules have been changing considerably since the death of princess diana 10 years ago , " he added .
" what i call ' peoplization of the press ' is so banal now that even the serious press jumps on the bandwagon . " sarkozy , whose political mentor was chirac , has simply gone much further than his predecessor in exposing his private life to public view . french press freer than ever to set the agenda bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the portrait of an attractive , harmonious family helps the presidential image " he wants to show that even presidents live , love and suffer like ordinary people , " said muzet , who dismissed suggestions that sarkozy is trying to divert the french from real problems their country faces from social unrest in the immigrant suburbs to rising consumer prices that have diminished purchasing power .
" he wants to show he is transparent and has nothing to hide , down to photos of him on the beach in his swimming trunks . " thierry saussez , a close personal advisor to the president who founded the corporate communications agency image et strategie europe , also emphasized that sarkozy is not trying to deflect the country 's focus from the economic slowdown by flaunting his private life as a few commentators have suggested .
the french press is now freer than ever to set the agenda , he said . " under mitterrand , journalists and others who knew about mitterrand 's illegitimate daughter were under tremendous pressure to keep his double life under wraps , " said saussez , who explained that the public has become so saturated with intimate images of their president enjoying the egyptian pyramids with bruni during the christmas holidays that it has contributed to a drop in the polls .
" and now it 's gone the other way with too much exposure of a president 's private life . " for the first time since sarkozy assumed office in may when he was riding a wave of popularity with two-thirds of the public supporting him , his approvals ratings have now dipped to below 50 percent , according to all pollsters .
but saussez was careful to point out that the bruni brouhaha is only part of the reason for the poll results . " the public needs assurances that the president is working hard and doing his job , not just having fun , " he said .
" but the french are also a very impatient people and they want the president to fix their problems right away . " are they getting married ? bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : bruni looks like a younger version of sarkozy 's ex-wife , who was also a model but did sarkozy have to make disneyland of all places , the site for his first very public outing with bruni ? " sarkozy is behaving in a way that no french president has , " said helene brunerie , a french artist living in germany .
" he 's divorced and suddenly in the arms of a top model . " on one hand i 'm glad that the press in france has the freedom to be so colorful and uninhibited , but the image of the french president that is being projected to the world is undignified , " she added , reflecting the view of many french citizens living abroad . to both sarkozy admirers and detractors , the image problem can at least be partially fixed if he tied the knot with bruni . for one it would solve sticky protocol problems when they travel abroad on official presidential visits as a couple .
on friday , the french president will be in india , where officials are beside themselves about whether to give bruni the first lady or the girlfriend treatment . saussez predicted that bruni will not go , thereby keeping the public guessing about his marital status . " the president needs to get married , " he said . diana fong send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

but insiders say the affair sets a precedent in a totally different way . french president nicolas sarkozy has broken with precedent like no other occupant of the elysee palace . the son of a hungarian aristocrat and grandson of a greek-jewish doctor , he embodies the multi-ethnic diversity of france that is reflected in some of his cabinet choices .
half of all top ministerial posts are filled by women , the highest proportion ever in france .
sarkozy , whose gaullist party ump is right of center , has even poached some of the best minds from his socialist rivals , such as the unusual choice of bernard kouchner , a medical doctor , as foreign minister . in october , sarkozy became the first head of state not only to divorce , but to do so in office , which prompted the release of three best-selling books about his ex-wife , cecilia ciganer . " speedy sarko " captivates public with new love bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : sarkozy waited until after the elections to get divorced from cecilia then one saturday afternoon in mid-december he showed up in disneyland paris with his new flame , carla bruni .
since then , the public has been bombarded with images of the italian ex-supermodel turned pop singer and the details of her past relationships with rock stars , actors and france 's literati .
bruni 's uncanny physical resemblance to cecilia - both are tall , striking blue-eyed brunettes , has all of france putting the president on the psychoanalyst 's couch debating whether " speedy sarko " is now suddenly on the rebound after his ex had ceremoniously left him . in news reports , prime minister francois fillon had even complained that the president was behaving like a love-struck teenager at cabinet meetings . " he giggles , " said fillon in an interview with the widely respected french satirical newspaper le canard enchaine .
" when we talk to him , he does not always listen .
he cancels meetings , which is not like him . " on jan .
8 at a lengthy news conference , the 52-year-old president admitted to a " serious relationship " with bruni , 40 , and talked about the emotional pain of divorce .
but his refusal to confirm or deny marriage rumors has only fuelled even more press speculation about the couple 's intentions . no more taboos on discussing a president 's love life that sarkozy himself even discussed his private life at all in such a public forum however was remarkable and unprecedented in the annals of presidential history , according to french sociologists and media watchers . although the sexual peccadilloes of former presidents such as francois mitterrand , who had fathered a daughter out of wedlock , were long known to media insiders , there used to be a silent pact among journalists that the private lives of top politicians were off-limits , according to denis muzet , founder of the paris-based politics and media institute , mediascopie . " taboos have been lifted , " said muzet , who explained that once bernadette , the wife of former president jacques chirac published her popular memoirs about her husband 's infidelities , the floodgates started to open and in a sense liberated the couple from the constraints of the presidency . " the rules have been changing considerably since the death of princess diana 10 years ago , " he added .
" what i call ' peoplization of the press ' is so banal now that even the serious press jumps on the bandwagon . " sarkozy , whose political mentor was chirac , has simply gone much further than his predecessor in exposing his private life to public view . french press freer than ever to set the agenda bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the portrait of an attractive , harmonious family helps the presidential image " he wants to show that even presidents live , love and suffer like ordinary people , " said muzet , who dismissed suggestions that sarkozy is trying to divert the french from real problems their country faces from social unrest in the immigrant suburbs to rising consumer prices that have diminished purchasing power .
" he wants to show he is transparent and has nothing to hide , down to photos of him on the beach in his swimming trunks . " thierry saussez , a close personal advisor to the president who founded the corporate communications agency image et strategie europe , also emphasized that sarkozy is not trying to deflect the country 's focus from the economic slowdown by flaunting his private life as a few commentators have suggested .
the french press is now freer than ever to set the agenda , he said . " under mitterrand , journalists and others who knew about mitterrand 's illegitimate daughter were under tremendous pressure to keep his double life under wraps , " said saussez , who explained that the public has become so saturated with intimate images of their president enjoying the egyptian pyramids with bruni during the christmas holidays that it has contributed to a drop in the polls .
" and now it 's gone the other way with too much exposure of a president 's private life . " for the first time since sarkozy assumed office in may when he was riding a wave of popularity with two-thirds of the public supporting him , his approvals ratings have now dipped to below 50 percent , according to all pollsters .
but saussez was careful to point out that the bruni brouhaha is only part of the reason for the poll results . " the public needs assurances that the president is working hard and doing his job , not just having fun , " he said .
" but the french are also a very impatient people and they want the president to fix their problems right away . " are they getting married ? bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : bruni looks like a younger version of sarkozy 's ex-wife , who was also a model but did sarkozy have to make disneyland of all places , the site for his first very public outing with bruni ? " sarkozy is behaving in a way that no french president has , " said helene brunerie , a french artist living in germany .
" he 's divorced and suddenly in the arms of a top model . " on one hand i 'm glad that the press in france has the freedom to be so colorful and uninhibited , but the image of the french president that is being projected to the world is undignified , " she added , reflecting the view of many french citizens living abroad . to both sarkozy admirers and detractors , the image problem can at least be partially fixed if he tied the knot with bruni . for one it would solve sticky protocol problems when they travel abroad on official presidential visits as a couple .
on friday , the french president will be in india , where officials are beside themselves about whether to give bruni the first lady or the girlfriend treatment . saussez predicted that bruni will not go , thereby keeping the public guessing about his marital status .

since then , the public has been bombarded with images of the italian ex-supermodel turned pop singer and the details of her past relationships with rock stars , actors and france 's literati .
bruni 's uncanny physical resemblance to cecilia - both are tall , striking blue-eyed brunettes , has all of france putting the president on the psychoanalyst 's couch debating whether " speedy sarko " is now suddenly on the rebound after his ex had ceremoniously left him . in news reports , prime minister francois fillon had even complained that the president was behaving like a love-struck teenager at cabinet meetings . " he giggles , " said fillon in an interview with the widely respected french satirical newspaper le canard enchaine .
" when we talk to him , he does not always listen .
he cancels meetings , which is not like him . " on jan .
8 at a lengthy news conference , the 52-year-old president admitted to a " serious relationship " with bruni , 40 , and talked about the emotional pain of divorce .
but his refusal to confirm or deny marriage rumors has only fuelled even more press speculation about the couple 's intentions . no more taboos on discussing a president 's love life that sarkozy himself even discussed his private life at all in such a public forum however was remarkable and unprecedented in the annals of presidential history , according to french sociologists and media watchers . although the sexual peccadilloes of former presidents such as francois mitterrand , who had fathered a daughter out of wedlock , were long known to media insiders , there used to be a silent pact among journalists that the private lives of top politicians were off-limits , according to denis muzet , founder of the paris-based politics and media institute , mediascopie . " taboos have been lifted , " said muzet , who explained that once bernadette , the wife of former president jacques chirac published her popular memoirs about her husband 's infidelities , the floodgates started to open and in a sense liberated the couple from the constraints of the presidency . " the rules have been changing considerably since the death of princess diana 10 years ago , " he added .
" what i call ' peoplization of the press ' is so banal now that even the serious press jumps on the bandwagon . " sarkozy , whose political mentor was chirac , has simply gone much further than his predecessor in exposing his private life to public view . french press freer than ever to set the agenda bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the portrait of an attractive , harmonious family helps the presidential image " he wants to show that even presidents live , love and suffer like ordinary people , " said muzet , who dismissed suggestions that sarkozy is trying to divert the french from real problems their country faces from social unrest in the immigrant suburbs to rising consumer prices that have diminished purchasing power .
" he wants to show he is transparent and has nothing to hide , down to photos of him on the beach in his swimming trunks . " thierry saussez , a close personal advisor to the president who founded the corporate communications agency image et strategie europe , also emphasized that sarkozy is not trying to deflect the country 's focus from the economic slowdown by flaunting his private life as a few commentators have suggested .
the french press is now freer than ever to set the agenda , he said . " under mitterrand , journalists and others who knew about mitterrand 's illegitimate daughter were under tremendous pressure to keep his double life under wraps , " said saussez , who explained that the public has become so saturated with intimate images of their president enjoying the egyptian pyramids with bruni during the christmas holidays that it has contributed to a drop in the polls .
" and now it 's gone the other way with too much exposure of a president 's private life . " for the first time since sarkozy assumed office in may when he was riding a wave of popularity with two-thirds of the public supporting him , his approvals ratings have now dipped to below 50 percent , according to all pollsters .
but saussez was careful to point out that the bruni brouhaha is only part of the reason for the poll results . " the public needs assurances that the president is working hard and doing his job , not just having fun , " he said .
" but the french are also a very impatient people and they want the president to fix their problems right away . " are they getting married ? bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : bruni looks like a younger version of sarkozy 's ex-wife , who was also a model but did sarkozy have to make disneyland of all places , the site for his first very public outing with bruni ? " sarkozy is behaving in a way that no french president has , " said helene brunerie , a french artist living in germany .
" he 's divorced and suddenly in the arms of a top model . " on one hand i 'm glad that the press in france has the freedom to be so colorful and uninhibited , but the image of the french president that is being projected to the world is undignified , " she added , reflecting the view of many french citizens living abroad . to both sarkozy admirers and detractors , the image problem can at least be partially fixed if he tied the knot with bruni . for one it would solve sticky protocol problems when they travel abroad on official presidential visits as a couple .
on friday , the french president will be in india , where officials are beside themselves about whether to give bruni the first lady or the girlfriend treatment . saussez predicted that bruni will not go , thereby keeping the public guessing about his marital status .

but insiders say the affair sets a precedent in a totally different way . french president nicolas sarkozy has broken with precedent like no other occupant of the elysee palace . the son of a hungarian aristocrat and grandson of a greek-jewish doctor , he embodies the multi-ethnic diversity of france that is reflected in some of his cabinet choices .

he said the situation in the serbian province remains calm but not stable . brig. gen. robert bund commands the 2,200 soldiers that make up the german contingent in the nato-led kosovo protection force -lrb- kfor -rrb- . dw-world.de : how did you prepare yourself personally for your role as leader of the german contingent in kosovo ? robert bund : i consider myself generally well prepared , especially in the area of leadership , as a result of my previous career assignments during my 40 years of service with the bundeswehr .
moving through the various ranks from company commander -lsb- who is in charge of up to 200 servicemen and women -rsb- all the way up to brigade commander -lsb- who is responsible for some 5,000 soldiers -rsb- , you gain so much experience that you should be ready to successfully confront all the challenges of a foreign operation . like any other soldier , i went through the whole range of preparatory training for this mission .
one hostage exercise we did left an impression .
role-players had to act as realistically as possible and were constantly monitored by psychologists . to round off my technical preparation , i studied the history and the political and social conditions in kosovo intensively .
and , of course , there were intensive talks with my wife and our children as well as with the members of my home church , the free protestant church , to emotionally prepare me for my long tour .
support from family and community makes it easier to take on the burdens of an operation abroad and the separation from home and it can be transformed into something positive . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : better living conditions will keep youth from joining radical groups , said bund how do you motivate your troops ? the leadership principle that i try to put into practice is based on two pillars .
the first pillar is trust . i treat all servicemen and women with unrestricted trust .
this means that i take each one seriously as an individual - with their questions , problems and specialized knowledge .
every single soldier is a specialist in his or her field , and i put my trust in their skills , even in our daily contact with each other .
but this trust also means that each person must be aware of their responsibility , too , and has to act accordingly - that is , responsibly .
i firmly demand this of everyone . the second pillar is comradeship .
back in germany , comradeship is a basic principle , but it plays a much more important role in a foreign operation .
i see comradeship as independent of rank or chain of command .
a particularly important point for me in this respect is looking after each other , taking notice of and dealing with one another in a positive manner and being aware of when others need help . in addition , i continually try to get a feel for the general mood , take notice of problems and explain my position on a whole range of different issues during our meetings .
in other words , i try to stay in touch with my soldiers . i also make use of the camp 's radio station , where all soldiers have the opportunity to ask questions on the air or in writing .
i respond to them during a question-and-answer broadcast called " commander on air . " what have you learned about the culture in kosovo ?
which aspects interest you the most ? i am most interested in the evolution of the political process .
europe and the us have clearly expressed their positions on the matter and the people in kosovo put all their trust in the support from these countries - and their expectations are high . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the people of kosovo want to decide on their future for themselves , said bund i have learned that these people are highly aware of their situation .
they know that never before in their history have they been so close to a potentially historic decision and that anything that deviates from normalcy would jeopardize the current decision process , possibly setting it back for years .
however , they 're not going to wait forever .
that is why we assess the situation as calm but not stable . i have also learned that the people in kosovo are among the youngest in europe .
the average age of the kosovo albanians is about 27 years .
this means that economic development over the next few years is extremely important .
only a significant improvement of the living conditions can prevent the young people from joining more radical movements .
improvement means secure electrical power supply 24 hours a day and modern roads and railway connections to the outside world . what surprised me is the way islam is practiced here .
here in kosovo i was able to gain insight into islamic practices through my many meetings with religious leaders .
i was very impressed that , when the catholic bishop consecrated a new altar , members off different faiths attended the mass and ate together afterwards . on the whole , the people in kosovo want to finally decide for themselves about their future after their long and , at times , tragic history . what is the everyday routine like for you and your soldiers ? the daily routine of my soldiers varies greatly , depending on their respective tasks .
but the overall conditions are the same for all of them .
every soldier without shift duty , night-time operations or other duties works monday through friday from 7:30 a.m. to 7:30 p.m. , but there are many who work beyond that .
on saturday , we start an hour later and on sunday duty is from 1:30 p.m. to 6:30 p.m. another special thing on sunday is that , at 11:00 , we hold our religious service in our small church , which was built by our soldiers a few years ago .
we are always accompanied by our church choir , which i sing in myself . my own daily routine depends on whether talks with politicians or other people are on my schedule .
the morning hours are especially important to me because i can prepare myself for the tasks ahead .
a half hour of bible study helps me get into the mood to go to work . after that , i have various appointments that are coordinated by my military assistant and aide de camp .
there are negotiations with civic representatives , briefings with my advisors and commanders and , of course , visits with the troops at the different field camps in and around prizren . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : kosovo 's political leaders , fatmir sejdiu , left , and hashim thaci , expect much of the eu normally , i am busy every day from about 7:00 a.m. to 9:00 p.m.
but , of course , i am available for all members of the german contingent outside those hours , too . what is your personal goal in kosovo ?
what do you want to leave behind ? the most important goal is get all servicemen and women home again safely . apart from that , i want to contribute to seeing our mission accomplished as well as possible .
to ensure a safe and secure environment and freedom of movement for all ethnic groups .
that the people of kosovo have a positive perspective on their future , and that our servicemen and women are recognized for continuing the tradition of their predecessor under the motto " helping others help themselves . " i want to ensure that , within the framework of our civil-military cooperation , we continue to contribute to the building of a kosovar society and , above all , give the children a better future by building schools and helping them with job qualifications . apart from our military mission we have been able to directly help people living below the poverty threshold with a variety of initiatives supported by donations from germany .
in addition , we 've been able to provide school materials to students . if this has succeeded in assuring the survival of at least a few people or facilitated learning , it is a big enough legacy . interview : kate bowen send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

he said the situation in the serbian province remains calm but not stable . brig. gen. robert bund commands the 2,200 soldiers that make up the german contingent in the nato-led kosovo protection force -lrb- kfor -rrb- . dw-world.de : how did you prepare yourself personally for your role as leader of the german contingent in kosovo ? robert bund : i consider myself generally well prepared , especially in the area of leadership , as a result of my previous career assignments during my 40 years of service with the bundeswehr .
moving through the various ranks from company commander -lsb- who is in charge of up to 200 servicemen and women -rsb- all the way up to brigade commander -lsb- who is responsible for some 5,000 soldiers -rsb- , you gain so much experience that you should be ready to successfully confront all the challenges of a foreign operation . like any other soldier , i went through the whole range of preparatory training for this mission .
one hostage exercise we did left an impression .
role-players had to act as realistically as possible and were constantly monitored by psychologists . to round off my technical preparation , i studied the history and the political and social conditions in kosovo intensively .
and , of course , there were intensive talks with my wife and our children as well as with the members of my home church , the free protestant church , to emotionally prepare me for my long tour .
support from family and community makes it easier to take on the burdens of an operation abroad and the separation from home and it can be transformed into something positive . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : better living conditions will keep youth from joining radical groups , said bund how do you motivate your troops ? the leadership principle that i try to put into practice is based on two pillars .
the first pillar is trust . i treat all servicemen and women with unrestricted trust .
this means that i take each one seriously as an individual - with their questions , problems and specialized knowledge .
every single soldier is a specialist in his or her field , and i put my trust in their skills , even in our daily contact with each other .
but this trust also means that each person must be aware of their responsibility , too , and has to act accordingly - that is , responsibly .
i firmly demand this of everyone . the second pillar is comradeship .
back in germany , comradeship is a basic principle , but it plays a much more important role in a foreign operation .
i see comradeship as independent of rank or chain of command .
a particularly important point for me in this respect is looking after each other , taking notice of and dealing with one another in a positive manner and being aware of when others need help . in addition , i continually try to get a feel for the general mood , take notice of problems and explain my position on a whole range of different issues during our meetings .
in other words , i try to stay in touch with my soldiers . i also make use of the camp 's radio station , where all soldiers have the opportunity to ask questions on the air or in writing .
i respond to them during a question-and-answer broadcast called " commander on air . " what have you learned about the culture in kosovo ?
which aspects interest you the most ? i am most interested in the evolution of the political process .
europe and the us have clearly expressed their positions on the matter and the people in kosovo put all their trust in the support from these countries - and their expectations are high . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the people of kosovo want to decide on their future for themselves , said bund i have learned that these people are highly aware of their situation .
they know that never before in their history have they been so close to a potentially historic decision and that anything that deviates from normalcy would jeopardize the current decision process , possibly setting it back for years .
however , they 're not going to wait forever .
that is why we assess the situation as calm but not stable . i have also learned that the people in kosovo are among the youngest in europe .
the average age of the kosovo albanians is about 27 years .
this means that economic development over the next few years is extremely important .
only a significant improvement of the living conditions can prevent the young people from joining more radical movements .
improvement means secure electrical power supply 24 hours a day and modern roads and railway connections to the outside world . what surprised me is the way islam is practiced here .
here in kosovo i was able to gain insight into islamic practices through my many meetings with religious leaders .
i was very impressed that , when the catholic bishop consecrated a new altar , members off different faiths attended the mass and ate together afterwards . on the whole , the people in kosovo want to finally decide for themselves about their future after their long and , at times , tragic history . what is the everyday routine like for you and your soldiers ? the daily routine of my soldiers varies greatly , depending on their respective tasks .
but the overall conditions are the same for all of them .
every soldier without shift duty , night-time operations or other duties works monday through friday from 7:30 a.m. to 7:30 p.m. , but there are many who work beyond that .
on saturday , we start an hour later and on sunday duty is from 1:30 p.m. to 6:30 p.m. another special thing on sunday is that , at 11:00 , we hold our religious service in our small church , which was built by our soldiers a few years ago .
we are always accompanied by our church choir , which i sing in myself . my own daily routine depends on whether talks with politicians or other people are on my schedule .
the morning hours are especially important to me because i can prepare myself for the tasks ahead .
a half hour of bible study helps me get into the mood to go to work . after that , i have various appointments that are coordinated by my military assistant and aide de camp .
there are negotiations with civic representatives , briefings with my advisors and commanders and , of course , visits with the troops at the different field camps in and around prizren . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : kosovo 's political leaders , fatmir sejdiu , left , and hashim thaci , expect much of the eu normally , i am busy every day from about 7:00 a.m. to 9:00 p.m.
but , of course , i am available for all members of the german contingent outside those hours , too . what is your personal goal in kosovo ?
what do you want to leave behind ? the most important goal is get all servicemen and women home again safely . apart from that , i want to contribute to seeing our mission accomplished as well as possible .
to ensure a safe and secure environment and freedom of movement for all ethnic groups .
that the people of kosovo have a positive perspective on their future , and that our servicemen and women are recognized for continuing the tradition of their predecessor under the motto " helping others help themselves . " i want to ensure that , within the framework of our civil-military cooperation , we continue to contribute to the building of a kosovar society and , above all , give the children a better future by building schools and helping them with job qualifications . apart from our military mission we have been able to directly help people living below the poverty threshold with a variety of initiatives supported by donations from germany .
in addition , we 've been able to provide school materials to students . if this has succeeded in assuring the survival of at least a few people or facilitated learning , it is a big enough legacy . interview : kate bowen send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

he said the situation in the serbian province remains calm but not stable . brig. gen. robert bund commands the 2,200 soldiers that make up the german contingent in the nato-led kosovo protection force -lrb- kfor -rrb- . dw-world.de : how did you prepare yourself personally for your role as leader of the german contingent in kosovo ? robert bund : i consider myself generally well prepared , especially in the area of leadership , as a result of my previous career assignments during my 40 years of service with the bundeswehr .
moving through the various ranks from company commander -lsb- who is in charge of up to 200 servicemen and women -rsb- all the way up to brigade commander -lsb- who is responsible for some 5,000 soldiers -rsb- , you gain so much experience that you should be ready to successfully confront all the challenges of a foreign operation . like any other soldier , i went through the whole range of preparatory training for this mission .
one hostage exercise we did left an impression .
role-players had to act as realistically as possible and were constantly monitored by psychologists . to round off my technical preparation , i studied the history and the political and social conditions in kosovo intensively .
and , of course , there were intensive talks with my wife and our children as well as with the members of my home church , the free protestant church , to emotionally prepare me for my long tour .
support from family and community makes it easier to take on the burdens of an operation abroad and the separation from home and it can be transformed into something positive . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : better living conditions will keep youth from joining radical groups , said bund how do you motivate your troops ? the leadership principle that i try to put into practice is based on two pillars .
the first pillar is trust . i treat all servicemen and women with unrestricted trust .
this means that i take each one seriously as an individual - with their questions , problems and specialized knowledge .
every single soldier is a specialist in his or her field , and i put my trust in their skills , even in our daily contact with each other .
but this trust also means that each person must be aware of their responsibility , too , and has to act accordingly - that is , responsibly .
i firmly demand this of everyone . the second pillar is comradeship .
back in germany , comradeship is a basic principle , but it plays a much more important role in a foreign operation .
i see comradeship as independent of rank or chain of command .
a particularly important point for me in this respect is looking after each other , taking notice of and dealing with one another in a positive manner and being aware of when others need help . in addition , i continually try to get a feel for the general mood , take notice of problems and explain my position on a whole range of different issues during our meetings .
in other words , i try to stay in touch with my soldiers . i also make use of the camp 's radio station , where all soldiers have the opportunity to ask questions on the air or in writing .
i respond to them during a question-and-answer broadcast called " commander on air . " what have you learned about the culture in kosovo ?
which aspects interest you the most ? i am most interested in the evolution of the political process .
europe and the us have clearly expressed their positions on the matter and the people in kosovo put all their trust in the support from these countries - and their expectations are high . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the people of kosovo want to decide on their future for themselves , said bund i have learned that these people are highly aware of their situation .
they know that never before in their history have they been so close to a potentially historic decision and that anything that deviates from normalcy would jeopardize the current decision process , possibly setting it back for years .
however , they 're not going to wait forever .
that is why we assess the situation as calm but not stable . i have also learned that the people in kosovo are among the youngest in europe .
the average age of the kosovo albanians is about 27 years .
this means that economic development over the next few years is extremely important .
only a significant improvement of the living conditions can prevent the young people from joining more radical movements .
improvement means secure electrical power supply 24 hours a day and modern roads and railway connections to the outside world . what surprised me is the way islam is practiced here .
here in kosovo i was able to gain insight into islamic practices through my many meetings with religious leaders .
i was very impressed that , when the catholic bishop consecrated a new altar , members off different faiths attended the mass and ate together afterwards . on the whole , the people in kosovo want to finally decide for themselves about their future after their long and , at times , tragic history . what is the everyday routine like for you and your soldiers ? the daily routine of my soldiers varies greatly , depending on their respective tasks .
but the overall conditions are the same for all of them .
every soldier without shift duty , night-time operations or other duties works monday through friday from 7:30 a.m. to 7:30 p.m. , but there are many who work beyond that .
on saturday , we start an hour later and on sunday duty is from 1:30 p.m. to 6:30 p.m. another special thing on sunday is that , at 11:00 , we hold our religious service in our small church , which was built by our soldiers a few years ago .
we are always accompanied by our church choir , which i sing in myself . my own daily routine depends on whether talks with politicians or other people are on my schedule .
the morning hours are especially important to me because i can prepare myself for the tasks ahead .
a half hour of bible study helps me get into the mood to go to work . after that , i have various appointments that are coordinated by my military assistant and aide de camp .
there are negotiations with civic representatives , briefings with my advisors and commanders and , of course , visits with the troops at the different field camps in and around prizren . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : kosovo 's political leaders , fatmir sejdiu , left , and hashim thaci , expect much of the eu normally , i am busy every day from about 7:00 a.m. to 9:00 p.m.
but , of course , i am available for all members of the german contingent outside those hours , too . what is your personal goal in kosovo ?
what do you want to leave behind ? the most important goal is get all servicemen and women home again safely . apart from that , i want to contribute to seeing our mission accomplished as well as possible .
to ensure a safe and secure environment and freedom of movement for all ethnic groups .
that the people of kosovo have a positive perspective on their future , and that our servicemen and women are recognized for continuing the tradition of their predecessor under the motto " helping others help themselves . " i want to ensure that , within the framework of our civil-military cooperation , we continue to contribute to the building of a kosovar society and , above all , give the children a better future by building schools and helping them with job qualifications . apart from our military mission we have been able to directly help people living below the poverty threshold with a variety of initiatives supported by donations from germany .

" the church of scientology , of which cruise is a leading member , reacted furiously to a newspaper interview by german historian guido knopp in which he drew parallels between the hollywood star and nazi propaganda minister joseph goebbels . " bild am sonntag is grossly irresponsible for publishing horrendous and disgraceful claims about mr. cruise , " the church 's public affairs director , karin pouw said , referring to the german mass-selling tabloid which published the interview . pouw said the footage , which surfaced on the youtube web site this week , was a pirated , edited video taken from a three-hour event . " bild am sonntag has disgracefully misinterpreted mr cruise 's remarks , " pouw said .
" he was giving an acceptance speech for a humanitarian award bestowed in honor of his efforts for global literacy .
in doing so , he was urging other people to become involved in similar humanitarian activities to the betterment of all . historian says speech stirs ugly memories knopp , who works for german broadcaster zdf and heads their programs on contemporary history , said over the weekend that the mission impossible star 's speech to other scientology members , leaked on to the internet this week , was reminiscent of a 1943 speech by propaganda minister , joseph göbbels . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : knopp drew parallels between cruise 's speech and that of göbbels , right the speech that cruise made four years ago asks fellow members of the church : " should we clean this place up ? " knopp said it was sure to remind germans of göbbel 's notorious speech in berlin on feb .
18 , 1943 when he asked the audience : " do you want total war ? " " it may be the case that cruise 's delivery style is not uncommon in certain religious movements in the us , " knopp said .
" but for germans with an interest in history , that scene where he asks whether the scientologists should clean up the world and everyone shouts ' yes ' is inevitably reminiscent of göbbel 's notorious speech . " scientology deeply controversial in germany unlike the us , germany does not recognize scientology as a church and there are debates about whether to ban the organization .
the movement is often described as a sect that exploits its members financially .
in december , regional ministers agreed to investigate the possibility of banning it . cruise also sparked controversy in germany last year because of his role as a nazi resistance hero claus schenk von stauffenberg in a new film , " valkyrie " of which he is also the producer .
von stauffenberg led the failed valkyrie plot , from which the film takes its name , to assassinate adolf hitler in 1944 . cruise 's plans to film a part of the film at the german defense ministry in berlin , where stauffenberg was executed after the failed assassination attempt , met with resistance from german government officials because of his links with scientology . the officials later changed tack and allowed the filming to go ahead .
cruise 's role in scientology is examined in an explosive unauthorized biography of the actor by british writer andrew morton which hit shelves in the united states earlier this month . the publication of the book has been given wide coverage in german media .
it was described by scientology as " replete with lies . " karin pouw said germany had misunderstood the us actor .

" the church of scientology , of which cruise is a leading member , reacted furiously to a newspaper interview by german historian guido knopp in which he drew parallels between the hollywood star and nazi propaganda minister joseph goebbels . " bild am sonntag is grossly irresponsible for publishing horrendous and disgraceful claims about mr. cruise , " the church 's public affairs director , karin pouw said , referring to the german mass-selling tabloid which published the interview . pouw said the footage , which surfaced on the youtube web site this week , was a pirated , edited video taken from a three-hour event . " bild am sonntag has disgracefully misinterpreted mr cruise 's remarks , " pouw said .
" he was giving an acceptance speech for a humanitarian award bestowed in honor of his efforts for global literacy .
in doing so , he was urging other people to become involved in similar humanitarian activities to the betterment of all . historian says speech stirs ugly memories knopp , who works for german broadcaster zdf and heads their programs on contemporary history , said over the weekend that the mission impossible star 's speech to other scientology members , leaked on to the internet this week , was reminiscent of a 1943 speech by propaganda minister , joseph göbbels . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : knopp drew parallels between cruise 's speech and that of göbbels , right the speech that cruise made four years ago asks fellow members of the church : " should we clean this place up ? " knopp said it was sure to remind germans of göbbel 's notorious speech in berlin on feb .
18 , 1943 when he asked the audience : " do you want total war ? " " it may be the case that cruise 's delivery style is not uncommon in certain religious movements in the us , " knopp said .
" but for germans with an interest in history , that scene where he asks whether the scientologists should clean up the world and everyone shouts ' yes ' is inevitably reminiscent of göbbel 's notorious speech . " scientology deeply controversial in germany unlike the us , germany does not recognize scientology as a church and there are debates about whether to ban the organization .
the movement is often described as a sect that exploits its members financially .
in december , regional ministers agreed to investigate the possibility of banning it . cruise also sparked controversy in germany last year because of his role as a nazi resistance hero claus schenk von stauffenberg in a new film , " valkyrie " of which he is also the producer .
von stauffenberg led the failed valkyrie plot , from which the film takes its name , to assassinate adolf hitler in 1944 . cruise 's plans to film a part of the film at the german defense ministry in berlin , where stauffenberg was executed after the failed assassination attempt , met with resistance from german government officials because of his links with scientology . the officials later changed tack and allowed the filming to go ahead .
cruise 's role in scientology is examined in an explosive unauthorized biography of the actor by british writer andrew morton which hit shelves in the united states earlier this month . the publication of the book has been given wide coverage in german media .
it was described by scientology as " replete with lies . " karin pouw said germany had misunderstood the us actor . " anyone who knows mr cruise knows that he does not have a prejudicial bone in his body and that , unlike bild am sonntag and other german anti-religionists , he does not discriminate against any other religion , race or color .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de food and drink -pipe- 22.01.2008 parmalat trial could open door for civil proceedings großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the shares might have crashed but the company kept on milking when things began to go sour at italian dairy company parmalat the company sued 45 italian and international banks .
on jan .
22 , a criminal trial began against four international banks charged with stock manipulation . parmalat was seen as a successful italian dairy company - until 2003 when it became a sensational fraud case .
behind the bright colored milk cartons - and even a soccer team - a financial black hole was growing .
as early as 1993 , parmalat officials allegedly began to cook the books .
on dec .
24 , 2003 , shareholders and bond holders did n't quite receive the christmas present they were after .
parmalat shares lost 97 percent and was de-listed from the stock exchange .
the chief executive officer and five former parmalat executives were arrested and a fraud investigation began .
in 2004 , auditors determined that parmalat had debts of around 14.3 billion euros -lrb- $ 20.9 billion -rrb- . two years after the spills were mopped up , a new parmalat emerged .
investors were n't buying into the milk or cream business , but the chance to recoup losses through a settlement with the banks and accounting firms accused of helping conceal its dire financial condition .
in the meantime , multiple legal skirmishes have been played out in courtrooms in parma and milan . on tuesday , jan .
22 , proceedings began in milan against four large international banks - citigroup , deutsche bank , morgan stanley and ubs - charged with stock manipulation of parmalat bonds sold in 2003 . if the banks are found guilty the banks could face fines of up to 5 million euros and have their profits seized .
a guilty ruling could also open the door to civil proceedings by investors . dw-world.de talked to beppe scienza , a lecturer in financial mathematics at the university of turin and author of the books " the cheated investors " and " stocks , policies and parmalat - what 's the worst ? "
he has been following the financial market for over 30 years . dw-world.de : parmalat was not a small or weak company - it was the eighth largest company in italy and a global brand .
how is it that the so-called coca cola of milk production began to go sour ? beppe scienza : the interesting thing about parmalat is that at the industrial level nothing changed .
the company continued to produce and so the industrial aspect remained untouched .
as for exactly how this happened , no one knows and no one has studied all the factors that led to the collapse .
however , these things often begin because someone is trying to cover up some kind of mistake or some kind of loss .
perhaps they invent an excuse to cover up an imbalance .
no one knows why this was done or where the money has ended up . it 's interesting to note that the parmalat dividends were n't very high and this , among other things , gave faith to investors .
when a dividend is very high there is usually a high risk , but when the dividend is , as in the case of parmalat , only a little high then it gives the idea that the company could be in difficulty , but it does n't indicate that it 's going to collapse . what could have been the role played by international banks , like deutsche bank , in the parmalat scandal ? i do n't think it was really that much different from the role of the italian banks .
they helped to sell shares .
some employee of the bank was probably corrupt , but the banks themselves must have known something .
like the italian banks , they were creditors so they had to replace the money . how important is what happens in the courtroom in milan over the next few months ? in order to write an honest history of what happened with parmalat , it is important because we might be able to understand the dynamics of what caused this to happen .
for the bond holders it could be important if there is a guilty verdict , because then it opens the door for civil cases to obtain compensation . will investors ever recover everything that they lost ? on a large scale : no .
a majority of investors wo n't recover what they lost .
in these cases where there 's a collapse and the money disappears , it 's better not to have the illusion that you will recover everything . what impact has the parmalat scandal had on the food industry in europe ? i think that it has little impact on the food industry .
it was n't really a bankruptcy in the sense that the company was closed down and assets sold off at auction .
the company continued production so from the industry point of view nothing changed . so it was only the investors who found themselves burnt by this scandal ? yes , and the creditors and the banks , which lost a big slice of their money . is the parmalat scandal the worst thing that has happened to italian investors ? the collapse of parmalat was used by the banks to convince individuals not to not buy shares or bonds but put their money into managed investment funds .
it 's true that investors lost a lot of money with parmalat , but if we look at managed investment funds then we discover that the loss to investors is around 20 billion euros .
now , the loss in italy from the parmalat scandal is around 3 billion euros .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de economy -pipe- 22.01.2008 effects of us recession could be held at bay , experts say großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : some experts said the us has become less important for the global economy global markets have plunged , partly due to fear of a recession in the united states , the world 's biggest economy .
but european experts say dynamic developing countries like china could offset us troubles . looking at the way the markets have plummeted , it appears an old adage rings true : " when the us sneezes , the rest of the world gets a cold . " panic spread across the frankfurt trading floor on monday , jan .
21 , when the country 's dax index experienced its biggest plunge since the sept .
11 , 2001 terrorist attacks in the united states . fears of a us recession , partly sparked by the recent credit crisis , and the possibility that it could lead to an international economic crisis also sent other european and asian into nose dives . over-sensitivity of markets ? bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : traders at the stock exchange in frankfurt tried to fend off panic yet , despite the panic , a majority of finance experts estimate the likelihood of a us recession at only 40 percent .
economists at german banks including dekabank and westlb assess the situation even more modestly , believing that a recession risk stands at only 25 percent . some analysts also point to a university of michigan consumer confidence reading for january , which last week stood at 80.5 percent , up from 75.5 percent in december .
this has led some to believe that consumer sentiment - which helps to drive markets - is up despite fears of a recession . but jörg krämer , chief economist at commerzbank , stressed the complexity of the situation . " we expect the us economy to stagnate in the first half of 2008 , which will feel like a recession , " he said . huge growth on chinese and indian markets bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : china could help balance out other markets other economic analysts have said that even if the us economy were to shrink , the rapidly expanding markets of developing countries in asia could offset a recession in the us , or at least minimize its effects .
after all , consumer growth rates in hong kong , china , thailand , malaysia and india tally up to 15 percent of the global economy . " the us economy is no longer as important for the world economic situation as it used to be , " said dutch world bank economist hans timmer . but krämer - and others - remains skeptical . " to be able to compensate for a us recession , growth in china would have to pick up even more , " said gabriele widmann , a dekabank analyst for the us market , adding that such growth would be difficult as the us is an important destination for asian goods . budgets and companies feeling the credit squeeze pessimists therefore fear that decreasing us demand for asian products could prompt a " domino effect . "
should american consumers lose their desire to buy , the dominos in the markets so dependent on exports to the us could start to tumble . " if growth of the us economy slows by one percent , business activity in germany likewise slows by a half percent , " krämer said . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : japanese and other asian stocks also plunged on monday furthermore , american financial market policies do not necessarily instill hope . us federal reserve bank chairman ben bernanke may have repeatedly lowered the prime interest rate since the mortgage crisis in the us erupted last year , but the lowered interest rates do not have the desired effect where they are most needed .
interest rates on the corporate bond and consumer credit markets have remained the same or have even risen . also , a multi-billion-dollar proposal by us president george w. bush last week to temporarily cut taxes and implement other measures to fend off a possible recession has failed to calm the financial mood . us business activity , after all , has often proven to be resistant to politics .

but insiders say the affair sets a precedent in a totally different way . french president nicolas sarkozy has broken with precedent like no other occupant of the elysee palace . the son of a hungarian aristocrat and grandson of a greek-jewish doctor , he embodies the multi-ethnic diversity of france that is reflected in some of his cabinet choices .
half of all top ministerial posts are filled by women , the highest proportion ever in france .
sarkozy , whose gaullist party ump is right of center , has even poached some of the best minds from his socialist rivals , such as the unusual choice of bernard kouchner , a medical doctor , as foreign minister . in october , sarkozy became the first head of state not only to divorce , but to do so in office , which prompted the release of three best-selling books about his ex-wife , cecilia ciganer . " speedy sarko " captivates public with new love bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : sarkozy waited until after the elections to get divorced from cecilia then one saturday afternoon in mid-december he showed up in disneyland paris with his new flame , carla bruni .
since then , the public has been bombarded with images of the italian ex-supermodel turned pop singer and the details of her past relationships with rock stars , actors and france 's literati .
bruni 's uncanny physical resemblance to cecilia - both are tall , striking blue-eyed brunettes , has all of france putting the president on the psychoanalyst 's couch debating whether " speedy sarko " is now suddenly on the rebound after his ex had ceremoniously left him . in news reports , prime minister francois fillon had even complained that the president was behaving like a love-struck teenager at cabinet meetings . " he giggles , " said fillon in an interview with the widely respected french satirical newspaper le canard enchaine .
" when we talk to him , he does not always listen .
he cancels meetings , which is not like him . " on jan .
8 at a lengthy news conference , the 52-year-old president admitted to a " serious relationship " with bruni , 40 , and talked about the emotional pain of divorce .
but his refusal to confirm or deny marriage rumors has only fuelled even more press speculation about the couple 's intentions . no more taboos on discussing a president 's love life that sarkozy himself even discussed his private life at all in such a public forum however was remarkable and unprecedented in the annals of presidential history , according to french sociologists and media watchers . although the sexual peccadilloes of former presidents such as francois mitterrand , who had fathered a daughter out of wedlock , were long known to media insiders , there used to be a silent pact among journalists that the private lives of top politicians were off-limits , according to denis muzet , founder of the paris-based politics and media institute , mediascopie . " taboos have been lifted , " said muzet , who explained that once bernadette , the wife of former president jacques chirac published her popular memoirs about her husband 's infidelities , the floodgates started to open and in a sense liberated the couple from the constraints of the presidency . " the rules have been changing considerably since the death of princess diana 10 years ago , " he added .
" what i call ' peoplization of the press ' is so banal now that even the serious press jumps on the bandwagon . " sarkozy , whose political mentor was chirac , has simply gone much further than his predecessor in exposing his private life to public view . french press freer than ever to set the agenda bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the portrait of an attractive , harmonious family helps the presidential image " he wants to show that even presidents live , love and suffer like ordinary people , " said muzet , who dismissed suggestions that sarkozy is trying to divert the french from real problems their country faces from social unrest in the immigrant suburbs to rising consumer prices that have diminished purchasing power .
" he wants to show he is transparent and has nothing to hide , down to photos of him on the beach in his swimming trunks . " thierry saussez , a close personal advisor to the president who founded the corporate communications agency image et strategie europe , also emphasized that sarkozy is not trying to deflect the country 's focus from the economic slowdown by flaunting his private life as a few commentators have suggested .
the french press is now freer than ever to set the agenda , he said . " under mitterrand , journalists and others who knew about mitterrand 's illegitimate daughter were under tremendous pressure to keep his double life under wraps , " said saussez , who explained that the public has become so saturated with intimate images of their president enjoying the egyptian pyramids with bruni during the christmas holidays that it has contributed to a drop in the polls .
" and now it 's gone the other way with too much exposure of a president 's private life . " for the first time since sarkozy assumed office in may when he was riding a wave of popularity with two-thirds of the public supporting him , his approvals ratings have now dipped to below 50 percent , according to all pollsters .
but saussez was careful to point out that the bruni brouhaha is only part of the reason for the poll results . " the public needs assurances that the president is working hard and doing his job , not just having fun , " he said .
" but the french are also a very impatient people and they want the president to fix their problems right away . " are they getting married ? bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : bruni looks like a younger version of sarkozy 's ex-wife , who was also a model but did sarkozy have to make disneyland of all places , the site for his first very public outing with bruni ? " sarkozy is behaving in a way that no french president has , " said helene brunerie , a french artist living in germany .
" he 's divorced and suddenly in the arms of a top model . " on one hand i 'm glad that the press in france has the freedom to be so colorful and uninhibited , but the image of the french president that is being projected to the world is undignified , " she added , reflecting the view of many french citizens living abroad . to both sarkozy admirers and detractors , the image problem can at least be partially fixed if he tied the knot with bruni . for one it would solve sticky protocol problems when they travel abroad on official presidential visits as a couple .
on friday , the french president will be in india , where officials are beside themselves about whether to give bruni the first lady or the girlfriend treatment . saussez predicted that bruni will not go , thereby keeping the public guessing about his marital status .

sarkozy , whose gaullist party ump is right of center , has even poached some of the best minds from his socialist rivals , such as the unusual choice of bernard kouchner , a medical doctor , as foreign minister . in october , sarkozy became the first head of state not only to divorce , but to do so in office , which prompted the release of three best-selling books about his ex-wife , cecilia ciganer . " speedy sarko " captivates public with new love bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : sarkozy waited until after the elections to get divorced from cecilia then one saturday afternoon in mid-december he showed up in disneyland paris with his new flame , carla bruni .
since then , the public has been bombarded with images of the italian ex-supermodel turned pop singer and the details of her past relationships with rock stars , actors and france 's literati .
bruni 's uncanny physical resemblance to cecilia - both are tall , striking blue-eyed brunettes , has all of france putting the president on the psychoanalyst 's couch debating whether " speedy sarko " is now suddenly on the rebound after his ex had ceremoniously left him . in news reports , prime minister francois fillon had even complained that the president was behaving like a love-struck teenager at cabinet meetings . " he giggles , " said fillon in an interview with the widely respected french satirical newspaper le canard enchaine .
" when we talk to him , he does not always listen .
he cancels meetings , which is not like him . " on jan .
8 at a lengthy news conference , the 52-year-old president admitted to a " serious relationship " with bruni , 40 , and talked about the emotional pain of divorce .
but his refusal to confirm or deny marriage rumors has only fuelled even more press speculation about the couple 's intentions . no more taboos on discussing a president 's love life that sarkozy himself even discussed his private life at all in such a public forum however was remarkable and unprecedented in the annals of presidential history , according to french sociologists and media watchers . although the sexual peccadilloes of former presidents such as francois mitterrand , who had fathered a daughter out of wedlock , were long known to media insiders , there used to be a silent pact among journalists that the private lives of top politicians were off-limits , according to denis muzet , founder of the paris-based politics and media institute , mediascopie . " taboos have been lifted , " said muzet , who explained that once bernadette , the wife of former president jacques chirac published her popular memoirs about her husband 's infidelities , the floodgates started to open and in a sense liberated the couple from the constraints of the presidency . " the rules have been changing considerably since the death of princess diana 10 years ago , " he added .
" what i call ' peoplization of the press ' is so banal now that even the serious press jumps on the bandwagon . " sarkozy , whose political mentor was chirac , has simply gone much further than his predecessor in exposing his private life to public view . french press freer than ever to set the agenda bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the portrait of an attractive , harmonious family helps the presidential image " he wants to show that even presidents live , love and suffer like ordinary people , " said muzet , who dismissed suggestions that sarkozy is trying to divert the french from real problems their country faces from social unrest in the immigrant suburbs to rising consumer prices that have diminished purchasing power .
" he wants to show he is transparent and has nothing to hide , down to photos of him on the beach in his swimming trunks . " thierry saussez , a close personal advisor to the president who founded the corporate communications agency image et strategie europe , also emphasized that sarkozy is not trying to deflect the country 's focus from the economic slowdown by flaunting his private life as a few commentators have suggested .
the french press is now freer than ever to set the agenda , he said . " under mitterrand , journalists and others who knew about mitterrand 's illegitimate daughter were under tremendous pressure to keep his double life under wraps , " said saussez , who explained that the public has become so saturated with intimate images of their president enjoying the egyptian pyramids with bruni during the christmas holidays that it has contributed to a drop in the polls .
" and now it 's gone the other way with too much exposure of a president 's private life . " for the first time since sarkozy assumed office in may when he was riding a wave of popularity with two-thirds of the public supporting him , his approvals ratings have now dipped to below 50 percent , according to all pollsters .
but saussez was careful to point out that the bruni brouhaha is only part of the reason for the poll results . " the public needs assurances that the president is working hard and doing his job , not just having fun , " he said .
" but the french are also a very impatient people and they want the president to fix their problems right away . " are they getting married ? bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : bruni looks like a younger version of sarkozy 's ex-wife , who was also a model but did sarkozy have to make disneyland of all places , the site for his first very public outing with bruni ? " sarkozy is behaving in a way that no french president has , " said helene brunerie , a french artist living in germany .
" he 's divorced and suddenly in the arms of a top model . " on one hand i 'm glad that the press in france has the freedom to be so colorful and uninhibited , but the image of the french president that is being projected to the world is undignified , " she added , reflecting the view of many french citizens living abroad . to both sarkozy admirers and detractors , the image problem can at least be partially fixed if he tied the knot with bruni . for one it would solve sticky protocol problems when they travel abroad on official presidential visits as a couple .
on friday , the french president will be in india , where officials are beside themselves about whether to give bruni the first lady or the girlfriend treatment . saussez predicted that bruni will not go , thereby keeping the public guessing about his marital status .

" it was an unofficial meeting and we shall now start official talks , " suominen told ap news agency , but gave no details . a spokesman for ig metall in düsseldorf told dpa news service of the meeting : " the management presented the closure plans again and repeated their inadequate and already known explanation of why .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de people -pipe- 22.01.2008 german historian compares tom cruise speech to nazi minister großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : it 's not the first time cruise has sparked controversy in germany scientology has rejected comments by a german historian comparing a speech by hollywood star tom cruise to one by a nazi minister , accusing the paper that published it of being " grossly irresponsible . " the church of scientology , of which cruise is a leading member , reacted furiously to a newspaper interview by german historian guido knopp in which he drew parallels between the hollywood star and nazi propaganda minister joseph goebbels . " bild am sonntag is grossly irresponsible for publishing horrendous and disgraceful claims about mr. cruise , " the church 's public affairs director , karin pouw said , referring to the german mass-selling tabloid which published the interview . pouw said the footage , which surfaced on the youtube web site this week , was a pirated , edited video taken from a three-hour event . " bild am sonntag has disgracefully misinterpreted mr cruise 's remarks , " pouw said .
" he was giving an acceptance speech for a humanitarian award bestowed in honor of his efforts for global literacy .
in doing so , he was urging other people to become involved in similar humanitarian activities to the betterment of all . historian says speech stirs ugly memories knopp , who works for german broadcaster zdf and heads their programs on contemporary history , said over the weekend that the mission impossible star 's speech to other scientology members , leaked on to the internet this week , was reminiscent of a 1943 speech by propaganda minister , joseph göbbels . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : knopp drew parallels between cruise 's speech and that of göbbels , right the speech that cruise made four years ago asks fellow members of the church : " should we clean this place up ? " knopp said it was sure to remind germans of göbbel 's notorious speech in berlin on feb .
18 , 1943 when he asked the audience : " do you want total war ? " " it may be the case that cruise 's delivery style is not uncommon in certain religious movements in the us , " knopp said .
" but for germans with an interest in history , that scene where he asks whether the scientologists should clean up the world and everyone shouts ' yes ' is inevitably reminiscent of göbbel 's notorious speech . " scientology deeply controversial in germany unlike the us , germany does not recognize scientology as a church and there are debates about whether to ban the organization .
the movement is often described as a sect that exploits its members financially .
in december , regional ministers agreed to investigate the possibility of banning it . cruise also sparked controversy in germany last year because of his role as a nazi resistance hero claus schenk von stauffenberg in a new film , " valkyrie " of which he is also the producer .
von stauffenberg led the failed valkyrie plot , from which the film takes its name , to assassinate adolf hitler in 1944 . cruise 's plans to film a part of the film at the german defense ministry in berlin , where stauffenberg was executed after the failed assassination attempt , met with resistance from german government officials because of his links with scientology . the officials later changed tack and allowed the filming to go ahead .
cruise 's role in scientology is examined in an explosive unauthorized biography of the actor by british writer andrew morton which hit shelves in the united states earlier this month . the publication of the book has been given wide coverage in german media .
it was described by scientology as " replete with lies . " karin pouw said germany had misunderstood the us actor . " anyone who knows mr cruise knows that he does not have a prejudicial bone in his body and that , unlike bild am sonntag and other german anti-religionists , he does not discriminate against any other religion , race or color .

" the church of scientology , of which cruise is a leading member , reacted furiously to a newspaper interview by german historian guido knopp in which he drew parallels between the hollywood star and nazi propaganda minister joseph goebbels . " bild am sonntag is grossly irresponsible for publishing horrendous and disgraceful claims about mr. cruise , " the church 's public affairs director , karin pouw said , referring to the german mass-selling tabloid which published the interview . pouw said the footage , which surfaced on the youtube web site this week , was a pirated , edited video taken from a three-hour event . " bild am sonntag has disgracefully misinterpreted mr cruise 's remarks , " pouw said .
" he was giving an acceptance speech for a humanitarian award bestowed in honor of his efforts for global literacy .
in doing so , he was urging other people to become involved in similar humanitarian activities to the betterment of all . historian says speech stirs ugly memories knopp , who works for german broadcaster zdf and heads their programs on contemporary history , said over the weekend that the mission impossible star 's speech to other scientology members , leaked on to the internet this week , was reminiscent of a 1943 speech by propaganda minister , joseph göbbels . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : knopp drew parallels between cruise 's speech and that of göbbels , right the speech that cruise made four years ago asks fellow members of the church : " should we clean this place up ? " knopp said it was sure to remind germans of göbbel 's notorious speech in berlin on feb .
18 , 1943 when he asked the audience : " do you want total war ? " " it may be the case that cruise 's delivery style is not uncommon in certain religious movements in the us , " knopp said .
" but for germans with an interest in history , that scene where he asks whether the scientologists should clean up the world and everyone shouts ' yes ' is inevitably reminiscent of göbbel 's notorious speech . " scientology deeply controversial in germany unlike the us , germany does not recognize scientology as a church and there are debates about whether to ban the organization .
the movement is often described as a sect that exploits its members financially .
in december , regional ministers agreed to investigate the possibility of banning it . cruise also sparked controversy in germany last year because of his role as a nazi resistance hero claus schenk von stauffenberg in a new film , " valkyrie " of which he is also the producer .
von stauffenberg led the failed valkyrie plot , from which the film takes its name , to assassinate adolf hitler in 1944 . cruise 's plans to film a part of the film at the german defense ministry in berlin , where stauffenberg was executed after the failed assassination attempt , met with resistance from german government officials because of his links with scientology . the officials later changed tack and allowed the filming to go ahead .
cruise 's role in scientology is examined in an explosive unauthorized biography of the actor by british writer andrew morton which hit shelves in the united states earlier this month . the publication of the book has been given wide coverage in german media .
it was described by scientology as " replete with lies . " karin pouw said germany had misunderstood the us actor . " anyone who knows mr cruise knows that he does not have a prejudicial bone in his body and that , unlike bild am sonntag and other german anti-religionists , he does not discriminate against any other religion , race or color .

" but for germans with an interest in history , that scene where he asks whether the scientologists should clean up the world and everyone shouts ' yes ' is inevitably reminiscent of göbbel 's notorious speech . " scientology deeply controversial in germany unlike the us , germany does not recognize scientology as a church and there are debates about whether to ban the organization .
the movement is often described as a sect that exploits its members financially .
in december , regional ministers agreed to investigate the possibility of banning it . cruise also sparked controversy in germany last year because of his role as a nazi resistance hero claus schenk von stauffenberg in a new film , " valkyrie " of which he is also the producer .
von stauffenberg led the failed valkyrie plot , from which the film takes its name , to assassinate adolf hitler in 1944 . cruise 's plans to film a part of the film at the german defense ministry in berlin , where stauffenberg was executed after the failed assassination attempt , met with resistance from german government officials because of his links with scientology . the officials later changed tack and allowed the filming to go ahead .
cruise 's role in scientology is examined in an explosive unauthorized biography of the actor by british writer andrew morton which hit shelves in the united states earlier this month . the publication of the book has been given wide coverage in german media .
it was described by scientology as " replete with lies . " karin pouw said germany had misunderstood the us actor . " anyone who knows mr cruise knows that he does not have a prejudicial bone in his body and that , unlike bild am sonntag and other german anti-religionists , he does not discriminate against any other religion , race or color .

" we agreed on the contents of the next security council resolution , " steinmeier said .
" germany , france and great britain are going to submit the draft of such a text to the security council , " he said , adding that the security council would then discuss the matter in the normal way . steinmeier provided no details of the text of the draft and said further discussions would continue into tuesday night .
the other foreign ministers present did not speak , and no questions were allowed from the media . it is widely expected the third resolution will contain stringent sanctions . steinmeier , who called the meeting at short notice , had already predicted agreement and said he was particularly pleased that his russian and chinese counterparts were attending . dual track approach steinmeier said the six were " concerned about iran 's nuclear activities , " adding that a nuclear-armed iran " would have dramatic consequences for the middle east and beyond .

" we all want a solution to this matter , " steinmeier said . defiant iranians tehran was defiant in the face of the renewed pressure .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de food and drink -pipe- 22.01.2008 parmalat trial could open door for civil proceedings großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the shares might have crashed but the company kept on milking when things began to go sour at italian dairy company parmalat the company sued 45 italian and international banks .
on jan .
22 , a criminal trial began against four international banks charged with stock manipulation . parmalat was seen as a successful italian dairy company - until 2003 when it became a sensational fraud case .
behind the bright colored milk cartons - and even a soccer team - a financial black hole was growing .
as early as 1993 , parmalat officials allegedly began to cook the books .
on dec .
24 , 2003 , shareholders and bond holders did n't quite receive the christmas present they were after .
parmalat shares lost 97 percent and was de-listed from the stock exchange .
the chief executive officer and five former parmalat executives were arrested and a fraud investigation began .
in 2004 , auditors determined that parmalat had debts of around 14.3 billion euros -lrb- $ 20.9 billion -rrb- . two years after the spills were mopped up , a new parmalat emerged .
investors were n't buying into the milk or cream business , but the chance to recoup losses through a settlement with the banks and accounting firms accused of helping conceal its dire financial condition .
in the meantime , multiple legal skirmishes have been played out in courtrooms in parma and milan . on tuesday , jan .
22 , proceedings began in milan against four large international banks - citigroup , deutsche bank , morgan stanley and ubs - charged with stock manipulation of parmalat bonds sold in 2003 . if the banks are found guilty the banks could face fines of up to 5 million euros and have their profits seized .
a guilty ruling could also open the door to civil proceedings by investors . dw-world.de talked to beppe scienza , a lecturer in financial mathematics at the university of turin and author of the books " the cheated investors " and " stocks , policies and parmalat - what 's the worst ? "
he has been following the financial market for over 30 years . dw-world.de : parmalat was not a small or weak company - it was the eighth largest company in italy and a global brand .
how is it that the so-called coca cola of milk production began to go sour ? beppe scienza : the interesting thing about parmalat is that at the industrial level nothing changed .
the company continued to produce and so the industrial aspect remained untouched .
as for exactly how this happened , no one knows and no one has studied all the factors that led to the collapse .
however , these things often begin because someone is trying to cover up some kind of mistake or some kind of loss .
perhaps they invent an excuse to cover up an imbalance .
no one knows why this was done or where the money has ended up . it 's interesting to note that the parmalat dividends were n't very high and this , among other things , gave faith to investors .
when a dividend is very high there is usually a high risk , but when the dividend is , as in the case of parmalat , only a little high then it gives the idea that the company could be in difficulty , but it does n't indicate that it 's going to collapse . what could have been the role played by international banks , like deutsche bank , in the parmalat scandal ? i do n't think it was really that much different from the role of the italian banks .
they helped to sell shares .
some employee of the bank was probably corrupt , but the banks themselves must have known something .
like the italian banks , they were creditors so they had to replace the money . how important is what happens in the courtroom in milan over the next few months ? in order to write an honest history of what happened with parmalat , it is important because we might be able to understand the dynamics of what caused this to happen .
for the bond holders it could be important if there is a guilty verdict , because then it opens the door for civil cases to obtain compensation . will investors ever recover everything that they lost ? on a large scale : no .
a majority of investors wo n't recover what they lost .
in these cases where there 's a collapse and the money disappears , it 's better not to have the illusion that you will recover everything . what impact has the parmalat scandal had on the food industry in europe ? i think that it has little impact on the food industry .
it was n't really a bankruptcy in the sense that the company was closed down and assets sold off at auction .
the company continued production so from the industry point of view nothing changed . so it was only the investors who found themselves burnt by this scandal ? yes , and the creditors and the banks , which lost a big slice of their money . is the parmalat scandal the worst thing that has happened to italian investors ? the collapse of parmalat was used by the banks to convince individuals not to not buy shares or bonds but put their money into managed investment funds .
it 's true that investors lost a lot of money with parmalat , but if we look at managed investment funds then we discover that the loss to investors is around 20 billion euros .
now , the loss in italy from the parmalat scandal is around 3 billion euros .
unfortunately , the worst things that happen to italian investors are not these company collapses , but rather the mismanagement of managed investment funds . how new is the new parmalat - has anything changed ? the company has maintained the name and the production facilities , but for an investor the past story of parmalat has nothing to do with buying the stock today since all of the company 's debts were wiped out before its re-listing . interview : stephanie raison send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

moving through the various ranks from company commander -lsb- who is in charge of up to 200 servicemen and women -rsb- all the way up to brigade commander -lsb- who is responsible for some 5,000 soldiers -rsb- , you gain so much experience that you should be ready to successfully confront all the challenges of a foreign operation . like any other soldier , i went through the whole range of preparatory training for this mission .
one hostage exercise we did left an impression .
role-players had to act as realistically as possible and were constantly monitored by psychologists . to round off my technical preparation , i studied the history and the political and social conditions in kosovo intensively .
and , of course , there were intensive talks with my wife and our children as well as with the members of my home church , the free protestant church , to emotionally prepare me for my long tour .
support from family and community makes it easier to take on the burdens of an operation abroad and the separation from home and it can be transformed into something positive . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : better living conditions will keep youth from joining radical groups , said bund how do you motivate your troops ? the leadership principle that i try to put into practice is based on two pillars .
the first pillar is trust . i treat all servicemen and women with unrestricted trust .
this means that i take each one seriously as an individual - with their questions , problems and specialized knowledge .
every single soldier is a specialist in his or her field , and i put my trust in their skills , even in our daily contact with each other .
but this trust also means that each person must be aware of their responsibility , too , and has to act accordingly - that is , responsibly .
i firmly demand this of everyone . the second pillar is comradeship .
back in germany , comradeship is a basic principle , but it plays a much more important role in a foreign operation .
i see comradeship as independent of rank or chain of command .
a particularly important point for me in this respect is looking after each other , taking notice of and dealing with one another in a positive manner and being aware of when others need help . in addition , i continually try to get a feel for the general mood , take notice of problems and explain my position on a whole range of different issues during our meetings .
in other words , i try to stay in touch with my soldiers . i also make use of the camp 's radio station , where all soldiers have the opportunity to ask questions on the air or in writing .
i respond to them during a question-and-answer broadcast called " commander on air . " what have you learned about the culture in kosovo ?
which aspects interest you the most ? i am most interested in the evolution of the political process .
europe and the us have clearly expressed their positions on the matter and the people in kosovo put all their trust in the support from these countries - and their expectations are high . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the people of kosovo want to decide on their future for themselves , said bund i have learned that these people are highly aware of their situation .
they know that never before in their history have they been so close to a potentially historic decision and that anything that deviates from normalcy would jeopardize the current decision process , possibly setting it back for years .
however , they 're not going to wait forever .
that is why we assess the situation as calm but not stable . i have also learned that the people in kosovo are among the youngest in europe .
the average age of the kosovo albanians is about 27 years .
this means that economic development over the next few years is extremely important .
only a significant improvement of the living conditions can prevent the young people from joining more radical movements .
improvement means secure electrical power supply 24 hours a day and modern roads and railway connections to the outside world . what surprised me is the way islam is practiced here .
here in kosovo i was able to gain insight into islamic practices through my many meetings with religious leaders .
i was very impressed that , when the catholic bishop consecrated a new altar , members off different faiths attended the mass and ate together afterwards . on the whole , the people in kosovo want to finally decide for themselves about their future after their long and , at times , tragic history . what is the everyday routine like for you and your soldiers ? the daily routine of my soldiers varies greatly , depending on their respective tasks .
but the overall conditions are the same for all of them .
every soldier without shift duty , night-time operations or other duties works monday through friday from 7:30 a.m. to 7:30 p.m. , but there are many who work beyond that .
on saturday , we start an hour later and on sunday duty is from 1:30 p.m. to 6:30 p.m. another special thing on sunday is that , at 11:00 , we hold our religious service in our small church , which was built by our soldiers a few years ago .
we are always accompanied by our church choir , which i sing in myself . my own daily routine depends on whether talks with politicians or other people are on my schedule .
the morning hours are especially important to me because i can prepare myself for the tasks ahead .
a half hour of bible study helps me get into the mood to go to work . after that , i have various appointments that are coordinated by my military assistant and aide de camp .
there are negotiations with civic representatives , briefings with my advisors and commanders and , of course , visits with the troops at the different field camps in and around prizren . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : kosovo 's political leaders , fatmir sejdiu , left , and hashim thaci , expect much of the eu normally , i am busy every day from about 7:00 a.m. to 9:00 p.m.
but , of course , i am available for all members of the german contingent outside those hours , too . what is your personal goal in kosovo ?
what do you want to leave behind ? the most important goal is get all servicemen and women home again safely . apart from that , i want to contribute to seeing our mission accomplished as well as possible .
to ensure a safe and secure environment and freedom of movement for all ethnic groups .
that the people of kosovo have a positive perspective on their future , and that our servicemen and women are recognized for continuing the tradition of their predecessor under the motto " helping others help themselves . " i want to ensure that , within the framework of our civil-military cooperation , we continue to contribute to the building of a kosovar society and , above all , give the children a better future by building schools and helping them with job qualifications . apart from our military mission we have been able to directly help people living below the poverty threshold with a variety of initiatives supported by donations from germany .
in addition , we 've been able to provide school materials to students . if this has succeeded in assuring the survival of at least a few people or facilitated learning , it is a big enough legacy . interview : kate bowen send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

he said the situation in the serbian province remains calm but not stable . brig. gen. robert bund commands the 2,200 soldiers that make up the german contingent in the nato-led kosovo protection force -lrb- kfor -rrb- . dw-world.de : how did you prepare yourself personally for your role as leader of the german contingent in kosovo ? robert bund : i consider myself generally well prepared , especially in the area of leadership , as a result of my previous career assignments during my 40 years of service with the bundeswehr .
moving through the various ranks from company commander -lsb- who is in charge of up to 200 servicemen and women -rsb- all the way up to brigade commander -lsb- who is responsible for some 5,000 soldiers -rsb- , you gain so much experience that you should be ready to successfully confront all the challenges of a foreign operation . like any other soldier , i went through the whole range of preparatory training for this mission .
one hostage exercise we did left an impression .
role-players had to act as realistically as possible and were constantly monitored by psychologists . to round off my technical preparation , i studied the history and the political and social conditions in kosovo intensively .
and , of course , there were intensive talks with my wife and our children as well as with the members of my home church , the free protestant church , to emotionally prepare me for my long tour .
support from family and community makes it easier to take on the burdens of an operation abroad and the separation from home and it can be transformed into something positive . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : better living conditions will keep youth from joining radical groups , said bund how do you motivate your troops ? the leadership principle that i try to put into practice is based on two pillars .
the first pillar is trust . i treat all servicemen and women with unrestricted trust .
this means that i take each one seriously as an individual - with their questions , problems and specialized knowledge .
every single soldier is a specialist in his or her field , and i put my trust in their skills , even in our daily contact with each other .
but this trust also means that each person must be aware of their responsibility , too , and has to act accordingly - that is , responsibly .
i firmly demand this of everyone . the second pillar is comradeship .
back in germany , comradeship is a basic principle , but it plays a much more important role in a foreign operation .
i see comradeship as independent of rank or chain of command .
a particularly important point for me in this respect is looking after each other , taking notice of and dealing with one another in a positive manner and being aware of when others need help . in addition , i continually try to get a feel for the general mood , take notice of problems and explain my position on a whole range of different issues during our meetings .
in other words , i try to stay in touch with my soldiers . i also make use of the camp 's radio station , where all soldiers have the opportunity to ask questions on the air or in writing .
i respond to them during a question-and-answer broadcast called " commander on air . " what have you learned about the culture in kosovo ?
which aspects interest you the most ? i am most interested in the evolution of the political process .
europe and the us have clearly expressed their positions on the matter and the people in kosovo put all their trust in the support from these countries - and their expectations are high . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the people of kosovo want to decide on their future for themselves , said bund i have learned that these people are highly aware of their situation .
they know that never before in their history have they been so close to a potentially historic decision and that anything that deviates from normalcy would jeopardize the current decision process , possibly setting it back for years .
however , they 're not going to wait forever .
that is why we assess the situation as calm but not stable . i have also learned that the people in kosovo are among the youngest in europe .
the average age of the kosovo albanians is about 27 years .
this means that economic development over the next few years is extremely important .
only a significant improvement of the living conditions can prevent the young people from joining more radical movements .
improvement means secure electrical power supply 24 hours a day and modern roads and railway connections to the outside world . what surprised me is the way islam is practiced here .
here in kosovo i was able to gain insight into islamic practices through my many meetings with religious leaders .
i was very impressed that , when the catholic bishop consecrated a new altar , members off different faiths attended the mass and ate together afterwards . on the whole , the people in kosovo want to finally decide for themselves about their future after their long and , at times , tragic history . what is the everyday routine like for you and your soldiers ? the daily routine of my soldiers varies greatly , depending on their respective tasks .
but the overall conditions are the same for all of them .
every soldier without shift duty , night-time operations or other duties works monday through friday from 7:30 a.m. to 7:30 p.m. , but there are many who work beyond that .
on saturday , we start an hour later and on sunday duty is from 1:30 p.m. to 6:30 p.m. another special thing on sunday is that , at 11:00 , we hold our religious service in our small church , which was built by our soldiers a few years ago .
we are always accompanied by our church choir , which i sing in myself . my own daily routine depends on whether talks with politicians or other people are on my schedule .
the morning hours are especially important to me because i can prepare myself for the tasks ahead .
a half hour of bible study helps me get into the mood to go to work . after that , i have various appointments that are coordinated by my military assistant and aide de camp .
there are negotiations with civic representatives , briefings with my advisors and commanders and , of course , visits with the troops at the different field camps in and around prizren . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : kosovo 's political leaders , fatmir sejdiu , left , and hashim thaci , expect much of the eu normally , i am busy every day from about 7:00 a.m. to 9:00 p.m.
but , of course , i am available for all members of the german contingent outside those hours , too . what is your personal goal in kosovo ?
what do you want to leave behind ? the most important goal is get all servicemen and women home again safely . apart from that , i want to contribute to seeing our mission accomplished as well as possible .
to ensure a safe and secure environment and freedom of movement for all ethnic groups .
that the people of kosovo have a positive perspective on their future , and that our servicemen and women are recognized for continuing the tradition of their predecessor under the motto " helping others help themselves . " i want to ensure that , within the framework of our civil-military cooperation , we continue to contribute to the building of a kosovar society and , above all , give the children a better future by building schools and helping them with job qualifications . apart from our military mission we have been able to directly help people living below the poverty threshold with a variety of initiatives supported by donations from germany .
in addition , we 've been able to provide school materials to students . if this has succeeded in assuring the survival of at least a few people or facilitated learning , it is a big enough legacy . interview : kate bowen send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

on jan .
22 , a criminal trial began against four international banks charged with stock manipulation . parmalat was seen as a successful italian dairy company - until 2003 when it became a sensational fraud case .
behind the bright colored milk cartons - and even a soccer team - a financial black hole was growing .
as early as 1993 , parmalat officials allegedly began to cook the books .
on dec .
24 , 2003 , shareholders and bond holders did n't quite receive the christmas present they were after .
parmalat shares lost 97 percent and was de-listed from the stock exchange .
the chief executive officer and five former parmalat executives were arrested and a fraud investigation began .
in 2004 , auditors determined that parmalat had debts of around 14.3 billion euros -lrb- $ 20.9 billion -rrb- . two years after the spills were mopped up , a new parmalat emerged .
investors were n't buying into the milk or cream business , but the chance to recoup losses through a settlement with the banks and accounting firms accused of helping conceal its dire financial condition .
in the meantime , multiple legal skirmishes have been played out in courtrooms in parma and milan . on tuesday , jan .
22 , proceedings began in milan against four large international banks - citigroup , deutsche bank , morgan stanley and ubs - charged with stock manipulation of parmalat bonds sold in 2003 . if the banks are found guilty the banks could face fines of up to 5 million euros and have their profits seized .
a guilty ruling could also open the door to civil proceedings by investors . dw-world.de talked to beppe scienza , a lecturer in financial mathematics at the university of turin and author of the books " the cheated investors " and " stocks , policies and parmalat - what 's the worst ? "
he has been following the financial market for over 30 years . dw-world.de : parmalat was not a small or weak company - it was the eighth largest company in italy and a global brand .
how is it that the so-called coca cola of milk production began to go sour ? beppe scienza : the interesting thing about parmalat is that at the industrial level nothing changed .
the company continued to produce and so the industrial aspect remained untouched .
as for exactly how this happened , no one knows and no one has studied all the factors that led to the collapse .
however , these things often begin because someone is trying to cover up some kind of mistake or some kind of loss .
perhaps they invent an excuse to cover up an imbalance .
no one knows why this was done or where the money has ended up . it 's interesting to note that the parmalat dividends were n't very high and this , among other things , gave faith to investors .
when a dividend is very high there is usually a high risk , but when the dividend is , as in the case of parmalat , only a little high then it gives the idea that the company could be in difficulty , but it does n't indicate that it 's going to collapse . what could have been the role played by international banks , like deutsche bank , in the parmalat scandal ? i do n't think it was really that much different from the role of the italian banks .
they helped to sell shares .
some employee of the bank was probably corrupt , but the banks themselves must have known something .
like the italian banks , they were creditors so they had to replace the money . how important is what happens in the courtroom in milan over the next few months ? in order to write an honest history of what happened with parmalat , it is important because we might be able to understand the dynamics of what caused this to happen .
for the bond holders it could be important if there is a guilty verdict , because then it opens the door for civil cases to obtain compensation . will investors ever recover everything that they lost ? on a large scale : no .
a majority of investors wo n't recover what they lost .
in these cases where there 's a collapse and the money disappears , it 's better not to have the illusion that you will recover everything . what impact has the parmalat scandal had on the food industry in europe ? i think that it has little impact on the food industry .
it was n't really a bankruptcy in the sense that the company was closed down and assets sold off at auction .
the company continued production so from the industry point of view nothing changed . so it was only the investors who found themselves burnt by this scandal ? yes , and the creditors and the banks , which lost a big slice of their money . is the parmalat scandal the worst thing that has happened to italian investors ? the collapse of parmalat was used by the banks to convince individuals not to not buy shares or bonds but put their money into managed investment funds .
it 's true that investors lost a lot of money with parmalat , but if we look at managed investment funds then we discover that the loss to investors is around 20 billion euros .
now , the loss in italy from the parmalat scandal is around 3 billion euros .
unfortunately , the worst things that happen to italian investors are not these company collapses , but rather the mismanagement of managed investment funds . how new is the new parmalat - has anything changed ? the company has maintained the name and the production facilities , but for an investor the past story of parmalat has nothing to do with buying the stock today since all of the company 's debts were wiped out before its re-listing . interview : stephanie raison send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

in the meantime , multiple legal skirmishes have been played out in courtrooms in parma and milan . on tuesday , jan .
22 , proceedings began in milan against four large international banks - citigroup , deutsche bank , morgan stanley and ubs - charged with stock manipulation of parmalat bonds sold in 2003 . if the banks are found guilty the banks could face fines of up to 5 million euros and have their profits seized .
a guilty ruling could also open the door to civil proceedings by investors . dw-world.de talked to beppe scienza , a lecturer in financial mathematics at the university of turin and author of the books " the cheated investors " and " stocks , policies and parmalat - what 's the worst ? "
he has been following the financial market for over 30 years . dw-world.de : parmalat was not a small or weak company - it was the eighth largest company in italy and a global brand .
how is it that the so-called coca cola of milk production began to go sour ? beppe scienza : the interesting thing about parmalat is that at the industrial level nothing changed .
the company continued to produce and so the industrial aspect remained untouched .
as for exactly how this happened , no one knows and no one has studied all the factors that led to the collapse .
however , these things often begin because someone is trying to cover up some kind of mistake or some kind of loss .
perhaps they invent an excuse to cover up an imbalance .
no one knows why this was done or where the money has ended up . it 's interesting to note that the parmalat dividends were n't very high and this , among other things , gave faith to investors .
when a dividend is very high there is usually a high risk , but when the dividend is , as in the case of parmalat , only a little high then it gives the idea that the company could be in difficulty , but it does n't indicate that it 's going to collapse . what could have been the role played by international banks , like deutsche bank , in the parmalat scandal ? i do n't think it was really that much different from the role of the italian banks .
they helped to sell shares .
some employee of the bank was probably corrupt , but the banks themselves must have known something .
like the italian banks , they were creditors so they had to replace the money . how important is what happens in the courtroom in milan over the next few months ? in order to write an honest history of what happened with parmalat , it is important because we might be able to understand the dynamics of what caused this to happen .
for the bond holders it could be important if there is a guilty verdict , because then it opens the door for civil cases to obtain compensation . will investors ever recover everything that they lost ? on a large scale : no .
a majority of investors wo n't recover what they lost .
in these cases where there 's a collapse and the money disappears , it 's better not to have the illusion that you will recover everything . what impact has the parmalat scandal had on the food industry in europe ? i think that it has little impact on the food industry .
it was n't really a bankruptcy in the sense that the company was closed down and assets sold off at auction .
the company continued production so from the industry point of view nothing changed . so it was only the investors who found themselves burnt by this scandal ? yes , and the creditors and the banks , which lost a big slice of their money . is the parmalat scandal the worst thing that has happened to italian investors ? the collapse of parmalat was used by the banks to convince individuals not to not buy shares or bonds but put their money into managed investment funds .
it 's true that investors lost a lot of money with parmalat , but if we look at managed investment funds then we discover that the loss to investors is around 20 billion euros .
now , the loss in italy from the parmalat scandal is around 3 billion euros .
unfortunately , the worst things that happen to italian investors are not these company collapses , but rather the mismanagement of managed investment funds . how new is the new parmalat - has anything changed ? the company has maintained the name and the production facilities , but for an investor the past story of parmalat has nothing to do with buying the stock today since all of the company 's debts were wiped out before its re-listing . interview : stephanie raison send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

on jan .
22 , a criminal trial began against four international banks charged with stock manipulation . parmalat was seen as a successful italian dairy company - until 2003 when it became a sensational fraud case .
behind the bright colored milk cartons - and even a soccer team - a financial black hole was growing .
as early as 1993 , parmalat officials allegedly began to cook the books .
on dec .
24 , 2003 , shareholders and bond holders did n't quite receive the christmas present they were after .
parmalat shares lost 97 percent and was de-listed from the stock exchange .
the chief executive officer and five former parmalat executives were arrested and a fraud investigation began .
in 2004 , auditors determined that parmalat had debts of around 14.3 billion euros -lrb- $ 20.9 billion -rrb- . two years after the spills were mopped up , a new parmalat emerged .
investors were n't buying into the milk or cream business , but the chance to recoup losses through a settlement with the banks and accounting firms accused of helping conceal its dire financial condition .
in the meantime , multiple legal skirmishes have been played out in courtrooms in parma and milan . on tuesday , jan .
22 , proceedings began in milan against four large international banks - citigroup , deutsche bank , morgan stanley and ubs - charged with stock manipulation of parmalat bonds sold in 2003 . if the banks are found guilty the banks could face fines of up to 5 million euros and have their profits seized .
a guilty ruling could also open the door to civil proceedings by investors . dw-world.de talked to beppe scienza , a lecturer in financial mathematics at the university of turin and author of the books " the cheated investors " and " stocks , policies and parmalat - what 's the worst ? "
he has been following the financial market for over 30 years . dw-world.de : parmalat was not a small or weak company - it was the eighth largest company in italy and a global brand .
how is it that the so-called coca cola of milk production began to go sour ? beppe scienza : the interesting thing about parmalat is that at the industrial level nothing changed .
the company continued to produce and so the industrial aspect remained untouched .
as for exactly how this happened , no one knows and no one has studied all the factors that led to the collapse .
however , these things often begin because someone is trying to cover up some kind of mistake or some kind of loss .
perhaps they invent an excuse to cover up an imbalance .
no one knows why this was done or where the money has ended up . it 's interesting to note that the parmalat dividends were n't very high and this , among other things , gave faith to investors .
when a dividend is very high there is usually a high risk , but when the dividend is , as in the case of parmalat , only a little high then it gives the idea that the company could be in difficulty , but it does n't indicate that it 's going to collapse . what could have been the role played by international banks , like deutsche bank , in the parmalat scandal ? i do n't think it was really that much different from the role of the italian banks .
they helped to sell shares .
some employee of the bank was probably corrupt , but the banks themselves must have known something .
like the italian banks , they were creditors so they had to replace the money . how important is what happens in the courtroom in milan over the next few months ? in order to write an honest history of what happened with parmalat , it is important because we might be able to understand the dynamics of what caused this to happen .
for the bond holders it could be important if there is a guilty verdict , because then it opens the door for civil cases to obtain compensation . will investors ever recover everything that they lost ? on a large scale : no .
a majority of investors wo n't recover what they lost .
in these cases where there 's a collapse and the money disappears , it 's better not to have the illusion that you will recover everything . what impact has the parmalat scandal had on the food industry in europe ? i think that it has little impact on the food industry .
it was n't really a bankruptcy in the sense that the company was closed down and assets sold off at auction .
the company continued production so from the industry point of view nothing changed . so it was only the investors who found themselves burnt by this scandal ? yes , and the creditors and the banks , which lost a big slice of their money . is the parmalat scandal the worst thing that has happened to italian investors ? the collapse of parmalat was used by the banks to convince individuals not to not buy shares or bonds but put their money into managed investment funds .
it 's true that investors lost a lot of money with parmalat , but if we look at managed investment funds then we discover that the loss to investors is around 20 billion euros .
now , the loss in italy from the parmalat scandal is around 3 billion euros .
unfortunately , the worst things that happen to italian investors are not these company collapses , but rather the mismanagement of managed investment funds . how new is the new parmalat - has anything changed ? the company has maintained the name and the production facilities , but for an investor the past story of parmalat has nothing to do with buying the stock today since all of the company 's debts were wiped out before its re-listing . interview : stephanie raison send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

" to be able to compensate for a us recession , growth in china would have to pick up even more , " said gabriele widmann , a dekabank analyst for the us market , adding that such growth would be difficult as the us is an important destination for asian goods . budgets and companies feeling the credit squeeze pessimists therefore fear that decreasing us demand for asian products could prompt a " domino effect .

the wall street journal recently summarized it as such : " we have tried tax breaks before .
they do n't work . " dekabank economist widmann is also certain : " the plan will just be a flash in the pan .
it would only relieve the situation short-term . " angela göpfert -lrb- als -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

but insiders say the affair sets a precedent in a totally different way . french president nicolas sarkozy has broken with precedent like no other occupant of the elysee palace . the son of a hungarian aristocrat and grandson of a greek-jewish doctor , he embodies the multi-ethnic diversity of france that is reflected in some of his cabinet choices .
half of all top ministerial posts are filled by women , the highest proportion ever in france .
sarkozy , whose gaullist party ump is right of center , has even poached some of the best minds from his socialist rivals , such as the unusual choice of bernard kouchner , a medical doctor , as foreign minister . in october , sarkozy became the first head of state not only to divorce , but to do so in office , which prompted the release of three best-selling books about his ex-wife , cecilia ciganer . " speedy sarko " captivates public with new love bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : sarkozy waited until after the elections to get divorced from cecilia then one saturday afternoon in mid-december he showed up in disneyland paris with his new flame , carla bruni .
since then , the public has been bombarded with images of the italian ex-supermodel turned pop singer and the details of her past relationships with rock stars , actors and france 's literati .
bruni 's uncanny physical resemblance to cecilia - both are tall , striking blue-eyed brunettes , has all of france putting the president on the psychoanalyst 's couch debating whether " speedy sarko " is now suddenly on the rebound after his ex had ceremoniously left him . in news reports , prime minister francois fillon had even complained that the president was behaving like a love-struck teenager at cabinet meetings . " he giggles , " said fillon in an interview with the widely respected french satirical newspaper le canard enchaine .
" when we talk to him , he does not always listen .
he cancels meetings , which is not like him . " on jan .
8 at a lengthy news conference , the 52-year-old president admitted to a " serious relationship " with bruni , 40 , and talked about the emotional pain of divorce .
but his refusal to confirm or deny marriage rumors has only fuelled even more press speculation about the couple 's intentions . no more taboos on discussing a president 's love life that sarkozy himself even discussed his private life at all in such a public forum however was remarkable and unprecedented in the annals of presidential history , according to french sociologists and media watchers . although the sexual peccadilloes of former presidents such as francois mitterrand , who had fathered a daughter out of wedlock , were long known to media insiders , there used to be a silent pact among journalists that the private lives of top politicians were off-limits , according to denis muzet , founder of the paris-based politics and media institute , mediascopie . " taboos have been lifted , " said muzet , who explained that once bernadette , the wife of former president jacques chirac published her popular memoirs about her husband 's infidelities , the floodgates started to open and in a sense liberated the couple from the constraints of the presidency . " the rules have been changing considerably since the death of princess diana 10 years ago , " he added .
" what i call ' peoplization of the press ' is so banal now that even the serious press jumps on the bandwagon . " sarkozy , whose political mentor was chirac , has simply gone much further than his predecessor in exposing his private life to public view . french press freer than ever to set the agenda bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the portrait of an attractive , harmonious family helps the presidential image " he wants to show that even presidents live , love and suffer like ordinary people , " said muzet , who dismissed suggestions that sarkozy is trying to divert the french from real problems their country faces from social unrest in the immigrant suburbs to rising consumer prices that have diminished purchasing power .
" he wants to show he is transparent and has nothing to hide , down to photos of him on the beach in his swimming trunks . " thierry saussez , a close personal advisor to the president who founded the corporate communications agency image et strategie europe , also emphasized that sarkozy is not trying to deflect the country 's focus from the economic slowdown by flaunting his private life as a few commentators have suggested .
the french press is now freer than ever to set the agenda , he said . " under mitterrand , journalists and others who knew about mitterrand 's illegitimate daughter were under tremendous pressure to keep his double life under wraps , " said saussez , who explained that the public has become so saturated with intimate images of their president enjoying the egyptian pyramids with bruni during the christmas holidays that it has contributed to a drop in the polls .
" and now it 's gone the other way with too much exposure of a president 's private life . " for the first time since sarkozy assumed office in may when he was riding a wave of popularity with two-thirds of the public supporting him , his approvals ratings have now dipped to below 50 percent , according to all pollsters .
but saussez was careful to point out that the bruni brouhaha is only part of the reason for the poll results . " the public needs assurances that the president is working hard and doing his job , not just having fun , " he said .
" but the french are also a very impatient people and they want the president to fix their problems right away . " are they getting married ? bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : bruni looks like a younger version of sarkozy 's ex-wife , who was also a model but did sarkozy have to make disneyland of all places , the site for his first very public outing with bruni ? " sarkozy is behaving in a way that no french president has , " said helene brunerie , a french artist living in germany .
" he 's divorced and suddenly in the arms of a top model . " on one hand i 'm glad that the press in france has the freedom to be so colorful and uninhibited , but the image of the french president that is being projected to the world is undignified , " she added , reflecting the view of many french citizens living abroad . to both sarkozy admirers and detractors , the image problem can at least be partially fixed if he tied the knot with bruni . for one it would solve sticky protocol problems when they travel abroad on official presidential visits as a couple .
on friday , the french president will be in india , where officials are beside themselves about whether to give bruni the first lady or the girlfriend treatment . saussez predicted that bruni will not go , thereby keeping the public guessing about his marital status .

" speedy sarko " captivates public with new love bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : sarkozy waited until after the elections to get divorced from cecilia then one saturday afternoon in mid-december he showed up in disneyland paris with his new flame , carla bruni .
since then , the public has been bombarded with images of the italian ex-supermodel turned pop singer and the details of her past relationships with rock stars , actors and france 's literati .
bruni 's uncanny physical resemblance to cecilia - both are tall , striking blue-eyed brunettes , has all of france putting the president on the psychoanalyst 's couch debating whether " speedy sarko " is now suddenly on the rebound after his ex had ceremoniously left him . in news reports , prime minister francois fillon had even complained that the president was behaving like a love-struck teenager at cabinet meetings . " he giggles , " said fillon in an interview with the widely respected french satirical newspaper le canard enchaine .
" when we talk to him , he does not always listen .
he cancels meetings , which is not like him . " on jan .
8 at a lengthy news conference , the 52-year-old president admitted to a " serious relationship " with bruni , 40 , and talked about the emotional pain of divorce .
but his refusal to confirm or deny marriage rumors has only fuelled even more press speculation about the couple 's intentions . no more taboos on discussing a president 's love life that sarkozy himself even discussed his private life at all in such a public forum however was remarkable and unprecedented in the annals of presidential history , according to french sociologists and media watchers . although the sexual peccadilloes of former presidents such as francois mitterrand , who had fathered a daughter out of wedlock , were long known to media insiders , there used to be a silent pact among journalists that the private lives of top politicians were off-limits , according to denis muzet , founder of the paris-based politics and media institute , mediascopie . " taboos have been lifted , " said muzet , who explained that once bernadette , the wife of former president jacques chirac published her popular memoirs about her husband 's infidelities , the floodgates started to open and in a sense liberated the couple from the constraints of the presidency . " the rules have been changing considerably since the death of princess diana 10 years ago , " he added .
" what i call ' peoplization of the press ' is so banal now that even the serious press jumps on the bandwagon . " sarkozy , whose political mentor was chirac , has simply gone much further than his predecessor in exposing his private life to public view . french press freer than ever to set the agenda bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the portrait of an attractive , harmonious family helps the presidential image " he wants to show that even presidents live , love and suffer like ordinary people , " said muzet , who dismissed suggestions that sarkozy is trying to divert the french from real problems their country faces from social unrest in the immigrant suburbs to rising consumer prices that have diminished purchasing power .
" he wants to show he is transparent and has nothing to hide , down to photos of him on the beach in his swimming trunks . " thierry saussez , a close personal advisor to the president who founded the corporate communications agency image et strategie europe , also emphasized that sarkozy is not trying to deflect the country 's focus from the economic slowdown by flaunting his private life as a few commentators have suggested .
the french press is now freer than ever to set the agenda , he said . " under mitterrand , journalists and others who knew about mitterrand 's illegitimate daughter were under tremendous pressure to keep his double life under wraps , " said saussez , who explained that the public has become so saturated with intimate images of their president enjoying the egyptian pyramids with bruni during the christmas holidays that it has contributed to a drop in the polls .
" and now it 's gone the other way with too much exposure of a president 's private life . " for the first time since sarkozy assumed office in may when he was riding a wave of popularity with two-thirds of the public supporting him , his approvals ratings have now dipped to below 50 percent , according to all pollsters .
but saussez was careful to point out that the bruni brouhaha is only part of the reason for the poll results . " the public needs assurances that the president is working hard and doing his job , not just having fun , " he said .
" but the french are also a very impatient people and they want the president to fix their problems right away . " are they getting married ? bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : bruni looks like a younger version of sarkozy 's ex-wife , who was also a model but did sarkozy have to make disneyland of all places , the site for his first very public outing with bruni ? " sarkozy is behaving in a way that no french president has , " said helene brunerie , a french artist living in germany .
" he 's divorced and suddenly in the arms of a top model . " on one hand i 'm glad that the press in france has the freedom to be so colorful and uninhibited , but the image of the french president that is being projected to the world is undignified , " she added , reflecting the view of many french citizens living abroad . to both sarkozy admirers and detractors , the image problem can at least be partially fixed if he tied the knot with bruni . for one it would solve sticky protocol problems when they travel abroad on official presidential visits as a couple .
on friday , the french president will be in india , where officials are beside themselves about whether to give bruni the first lady or the girlfriend treatment . saussez predicted that bruni will not go , thereby keeping the public guessing about his marital status .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de people -pipe- 22.01.2008 german historian compares tom cruise speech to nazi minister großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : it 's not the first time cruise has sparked controversy in germany scientology has rejected comments by a german historian comparing a speech by hollywood star tom cruise to one by a nazi minister , accusing the paper that published it of being " grossly irresponsible . " the church of scientology , of which cruise is a leading member , reacted furiously to a newspaper interview by german historian guido knopp in which he drew parallels between the hollywood star and nazi propaganda minister joseph goebbels . " bild am sonntag is grossly irresponsible for publishing horrendous and disgraceful claims about mr. cruise , " the church 's public affairs director , karin pouw said , referring to the german mass-selling tabloid which published the interview . pouw said the footage , which surfaced on the youtube web site this week , was a pirated , edited video taken from a three-hour event . " bild am sonntag has disgracefully misinterpreted mr cruise 's remarks , " pouw said .
" he was giving an acceptance speech for a humanitarian award bestowed in honor of his efforts for global literacy .
in doing so , he was urging other people to become involved in similar humanitarian activities to the betterment of all . historian says speech stirs ugly memories knopp , who works for german broadcaster zdf and heads their programs on contemporary history , said over the weekend that the mission impossible star 's speech to other scientology members , leaked on to the internet this week , was reminiscent of a 1943 speech by propaganda minister , joseph göbbels . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : knopp drew parallels between cruise 's speech and that of göbbels , right the speech that cruise made four years ago asks fellow members of the church : " should we clean this place up ? " knopp said it was sure to remind germans of göbbel 's notorious speech in berlin on feb .
18 , 1943 when he asked the audience : " do you want total war ? " " it may be the case that cruise 's delivery style is not uncommon in certain religious movements in the us , " knopp said .
" but for germans with an interest in history , that scene where he asks whether the scientologists should clean up the world and everyone shouts ' yes ' is inevitably reminiscent of göbbel 's notorious speech . " scientology deeply controversial in germany unlike the us , germany does not recognize scientology as a church and there are debates about whether to ban the organization .

" the church of scientology , of which cruise is a leading member , reacted furiously to a newspaper interview by german historian guido knopp in which he drew parallels between the hollywood star and nazi propaganda minister joseph goebbels . " bild am sonntag is grossly irresponsible for publishing horrendous and disgraceful claims about mr. cruise , " the church 's public affairs director , karin pouw said , referring to the german mass-selling tabloid which published the interview . pouw said the footage , which surfaced on the youtube web site this week , was a pirated , edited video taken from a three-hour event . " bild am sonntag has disgracefully misinterpreted mr cruise 's remarks , " pouw said .
" he was giving an acceptance speech for a humanitarian award bestowed in honor of his efforts for global literacy .
in doing so , he was urging other people to become involved in similar humanitarian activities to the betterment of all . historian says speech stirs ugly memories knopp , who works for german broadcaster zdf and heads their programs on contemporary history , said over the weekend that the mission impossible star 's speech to other scientology members , leaked on to the internet this week , was reminiscent of a 1943 speech by propaganda minister , joseph göbbels . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : knopp drew parallels between cruise 's speech and that of göbbels , right the speech that cruise made four years ago asks fellow members of the church : " should we clean this place up ?

18 , 1943 when he asked the audience : " do you want total war ? " " it may be the case that cruise 's delivery style is not uncommon in certain religious movements in the us , " knopp said .
" but for germans with an interest in history , that scene where he asks whether the scientologists should clean up the world and everyone shouts ' yes ' is inevitably reminiscent of göbbel 's notorious speech .

22 , that its talks with finnish cell-phone maker nokia had been unsuccessful , but vowed to continue the fight to keep a german factory open . plant workers and german labor groups have been furious about mobile-phone manufacturer nokia 's decision to shut down the plant in the western german city of bochum and move most of the operation to romania , where labor costs are significantly lower . on monday , nokia 's chief executive olli-pekka kallasvuo , representatives of the bochum plant and the ig metall trade union met in helsinki for what was called a " preliminary contact " by company spokeswoman arja suominen . " it was an unofficial meeting and we shall now start official talks , " suominen told ap news agency , but gave no details . a spokesman for ig metall in düsseldorf told dpa news service of the meeting : " the management presented the closure plans again and repeated their inadequate and already known explanation of why . " chancellor spoke with nokia chief bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the closure would mean the loss of 2,300 jobs berthold huber , ig metall chief , told bavarian public television : " this will be a fierce conflict if there is no other way and the management does not change its mind . " ulrike kleinebrahm , the ig metall organizer in bochum , said labor groups were creating their own plan to keep the factory running .
she also called on german political leaders to keep up their pressure on nokia , a cue which chancellor angela merkel has taken . on tuesday , jan .
22 , merkel revealed that she had personally phoned nokia chief executive kallasvuo , to reproach him for plans to close germany 's last factory making nokia mobile phones . " i made clear to him that i had no sympathy for the entire communication and everything connected to it , " merkel told ndr public radio in an interview . she stressed that the federal economics ministry was still in talks with nokia - the world 's largest cell-phone manufacturer - about the closure , but said that both had agreed to keep the discussions confidential . however , merkel said she was skeptical that nokia would alter its decision . " if the decision is not altered , and it would seem to be that way , then everything possible must be done to ensure the people affected have a future , " she said . the chancellor said that she had also spoken with ig metall 's huber , the head of the union representing most nokia staff in bochum . she said the decision to close the plant demonstrated that government subsidies to businesses were " not a perpetual guarantee " that a factory would stay open .
however , she said subsidies were needed " in exceptional cases . " nokia has received over 80 million euros -lrb- $ 120 million -rrb- in state and federal subsidies during the 20 years of the plant 's existence in bochum . calls for nokia boycott bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : some say boycotting nokia would show need for social responsibility german news media have been reporting that the growing calls for a boycott of nokia products could force the company to offer the 2,300 staff the most expensive compensation plan in german corporate history . the chairman of the finnish branch of the activist network attac , mikko sauli , told dpa that the boycott was to protest nokia 's decision to close the plant , adding that the group was not suggesting that people should throw away " a perfectly functioning cell phone " because that would not be " ecologically sustainable . " sauli said attac finland was distributing the petition to other sister organizations , wanting to stress the need for an international " framework " guaranteeing " social responsibility . " attac , which stands for the " association for the taxation of financial transactions to aid citizens , " was founded in france in 1998 and has since expanded internationally , with branches in dozens of countries . dw staff -lrb- als -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de food and drink -pipe- 22.01.2008 parmalat trial could open door for civil proceedings großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the shares might have crashed but the company kept on milking when things began to go sour at italian dairy company parmalat the company sued 45 italian and international banks .
on jan .
22 , a criminal trial began against four international banks charged with stock manipulation . parmalat was seen as a successful italian dairy company - until 2003 when it became a sensational fraud case .
behind the bright colored milk cartons - and even a soccer team - a financial black hole was growing .
as early as 1993 , parmalat officials allegedly began to cook the books .
on dec .
24 , 2003 , shareholders and bond holders did n't quite receive the christmas present they were after .
parmalat shares lost 97 percent and was de-listed from the stock exchange .
the chief executive officer and five former parmalat executives were arrested and a fraud investigation began .
in 2004 , auditors determined that parmalat had debts of around 14.3 billion euros -lrb- $ 20.9 billion -rrb- . two years after the spills were mopped up , a new parmalat emerged .
investors were n't buying into the milk or cream business , but the chance to recoup losses through a settlement with the banks and accounting firms accused of helping conceal its dire financial condition .
in the meantime , multiple legal skirmishes have been played out in courtrooms in parma and milan . on tuesday , jan .
22 , proceedings began in milan against four large international banks - citigroup , deutsche bank , morgan stanley and ubs - charged with stock manipulation of parmalat bonds sold in 2003 . if the banks are found guilty the banks could face fines of up to 5 million euros and have their profits seized .
a guilty ruling could also open the door to civil proceedings by investors . dw-world.de talked to beppe scienza , a lecturer in financial mathematics at the university of turin and author of the books " the cheated investors " and " stocks , policies and parmalat - what 's the worst ? "
he has been following the financial market for over 30 years . dw-world.de : parmalat was not a small or weak company - it was the eighth largest company in italy and a global brand .
how is it that the so-called coca cola of milk production began to go sour ? beppe scienza : the interesting thing about parmalat is that at the industrial level nothing changed .
the company continued to produce and so the industrial aspect remained untouched .
as for exactly how this happened , no one knows and no one has studied all the factors that led to the collapse .
however , these things often begin because someone is trying to cover up some kind of mistake or some kind of loss .
perhaps they invent an excuse to cover up an imbalance .
no one knows why this was done or where the money has ended up . it 's interesting to note that the parmalat dividends were n't very high and this , among other things , gave faith to investors .
when a dividend is very high there is usually a high risk , but when the dividend is , as in the case of parmalat , only a little high then it gives the idea that the company could be in difficulty , but it does n't indicate that it 's going to collapse . what could have been the role played by international banks , like deutsche bank , in the parmalat scandal ? i do n't think it was really that much different from the role of the italian banks .
they helped to sell shares .
some employee of the bank was probably corrupt , but the banks themselves must have known something .
like the italian banks , they were creditors so they had to replace the money . how important is what happens in the courtroom in milan over the next few months ? in order to write an honest history of what happened with parmalat , it is important because we might be able to understand the dynamics of what caused this to happen .
for the bond holders it could be important if there is a guilty verdict , because then it opens the door for civil cases to obtain compensation . will investors ever recover everything that they lost ? on a large scale : no .
a majority of investors wo n't recover what they lost .
in these cases where there 's a collapse and the money disappears , it 's better not to have the illusion that you will recover everything . what impact has the parmalat scandal had on the food industry in europe ? i think that it has little impact on the food industry .
it was n't really a bankruptcy in the sense that the company was closed down and assets sold off at auction .
the company continued production so from the industry point of view nothing changed . so it was only the investors who found themselves burnt by this scandal ? yes , and the creditors and the banks , which lost a big slice of their money . is the parmalat scandal the worst thing that has happened to italian investors ? the collapse of parmalat was used by the banks to convince individuals not to not buy shares or bonds but put their money into managed investment funds .
it 's true that investors lost a lot of money with parmalat , but if we look at managed investment funds then we discover that the loss to investors is around 20 billion euros .
now , the loss in italy from the parmalat scandal is around 3 billion euros .
unfortunately , the worst things that happen to italian investors are not these company collapses , but rather the mismanagement of managed investment funds . how new is the new parmalat - has anything changed ? the company has maintained the name and the production facilities , but for an investor the past story of parmalat has nothing to do with buying the stock today since all of the company 's debts were wiped out before its re-listing . interview : stephanie raison send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de media -pipe- 22.01.2008 experts : no ulterior motives behind french sarkozy-bruni affair großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : sarkozy 's refusal to confirm marriage rumors fuels even more press speculation nicolas sarkozy 's relationship with carla bruni has led to speculation that the french president is trying to cover up political problems .
but insiders say the affair sets a precedent in a totally different way . french president nicolas sarkozy has broken with precedent like no other occupant of the elysee palace . the son of a hungarian aristocrat and grandson of a greek-jewish doctor , he embodies the multi-ethnic diversity of france that is reflected in some of his cabinet choices .
half of all top ministerial posts are filled by women , the highest proportion ever in france .
sarkozy , whose gaullist party ump is right of center , has even poached some of the best minds from his socialist rivals , such as the unusual choice of bernard kouchner , a medical doctor , as foreign minister . in october , sarkozy became the first head of state not only to divorce , but to do so in office , which prompted the release of three best-selling books about his ex-wife , cecilia ciganer . " speedy sarko " captivates public with new love bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : sarkozy waited until after the elections to get divorced from cecilia then one saturday afternoon in mid-december he showed up in disneyland paris with his new flame , carla bruni .
since then , the public has been bombarded with images of the italian ex-supermodel turned pop singer and the details of her past relationships with rock stars , actors and france 's literati .
bruni 's uncanny physical resemblance to cecilia - both are tall , striking blue-eyed brunettes , has all of france putting the president on the psychoanalyst 's couch debating whether " speedy sarko " is now suddenly on the rebound after his ex had ceremoniously left him . in news reports , prime minister francois fillon had even complained that the president was behaving like a love-struck teenager at cabinet meetings . " he giggles , " said fillon in an interview with the widely respected french satirical newspaper le canard enchaine .
" when we talk to him , he does not always listen .
he cancels meetings , which is not like him . " on jan .
8 at a lengthy news conference , the 52-year-old president admitted to a " serious relationship " with bruni , 40 , and talked about the emotional pain of divorce .
but his refusal to confirm or deny marriage rumors has only fuelled even more press speculation about the couple 's intentions . no more taboos on discussing a president 's love life that sarkozy himself even discussed his private life at all in such a public forum however was remarkable and unprecedented in the annals of presidential history , according to french sociologists and media watchers . although the sexual peccadilloes of former presidents such as francois mitterrand , who had fathered a daughter out of wedlock , were long known to media insiders , there used to be a silent pact among journalists that the private lives of top politicians were off-limits , according to denis muzet , founder of the paris-based politics and media institute , mediascopie . " taboos have been lifted , " said muzet , who explained that once bernadette , the wife of former president jacques chirac published her popular memoirs about her husband 's infidelities , the floodgates started to open and in a sense liberated the couple from the constraints of the presidency . " the rules have been changing considerably since the death of princess diana 10 years ago , " he added .
" what i call ' peoplization of the press ' is so banal now that even the serious press jumps on the bandwagon . " sarkozy , whose political mentor was chirac , has simply gone much further than his predecessor in exposing his private life to public view . french press freer than ever to set the agenda bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the portrait of an attractive , harmonious family helps the presidential image " he wants to show that even presidents live , love and suffer like ordinary people , " said muzet , who dismissed suggestions that sarkozy is trying to divert the french from real problems their country faces from social unrest in the immigrant suburbs to rising consumer prices that have diminished purchasing power .
" he wants to show he is transparent and has nothing to hide , down to photos of him on the beach in his swimming trunks . " thierry saussez , a close personal advisor to the president who founded the corporate communications agency image et strategie europe , also emphasized that sarkozy is not trying to deflect the country 's focus from the economic slowdown by flaunting his private life as a few commentators have suggested .
the french press is now freer than ever to set the agenda , he said . " under mitterrand , journalists and others who knew about mitterrand 's illegitimate daughter were under tremendous pressure to keep his double life under wraps , " said saussez , who explained that the public has become so saturated with intimate images of their president enjoying the egyptian pyramids with bruni during the christmas holidays that it has contributed to a drop in the polls .
" and now it 's gone the other way with too much exposure of a president 's private life . " for the first time since sarkozy assumed office in may when he was riding a wave of popularity with two-thirds of the public supporting him , his approvals ratings have now dipped to below 50 percent , according to all pollsters .
but saussez was careful to point out that the bruni brouhaha is only part of the reason for the poll results . " the public needs assurances that the president is working hard and doing his job , not just having fun , " he said .
" but the french are also a very impatient people and they want the president to fix their problems right away . " are they getting married ? bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : bruni looks like a younger version of sarkozy 's ex-wife , who was also a model but did sarkozy have to make disneyland of all places , the site for his first very public outing with bruni ? " sarkozy is behaving in a way that no french president has , " said helene brunerie , a french artist living in germany .
" he 's divorced and suddenly in the arms of a top model . " on one hand i 'm glad that the press in france has the freedom to be so colorful and uninhibited , but the image of the french president that is being projected to the world is undignified , " she added , reflecting the view of many french citizens living abroad . to both sarkozy admirers and detractors , the image problem can at least be partially fixed if he tied the knot with bruni . for one it would solve sticky protocol problems when they travel abroad on official presidential visits as a couple .
on friday , the french president will be in india , where officials are beside themselves about whether to give bruni the first lady or the girlfriend treatment . saussez predicted that bruni will not go , thereby keeping the public guessing about his marital status . " the president needs to get married , " he said . diana fong send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

" what i call ' peoplization of the press ' is so banal now that even the serious press jumps on the bandwagon . " sarkozy , whose political mentor was chirac , has simply gone much further than his predecessor in exposing his private life to public view . french press freer than ever to set the agenda bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the portrait of an attractive , harmonious family helps the presidential image " he wants to show that even presidents live , love and suffer like ordinary people , " said muzet , who dismissed suggestions that sarkozy is trying to divert the french from real problems their country faces from social unrest in the immigrant suburbs to rising consumer prices that have diminished purchasing power .
" he wants to show he is transparent and has nothing to hide , down to photos of him on the beach in his swimming trunks . " thierry saussez , a close personal advisor to the president who founded the corporate communications agency image et strategie europe , also emphasized that sarkozy is not trying to deflect the country 's focus from the economic slowdown by flaunting his private life as a few commentators have suggested .
the french press is now freer than ever to set the agenda , he said . " under mitterrand , journalists and others who knew about mitterrand 's illegitimate daughter were under tremendous pressure to keep his double life under wraps , " said saussez , who explained that the public has become so saturated with intimate images of their president enjoying the egyptian pyramids with bruni during the christmas holidays that it has contributed to a drop in the polls .

" for the first time since sarkozy assumed office in may when he was riding a wave of popularity with two-thirds of the public supporting him , his approvals ratings have now dipped to below 50 percent , according to all pollsters .
but saussez was careful to point out that the bruni brouhaha is only part of the reason for the poll results . " the public needs assurances that the president is working hard and doing his job , not just having fun , " he said .

" on one hand i 'm glad that the press in france has the freedom to be so colorful and uninhibited , but the image of the french president that is being projected to the world is undignified , " she added , reflecting the view of many french citizens living abroad . to both sarkozy admirers and detractors , the image problem can at least be partially fixed if he tied the knot with bruni . for one it would solve sticky protocol problems when they travel abroad on official presidential visits as a couple .
on friday , the french president will be in india , where officials are beside themselves about whether to give bruni the first lady or the girlfriend treatment . saussez predicted that bruni will not go , thereby keeping the public guessing about his marital status .

but insiders say the affair sets a precedent in a totally different way . french president nicolas sarkozy has broken with precedent like no other occupant of the elysee palace . the son of a hungarian aristocrat and grandson of a greek-jewish doctor , he embodies the multi-ethnic diversity of france that is reflected in some of his cabinet choices .
half of all top ministerial posts are filled by women , the highest proportion ever in france .
sarkozy , whose gaullist party ump is right of center , has even poached some of the best minds from his socialist rivals , such as the unusual choice of bernard kouchner , a medical doctor , as foreign minister . in october , sarkozy became the first head of state not only to divorce , but to do so in office , which prompted the release of three best-selling books about his ex-wife , cecilia ciganer . " speedy sarko " captivates public with new love bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : sarkozy waited until after the elections to get divorced from cecilia then one saturday afternoon in mid-december he showed up in disneyland paris with his new flame , carla bruni .
since then , the public has been bombarded with images of the italian ex-supermodel turned pop singer and the details of her past relationships with rock stars , actors and france 's literati .
bruni 's uncanny physical resemblance to cecilia - both are tall , striking blue-eyed brunettes , has all of france putting the president on the psychoanalyst 's couch debating whether " speedy sarko " is now suddenly on the rebound after his ex had ceremoniously left him . in news reports , prime minister francois fillon had even complained that the president was behaving like a love-struck teenager at cabinet meetings . " he giggles , " said fillon in an interview with the widely respected french satirical newspaper le canard enchaine .
" when we talk to him , he does not always listen .
he cancels meetings , which is not like him . " on jan .
8 at a lengthy news conference , the 52-year-old president admitted to a " serious relationship " with bruni , 40 , and talked about the emotional pain of divorce .
but his refusal to confirm or deny marriage rumors has only fuelled even more press speculation about the couple 's intentions . no more taboos on discussing a president 's love life that sarkozy himself even discussed his private life at all in such a public forum however was remarkable and unprecedented in the annals of presidential history , according to french sociologists and media watchers . although the sexual peccadilloes of former presidents such as francois mitterrand , who had fathered a daughter out of wedlock , were long known to media insiders , there used to be a silent pact among journalists that the private lives of top politicians were off-limits , according to denis muzet , founder of the paris-based politics and media institute , mediascopie .

" he 's divorced and suddenly in the arms of a top model . " on one hand i 'm glad that the press in france has the freedom to be so colorful and uninhibited , but the image of the french president that is being projected to the world is undignified , " she added , reflecting the view of many french citizens living abroad . to both sarkozy admirers and detractors , the image problem can at least be partially fixed if he tied the knot with bruni . for one it would solve sticky protocol problems when they travel abroad on official presidential visits as a couple .
on friday , the french president will be in india , where officials are beside themselves about whether to give bruni the first lady or the girlfriend treatment . saussez predicted that bruni will not go , thereby keeping the public guessing about his marital status .

he said the situation in the serbian province remains calm but not stable . brig. gen. robert bund commands the 2,200 soldiers that make up the german contingent in the nato-led kosovo protection force -lrb- kfor -rrb- . dw-world.de : how did you prepare yourself personally for your role as leader of the german contingent in kosovo ? robert bund : i consider myself generally well prepared , especially in the area of leadership , as a result of my previous career assignments during my 40 years of service with the bundeswehr .
moving through the various ranks from company commander -lsb- who is in charge of up to 200 servicemen and women -rsb- all the way up to brigade commander -lsb- who is responsible for some 5,000 soldiers -rsb- , you gain so much experience that you should be ready to successfully confront all the challenges of a foreign operation . like any other soldier , i went through the whole range of preparatory training for this mission .
one hostage exercise we did left an impression .
role-players had to act as realistically as possible and were constantly monitored by psychologists . to round off my technical preparation , i studied the history and the political and social conditions in kosovo intensively .
and , of course , there were intensive talks with my wife and our children as well as with the members of my home church , the free protestant church , to emotionally prepare me for my long tour .
support from family and community makes it easier to take on the burdens of an operation abroad and the separation from home and it can be transformed into something positive . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : better living conditions will keep youth from joining radical groups , said bund how do you motivate your troops ? the leadership principle that i try to put into practice is based on two pillars .
the first pillar is trust . i treat all servicemen and women with unrestricted trust .
this means that i take each one seriously as an individual - with their questions , problems and specialized knowledge .
every single soldier is a specialist in his or her field , and i put my trust in their skills , even in our daily contact with each other .
but this trust also means that each person must be aware of their responsibility , too , and has to act accordingly - that is , responsibly .
i firmly demand this of everyone . the second pillar is comradeship .
back in germany , comradeship is a basic principle , but it plays a much more important role in a foreign operation .
i see comradeship as independent of rank or chain of command .
a particularly important point for me in this respect is looking after each other , taking notice of and dealing with one another in a positive manner and being aware of when others need help . in addition , i continually try to get a feel for the general mood , take notice of problems and explain my position on a whole range of different issues during our meetings .
in other words , i try to stay in touch with my soldiers . i also make use of the camp 's radio station , where all soldiers have the opportunity to ask questions on the air or in writing .
i respond to them during a question-and-answer broadcast called " commander on air . " what have you learned about the culture in kosovo ?
which aspects interest you the most ? i am most interested in the evolution of the political process .
europe and the us have clearly expressed their positions on the matter and the people in kosovo put all their trust in the support from these countries - and their expectations are high . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the people of kosovo want to decide on their future for themselves , said bund i have learned that these people are highly aware of their situation .
they know that never before in their history have they been so close to a potentially historic decision and that anything that deviates from normalcy would jeopardize the current decision process , possibly setting it back for years .
however , they 're not going to wait forever .
that is why we assess the situation as calm but not stable . i have also learned that the people in kosovo are among the youngest in europe .
the average age of the kosovo albanians is about 27 years .
this means that economic development over the next few years is extremely important .
only a significant improvement of the living conditions can prevent the young people from joining more radical movements .
improvement means secure electrical power supply 24 hours a day and modern roads and railway connections to the outside world . what surprised me is the way islam is practiced here .
here in kosovo i was able to gain insight into islamic practices through my many meetings with religious leaders .
i was very impressed that , when the catholic bishop consecrated a new altar , members off different faiths attended the mass and ate together afterwards . on the whole , the people in kosovo want to finally decide for themselves about their future after their long and , at times , tragic history . what is the everyday routine like for you and your soldiers ? the daily routine of my soldiers varies greatly , depending on their respective tasks .
but the overall conditions are the same for all of them .
every soldier without shift duty , night-time operations or other duties works monday through friday from 7:30 a.m. to 7:30 p.m. , but there are many who work beyond that .
on saturday , we start an hour later and on sunday duty is from 1:30 p.m. to 6:30 p.m. another special thing on sunday is that , at 11:00 , we hold our religious service in our small church , which was built by our soldiers a few years ago .
we are always accompanied by our church choir , which i sing in myself . my own daily routine depends on whether talks with politicians or other people are on my schedule .
the morning hours are especially important to me because i can prepare myself for the tasks ahead .
a half hour of bible study helps me get into the mood to go to work . after that , i have various appointments that are coordinated by my military assistant and aide de camp .
there are negotiations with civic representatives , briefings with my advisors and commanders and , of course , visits with the troops at the different field camps in and around prizren . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : kosovo 's political leaders , fatmir sejdiu , left , and hashim thaci , expect much of the eu normally , i am busy every day from about 7:00 a.m. to 9:00 p.m.
but , of course , i am available for all members of the german contingent outside those hours , too . what is your personal goal in kosovo ?
what do you want to leave behind ? the most important goal is get all servicemen and women home again safely . apart from that , i want to contribute to seeing our mission accomplished as well as possible .
to ensure a safe and secure environment and freedom of movement for all ethnic groups .
that the people of kosovo have a positive perspective on their future , and that our servicemen and women are recognized for continuing the tradition of their predecessor under the motto " helping others help themselves . " i want to ensure that , within the framework of our civil-military cooperation , we continue to contribute to the building of a kosovar society and , above all , give the children a better future by building schools and helping them with job qualifications . apart from our military mission we have been able to directly help people living below the poverty threshold with a variety of initiatives supported by donations from germany .
in addition , we 've been able to provide school materials to students . if this has succeeded in assuring the survival of at least a few people or facilitated learning , it is a big enough legacy . interview : kate bowen send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

and , of course , there were intensive talks with my wife and our children as well as with the members of my home church , the free protestant church , to emotionally prepare me for my long tour .
support from family and community makes it easier to take on the burdens of an operation abroad and the separation from home and it can be transformed into something positive . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : better living conditions will keep youth from joining radical groups , said bund how do you motivate your troops ? the leadership principle that i try to put into practice is based on two pillars .
the first pillar is trust . i treat all servicemen and women with unrestricted trust .
this means that i take each one seriously as an individual - with their questions , problems and specialized knowledge .
every single soldier is a specialist in his or her field , and i put my trust in their skills , even in our daily contact with each other .
but this trust also means that each person must be aware of their responsibility , too , and has to act accordingly - that is , responsibly .
i firmly demand this of everyone . the second pillar is comradeship .
back in germany , comradeship is a basic principle , but it plays a much more important role in a foreign operation .
i see comradeship as independent of rank or chain of command .
a particularly important point for me in this respect is looking after each other , taking notice of and dealing with one another in a positive manner and being aware of when others need help . in addition , i continually try to get a feel for the general mood , take notice of problems and explain my position on a whole range of different issues during our meetings .
in other words , i try to stay in touch with my soldiers . i also make use of the camp 's radio station , where all soldiers have the opportunity to ask questions on the air or in writing .
i respond to them during a question-and-answer broadcast called " commander on air . " what have you learned about the culture in kosovo ?
which aspects interest you the most ? i am most interested in the evolution of the political process .
europe and the us have clearly expressed their positions on the matter and the people in kosovo put all their trust in the support from these countries - and their expectations are high . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the people of kosovo want to decide on their future for themselves , said bund i have learned that these people are highly aware of their situation .
they know that never before in their history have they been so close to a potentially historic decision and that anything that deviates from normalcy would jeopardize the current decision process , possibly setting it back for years .
however , they 're not going to wait forever .
that is why we assess the situation as calm but not stable . i have also learned that the people in kosovo are among the youngest in europe .
the average age of the kosovo albanians is about 27 years .
this means that economic development over the next few years is extremely important .
only a significant improvement of the living conditions can prevent the young people from joining more radical movements .
improvement means secure electrical power supply 24 hours a day and modern roads and railway connections to the outside world . what surprised me is the way islam is practiced here .
here in kosovo i was able to gain insight into islamic practices through my many meetings with religious leaders .
i was very impressed that , when the catholic bishop consecrated a new altar , members off different faiths attended the mass and ate together afterwards . on the whole , the people in kosovo want to finally decide for themselves about their future after their long and , at times , tragic history . what is the everyday routine like for you and your soldiers ? the daily routine of my soldiers varies greatly , depending on their respective tasks .
but the overall conditions are the same for all of them .
every soldier without shift duty , night-time operations or other duties works monday through friday from 7:30 a.m. to 7:30 p.m. , but there are many who work beyond that .
on saturday , we start an hour later and on sunday duty is from 1:30 p.m. to 6:30 p.m. another special thing on sunday is that , at 11:00 , we hold our religious service in our small church , which was built by our soldiers a few years ago .
we are always accompanied by our church choir , which i sing in myself . my own daily routine depends on whether talks with politicians or other people are on my schedule .
the morning hours are especially important to me because i can prepare myself for the tasks ahead .
a half hour of bible study helps me get into the mood to go to work . after that , i have various appointments that are coordinated by my military assistant and aide de camp .
there are negotiations with civic representatives , briefings with my advisors and commanders and , of course , visits with the troops at the different field camps in and around prizren . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : kosovo 's political leaders , fatmir sejdiu , left , and hashim thaci , expect much of the eu normally , i am busy every day from about 7:00 a.m. to 9:00 p.m.
but , of course , i am available for all members of the german contingent outside those hours , too . what is your personal goal in kosovo ?
what do you want to leave behind ? the most important goal is get all servicemen and women home again safely . apart from that , i want to contribute to seeing our mission accomplished as well as possible .
to ensure a safe and secure environment and freedom of movement for all ethnic groups .
that the people of kosovo have a positive perspective on their future , and that our servicemen and women are recognized for continuing the tradition of their predecessor under the motto " helping others help themselves . " i want to ensure that , within the framework of our civil-military cooperation , we continue to contribute to the building of a kosovar society and , above all , give the children a better future by building schools and helping them with job qualifications . apart from our military mission we have been able to directly help people living below the poverty threshold with a variety of initiatives supported by donations from germany .
in addition , we 've been able to provide school materials to students . if this has succeeded in assuring the survival of at least a few people or facilitated learning , it is a big enough legacy . interview : kate bowen send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

according to diplomats , the us wants new sanctions against state-run iranian banks as well as firms that support tehran 's nuclear weapons program . the us administration 's own intelligence on iran has made it difficult to convince russia and china that tehran deserves new sanctions . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the west fears iran is trying to make a bomb a national intelligence estimate released in early december reported that iran abandoned its nuclear weapons program in 2003 , a conclusion that undermined us president george w. bush 's warnings about the iran threat . the us this week played down expectations of a breakthrough at the berlin summit . " we do n't yet have agreement on the elements or language of a -lrb- united nations -rrb- resolution , " state department spokesman sean mccormack said on friday , jan .
18 . " but we 're pushing forward on it and we 're optimistic that we will eventually be able to get a resolution .
we would have wished that we had had one by now but that is multilateral diplomacy . " steinmeier said the nie report contained both positive and negative news .
in addition to showing that iran had ended its enrichment program , the report also concluded that the country had been working on a weapons program . " the question remains : how far along were the iranians ? "
steinmeier said .
" for that we need the iaea in vienna . " as host of the meeting , steinmeier is to meet separately with us secretary of state condoleeza rice and his chinese counterpart , yang jiechi . iran says berlin meet useless iran , the world 's fourth-largest oil exporter , insists its uranium enrichment is aimed at generating electricity so that it can export more oil and gas . iran 's foreign ministry spokesman , mohammad-ali hosseini , on monday predicted that the berlin meeting would come to nothing . the view was echoed by another senior iranian official , ali aghamohammadi , a representative of supreme leader ayatollah ali khamenei on a powerful arbitration body . in an interview with reuters , aghamohammadi said the berlin meeting would not help defuse iran 's nuclear row with the west if the six powers continue to push for a new sanctions resolution on iran . " if they can find a way to turn the page , then things should be fine , " he said .
" if they want to continue their trend to push for another resolution , even a very weak one , i do n't think it can solve anything . " dw staff -lrb- sp -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de economy -pipe- 22.01.2008 effects of us recession could be held at bay , experts say großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : some experts said the us has become less important for the global economy global markets have plunged , partly due to fear of a recession in the united states , the world 's biggest economy .
but european experts say dynamic developing countries like china could offset us troubles . looking at the way the markets have plummeted , it appears an old adage rings true : " when the us sneezes , the rest of the world gets a cold . " panic spread across the frankfurt trading floor on monday , jan .
21 , when the country 's dax index experienced its biggest plunge since the sept .
11 , 2001 terrorist attacks in the united states . fears of a us recession , partly sparked by the recent credit crisis , and the possibility that it could lead to an international economic crisis also sent other european and asian into nose dives . over-sensitivity of markets ? bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : traders at the stock exchange in frankfurt tried to fend off panic yet , despite the panic , a majority of finance experts estimate the likelihood of a us recession at only 40 percent .
economists at german banks including dekabank and westlb assess the situation even more modestly , believing that a recession risk stands at only 25 percent . some analysts also point to a university of michigan consumer confidence reading for january , which last week stood at 80.5 percent , up from 75.5 percent in december .
this has led some to believe that consumer sentiment - which helps to drive markets - is up despite fears of a recession . but jörg krämer , chief economist at commerzbank , stressed the complexity of the situation . " we expect the us economy to stagnate in the first half of 2008 , which will feel like a recession , " he said . huge growth on chinese and indian markets bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : china could help balance out other markets other economic analysts have said that even if the us economy were to shrink , the rapidly expanding markets of developing countries in asia could offset a recession in the us , or at least minimize its effects .
after all , consumer growth rates in hong kong , china , thailand , malaysia and india tally up to 15 percent of the global economy . " the us economy is no longer as important for the world economic situation as it used to be , " said dutch world bank economist hans timmer . but krämer - and others - remains skeptical . " to be able to compensate for a us recession , growth in china would have to pick up even more , " said gabriele widmann , a dekabank analyst for the us market , adding that such growth would be difficult as the us is an important destination for asian goods . budgets and companies feeling the credit squeeze pessimists therefore fear that decreasing us demand for asian products could prompt a " domino effect . "
should american consumers lose their desire to buy , the dominos in the markets so dependent on exports to the us could start to tumble . " if growth of the us economy slows by one percent , business activity in germany likewise slows by a half percent , " krämer said . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : japanese and other asian stocks also plunged on monday furthermore , american financial market policies do not necessarily instill hope . us federal reserve bank chairman ben bernanke may have repeatedly lowered the prime interest rate since the mortgage crisis in the us erupted last year , but the lowered interest rates do not have the desired effect where they are most needed .
interest rates on the corporate bond and consumer credit markets have remained the same or have even risen . also , a multi-billion-dollar proposal by us president george w. bush last week to temporarily cut taxes and implement other measures to fend off a possible recession has failed to calm the financial mood . us business activity , after all , has often proven to be resistant to politics .

moving through the various ranks from company commander -lsb- who is in charge of up to 200 servicemen and women -rsb- all the way up to brigade commander -lsb- who is responsible for some 5,000 soldiers -rsb- , you gain so much experience that you should be ready to successfully confront all the challenges of a foreign operation . like any other soldier , i went through the whole range of preparatory training for this mission .
one hostage exercise we did left an impression .
role-players had to act as realistically as possible and were constantly monitored by psychologists . to round off my technical preparation , i studied the history and the political and social conditions in kosovo intensively .
and , of course , there were intensive talks with my wife and our children as well as with the members of my home church , the free protestant church , to emotionally prepare me for my long tour .
support from family and community makes it easier to take on the burdens of an operation abroad and the separation from home and it can be transformed into something positive . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : better living conditions will keep youth from joining radical groups , said bund how do you motivate your troops ? the leadership principle that i try to put into practice is based on two pillars .
the first pillar is trust . i treat all servicemen and women with unrestricted trust .
this means that i take each one seriously as an individual - with their questions , problems and specialized knowledge .
every single soldier is a specialist in his or her field , and i put my trust in their skills , even in our daily contact with each other .
but this trust also means that each person must be aware of their responsibility , too , and has to act accordingly - that is , responsibly .
i firmly demand this of everyone . the second pillar is comradeship .
back in germany , comradeship is a basic principle , but it plays a much more important role in a foreign operation .
i see comradeship as independent of rank or chain of command .
a particularly important point for me in this respect is looking after each other , taking notice of and dealing with one another in a positive manner and being aware of when others need help . in addition , i continually try to get a feel for the general mood , take notice of problems and explain my position on a whole range of different issues during our meetings .
in other words , i try to stay in touch with my soldiers . i also make use of the camp 's radio station , where all soldiers have the opportunity to ask questions on the air or in writing .
i respond to them during a question-and-answer broadcast called " commander on air . " what have you learned about the culture in kosovo ?
which aspects interest you the most ? i am most interested in the evolution of the political process .
europe and the us have clearly expressed their positions on the matter and the people in kosovo put all their trust in the support from these countries - and their expectations are high . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the people of kosovo want to decide on their future for themselves , said bund i have learned that these people are highly aware of their situation .
they know that never before in their history have they been so close to a potentially historic decision and that anything that deviates from normalcy would jeopardize the current decision process , possibly setting it back for years .
however , they 're not going to wait forever .
that is why we assess the situation as calm but not stable . i have also learned that the people in kosovo are among the youngest in europe .
the average age of the kosovo albanians is about 27 years .
this means that economic development over the next few years is extremely important .
only a significant improvement of the living conditions can prevent the young people from joining more radical movements .
improvement means secure electrical power supply 24 hours a day and modern roads and railway connections to the outside world . what surprised me is the way islam is practiced here .
here in kosovo i was able to gain insight into islamic practices through my many meetings with religious leaders .
i was very impressed that , when the catholic bishop consecrated a new altar , members off different faiths attended the mass and ate together afterwards . on the whole , the people in kosovo want to finally decide for themselves about their future after their long and , at times , tragic history . what is the everyday routine like for you and your soldiers ? the daily routine of my soldiers varies greatly , depending on their respective tasks .
but the overall conditions are the same for all of them .
every soldier without shift duty , night-time operations or other duties works monday through friday from 7:30 a.m. to 7:30 p.m. , but there are many who work beyond that .
on saturday , we start an hour later and on sunday duty is from 1:30 p.m. to 6:30 p.m. another special thing on sunday is that , at 11:00 , we hold our religious service in our small church , which was built by our soldiers a few years ago .
we are always accompanied by our church choir , which i sing in myself . my own daily routine depends on whether talks with politicians or other people are on my schedule .
the morning hours are especially important to me because i can prepare myself for the tasks ahead .
a half hour of bible study helps me get into the mood to go to work . after that , i have various appointments that are coordinated by my military assistant and aide de camp .
there are negotiations with civic representatives , briefings with my advisors and commanders and , of course , visits with the troops at the different field camps in and around prizren . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : kosovo 's political leaders , fatmir sejdiu , left , and hashim thaci , expect much of the eu normally , i am busy every day from about 7:00 a.m. to 9:00 p.m.
but , of course , i am available for all members of the german contingent outside those hours , too . what is your personal goal in kosovo ?
what do you want to leave behind ? the most important goal is get all servicemen and women home again safely . apart from that , i want to contribute to seeing our mission accomplished as well as possible .
to ensure a safe and secure environment and freedom of movement for all ethnic groups .
that the people of kosovo have a positive perspective on their future , and that our servicemen and women are recognized for continuing the tradition of their predecessor under the motto " helping others help themselves . " i want to ensure that , within the framework of our civil-military cooperation , we continue to contribute to the building of a kosovar society and , above all , give the children a better future by building schools and helping them with job qualifications . apart from our military mission we have been able to directly help people living below the poverty threshold with a variety of initiatives supported by donations from germany .
in addition , we 've been able to provide school materials to students . if this has succeeded in assuring the survival of at least a few people or facilitated learning , it is a big enough legacy . interview : kate bowen send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

he said the situation in the serbian province remains calm but not stable . brig. gen. robert bund commands the 2,200 soldiers that make up the german contingent in the nato-led kosovo protection force -lrb- kfor -rrb- . dw-world.de : how did you prepare yourself personally for your role as leader of the german contingent in kosovo ? robert bund : i consider myself generally well prepared , especially in the area of leadership , as a result of my previous career assignments during my 40 years of service with the bundeswehr .
moving through the various ranks from company commander -lsb- who is in charge of up to 200 servicemen and women -rsb- all the way up to brigade commander -lsb- who is responsible for some 5,000 soldiers -rsb- , you gain so much experience that you should be ready to successfully confront all the challenges of a foreign operation . like any other soldier , i went through the whole range of preparatory training for this mission .
one hostage exercise we did left an impression .
role-players had to act as realistically as possible and were constantly monitored by psychologists . to round off my technical preparation , i studied the history and the political and social conditions in kosovo intensively .
and , of course , there were intensive talks with my wife and our children as well as with the members of my home church , the free protestant church , to emotionally prepare me for my long tour .
support from family and community makes it easier to take on the burdens of an operation abroad and the separation from home and it can be transformed into something positive . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : better living conditions will keep youth from joining radical groups , said bund how do you motivate your troops ? the leadership principle that i try to put into practice is based on two pillars .
the first pillar is trust . i treat all servicemen and women with unrestricted trust .
this means that i take each one seriously as an individual - with their questions , problems and specialized knowledge .
every single soldier is a specialist in his or her field , and i put my trust in their skills , even in our daily contact with each other .
but this trust also means that each person must be aware of their responsibility , too , and has to act accordingly - that is , responsibly .
i firmly demand this of everyone . the second pillar is comradeship .
back in germany , comradeship is a basic principle , but it plays a much more important role in a foreign operation .
i see comradeship as independent of rank or chain of command .
a particularly important point for me in this respect is looking after each other , taking notice of and dealing with one another in a positive manner and being aware of when others need help . in addition , i continually try to get a feel for the general mood , take notice of problems and explain my position on a whole range of different issues during our meetings .
in other words , i try to stay in touch with my soldiers . i also make use of the camp 's radio station , where all soldiers have the opportunity to ask questions on the air or in writing .
i respond to them during a question-and-answer broadcast called " commander on air . " what have you learned about the culture in kosovo ?
which aspects interest you the most ? i am most interested in the evolution of the political process .
europe and the us have clearly expressed their positions on the matter and the people in kosovo put all their trust in the support from these countries - and their expectations are high . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the people of kosovo want to decide on their future for themselves , said bund i have learned that these people are highly aware of their situation .
they know that never before in their history have they been so close to a potentially historic decision and that anything that deviates from normalcy would jeopardize the current decision process , possibly setting it back for years .
however , they 're not going to wait forever .
that is why we assess the situation as calm but not stable . i have also learned that the people in kosovo are among the youngest in europe .
the average age of the kosovo albanians is about 27 years .
this means that economic development over the next few years is extremely important .
only a significant improvement of the living conditions can prevent the young people from joining more radical movements .
improvement means secure electrical power supply 24 hours a day and modern roads and railway connections to the outside world . what surprised me is the way islam is practiced here .
here in kosovo i was able to gain insight into islamic practices through my many meetings with religious leaders .
i was very impressed that , when the catholic bishop consecrated a new altar , members off different faiths attended the mass and ate together afterwards . on the whole , the people in kosovo want to finally decide for themselves about their future after their long and , at times , tragic history . what is the everyday routine like for you and your soldiers ? the daily routine of my soldiers varies greatly , depending on their respective tasks .
but the overall conditions are the same for all of them .
every soldier without shift duty , night-time operations or other duties works monday through friday from 7:30 a.m. to 7:30 p.m. , but there are many who work beyond that .
on saturday , we start an hour later and on sunday duty is from 1:30 p.m. to 6:30 p.m. another special thing on sunday is that , at 11:00 , we hold our religious service in our small church , which was built by our soldiers a few years ago .
we are always accompanied by our church choir , which i sing in myself . my own daily routine depends on whether talks with politicians or other people are on my schedule .
the morning hours are especially important to me because i can prepare myself for the tasks ahead .
a half hour of bible study helps me get into the mood to go to work . after that , i have various appointments that are coordinated by my military assistant and aide de camp .
there are negotiations with civic representatives , briefings with my advisors and commanders and , of course , visits with the troops at the different field camps in and around prizren . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : kosovo 's political leaders , fatmir sejdiu , left , and hashim thaci , expect much of the eu normally , i am busy every day from about 7:00 a.m. to 9:00 p.m.
but , of course , i am available for all members of the german contingent outside those hours , too . what is your personal goal in kosovo ?
what do you want to leave behind ? the most important goal is get all servicemen and women home again safely . apart from that , i want to contribute to seeing our mission accomplished as well as possible .
to ensure a safe and secure environment and freedom of movement for all ethnic groups .
that the people of kosovo have a positive perspective on their future , and that our servicemen and women are recognized for continuing the tradition of their predecessor under the motto " helping others help themselves . " i want to ensure that , within the framework of our civil-military cooperation , we continue to contribute to the building of a kosovar society and , above all , give the children a better future by building schools and helping them with job qualifications . apart from our military mission we have been able to directly help people living below the poverty threshold with a variety of initiatives supported by donations from germany .
in addition , we 've been able to provide school materials to students . if this has succeeded in assuring the survival of at least a few people or facilitated learning , it is a big enough legacy . interview : kate bowen send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

he said the situation in the serbian province remains calm but not stable . brig. gen. robert bund commands the 2,200 soldiers that make up the german contingent in the nato-led kosovo protection force -lrb- kfor -rrb- . dw-world.de : how did you prepare yourself personally for your role as leader of the german contingent in kosovo ? robert bund : i consider myself generally well prepared , especially in the area of leadership , as a result of my previous career assignments during my 40 years of service with the bundeswehr .
moving through the various ranks from company commander -lsb- who is in charge of up to 200 servicemen and women -rsb- all the way up to brigade commander -lsb- who is responsible for some 5,000 soldiers -rsb- , you gain so much experience that you should be ready to successfully confront all the challenges of a foreign operation . like any other soldier , i went through the whole range of preparatory training for this mission .
one hostage exercise we did left an impression .
role-players had to act as realistically as possible and were constantly monitored by psychologists . to round off my technical preparation , i studied the history and the political and social conditions in kosovo intensively .
and , of course , there were intensive talks with my wife and our children as well as with the members of my home church , the free protestant church , to emotionally prepare me for my long tour .
support from family and community makes it easier to take on the burdens of an operation abroad and the separation from home and it can be transformed into something positive . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : better living conditions will keep youth from joining radical groups , said bund how do you motivate your troops ? the leadership principle that i try to put into practice is based on two pillars .
the first pillar is trust . i treat all servicemen and women with unrestricted trust .
this means that i take each one seriously as an individual - with their questions , problems and specialized knowledge .
every single soldier is a specialist in his or her field , and i put my trust in their skills , even in our daily contact with each other .
but this trust also means that each person must be aware of their responsibility , too , and has to act accordingly - that is , responsibly .
i firmly demand this of everyone . the second pillar is comradeship .
back in germany , comradeship is a basic principle , but it plays a much more important role in a foreign operation .
i see comradeship as independent of rank or chain of command .
a particularly important point for me in this respect is looking after each other , taking notice of and dealing with one another in a positive manner and being aware of when others need help . in addition , i continually try to get a feel for the general mood , take notice of problems and explain my position on a whole range of different issues during our meetings .
in other words , i try to stay in touch with my soldiers . i also make use of the camp 's radio station , where all soldiers have the opportunity to ask questions on the air or in writing .
i respond to them during a question-and-answer broadcast called " commander on air . " what have you learned about the culture in kosovo ?
which aspects interest you the most ? i am most interested in the evolution of the political process .
europe and the us have clearly expressed their positions on the matter and the people in kosovo put all their trust in the support from these countries - and their expectations are high . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the people of kosovo want to decide on their future for themselves , said bund i have learned that these people are highly aware of their situation .
they know that never before in their history have they been so close to a potentially historic decision and that anything that deviates from normalcy would jeopardize the current decision process , possibly setting it back for years .
however , they 're not going to wait forever .
that is why we assess the situation as calm but not stable . i have also learned that the people in kosovo are among the youngest in europe .
the average age of the kosovo albanians is about 27 years .
this means that economic development over the next few years is extremely important .
only a significant improvement of the living conditions can prevent the young people from joining more radical movements .
improvement means secure electrical power supply 24 hours a day and modern roads and railway connections to the outside world . what surprised me is the way islam is practiced here .
here in kosovo i was able to gain insight into islamic practices through my many meetings with religious leaders .
i was very impressed that , when the catholic bishop consecrated a new altar , members off different faiths attended the mass and ate together afterwards . on the whole , the people in kosovo want to finally decide for themselves about their future after their long and , at times , tragic history . what is the everyday routine like for you and your soldiers ? the daily routine of my soldiers varies greatly , depending on their respective tasks .
but the overall conditions are the same for all of them .
every soldier without shift duty , night-time operations or other duties works monday through friday from 7:30 a.m. to 7:30 p.m. , but there are many who work beyond that .
on saturday , we start an hour later and on sunday duty is from 1:30 p.m. to 6:30 p.m. another special thing on sunday is that , at 11:00 , we hold our religious service in our small church , which was built by our soldiers a few years ago .
we are always accompanied by our church choir , which i sing in myself . my own daily routine depends on whether talks with politicians or other people are on my schedule .
the morning hours are especially important to me because i can prepare myself for the tasks ahead .
a half hour of bible study helps me get into the mood to go to work . after that , i have various appointments that are coordinated by my military assistant and aide de camp .
there are negotiations with civic representatives , briefings with my advisors and commanders and , of course , visits with the troops at the different field camps in and around prizren . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : kosovo 's political leaders , fatmir sejdiu , left , and hashim thaci , expect much of the eu normally , i am busy every day from about 7:00 a.m. to 9:00 p.m.
but , of course , i am available for all members of the german contingent outside those hours , too . what is your personal goal in kosovo ?
what do you want to leave behind ? the most important goal is get all servicemen and women home again safely . apart from that , i want to contribute to seeing our mission accomplished as well as possible .
to ensure a safe and secure environment and freedom of movement for all ethnic groups .
that the people of kosovo have a positive perspective on their future , and that our servicemen and women are recognized for continuing the tradition of their predecessor under the motto " helping others help themselves . " i want to ensure that , within the framework of our civil-military cooperation , we continue to contribute to the building of a kosovar society and , above all , give the children a better future by building schools and helping them with job qualifications . apart from our military mission we have been able to directly help people living below the poverty threshold with a variety of initiatives supported by donations from germany .
in addition , we 've been able to provide school materials to students . if this has succeeded in assuring the survival of at least a few people or facilitated learning , it is a big enough legacy . interview : kate bowen send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de food and drink -pipe- 22.01.2008 parmalat trial could open door for civil proceedings großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the shares might have crashed but the company kept on milking when things began to go sour at italian dairy company parmalat the company sued 45 italian and international banks .
on jan .
22 , a criminal trial began against four international banks charged with stock manipulation . parmalat was seen as a successful italian dairy company - until 2003 when it became a sensational fraud case .
behind the bright colored milk cartons - and even a soccer team - a financial black hole was growing .
as early as 1993 , parmalat officials allegedly began to cook the books .
on dec .
24 , 2003 , shareholders and bond holders did n't quite receive the christmas present they were after .
parmalat shares lost 97 percent and was de-listed from the stock exchange .
the chief executive officer and five former parmalat executives were arrested and a fraud investigation began .
in 2004 , auditors determined that parmalat had debts of around 14.3 billion euros -lrb- $ 20.9 billion -rrb- . two years after the spills were mopped up , a new parmalat emerged .
investors were n't buying into the milk or cream business , but the chance to recoup losses through a settlement with the banks and accounting firms accused of helping conceal its dire financial condition .
in the meantime , multiple legal skirmishes have been played out in courtrooms in parma and milan . on tuesday , jan .
22 , proceedings began in milan against four large international banks - citigroup , deutsche bank , morgan stanley and ubs - charged with stock manipulation of parmalat bonds sold in 2003 . if the banks are found guilty the banks could face fines of up to 5 million euros and have their profits seized .
a guilty ruling could also open the door to civil proceedings by investors . dw-world.de talked to beppe scienza , a lecturer in financial mathematics at the university of turin and author of the books " the cheated investors " and " stocks , policies and parmalat - what 's the worst ? "
he has been following the financial market for over 30 years . dw-world.de : parmalat was not a small or weak company - it was the eighth largest company in italy and a global brand .
how is it that the so-called coca cola of milk production began to go sour ? beppe scienza : the interesting thing about parmalat is that at the industrial level nothing changed .
the company continued to produce and so the industrial aspect remained untouched .
as for exactly how this happened , no one knows and no one has studied all the factors that led to the collapse .
however , these things often begin because someone is trying to cover up some kind of mistake or some kind of loss .
perhaps they invent an excuse to cover up an imbalance .
no one knows why this was done or where the money has ended up . it 's interesting to note that the parmalat dividends were n't very high and this , among other things , gave faith to investors .
when a dividend is very high there is usually a high risk , but when the dividend is , as in the case of parmalat , only a little high then it gives the idea that the company could be in difficulty , but it does n't indicate that it 's going to collapse . what could have been the role played by international banks , like deutsche bank , in the parmalat scandal ? i do n't think it was really that much different from the role of the italian banks .
they helped to sell shares .
some employee of the bank was probably corrupt , but the banks themselves must have known something .
like the italian banks , they were creditors so they had to replace the money . how important is what happens in the courtroom in milan over the next few months ? in order to write an honest history of what happened with parmalat , it is important because we might be able to understand the dynamics of what caused this to happen .
for the bond holders it could be important if there is a guilty verdict , because then it opens the door for civil cases to obtain compensation . will investors ever recover everything that they lost ? on a large scale : no .
a majority of investors wo n't recover what they lost .
in these cases where there 's a collapse and the money disappears , it 's better not to have the illusion that you will recover everything . what impact has the parmalat scandal had on the food industry in europe ? i think that it has little impact on the food industry .
it was n't really a bankruptcy in the sense that the company was closed down and assets sold off at auction .
the company continued production so from the industry point of view nothing changed . so it was only the investors who found themselves burnt by this scandal ? yes , and the creditors and the banks , which lost a big slice of their money . is the parmalat scandal the worst thing that has happened to italian investors ? the collapse of parmalat was used by the banks to convince individuals not to not buy shares or bonds but put their money into managed investment funds .
it 's true that investors lost a lot of money with parmalat , but if we look at managed investment funds then we discover that the loss to investors is around 20 billion euros .
now , the loss in italy from the parmalat scandal is around 3 billion euros .
unfortunately , the worst things that happen to italian investors are not these company collapses , but rather the mismanagement of managed investment funds . how new is the new parmalat - has anything changed ? the company has maintained the name and the production facilities , but for an investor the past story of parmalat has nothing to do with buying the stock today since all of the company 's debts were wiped out before its re-listing . interview : stephanie raison send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

on jan .
22 , a criminal trial began against four international banks charged with stock manipulation . parmalat was seen as a successful italian dairy company - until 2003 when it became a sensational fraud case .
behind the bright colored milk cartons - and even a soccer team - a financial black hole was growing .
as early as 1993 , parmalat officials allegedly began to cook the books .
on dec .
24 , 2003 , shareholders and bond holders did n't quite receive the christmas present they were after .
parmalat shares lost 97 percent and was de-listed from the stock exchange .
the chief executive officer and five former parmalat executives were arrested and a fraud investigation began .
in 2004 , auditors determined that parmalat had debts of around 14.3 billion euros -lrb- $ 20.9 billion -rrb- . two years after the spills were mopped up , a new parmalat emerged .
investors were n't buying into the milk or cream business , but the chance to recoup losses through a settlement with the banks and accounting firms accused of helping conceal its dire financial condition .
in the meantime , multiple legal skirmishes have been played out in courtrooms in parma and milan . on tuesday , jan .
22 , proceedings began in milan against four large international banks - citigroup , deutsche bank , morgan stanley and ubs - charged with stock manipulation of parmalat bonds sold in 2003 . if the banks are found guilty the banks could face fines of up to 5 million euros and have their profits seized .
a guilty ruling could also open the door to civil proceedings by investors . dw-world.de talked to beppe scienza , a lecturer in financial mathematics at the university of turin and author of the books " the cheated investors " and " stocks , policies and parmalat - what 's the worst ? "
he has been following the financial market for over 30 years . dw-world.de : parmalat was not a small or weak company - it was the eighth largest company in italy and a global brand .
how is it that the so-called coca cola of milk production began to go sour ? beppe scienza : the interesting thing about parmalat is that at the industrial level nothing changed .
the company continued to produce and so the industrial aspect remained untouched .
as for exactly how this happened , no one knows and no one has studied all the factors that led to the collapse .
however , these things often begin because someone is trying to cover up some kind of mistake or some kind of loss .
perhaps they invent an excuse to cover up an imbalance .
no one knows why this was done or where the money has ended up . it 's interesting to note that the parmalat dividends were n't very high and this , among other things , gave faith to investors .
when a dividend is very high there is usually a high risk , but when the dividend is , as in the case of parmalat , only a little high then it gives the idea that the company could be in difficulty , but it does n't indicate that it 's going to collapse . what could have been the role played by international banks , like deutsche bank , in the parmalat scandal ? i do n't think it was really that much different from the role of the italian banks .
they helped to sell shares .
some employee of the bank was probably corrupt , but the banks themselves must have known something .
like the italian banks , they were creditors so they had to replace the money . how important is what happens in the courtroom in milan over the next few months ? in order to write an honest history of what happened with parmalat , it is important because we might be able to understand the dynamics of what caused this to happen .
for the bond holders it could be important if there is a guilty verdict , because then it opens the door for civil cases to obtain compensation . will investors ever recover everything that they lost ? on a large scale : no .
a majority of investors wo n't recover what they lost .
in these cases where there 's a collapse and the money disappears , it 's better not to have the illusion that you will recover everything . what impact has the parmalat scandal had on the food industry in europe ? i think that it has little impact on the food industry .
it was n't really a bankruptcy in the sense that the company was closed down and assets sold off at auction .
the company continued production so from the industry point of view nothing changed . so it was only the investors who found themselves burnt by this scandal ? yes , and the creditors and the banks , which lost a big slice of their money . is the parmalat scandal the worst thing that has happened to italian investors ? the collapse of parmalat was used by the banks to convince individuals not to not buy shares or bonds but put their money into managed investment funds .
it 's true that investors lost a lot of money with parmalat , but if we look at managed investment funds then we discover that the loss to investors is around 20 billion euros .
now , the loss in italy from the parmalat scandal is around 3 billion euros .
unfortunately , the worst things that happen to italian investors are not these company collapses , but rather the mismanagement of managed investment funds . how new is the new parmalat - has anything changed ? the company has maintained the name and the production facilities , but for an investor the past story of parmalat has nothing to do with buying the stock today since all of the company 's debts were wiped out before its re-listing . interview : stephanie raison send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

11 , 2001 .
but many european editorialists do n't see a need for major panic . " the fear that europe and asia will be infected by the us recession has sent the stock market plummeting , " wrote germany 's financial daily handelsblatt from düsseldorf .
" but panic is a bad advisor .

11 , 2001 .
but many european editorialists do n't see a need for major panic . " the fear that europe and asia will be infected by the us recession has sent the stock market plummeting , " wrote germany 's financial daily handelsblatt from düsseldorf .
" but panic is a bad advisor .
no investor can win by fleeing the market . -lsb- ... -rsb-
on the contrary , fear offers opportunities for hefty market returns in the next few months . " in germany , hope lies in private consumption , considering the recent recovery of the job market , " continued the paper .
" germans need a long time to bring themselves to purchase a car , furniture or other large items .
but as soon as they 've reached their decision , they bring in their high purchase power .
that helps industry and the stock market .
we will see considerably better days on the markets in the next few months . " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the dax sunk to its lowest point since sept .
11 , 2001 the frankfurter allgemeine zeitung commented from germany 's financial capital on the main river that " there 's no reason for panic at the moment , " adding that there is " unfortunately also no reason for confidence . " " the severe setback in the german stock market destroyed the hope that has been fostered over the last few months that the german exchange could be uncoupled from international developments on the financial markets and that domestic stocks were more secure than american or european stocks . " the possibility ca n't be excluded that the situation in the industrial nations will become noticeably worse , " the paper wrote .
" there are many indications that the tendencies on the international stock markets will continue to be driven by developments in the united states . " paris ' liberation , on the other hand , found fault with politics and with the markets themselves .
it wrote tuesday that the financial markets , " heated by their ultraliberal dogmas , have rejected every attempt at regulation .
they have asserted that the divine market would find the remedy for its imbalance on its own .
but the only remedy that has resulted - as in all crises caused by speculation - is a crash . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : germans are cautious but strong buyers , wrote one paper " the whole thing would be tolerable if it just affected the irrational world of financial markets , which are getting a harsh blow from tumbling prices and the loss of capital , " the french paper opined .
" that 's how it goes in a world of crazy money , in which politics has abdicated and left it to the economy . " writing from london , the financial times said " data this year have confirmed trends that had looked worrying for months , such as the fallout from the us housing slump and the crisis in the credit markets " but that " it has brought no true shocks .
equity markets ' success in avoiding a sell-off for so long is more surprising than their recent and sudden capitulation . " big sell-offs are usually followed by a bounce , " continued the paper .
" but popular measures of sentiment had already turned so bearish by the end of last week that they signaled an imminent bounce .
but that has not happened . -lrb- … -rrb- a bounce is likely before long .

" the church of scientology , of which cruise is a leading member , reacted furiously to a newspaper interview by german historian guido knopp in which he drew parallels between the hollywood star and nazi propaganda minister joseph goebbels . " bild am sonntag is grossly irresponsible for publishing horrendous and disgraceful claims about mr. cruise , " the church 's public affairs director , karin pouw said , referring to the german mass-selling tabloid which published the interview . pouw said the footage , which surfaced on the youtube web site this week , was a pirated , edited video taken from a three-hour event . " bild am sonntag has disgracefully misinterpreted mr cruise 's remarks , " pouw said .
" he was giving an acceptance speech for a humanitarian award bestowed in honor of his efforts for global literacy .
in doing so , he was urging other people to become involved in similar humanitarian activities to the betterment of all . historian says speech stirs ugly memories knopp , who works for german broadcaster zdf and heads their programs on contemporary history , said over the weekend that the mission impossible star 's speech to other scientology members , leaked on to the internet this week , was reminiscent of a 1943 speech by propaganda minister , joseph göbbels . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : knopp drew parallels between cruise 's speech and that of göbbels , right the speech that cruise made four years ago asks fellow members of the church : " should we clean this place up ? " knopp said it was sure to remind germans of göbbel 's notorious speech in berlin on feb .
18 , 1943 when he asked the audience : " do you want total war ? " " it may be the case that cruise 's delivery style is not uncommon in certain religious movements in the us , " knopp said .
" but for germans with an interest in history , that scene where he asks whether the scientologists should clean up the world and everyone shouts ' yes ' is inevitably reminiscent of göbbel 's notorious speech . " scientology deeply controversial in germany unlike the us , germany does not recognize scientology as a church and there are debates about whether to ban the organization .
the movement is often described as a sect that exploits its members financially .
in december , regional ministers agreed to investigate the possibility of banning it . cruise also sparked controversy in germany last year because of his role as a nazi resistance hero claus schenk von stauffenberg in a new film , " valkyrie " of which he is also the producer .
von stauffenberg led the failed valkyrie plot , from which the film takes its name , to assassinate adolf hitler in 1944 . cruise 's plans to film a part of the film at the german defense ministry in berlin , where stauffenberg was executed after the failed assassination attempt , met with resistance from german government officials because of his links with scientology . the officials later changed tack and allowed the filming to go ahead .
cruise 's role in scientology is examined in an explosive unauthorized biography of the actor by british writer andrew morton which hit shelves in the united states earlier this month . the publication of the book has been given wide coverage in german media .
it was described by scientology as " replete with lies . " karin pouw said germany had misunderstood the us actor .

" the church of scientology , of which cruise is a leading member , reacted furiously to a newspaper interview by german historian guido knopp in which he drew parallels between the hollywood star and nazi propaganda minister joseph goebbels . " bild am sonntag is grossly irresponsible for publishing horrendous and disgraceful claims about mr. cruise , " the church 's public affairs director , karin pouw said , referring to the german mass-selling tabloid which published the interview . pouw said the footage , which surfaced on the youtube web site this week , was a pirated , edited video taken from a three-hour event . " bild am sonntag has disgracefully misinterpreted mr cruise 's remarks , " pouw said .
" he was giving an acceptance speech for a humanitarian award bestowed in honor of his efforts for global literacy .
in doing so , he was urging other people to become involved in similar humanitarian activities to the betterment of all . historian says speech stirs ugly memories knopp , who works for german broadcaster zdf and heads their programs on contemporary history , said over the weekend that the mission impossible star 's speech to other scientology members , leaked on to the internet this week , was reminiscent of a 1943 speech by propaganda minister , joseph göbbels . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : knopp drew parallels between cruise 's speech and that of göbbels , right the speech that cruise made four years ago asks fellow members of the church : " should we clean this place up ? " knopp said it was sure to remind germans of göbbel 's notorious speech in berlin on feb .
18 , 1943 when he asked the audience : " do you want total war ? " " it may be the case that cruise 's delivery style is not uncommon in certain religious movements in the us , " knopp said .
" but for germans with an interest in history , that scene where he asks whether the scientologists should clean up the world and everyone shouts ' yes ' is inevitably reminiscent of göbbel 's notorious speech . " scientology deeply controversial in germany unlike the us , germany does not recognize scientology as a church and there are debates about whether to ban the organization .
the movement is often described as a sect that exploits its members financially .
in december , regional ministers agreed to investigate the possibility of banning it . cruise also sparked controversy in germany last year because of his role as a nazi resistance hero claus schenk von stauffenberg in a new film , " valkyrie " of which he is also the producer .
von stauffenberg led the failed valkyrie plot , from which the film takes its name , to assassinate adolf hitler in 1944 . cruise 's plans to film a part of the film at the german defense ministry in berlin , where stauffenberg was executed after the failed assassination attempt , met with resistance from german government officials because of his links with scientology . the officials later changed tack and allowed the filming to go ahead .
cruise 's role in scientology is examined in an explosive unauthorized biography of the actor by british writer andrew morton which hit shelves in the united states earlier this month . the publication of the book has been given wide coverage in german media .
it was described by scientology as " replete with lies . " karin pouw said germany had misunderstood the us actor .

" the church of scientology , of which cruise is a leading member , reacted furiously to a newspaper interview by german historian guido knopp in which he drew parallels between the hollywood star and nazi propaganda minister joseph goebbels . " bild am sonntag is grossly irresponsible for publishing horrendous and disgraceful claims about mr. cruise , " the church 's public affairs director , karin pouw said , referring to the german mass-selling tabloid which published the interview . pouw said the footage , which surfaced on the youtube web site this week , was a pirated , edited video taken from a three-hour event . " bild am sonntag has disgracefully misinterpreted mr cruise 's remarks , " pouw said .
" he was giving an acceptance speech for a humanitarian award bestowed in honor of his efforts for global literacy .
in doing so , he was urging other people to become involved in similar humanitarian activities to the betterment of all . historian says speech stirs ugly memories knopp , who works for german broadcaster zdf and heads their programs on contemporary history , said over the weekend that the mission impossible star 's speech to other scientology members , leaked on to the internet this week , was reminiscent of a 1943 speech by propaganda minister , joseph göbbels . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : knopp drew parallels between cruise 's speech and that of göbbels , right the speech that cruise made four years ago asks fellow members of the church : " should we clean this place up ? " knopp said it was sure to remind germans of göbbel 's notorious speech in berlin on feb .
18 , 1943 when he asked the audience : " do you want total war ? " " it may be the case that cruise 's delivery style is not uncommon in certain religious movements in the us , " knopp said .
" but for germans with an interest in history , that scene where he asks whether the scientologists should clean up the world and everyone shouts ' yes ' is inevitably reminiscent of göbbel 's notorious speech . " scientology deeply controversial in germany unlike the us , germany does not recognize scientology as a church and there are debates about whether to ban the organization .
the movement is often described as a sect that exploits its members financially .
in december , regional ministers agreed to investigate the possibility of banning it . cruise also sparked controversy in germany last year because of his role as a nazi resistance hero claus schenk von stauffenberg in a new film , " valkyrie " of which he is also the producer .
von stauffenberg led the failed valkyrie plot , from which the film takes its name , to assassinate adolf hitler in 1944 . cruise 's plans to film a part of the film at the german defense ministry in berlin , where stauffenberg was executed after the failed assassination attempt , met with resistance from german government officials because of his links with scientology . the officials later changed tack and allowed the filming to go ahead .
cruise 's role in scientology is examined in an explosive unauthorized biography of the actor by british writer andrew morton which hit shelves in the united states earlier this month . the publication of the book has been given wide coverage in german media .
it was described by scientology as " replete with lies . " karin pouw said germany had misunderstood the us actor . " anyone who knows mr cruise knows that he does not have a prejudicial bone in his body and that , unlike bild am sonntag and other german anti-religionists , he does not discriminate against any other religion , race or color .

the five-day forum in davos - unlike previous gatherings - will be low on showbiz glamour .
instead the hot issues range from the middle east and terrorism to the legacies of presidents bush and putin .
business leaders will focus on private equity investors and the growing power of india , china and oil-rich nations .
the organisers of the event - now in its 38th year - have chosen the motto " the power of collaborative innovation " for this year 's annual meeting in the swiss mountain village of davos .
the forum 's real topic , however , will be the global economic tensions - both political and economic .
business barometer a year ago most economists in davos expected the global economy to continue its five-year run of strong growth .
coming to davos " in davos we 'll have some fun watching the world 's most powerful networkers in action " read our davos blog q & a : world economic forum the sub-prime crisis in the united states , the resulting global credit crunch , and the flight from risky investments put an end to that .
and while in previous years the agenda was dominated by political issues , this time round it will truly be a world economic forum .
the forum will also serve as a barometer of business confidence .
as the bosses of more than 1,000 of the world 's largest companies meet , the mood in davos may help to gauge whether the financial market turmoil will have a long-term impact on profits and investment decisions .
back to basics for many corporate leaders the agenda is a welcome return to business basics - after a series of forums that were either dominated by green issues -lrb- 2007 -rrb- or outshone by showbiz participants like angelina jolie and sharon stone -lrb- 2006 -rrb- .
instead the forum will explore weighty subjects like the " myths and realities " surrounding hedge funds , private equity investors and so-called sovereign investment funds which invest on behalf of countries like russia , china and singapore .
microsoft founder bill gates has promised a keynote speech on " remaking capitalism for the 21st century " .
his speech comes at a time of a rapid shift in global economic power .
already 70 of the world 's top 500 companies hail from emerging markets like china , india and south korea , turning both into competitors and potential markets of western industrialised countries .
many bosses and political leaders from these power houses will be attending the forum .
political power davos is still a magnet for the world 's politicians , though .
some 27 heads of state or government and more than 100 cabinet ministers are scheduled to come .
us secretary of state condoleezza rice will give the opening address .
pakistan 's president pervez musharraf , uk prime minister gordon brown and un secretary general ban ki-moon will also make the trek through the alps ' snow and ice .
elder statesmen like former us secretary of state henry kissinger and the uk 's former prime minister tony blair are helping to chair the event .
have your say " markets will recover again as they always do .
in the meantime we have to tighten our belts ! "
richard , london send us your comments us politicians will be somewhat thin on the ground , though .
forum regulars like former us president bill clinton and senator john mccain will be on the presidential campaign trail back home .
there will be just a few stars in davos , musicians bono and peter gabriel , and oscar-winning actress emma thompson , all three promoting the good causes they support .
networking pure the forum 's eclectic agenda mixes offbeat subjects like mood manipulation and the power of scent , with current issues like social networking and global water shortages .
one session is guaranteed to be fully booked within minutes : science of love - can neuroscience and anthropology explain why , how , with whom and when we experience passion and fall in love ?
for many participants , however , the biggest attraction of davos wo n't be the packed agenda but the benefit of being there .
where else in the world can one meet as many powerful and interesting people in one place ?
more snow is scheduled to fall in davos this week .
inside the congress centre a blizzard of business cards is bound to envelop participants .

there was a " real link " between tb in cattle and the disease in wildlife , said the report .
but the rspca said a cull would make no meaningful contribution to the problem .
although broadly welcoming the report , the badger trust cymru said a cull would have " no scientific validity and will serve no useful purpose " .
the report into controlling the disease in cattle was undertaken by the assembly 's rural development sub committee .
their findings concluded that only a combination of increased on-farm biosecurity , the control of tb in the wildlife population and the accurate identification of reactors would control the disease .
animals who test positive as a bovine tb reactor means they may have come into contact with the disease and under government rules , these cattle must be shot .
annual testing of cattle was one of the recommendations made in the report , and the report also stressed the importance of farmers and wildlife groups " taking ownership " of the problem .
the committee urged the assembly government to review the extent of its powers and if more were needed to implement their recommended approach to tackling bovine tb , they should seek them urgently .
alun davies , chair of the sub-committee , said previous policies used to bring the disease under control had failed to stop its spread .
" there is a real link between bovine tb in cattle and the disease in wildlife , " he said .
" at present we are simply not convinced that we have the tools available at our disposal to either control or eliminate the disease .
" it is clear the assembly government will need to make substantial investments in the animal disease control and biosecurity infrastructure in wales . "
opposition the sub committee 's report comes in the wake of advice from the uk government 's chief scientist sir david king who claimed in october that killing badgers could help prevent the spread of bovine tb .
the disease can take years to develop and damages the animal 's lungs , eventually leading to death .
but in its back off badgers campaign , the rspca said the advice to cull badgers went against the conclusions of the government-appointed independent scientific group -lrb- isg -rrb- .
the isg 's study suggested badgers played a role in the spread of bovine tb , but warned that culling would have to be so extensive it would be uneconomical .
mike sharratt , for badger trust cymru , said : " killing badgers in one area , that is not randomly selected and has no scientific control with which to compare the results , will have no scientific validity .

there was a " real link " between tb in cattle and the disease in wildlife , said the report .
but the rspca said a cull would make no meaningful contribution to the problem .
although broadly welcoming the report , the badger trust cymru said a cull would have " no scientific validity and will serve no useful purpose " .
the report into controlling the disease in cattle was undertaken by the assembly 's rural development sub committee .
their findings concluded that only a combination of increased on-farm biosecurity , the control of tb in the wildlife population and the accurate identification of reactors would control the disease .
animals who test positive as a bovine tb reactor means they may have come into contact with the disease and under government rules , these cattle must be shot .
annual testing of cattle was one of the recommendations made in the report , and the report also stressed the importance of farmers and wildlife groups " taking ownership " of the problem .
the committee urged the assembly government to review the extent of its powers and if more were needed to implement their recommended approach to tackling bovine tb , they should seek them urgently .
there are suggestions badgers spread tb to cattle alun davies , chair of the sub-committee , said previous policies used to bring the disease under control had failed to stop its spread .
" there is a real link between bovine tb in cattle and the disease in wildlife , " he said .
" at present we are simply not convinced that we have the tools available at our disposal to either control or eliminate the disease .
" it is clear the assembly government will need to make substantial investments in the animal disease control and biosecurity infrastructure in wales . "
opposition the sub committee 's report comes in the wake of advice from the uk government 's chief scientist sir david king who claimed in october that killing badgers could help prevent the spread of bovine tb .
the disease can take years to develop and damages the animal 's lungs , eventually leading to death .
but in its back off badgers campaign , the rspca said the advice to cull badgers went against the conclusions of the government-appointed independent scientific group -lrb- isg -rrb- .
the isg 's study suggested badgers played a role in the spread of bovine tb , but warned that culling would have to be so extensive it would be uneconomical .
mike sharratt , for badger trust cymru , said : " killing badgers in one area , that is not randomly selected and has no scientific control with which to compare the results , will have no scientific validity .
" the science clearly shows that badgers ' small role in this disease occurs when they are in farm buildings looking for food .

as a result , wetherspoon said it was now slowing its rate of new pub openings .
it will now open 25 new outlets in its financial year to the end of july , less than previously indicated .
the company currently has 683 pubs in the uk .
it said it remained confident that the uk-wide smoking ban would see growth in both bar and food sales in the medium and long term .

like-for-like sales at the company , which exclude new pub openings , fell 3.2 % in the 11 weeks to 13 january , compared with a year earlier .
wetherspoon said rising sales of food , real ale and coffee had failed to offset a fall in lager and spirits .
the sales decline is worse than the 1 % fall in the 13 weeks to 28 october .
as a result , wetherspoon said it was now slowing its rate of new pub openings .
it will now open 25 new outlets in its financial year to the end of july , less than previously indicated .
the company currently has 683 pubs in the uk .
it said it remained confident that the uk-wide smoking ban would see growth in both bar and food sales in the medium and long term .

east and west lindsey districts were worst affected but south lincolnshire escaped relatively unscathed , the environment agency said .
the river witham between lincoln and boston remains on flood alert .
there is also a severe flood warning for the river ancholme between bishopbridge and south ferriby .
flood warnings remain in place in horncastle , langworth and for stainfield beck near bardney .
the warning on the river ancholme coincided with a high tide on the humber estuary at 1800 gmt on monday .
standing water cars were abandoned at the witham tavern in boston after the car park flooded on monday night as a result of the river witham bursting its bank at a previous high tide .
sandbags were issued by boston borough council to properties in that area .
supt john ginty from lincolnshire police said it was a worrying time .
" the public need to remain vigilant and keep an eye out particularly when flood watches are in place in the county " , he added .
on monday , residents in louth were warned about possible flooding as water levels rose on the river lud .
the environment agency sounded flood sirens in louth and horncastle early to give people advance warning .
an environment agency spokesman said : " just because the sirens stop does not mean the threat of flooding is over .
we do n't want people to panic but we do want to warn them . "

two in barry and splott , cardiff , which had been earmarked for closure have been saved as a result of feedback from a six-week consultation .
but , as a result of a further review by post office ltd , the perthcelyn branch in mountain ash is now under threat .
post office said 92.9 % of customers in the area would not be affected .
the first closures will take place in february and all by 2009 .
the closure plans for 31 branches across the region were first revealed in october provoking fierce opposition from politicians and residents .
during the public consultation , the post office said it received 2,700 responses and attended 20 meetings to hear the concerns of customers .
the region will be left with a total of 154 branches but the post office insists 99.7 % of the area 's population will either see no change to their existing branch or will remain within a mile of an alternative .
closure list bridgend : rhoslanog , parc newydd cardiff : salisbury rd , cathays ; evansfield rd , llandaff north ; newport rd , st mellons ; sanquahar st , splott ; cowbridge rd / neville st , canton cynon valley : gadlys rd , aberdare ; merthyr rd , llwydcoed ; glancynon , abercynon ; glyn gwyn st , miskin , mountain ash ; penderyn comm centre , penderyn merthyr : chapel st , abercanaid ; dan-y-twyn , quakers yard ; station sq , merthyr vale rhymney valley : bristol terr , brithdir ; jerusalem st , rhymney pontypridd area : swan st , llantrisant ; cardiff rd , nantgarw ; graigwen rd , graigwen ; hopkinstown rd , hopkinstown ; leyshon st , the graig ; tynybryn rd , tonyrefail ; trehafod rd , pontypridd rhondda : ynyswen rd , abergorky ; commercial st , blaenllechau ; miskin rd , trealaw ; court st , blaenclydach ; po at spar , llewellyn st , pentre vale of glamorgan : pill st , cogan source : post office ltd concerns about the high numbers of elderly and vulnerable customers living close to both the high street , barry and splott road , cardiff branches were among the reasons why it was decided not to close them , said the post office .
in barry , residents raised concerns about the long walking distances to the neighbouring offices , the hilly terrain , parking constraints and the possible adverse effect on the local economy .
there were also worries about the ability of neighbouring offices to cope with additional customers .
transport issues and the possible impact on local businesses were some of the reasons given for the u-turn on the splott branch .
the post office said there was a " pressing social need " for a branch in that location .
but in llantrisant , the closure of the branch in swan street will disadvantage senior citizens in the area , said the branch 's sub-postmaster colin cranness .
" many of them live in complexes with no bus facilities , " he said .
" it is fine them having free bus passes but first of all they have got to go up a hill to get to a bus stop .
" access to the other offices is extremely difficult and as many of my customers wrote in their letters there is no continual pavement and it is on a main busy road which comes up through llantrisant . "
a six-week consultation period on the future of the perthcelyn branch in mountain ash will commence soon .
steve geraty , post office ltd 's network development manager for wales , said the decision to close the branches had not been taken lightly .
support he said : " we have considered very carefully all the comments made during the public consultation and we believe that the amended plan offers our customers across the cardiff and glamorgan valleys area the best prospect for a sustainable network in the future . "
he also appealed to customers and businesses to support the branches that had been saved from closure in barry and cardiff .
confirmation of the closures comes in the wake of an announcement that 25 branches across the newport and gwent valleys area had been earmarked for closure .
public consultation on these plans has begun .
the plans are part of a wider restructuring of post office services throughout the uk which will see about 2,500 branches - a fifth of those left in the uk - close by 2009 .
when the announcement was made in may 2007 , the then trade secretary alistair darling said there were 4m fewer customers using post offices every week in the uk than two years ago and they were losing £ 4m a week .
he said changing lifestyles and new technologies meant people used post office branches less .

starting at least 15 days of debate over the next month , foreign secretary david miliband said the treaty was " good for britain and good for europe " .
he came under fire from some labour backbenchers , and the tories said the government was " brazenly abrogating " its promise to hold a referendum .
at the end of a rowdy five-hour debate a motion to approve the bill in principle won by 362 votes to 224 .
but the european union -lrb- amendment -rrb- bill will be debated line-by-line over the coming weeks .
prime minister gordon brown signed the lisbon treaty in december but parliament must ratify it .
it was designed to replace the eu constitution , which was abandoned in 2005 , but on which labour had promised a referendum - the government says a referendum is not needed for the new treaty .

jose manuel barroso wants to protect energy-intensive sectors such as aluminium , steel and cement .
he says there is no point these industries cutting emissions in europe if they lose business to countries with more lax rules on carbon emissions .
mr barroso made the comments in a speech to business leaders in london .
level playing field he said foreign firms should be forced to purchase the same eu carbon allowances european firms would have to buy , thereby levelling the industrial playing field .
i think we should be ready to continue to give the energy-intensive industries their -lrb- carbon -rrb- allowances free of charge - or to require importers to obtain allowances alongside european competitors jose manuel barroso european commission president the threat of trade measures is the nuclear bomb of climate negotiations - and the commission president said he very much hoped it would not be used .
he said his preferred option was for a comprehensive global treaty on emissions .
his fall-back was a global sectoral agreement imposing uniform standards on energy-intensive export industries .
if these failed , he would either protect europe 's industries by giving them all their carbon allowances in the european trading system -lrb- ets -rrb- free of charge , or charge importers at the same rate for the allowances .
" i think we should be ready to continue to give the energy-intensive industries their ets allowances free of charge - or to require importers to obtain allowances alongside european competitors , as long as this system is compatible with wto -lrb- world trade organization -rrb- requirements . "
french idea the idea of climate trade sanctions against nations such as the united states has long been promoted by the french .
they say it is unfair for europe 's firms to bear a financial risk because of the eu 's leadership on a global issue .
they believe the right measures would be acceptable to the wto , which in some cases allows countries to impose charges on environmental grounds .
but us trade representative susan schwab said on monday that climate change should not be used as an excuse for protectionism .
and eu trade commissioner peter mandelson agreed that restrictions were not " the way forward " .
he has been overruled by mr barroso , who will be aware of the effects of his words not just in washington but also in beijing and delhi .
but britain 's energy minister malcolm wicks said the commission 's proposals " might look like trade barriers " .
" we believe in global trade , we want more of it in the future , not less , and that is good for the european economy , " he told bbc news .
" there is always the danger that the protectionists in europe ... could use this as a secret weapon ... to bring about protectionism . "
investing audience mr barroso 's speech on monday evening at lehman brothers bank in canary wharf was quite warmly received by an audience mainly of investors .
john llewellyn of lehman brothers said mr barroso was right to make the threat of trade sanctions , and right to insist that they would be very much the last resort .
he said : " i have heard quite prominent americans say they would recommend to the europeans that they did it -lrb- impose trade measures -rrb- .
but it 's not the way to go if you can possibly avoid it . "
tom burke of environment consultancy e3g said the soft threat would focus minds among other major polluters in future climate negotiations .
" what was really important in the way barroso raised the issue of compensatory adjustments is that it sends a very strong signal about how serious europe is about this , " he said .
" people need to understand that europe sees climate change as in its national interest .
and europe 's going to fight pretty aggressively to protect the interest of 450 million europeans . "

jose manuel barroso wants to protect energy-intensive sectors such as aluminium , steel and cement .
he says there is no point these industries cutting emissions in europe if they lose business to countries with more lax rules on carbon emissions .
mr barroso made the comments in a speech to business leaders in london .
level playing field he said foreign firms should be forced to purchase the same eu carbon allowances european firms would have to buy , thereby levelling the industrial playing field .

he said his preferred option was for a comprehensive global treaty on emissions .
his fall-back was a global sectoral agreement imposing uniform standards on energy-intensive export industries .
if these failed , he would either protect europe 's industries by giving them all their carbon allowances in the european trading system -lrb- ets -rrb- free of charge , or charge importers at the same rate for the allowances .

french idea the idea of climate trade sanctions against nations such as the united states has long been promoted by the french .

they believe the right measures would be acceptable to the wto , which in some cases allows countries to impose charges on environmental grounds .
but us trade representative susan schwab said on monday that climate change should not be used as an excuse for protectionism .

he has been overruled by mr barroso , who will be aware of the effects of his words not just in washington but also in beijing and delhi .

" we believe in global trade , we want more of it in the future , not less , and that is good for the european economy , " he told bbc news .
" there is always the danger that the protectionists in europe ... could use this as a secret weapon ... to bring about protectionism . "
investing audience mr barroso 's speech on monday evening at lehman brothers bank in canary wharf was quite warmly received by an audience mainly of investors .
john llewellyn of lehman brothers said mr barroso was right to make the threat of trade sanctions , and right to insist that they would be very much the last resort .
he said : " i have heard quite prominent americans say they would recommend to the europeans that they did it -lrb- impose trade measures -rrb- .
but it 's not the way to go if you can possibly avoid it . "
tom burke of environment consultancy e3g said the soft threat would focus minds among other major polluters in future climate negotiations .
" what was really important in the way barroso raised the issue of compensatory adjustments is that it sends a very strong signal about how serious europe is about this , " he said .
" people need to understand that europe sees climate change as in its national interest .
and europe 's going to fight pretty aggressively to protect the interest of 450 million europeans . "

the drastic fall in the value of indian shares took investors here by surprise .
many gathered outside the bombay stock exchange , gazing up at the screens flashing market numbers in stunned silence .
no one had expected the impact from falls in regional markets to be so pronounced in india .
" it does n't make sense for markets to fall so much , " one investor said as he looked up at the flashing red arrows .
" we are the worst affected out of all the regional markets , but we were performing the best before this .
it just does n't make sense .
" i 've lost a lot of money today and i do n't know what to do next . "
tempting fate if there was an overwhelming sentiment at the bombay stock exchange on tuesday , it was this : utter confusion .
i thought this was somewhere i could put my money safely and grow it , rather than putting in the bank like my dad did gauravi sharma , a first-time investor millions of retail investors have put their life savings in these markets , hoping to make a pretty profit .
a small group of traders demonstrated outside the exchange , blaming indian financial authorities for not having done more to protect small investors .
some were even targeting the new statue of a bull placed outside the exchange - saying it was inauspicious .
" ever since the authorities here put the bull up outside the exchange , we 've had bad luck , " said kaushik vyas , a day trader in mumbai .
" the gods are punishing us for our arrogance .
we put up a bull and no bear ?
did we think we could tempt the fates like this ?
we have to bring the bull down . "
historic moment last year the sensex topped 20,000 points police were brought in to calm protesters , many whom were irate about the amount of money they had lost in the indian markets .
but there are some who say it could have been much worse , if financial authorities had not stepped in when they did .
financial regulators had halted trading in indian shares at the very start of trade on tuesday , when shares on the bombay stock exchange fell by almost 10 % .
it is the fourth time in the history of the stock market that shares have been suspended .
strong fundamentals when markets reopened , there was some recovery in the value of shares , but activity was still very volatile .
analysts say that india 's stock market is still fundamentally intact .
" the indian market will continue to be one of the best-performing in the world , " says william norbega , president of the conrad group , which advises institutional capital worth $ 2bn where to put their funds .
" what we 've seen today is a healthy and much needed correction .
valuations in indian shares were getting really high .
" now you 'll see lots of institutions come in , private equity funds come in , to buy shares in the indian market .
the economic fundamentals in india and companies here are very strong . "
error of judgement ?
that offers little consolation to small investors who had put away money in equity markets here , thinking they had found a safe place for their investments .
" i thought this was somewhere i could put my money safely and grow it , rather than putting in the bank like my dad did , " said gauravi sharma , a first-time investor .
" my parents had never invested in indian shares , they said it was unsafe .
but i thought , after everything i heard on tv and in the news , that this was the right place to put my money .
now i 'm not so sure . "
indian investors have just learned a harsh lesson .
no matter how quickly a market goes up , it can fall just as suddenly too .

the drastic fall in the value of indian shares took investors here by surprise .
many gathered outside the bombay stock exchange , gazing up at the screens flashing market numbers in stunned silence .
no one had expected the impact from falls in regional markets to be so pronounced in india .
" it does n't make sense for markets to fall so much , " one investor said as he looked up at the flashing red arrows .
" we are the worst affected out of all the regional markets , but we were performing the best before this .
it just does n't make sense .
" i 've lost a lot of money today and i do n't know what to do next . "
tempting fate if there was an overwhelming sentiment at the bombay stock exchange on tuesday , it was this : utter confusion .
i thought this was somewhere i could put my money safely and grow it , rather than putting in the bank like my dad did gauravi sharma , a first-time investor millions of retail investors have put their life savings in these markets , hoping to make a pretty profit .
a small group of traders demonstrated outside the exchange , blaming indian financial authorities for not having done more to protect small investors .
some were even targeting the new statue of a bull placed outside the exchange - saying it was inauspicious .
" ever since the authorities here put the bull up outside the exchange , we 've had bad luck , " said kaushik vyas , a day trader in mumbai .
" the gods are punishing us for our arrogance .
we put up a bull and no bear ?
did we think we could tempt the fates like this ?
we have to bring the bull down . "
historic moment last year the sensex topped 20,000 points police were brought in to calm protesters , many whom were irate about the amount of money they had lost in the indian markets .
but there are some who say it could have been much worse , if financial authorities had not stepped in when they did .
financial regulators had halted trading in indian shares at the very start of trade on tuesday , when shares on the bombay stock exchange fell by almost 10 % .
it is the fourth time in the history of the stock market that shares have been suspended .
strong fundamentals when markets reopened , there was some recovery in the value of shares , but activity was still very volatile .
analysts say that india 's stock market is still fundamentally intact .
" the indian market will continue to be one of the best-performing in the world , " says william norbega , president of the conrad group , which advises institutional capital worth $ 2bn where to put their funds .
" what we 've seen today is a healthy and much needed correction .
valuations in indian shares were getting really high .
" now you 'll see lots of institutions come in , private equity funds come in , to buy shares in the indian market .
the economic fundamentals in india and companies here are very strong . "
error of judgement ?
that offers little consolation to small investors who had put away money in equity markets here , thinking they had found a safe place for their investments .
" i thought this was somewhere i could put my money safely and grow it , rather than putting in the bank like my dad did , " said gauravi sharma , a first-time investor .
" my parents had never invested in indian shares , they said it was unsafe .
but i thought , after everything i heard on tv and in the news , that this was the right place to put my money .
now i 'm not so sure . "
indian investors have just learned a harsh lesson .
no matter how quickly a market goes up , it can fall just as suddenly too .

the shops will also stop selling dvd recorders featuring only analogue tuners .
the move comes just over three years after dixons announced it would no longer stock video cassette recorders , another sign of changing times in technology .
the parent company of the three chains , dsg international , admitted earlier this month that its profit margins in the run-up to christmas had been lower than expected .
