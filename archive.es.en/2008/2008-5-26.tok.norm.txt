" there are going to be harsh consequences " if allegations that deutsche telekom spied on company officials and journalists by monitoring phone traffic between them in order to uncover the source of information leaks are true , said ceo rene obermann in a statement published in the german mass circulation bild zeitung on monday , may 26 .
" this is a breach of our data privacy laws .
cases of misconduct must be clarified , " said obermann , who assured telekom customers that their phone records would remain confidential .
" the billing records of our millions of fixed-line and mobile customers remain secure , " he said , adding that he has faith in telekom 's 240,000 employees .
the alleged misconduct took place over the course of more than a year in 2005-2006 under obermann 's predecessor kai-uwe ricke , who was ousted at a time of diminishing profits and management disputes .
" earth-shattering " ricke and klaus zumwinkel , who was head of the telecom giant 's supervisory board at the time , both denied commissioning the analysis of the data , which recorded the numbers dialed and the time and the duration of phone calls . obermann was head of the mobile division of deutsche telekom at the time .
hundreds of thousands of phone calls made by top management and supervisory board members were monitored , but not tapped , according to newsmagazine " der spiegel . "
a private berlin agency has been analyzing the data .
numerous phone calls out of new york were also monitored , " der spiegel " reported .
the new york-based blackstone group , a private equities firm , owns a significant stake in deutsche telekom , which is one-third state controlled .
the criminal inquiry , which has been handed over to public prosecutors , threatens to undermine relations with labor leaders at a point when management has been making massive job cuts in restructuring its domestic operations .
max stadler a parliamentarian and internal affairs spokesman for the opposition fdp , told the frankfurter rundschau newspaper it was " earth-shattering that a company that has a special responsibility for protecting private data " violated germany 's data privacy laws . dw staff -lrb- df -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

the peaceful beliefs of ahmadis , who can be found in small numbers in germany , are seen as heretical by most muslims . it 's been 100 years since mirza ghulam ahmad founded the ahmadiyya muslim faith .
the controversial indian religious figure claimed to be the promised messiah awaited by all the major religions , whether christian , buddhist jewish or muslim .
his followers believed that within 300 years most of the world will join the islamic brotherhood , which will usher in an era of peace .
that goal implies worldwide missionary work , which has lead ahmadis , as the members of the ahmidiyya community call themselves , to proselitize the world .
they 've even ended up in the unlikely berlin neighborhood of pankow-heinersdorf .
with a new mosque under construction and 100th anniversary parties planned , mirza masroor ahmad will travel to berlin on tuesday , may 27 .
for his followers , the caliph is for followers a representative of the promised messiah .
he is democratically elected by the council of the ahmadiyyas and serves for life .
misunderstandings persist the title of " caliph " has been misunderstood by many in the west , said islamic scholar stephan rosiny .
a caliph is the political head of state in an islamic community .
while the practice of the worldly and spiritual leadership being united in the person of the caliph has its origins in the middle ages , modern islamists have used the idea as well .
a recent example was the so-called caliph of cologne , metin kaplan , who , until his movement was outlawed in 2001 dreamed of starting an islamic regime in europe .
“ to equate the ahmadis with something like that is pure sensationalism , ” rosiny said .
rosiny sees a perception problem due to people in the west viewing radical forms of islam as the norm rather than an exception .
rosiny said that islamic beliefs need to be taken in context .
caliph means successor and “ jihad ” for the ahmidiyya movement , as for most muslims , does not mean holy war but rather a struggle to improve oneself or society .
a peaceful movement the ahmadiyya movement stresses the peaceful aspects of islam .
it condemns islamist violence and spoke out against the fatwa against author salman rushdie for his novel “ the satanic verses . ”
“ love for all , hate for none ” is their motto .
yet the ahmidiyya movement is considered heretical by mainstream islam .
for most muslims , mohammed is the last and most important prophet , while ahmadis believe that he was followed by others .
that has won the movement enemies .
in 1974 , pakistan declared followers not to be muslims and legitimized violence against them .
the caliph moved to london .
long history of missionary work the group has been preaching in germany since the weimar republic .
in berlin 's wilmersdorf neighbourhood the splinter group called the lahore ahmadiyya movement opened a mosque in the 1920s .
it is an architectural gem which remains germany 's oldest mosque .
since the beginning of the systematic persecution in pakistan , many pakistani ahmadiyyas came as asylum seekers to germany .
worldwide there are between 10 and 80 million ahmadiyyas .
in pankow-heinersdorf in the northern part of berlin there are almost no muslims , much less ahmadis .
the neighbourhood was chosen for the 100th anniversary celebrations because the group 's first mosque in eastern germany is being built here .
the shell has just been completed after a long and vehement opposition from some of the public .
there were demonstrations and initiatives against the construction .

the peaceful beliefs of ahmadis , who can be found in small numbers in germany , are seen as heretical by most muslims . it 's been 100 years since mirza ghulam ahmad founded the ahmadiyya muslim faith .
the controversial indian religious figure claimed to be the promised messiah awaited by all the major religions , whether christian , buddhist jewish or muslim .
his followers believed that within 300 years most of the world will join the islamic brotherhood , which will usher in an era of peace .
that goal implies worldwide missionary work , which has lead ahmadis , as the members of the ahmidiyya community call themselves , to proselitize the world .
they 've even ended up in the unlikely berlin neighborhood of pankow-heinersdorf .
with a new mosque under construction and 100th anniversary parties planned , mirza masroor ahmad will travel to berlin on tuesday , may 27 .
for his followers , the caliph is for followers a representative of the promised messiah .
he is democratically elected by the council of the ahmadiyyas and serves for life .
misunderstandings persist the title of " caliph " has been misunderstood by many in the west , said islamic scholar stephan rosiny .
a caliph is the political head of state in an islamic community .
while the practice of the worldly and spiritual leadership being united in the person of the caliph has its origins in the middle ages , modern islamists have used the idea as well .
a recent example was the so-called caliph of cologne , metin kaplan , who , until his movement was outlawed in 2001 dreamed of starting an islamic regime in europe .
“ to equate the ahmadis with something like that is pure sensationalism , ” rosiny said .
rosiny sees a perception problem due to people in the west viewing radical forms of islam as the norm rather than an exception .
rosiny said that islamic beliefs need to be taken in context .
caliph means successor and “ jihad ” for the ahmidiyya movement , as for most muslims , does not mean holy war but rather a struggle to improve oneself or society .
a peaceful movement the ahmadiyya movement stresses the peaceful aspects of islam .
it condemns islamist violence and spoke out against the fatwa against author salman rushdie for his novel “ the satanic verses . ”

" the eu general affairs and external relations council has decided the eu should double the number of participants in the eupol mission in afghanistan , " said a statement from the slovenian presidency of the bloc .
" this measure will strengthen efforts towards police reform , " it added .
launched in june 2007 and expected to last for at least three years , the eupol mission consists of about 200 experts tasked with training afghan policemen and officials at the interior ministry .
their numbers are now expected to rise to about 400 over the next 12 months , diplomats said .
" we want the afghan government to be able to take care of security themselves , " said german defence minister franz josef jung , whose country was strongly behind the initiative .
italy considering sending troops to danger zones bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : frattini said isaf requests would determine italy 's plans separately , new italian foreign minister franco frattini said his government was ready to drop some of its caveats and deploy its troops to more dangerous battle zones , as requested by nato .
" we are talking about greater geographical flexibility , " frattini said .
" we want to align italy to its other great nato partners . "
italy currently has about 2,360 soldiers in afghanistan .
but they are mainly deployed in kabul and in the less restive west of the country .
the previous centre-left government of romano prodi refused to give in to us requests for the troops to be sent to southern hotspots , where nato is fighting taliban insurgents .
germany has maintained a similar position , thus infuriating the united states , britain , canada and the netherlands , which have suffered significant casualties around the kandahar region .
new direction for italian leadership frattini did not rule out sending troops to the south , saying redeployment would depend on the requests made by nato 's international security assistance force -lrb- isaf -rrb- .
but with a political storm brewing back home , italian defence minister ignazio la russa later clarified that such redeployments would be " temporary " rather than permanent .
" we are not against , should the need arise , temporary interventions aimed at lending a hand to those facing greater difficulties than ours , " he said . dw staff / dpa -lrb- nda -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

in 2005 , he transferred to fc nuremberg , which took the german cup in 2007 .
that same year , saenko debuted with the russian national team . dw-world.de : after a disappointing euro 2004 in portugal , where russia went out in the first round , and after failing to qualify for the world cup in 2006 , russia are back to challenge soccer 's greatest at this year 's european championship . ivan saenko : yes , you could say that .

everyone feels the coach trusts that everything at euro 2008 will work out . the russian league has gotten stronger .
for example , the uefa trophy is evidence of fc zenit 's achievements . yes , they have very good players .

it should also boost employment in the region . the express mail delivery and logistics company dhl , which is a division of germany 's postal giant deutsche post ag , inaugurated its principle european hub at leipzig-halle airport in eastern germany on monday , may 26 .
in 2004 , deutsche post had already announced the planned move from brussels to leipzig , since the belgian capital refused to permit additional nighttime flights .
dhl added that besides being able to operate around the clock in leipzig , the central european location was ideal as a hub for emerging markets in eastern europe and asia .
" demand for express services is growing worldwide , " said the new ceo of the post ag parent company , frank appel at the opening ceremony attended by prominent politicians , such as german foreign minister frank-walter steinmeier .
" this is a day to be proud of .
we are looking towards the future , " he said .
georg milbradt , the state premier of saxony , where leipzig is the capital , hailed the move as a " job motor " which will help boost the economy in the eastern states , which have higher unemployment rates than in the west .
at present dhl already operates flights to the middle east and india from leipzig-halle , where it plans to increase its personnel from about 2,000 to 3,500 employees by 2012 .
" with dhl here , the state of saxony will without a doubt become a central logistics point in europe , " said the state 's economics minister thomas jurk .
some 300 million euros -lrb- $ 474 million -rrb- have already been invested in the new hub , which has an air freight turnover of 1,500 tons a day .
about 60 freight aircraft bearing the dhl logo take off and land in leipzig per day .
worldwide , dhl flies to nearly 50 destinations , of which leipzig will become one of three main hubs that include wilmington , ohio in the us and hong kong .
not everyone was happy about the new hub however .
dozens of local residents staged a protest at the inauguration over the potential increase in noise levels at night .
" we will only fly when necessary , " said appel .
a hearing on night time flights will be held in the federal courts in leipzig on july 15 . dw staff -lrb- df -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de civil rights -pipe- 26.05.2008 memorial for gays persecuted by nazis opens in berlin großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the memorial and its creators german politicians will dedicate a memorial in berlin this week to the tens of thousands of homosexuals persecuted during the nazi regime .
gay activists say the memorial is long overdue . seventy-five years ago nazis launched a series of raids and public book burnings aimed at homosexuals .
it was the start of adolf hitler ’ s crusade against homosexuality which saw an unknown number of gays arrested , tortured and murdered by the nazis .
the subject of nazi persecution of homosexuals has long been swept under the carpet .
yet a new memorial which opens tuesday , may 27 , will bring the past persecution and ongoing struggles of homosexuals to be accepted in society to the heart of the german capital .
showing a forbidden kiss bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the memorial will be officially unveiled this week the homosexual memorial will consist of a grey rectangular block some four meters -lrb- 13 feet -rrb- tall .
one side will have a small opening through which viewers will see a black and white art film scene of two men kissing .
" a simple kiss could land you in trouble , " says the text which accompanies the memorial .
the memorial was designed by the danish-norweigan artistic duo michael elmgreen and ingar dragset .
the memorial has a prominent place in berlin 's tiergarten park , half a block from brandenburg gate .
the monument sits across from the jewish holocaust memorial .
originally it was debated whether homosexuals should be included in the larger memorial before the decision was made to give homosexuals their own monument .
but the design corresponds to the holocaust memorial 's field of steles , a series of concrete blocks of varying sizes .
while the nazi persecution of the jews is well known , for many years there was little public acknowledgement of nazi atrocities towards homosexuals .
estimates put the number of homosexuals arrested by nazis at about 54,000 with 7,000 being killed in concentration camps .
" it is not easy for a gay man to live in this country and this society .
it 's important to remember that this society punished homosexuality for 20 years after national socialism ended , " said günter dworek of the federation of gays and lesbians in germany -lrb- lsvd -rrb- , a driving force behind the project .
gays making strides bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : berlin 's mayor is gay homosexuality remained illegal in germany until 1969 and was only formally decriminalized in 1994 .
it was n't until 2000 that germany 's parliament first passed a resolution acknowledging discrimination had occurred , dworek said .
the decision to fund the memorial , which cost 450,000 euros -lrb- $ 710,000 -rrb- , happened three years later .
the city 's current mayor , social democrat klaus wowereit , announced shortly before taking office seven years ago that he is gay .
wowereit 's legendary outing has given many others courage , dworek said .
" that opened a lot of people 's eyes .
you can not simply assume that politicians who already have a career behind them , like klaus wowereit , are by nature heterosexual , " dworek said .
germany also has a law which allows same-sex couples to register their partnerships .
yet many activists would like to see more , including anti-discrimination laws .
neo-nazi violence is still a very real threat , said albert eckert , head of the gay holocaust memorial committee . " but at last we have a monument to those who suffered and died under the nazis , " eckert said .
a tribute to hirschfeld bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : it is similar in style to the holocaust memorial eckert said he was also happy that the dedication was close to the birthday and death day of magnus hirschfeld , who died in exile in southern france on may 14 , 1935 .
a jewish homosexual , hirschfeld was a medical doctor who dedicated his life to the scientific study of homosexuality and lobbied the german government to repeal laws which outlawed gay sex .
the word " transsexual " was coined by hirschfeld to describe the phenomenon that he argued was a natural extension of human sexuality .
for his work , the nazis targeted hirschfeld as an example of decadent bolshevistic / jewish influence infecting the purity of the german people , luring the aryan race into impure and destructive perversity .
his institute was ransacked and his books were burned in rallies on may 10 , 1933 .
it was n't long before gay men were being rounded up and sent to mental hospitals or concentration camps .
" we have no idea how many thousands died in concentration camps because many were also jewish or were communists .
we know that many were left in prison after the war when post-war courts upheld the nazi jail sentences against them , " eckert says .
" anyone who was gay was automatically a criminal .
this monument is for all of them . "
making an international statement bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : a kiss can be a political statement the parliament decided on december 12 , 2003 to fund the homosexual memorial .
it was a nice birthday present for the green politician and well-known gay activist volker beck who turned 43 that day .
beck felt the memorial was especially important because the laws used to prosecute homosexuals continued long after the nazis had been defeated .
and persecution still exists in many countries today , making the memorial as important as ever , beck said .
he cites 80 countries which criminalize homosexual acts between consenting adults and 12 where the death penalty can be handed down .
beck believes germany 's memorial " sends an important signal that in this country , where in the past -lsb- homosexuals -rsb- were also systematically persecuted , we now have constructed a symbol against this human rights violation . " but homosexuals are still not fully accepted in society , beck said .
he worries about the refusal of some conservative christians and muslims to accept homosexuality .
beck said he does n't have any problem with the memorial 's design , which has come under criticism , particularly from women .
the first scene will portray men kissing , but later it will show women .
dworek said he is " downright happy " with the memorial 's design and likes the idea that the kissing scene will switch every two years .

gay activists say the memorial is long overdue . seventy-five years ago nazis launched a series of raids and public book burnings aimed at homosexuals .
it was the start of adolf hitler ’ s crusade against homosexuality which saw an unknown number of gays arrested , tortured and murdered by the nazis .
the subject of nazi persecution of homosexuals has long been swept under the carpet .
yet a new memorial which opens tuesday , may 27 , will bring the past persecution and ongoing struggles of homosexuals to be accepted in society to the heart of the german capital .
showing a forbidden kiss bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the memorial will be officially unveiled this week the homosexual memorial will consist of a grey rectangular block some four meters -lrb- 13 feet -rrb- tall .
one side will have a small opening through which viewers will see a black and white art film scene of two men kissing .
" a simple kiss could land you in trouble , " says the text which accompanies the memorial .
the memorial was designed by the danish-norweigan artistic duo michael elmgreen and ingar dragset .
the memorial has a prominent place in berlin 's tiergarten park , half a block from brandenburg gate .
the monument sits across from the jewish holocaust memorial .
originally it was debated whether homosexuals should be included in the larger memorial before the decision was made to give homosexuals their own monument .
but the design corresponds to the holocaust memorial 's field of steles , a series of concrete blocks of varying sizes .
while the nazi persecution of the jews is well known , for many years there was little public acknowledgement of nazi atrocities towards homosexuals .
estimates put the number of homosexuals arrested by nazis at about 54,000 with 7,000 being killed in concentration camps .
" it is not easy for a gay man to live in this country and this society .
it 's important to remember that this society punished homosexuality for 20 years after national socialism ended , " said günter dworek of the federation of gays and lesbians in germany -lrb- lsvd -rrb- , a driving force behind the project .
gays making strides bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : berlin 's mayor is gay homosexuality remained illegal in germany until 1969 and was only formally decriminalized in 1994 .
it was n't until 2000 that germany 's parliament first passed a resolution acknowledging discrimination had occurred , dworek said .
the decision to fund the memorial , which cost 450,000 euros -lrb- $ 710,000 -rrb- , happened three years later .
the city 's current mayor , social democrat klaus wowereit , announced shortly before taking office seven years ago that he is gay .
wowereit 's legendary outing has given many others courage , dworek said .
" that opened a lot of people 's eyes .
you can not simply assume that politicians who already have a career behind them , like klaus wowereit , are by nature heterosexual , " dworek said .
germany also has a law which allows same-sex couples to register their partnerships .
yet many activists would like to see more , including anti-discrimination laws .
neo-nazi violence is still a very real threat , said albert eckert , head of the gay holocaust memorial committee . " but at last we have a monument to those who suffered and died under the nazis , " eckert said .
a tribute to hirschfeld bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : it is similar in style to the holocaust memorial eckert said he was also happy that the dedication was close to the birthday and death day of magnus hirschfeld , who died in exile in southern france on may 14 , 1935 .
a jewish homosexual , hirschfeld was a medical doctor who dedicated his life to the scientific study of homosexuality and lobbied the german government to repeal laws which outlawed gay sex .
the word " transsexual " was coined by hirschfeld to describe the phenomenon that he argued was a natural extension of human sexuality .
for his work , the nazis targeted hirschfeld as an example of decadent bolshevistic / jewish influence infecting the purity of the german people , luring the aryan race into impure and destructive perversity .
his institute was ransacked and his books were burned in rallies on may 10 , 1933 .
it was n't long before gay men were being rounded up and sent to mental hospitals or concentration camps .
" we have no idea how many thousands died in concentration camps because many were also jewish or were communists .
we know that many were left in prison after the war when post-war courts upheld the nazi jail sentences against them , " eckert says .
" anyone who was gay was automatically a criminal .
this monument is for all of them . "
making an international statement bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : a kiss can be a political statement the parliament decided on december 12 , 2003 to fund the homosexual memorial .

gay activists say the memorial is long overdue . seventy-five years ago nazis launched a series of raids and public book burnings aimed at homosexuals .
it was the start of adolf hitler ’ s crusade against homosexuality which saw an unknown number of gays arrested , tortured and murdered by the nazis .
the subject of nazi persecution of homosexuals has long been swept under the carpet .
yet a new memorial which opens tuesday , may 27 , will bring the past persecution and ongoing struggles of homosexuals to be accepted in society to the heart of the german capital .
showing a forbidden kiss bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the memorial will be officially unveiled this week the homosexual memorial will consist of a grey rectangular block some four meters -lrb- 13 feet -rrb- tall .
one side will have a small opening through which viewers will see a black and white art film scene of two men kissing .
" a simple kiss could land you in trouble , " says the text which accompanies the memorial .
the memorial was designed by the danish-norweigan artistic duo michael elmgreen and ingar dragset .
the memorial has a prominent place in berlin 's tiergarten park , half a block from brandenburg gate .
the monument sits across from the jewish holocaust memorial .
originally it was debated whether homosexuals should be included in the larger memorial before the decision was made to give homosexuals their own monument .
but the design corresponds to the holocaust memorial 's field of steles , a series of concrete blocks of varying sizes .
while the nazi persecution of the jews is well known , for many years there was little public acknowledgement of nazi atrocities towards homosexuals .
estimates put the number of homosexuals arrested by nazis at about 54,000 with 7,000 being killed in concentration camps .
" it is not easy for a gay man to live in this country and this society .
it 's important to remember that this society punished homosexuality for 20 years after national socialism ended , " said günter dworek of the federation of gays and lesbians in germany -lrb- lsvd -rrb- , a driving force behind the project .
gays making strides bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : berlin 's mayor is gay homosexuality remained illegal in germany until 1969 and was only formally decriminalized in 1994 .
it was n't until 2000 that germany 's parliament first passed a resolution acknowledging discrimination had occurred , dworek said .
the decision to fund the memorial , which cost 450,000 euros -lrb- $ 710,000 -rrb- , happened three years later .
the city 's current mayor , social democrat klaus wowereit , announced shortly before taking office seven years ago that he is gay .
wowereit 's legendary outing has given many others courage , dworek said .
" that opened a lot of people 's eyes .
you can not simply assume that politicians who already have a career behind them , like klaus wowereit , are by nature heterosexual , " dworek said .
germany also has a law which allows same-sex couples to register their partnerships .
yet many activists would like to see more , including anti-discrimination laws .
neo-nazi violence is still a very real threat , said albert eckert , head of the gay holocaust memorial committee . " but at last we have a monument to those who suffered and died under the nazis , " eckert said .
a tribute to hirschfeld bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : it is similar in style to the holocaust memorial eckert said he was also happy that the dedication was close to the birthday and death day of magnus hirschfeld , who died in exile in southern france on may 14 , 1935 .
a jewish homosexual , hirschfeld was a medical doctor who dedicated his life to the scientific study of homosexuality and lobbied the german government to repeal laws which outlawed gay sex .
the word " transsexual " was coined by hirschfeld to describe the phenomenon that he argued was a natural extension of human sexuality .
for his work , the nazis targeted hirschfeld as an example of decadent bolshevistic / jewish influence infecting the purity of the german people , luring the aryan race into impure and destructive perversity .
his institute was ransacked and his books were burned in rallies on may 10 , 1933 .
it was n't long before gay men were being rounded up and sent to mental hospitals or concentration camps .
" we have no idea how many thousands died in concentration camps because many were also jewish or were communists .
we know that many were left in prison after the war when post-war courts upheld the nazi jail sentences against them , " eckert says .
" anyone who was gay was automatically a criminal .
this monument is for all of them . "
making an international statement bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : a kiss can be a political statement the parliament decided on december 12 , 2003 to fund the homosexual memorial .
it was a nice birthday present for the green politician and well-known gay activist volker beck who turned 43 that day .
beck felt the memorial was especially important because the laws used to prosecute homosexuals continued long after the nazis had been defeated .
and persecution still exists in many countries today , making the memorial as important as ever , beck said .
he cites 80 countries which criminalize homosexual acts between consenting adults and 12 where the death penalty can be handed down .
beck believes germany 's memorial " sends an important signal that in this country , where in the past -lsb- homosexuals -rsb- were also systematically persecuted , we now have constructed a symbol against this human rights violation . " but homosexuals are still not fully accepted in society , beck said .
he worries about the refusal of some conservative christians and muslims to accept homosexuality .
beck said he does n't have any problem with the memorial 's design , which has come under criticism , particularly from women .
the first scene will portray men kissing , but later it will show women .
dworek said he is " downright happy " with the memorial 's design and likes the idea that the kissing scene will switch every two years .
" this will keep the memorial fresh .
there is always be something new , " dworek said .
" it will be a dynamic memorial . " dw staff -lrb- th -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de civil rights -pipe- 26.05.2008 memorial for gays persecuted by nazis opens in berlin großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the memorial and its creators german politicians will dedicate a memorial in berlin this week to the tens of thousands of homosexuals persecuted during the nazi regime .
gay activists say the memorial is long overdue . seventy-five years ago nazis launched a series of raids and public book burnings aimed at homosexuals .
it was the start of adolf hitler ’ s crusade against homosexuality which saw an unknown number of gays arrested , tortured and murdered by the nazis .
the subject of nazi persecution of homosexuals has long been swept under the carpet .
yet a new memorial which opens tuesday , may 27 , will bring the past persecution and ongoing struggles of homosexuals to be accepted in society to the heart of the german capital .
showing a forbidden kiss bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the memorial will be officially unveiled this week the homosexual memorial will consist of a grey rectangular block some four meters -lrb- 13 feet -rrb- tall .
one side will have a small opening through which viewers will see a black and white art film scene of two men kissing .
" a simple kiss could land you in trouble , " says the text which accompanies the memorial .
the memorial was designed by the danish-norweigan artistic duo michael elmgreen and ingar dragset .
the memorial has a prominent place in berlin 's tiergarten park , half a block from brandenburg gate .
the monument sits across from the jewish holocaust memorial .
originally it was debated whether homosexuals should be included in the larger memorial before the decision was made to give homosexuals their own monument .
but the design corresponds to the holocaust memorial 's field of steles , a series of concrete blocks of varying sizes .
while the nazi persecution of the jews is well known , for many years there was little public acknowledgement of nazi atrocities towards homosexuals .
estimates put the number of homosexuals arrested by nazis at about 54,000 with 7,000 being killed in concentration camps .
" it is not easy for a gay man to live in this country and this society .
it 's important to remember that this society punished homosexuality for 20 years after national socialism ended , " said günter dworek of the federation of gays and lesbians in germany -lrb- lsvd -rrb- , a driving force behind the project .
gays making strides bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : berlin 's mayor is gay homosexuality remained illegal in germany until 1969 and was only formally decriminalized in 1994 .
it was n't until 2000 that germany 's parliament first passed a resolution acknowledging discrimination had occurred , dworek said .
the decision to fund the memorial , which cost 450,000 euros -lrb- $ 710,000 -rrb- , happened three years later .
the city 's current mayor , social democrat klaus wowereit , announced shortly before taking office seven years ago that he is gay .
wowereit 's legendary outing has given many others courage , dworek said .
" that opened a lot of people 's eyes .
you can not simply assume that politicians who already have a career behind them , like klaus wowereit , are by nature heterosexual , " dworek said .
germany also has a law which allows same-sex couples to register their partnerships .
yet many activists would like to see more , including anti-discrimination laws .
neo-nazi violence is still a very real threat , said albert eckert , head of the gay holocaust memorial committee . " but at last we have a monument to those who suffered and died under the nazis , " eckert said .
a tribute to hirschfeld bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : it is similar in style to the holocaust memorial eckert said he was also happy that the dedication was close to the birthday and death day of magnus hirschfeld , who died in exile in southern france on may 14 , 1935 .
a jewish homosexual , hirschfeld was a medical doctor who dedicated his life to the scientific study of homosexuality and lobbied the german government to repeal laws which outlawed gay sex .
the word " transsexual " was coined by hirschfeld to describe the phenomenon that he argued was a natural extension of human sexuality .
for his work , the nazis targeted hirschfeld as an example of decadent bolshevistic / jewish influence infecting the purity of the german people , luring the aryan race into impure and destructive perversity .
his institute was ransacked and his books were burned in rallies on may 10 , 1933 .
it was n't long before gay men were being rounded up and sent to mental hospitals or concentration camps .
" we have no idea how many thousands died in concentration camps because many were also jewish or were communists .
we know that many were left in prison after the war when post-war courts upheld the nazi jail sentences against them , " eckert says .
" anyone who was gay was automatically a criminal .
this monument is for all of them . "
making an international statement bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : a kiss can be a political statement the parliament decided on december 12 , 2003 to fund the homosexual memorial .
it was a nice birthday present for the green politician and well-known gay activist volker beck who turned 43 that day .
beck felt the memorial was especially important because the laws used to prosecute homosexuals continued long after the nazis had been defeated .
and persecution still exists in many countries today , making the memorial as important as ever , beck said .
he cites 80 countries which criminalize homosexual acts between consenting adults and 12 where the death penalty can be handed down .
beck believes germany 's memorial " sends an important signal that in this country , where in the past -lsb- homosexuals -rsb- were also systematically persecuted , we now have constructed a symbol against this human rights violation . " but homosexuals are still not fully accepted in society , beck said .
he worries about the refusal of some conservative christians and muslims to accept homosexuality .
beck said he does n't have any problem with the memorial 's design , which has come under criticism , particularly from women .
the first scene will portray men kissing , but later it will show women .
dworek said he is " downright happy " with the memorial 's design and likes the idea that the kissing scene will switch every two years .
" this will keep the memorial fresh .
there is always be something new , " dworek said .
" it will be a dynamic memorial . " dw staff -lrb- th -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

it is intended to replace the current partnership and cooperation agreement -lrb- pca -rrb- , which ran out in 2007 , and should include legally-binding measures on such issues as energy , security , trade and education . negotiations are to be formally launched in siberia on june 26-27 , when new president dmitry medvedev will represent russia for the first time .
they were only made possible after lithuania , the last eu member to block the talks , was assured that its concerns about energy supply and moscow 's stance on georgia would be addressed . officials in brussels predict complex negotiations with moscow are likely to last about a year , with a further year required for its ratification by eu member states and russia . eu ministers also listened to polish plans for strengthening ties with ukraine , moldova , georgia , armenia , azerbaijan and , eventually , belarus . supported by sweden and blessed by heavyweights france and germany , the so-called eastern partnership comes on the back of french plans to boost the eu 's ties with its southern neighbors in a union for the mediterranean . visa-free travel in sight according to a text seen by german news agency dpa , the proposed eastern partnership would seek to deepen cooperation and focus on concrete proposals in the area of migration , with an eye to moving towards a visa-free regime . it would also seek to create a free trade area , provide support for reforms designed to bring those countries up to eu standards , and arrange more student exchange programs . the partnership would use existing neighborhood funds and would have an institutional structure that is " as light-weight and goal-oriented as possible . " human rights , a frequent bone of contention under russia 's former president vladimir putin , and energy supply are also likely to become major topics of discussion . benita ferrero-waldner , the commissioner in charge of the eu 's external relations , said the eu executive would only support the plan if it provided " added value " and did not duplicate existing eu policies . " the negotiation will certainly not be easy … i think they will take quite some time , " she said . poland advocates eastern focus polish and swedish diplomats say the partnership will encourage " multilateral cooperation " and " foster regional links . " cooperation with belarus , whose democratic credentials have been thrown into question , would initially take place only on a " technical and expert level . " the polish-swedish plan was welcomed by the czech republic , which is due to take over the rotating presidency of the eu on jan .

it is intended to replace the current partnership and cooperation agreement -lrb- pca -rrb- , which ran out in 2007 , and should include legally-binding measures on such issues as energy , security , trade and education . negotiations are to be formally launched in siberia on june 26-27 , when new president dmitry medvedev will represent russia for the first time .
they were only made possible after lithuania , the last eu member to block the talks , was assured that its concerns about energy supply and moscow 's stance on georgia would be addressed . officials in brussels predict complex negotiations with moscow are likely to last about a year , with a further year required for its ratification by eu member states and russia . eu ministers also listened to polish plans for strengthening ties with ukraine , moldova , georgia , armenia , azerbaijan and , eventually , belarus . supported by sweden and blessed by heavyweights france and germany , the so-called eastern partnership comes on the back of french plans to boost the eu 's ties with its southern neighbors in a union for the mediterranean . visa-free travel in sight according to a text seen by german news agency dpa , the proposed eastern partnership would seek to deepen cooperation and focus on concrete proposals in the area of migration , with an eye to moving towards a visa-free regime . it would also seek to create a free trade area , provide support for reforms designed to bring those countries up to eu standards , and arrange more student exchange programs . the partnership would use existing neighborhood funds and would have an institutional structure that is " as light-weight and goal-oriented as possible . " human rights , a frequent bone of contention under russia 's former president vladimir putin , and energy supply are also likely to become major topics of discussion . benita ferrero-waldner , the commissioner in charge of the eu 's external relations , said the eu executive would only support the plan if it provided " added value " and did not duplicate existing eu policies . " the negotiation will certainly not be easy … i think they will take quite some time , " she said . poland advocates eastern focus polish and swedish diplomats say the partnership will encourage " multilateral cooperation " and " foster regional links .

" human rights , a frequent bone of contention under russia 's former president vladimir putin , and energy supply are also likely to become major topics of discussion . benita ferrero-waldner , the commissioner in charge of the eu 's external relations , said the eu executive would only support the plan if it provided " added value " and did not duplicate existing eu policies . " the negotiation will certainly not be easy … i think they will take quite some time , " she said . poland advocates eastern focus polish and swedish diplomats say the partnership will encourage " multilateral cooperation " and " foster regional links . " cooperation with belarus , whose democratic credentials have been thrown into question , would initially take place only on a " technical and expert level . " the polish-swedish plan was welcomed by the czech republic , which is due to take over the rotating presidency of the eu on jan .
1 . france , which launched the idea of the mediterranean union , is due to hold the eu presidency from july 1 this year . " this year is the mediterranean year , next year would be the eastern year , " said the czech deputy prime minister for european affairs , alexander vondra . kosovo handover unrealistic another major issue up for discussion in brussels is the bloc 's eu-lex law mission in kosovo . the mission was originally meant to take over the administration of the newly independent country from the united nations on june 15 . but eu officials now concede that legal and logistical difficulties mean that the deadline is unrealistic . " eu-lex is going slowly but surely , " said slovenian foreign minister dimitrij rupel , who chaired monday 's meeting as current eu president . dw staff with dpa news reports -lrb- kjb -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

schwan nearly won the post five years ago , but lost out to horst koehler , a former head of the international monetary fund .
koehler has the support of chancellor angela merkel 's christian democratic union -lrb- cdu -rrb- , who wants to see him serve a second five-year term .
members of the cdu and its bavarian sister party , the christian social union -lrb- csu -rrb- , were upset to hear that the spd would put forth its own candidate .

chancellor merkel expressed her anger about the decision of her coalition partners to nominate their own candidate . " we have a president who is respected around the world , " merkel said .
" so it is regrettable that the social democrats have put up their own candidate in this step that can only be explained by the internal state of the party . ” schwan 's candidacy runs counter to a longstanding tradition observed by the two main political blocs not to put up a challenger to a president seeking a second term .

i urge them just to relax . "
spd leader kurt beck said that his party would not " campaign against the incumbent . "

the decision is sure to cause friction within germany 's coalition government . schwan , a 65-year-old university professor , was announced on monday , may 26 , as the social democratic party 's -lrb- spd -rrb- choice for the high-profile office of german president .
schwan nearly won the post five years ago , but lost out to horst koehler , a former head of the international monetary fund .
koehler has the support of chancellor angela merkel 's christian democratic union -lrb- cdu -rrb- , who wants to see him serve a second five-year term .
members of the cdu and its bavarian sister party , the christian social union -lrb- csu -rrb- , were upset to hear that the spd would put forth its own candidate .
the parties form a left-right coalition together .
chancellor merkel expressed her anger about the decision of her coalition partners to nominate their own candidate . " we have a president who is respected around the world , " merkel said .
" so it is regrettable that the social democrats have put up their own candidate in this step that can only be explained by the internal state of the party . ” schwan 's candidacy runs counter to a longstanding tradition observed by the two main political blocs not to put up a challenger to a president seeking a second term . " i believe that this candidacy will fail and that horst koehler will remain president , as is the wish of the majority of our citizens , " she added .
coalition will stay together bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : they do not always see eye to eye spd head hubertus heil said that he does not worry that the move will rupture the coalition ahead of federal elections , which are scheduled to take place in 2009 .
the csu also faces state elections in bavaria later this year .
" a little competition is n't going to cause any harm to a functioning democracy , " heil said .
" the csu is nervous ahead of the state elections in september .
i urge them just to relax . "
spd leader kurt beck said that his party would not " campaign against the incumbent . "
" in a democracy , we view a rival candidacy as a good opportunity for a broad discussion of the issues , " beck said monday .
merkel 's spokesman ulrich wilhelm also rejected any suggestion of the coalition breaking apart at a news conference .
" the chancellor has made it clear that the spd decision puts a strain on the coalition but that she , as well as the chairmen of the spd and csu , remains interested in carrying on the work on policies in the best interests of germany , " wilhelm said .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de in focus : dossier : preserving biodiversity biodiversity conference ends with mixed results merkel warns of extinction threat to life on earth merkel pledges funds at un biodiversity talks biodiversity loss can dent world economy , study warns environment -pipe- 26.05.2008 progress at mid-way point for un biodiversity conference großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : delegates at the un biodiversity conference are trying to find a balance in their debates halfway through a two-week conference in germany on biodiversity , enough progress has been made to avoid total failure , but much more remains to be done at the un event . more than 6,000 delegates from 200 nations have debated and pored over tons of conference papers .
after a week , they have isolated key issues splitting the ninth conference of the parties to the convention on biological diversity -lrb- cbd -rrb- that runs until may 30 .
on sunday , may 25 , they were told to forget weekend-break plans and attend extra sessions summoned by the chairman of the mammoth conference , german environment minister sigmar gabriel .
the delegates must find a way to preserve biological diversity on the planet .
despite a minimum of progress , decisive action to halt the global destruction of virgin natural sites like rain forests and to prevent the extinction of flora and fauna has not yet been agreed upon .
the talks have prompted greater public awareness and concern about the exploitation of natural resources for the profit of the few .
gabriel says the sheer survival of billions of people may depend on this meeting 's resolutions , and that most government officials have praised the " constructive " atmosphere in the debates .
that should move the talks forward , said gabriel , whose role as chairman has been important in setting the fast pace .
praise heaped on german hosts bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : gabriel and his colleagues have been praised for their work ahmed djoghlaf , chief of the un convention secretariat , has been unstinting in his praise of the germans and gabriel for their no-nonsense management of the negotiations .
it is a gargantuan task getting so many nations to agree .
like the un climate-change convention , the pact on biodiversity requires " consensus " decision-making by the 191 parties under the aegis of the united nations .
it takes only one nay-sayer to torpedo any agreement , so conflicting national interests must be balanced up .
there have been critics in bonn quietly suggesting that such a decision-making method is impossibly unwieldy , but no one openly proposes the alternative : voting and letting a majority decide .
conference managers shrug and say , " if we started a debate about making decisions by a majority , we 'd never hear the end of it . "
eradication of bio-piracy a key issue one of the key issues at the conference has been how to achieve access to the natural resources mankind needs , and at the same time compensate poor countries , for example for the use of their unique plant species as sources of drugs .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : protests focused on the abuse of natural resources there has been some progress towards drafting a bonn " road map " on future talks about this .
such a road map would lead to a treaty being adopted by the next biodiversity conference in nagoya , japan in 2010 .
gabriel says both developing and industrialized countries will benefit from having clear ground rules about profit-sharing with the poor nations .
nature reserve network plan under fire meanwhile , the idea of creating a world network of nature reserves on land and under the sea has caused antagonism .
sources in the delegations say there is little prospect of any deal .
environmentalist group greenpeace alleges that the industrialized world is not sufficiently willing to foot the bill .
developing nations say they can not afford to create reserves alone .

" there are going to be harsh consequences " if allegations that deutsche telekom spied on company officials and journalists by monitoring phone traffic between them in order to uncover the source of information leaks are true , said ceo rene obermann in a statement published in the german mass circulation bild zeitung on monday , may 26 .
" this is a breach of our data privacy laws .
cases of misconduct must be clarified , " said obermann , who assured telekom customers that their phone records would remain confidential .
" the billing records of our millions of fixed-line and mobile customers remain secure , " he said , adding that he has faith in telekom 's 240,000 employees .
the alleged misconduct took place over the course of more than a year in 2005-2006 under obermann 's predecessor kai-uwe ricke , who was ousted at a time of diminishing profits and management disputes .
" earth-shattering " ricke and klaus zumwinkel , who was head of the telecom giant 's supervisory board at the time , both denied commissioning the analysis of the data , which recorded the numbers dialed and the time and the duration of phone calls . obermann was head of the mobile division of deutsche telekom at the time .
hundreds of thousands of phone calls made by top management and supervisory board members were monitored , but not tapped , according to newsmagazine " der spiegel . "
a private berlin agency has been analyzing the data .
numerous phone calls out of new york were also monitored , " der spiegel " reported .

it should also boost employment in the region . the express mail delivery and logistics company dhl , which is a division of germany 's postal giant deutsche post ag , inaugurated its principle european hub at leipzig-halle airport in eastern germany on monday , may 26 .
in 2004 , deutsche post had already announced the planned move from brussels to leipzig , since the belgian capital refused to permit additional nighttime flights .
dhl added that besides being able to operate around the clock in leipzig , the central european location was ideal as a hub for emerging markets in eastern europe and asia .
" demand for express services is growing worldwide , " said the new ceo of the post ag parent company , frank appel at the opening ceremony attended by prominent politicians , such as german foreign minister frank-walter steinmeier .
" this is a day to be proud of .
we are looking towards the future , " he said .
georg milbradt , the state premier of saxony , where leipzig is the capital , hailed the move as a " job motor " which will help boost the economy in the eastern states , which have higher unemployment rates than in the west .
at present dhl already operates flights to the middle east and india from leipzig-halle , where it plans to increase its personnel from about 2,000 to 3,500 employees by 2012 .
" with dhl here , the state of saxony will without a doubt become a central logistics point in europe , " said the state 's economics minister thomas jurk .
some 300 million euros -lrb- $ 474 million -rrb- have already been invested in the new hub , which has an air freight turnover of 1,500 tons a day .
about 60 freight aircraft bearing the dhl logo take off and land in leipzig per day .
worldwide , dhl flies to nearly 50 destinations , of which leipzig will become one of three main hubs that include wilmington , ohio in the us and hong kong .
not everyone was happy about the new hub however .
dozens of local residents staged a protest at the inauguration over the potential increase in noise levels at night .
" we will only fly when necessary , " said appel .
a hearing on night time flights will be held in the federal courts in leipzig on july 15 . dw staff -lrb- df -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

the peaceful beliefs of ahmadis , who can be found in small numbers in germany , are seen as heretical by most muslims . it 's been 100 years since mirza ghulam ahmad founded the ahmadiyya muslim faith .
the controversial indian religious figure claimed to be the promised messiah awaited by all the major religions , whether christian , buddhist jewish or muslim .
his followers believed that within 300 years most of the world will join the islamic brotherhood , which will usher in an era of peace .
that goal implies worldwide missionary work , which has lead ahmadis , as the members of the ahmidiyya community call themselves , to proselitize the world .
they 've even ended up in the unlikely berlin neighborhood of pankow-heinersdorf .
with a new mosque under construction and 100th anniversary parties planned , mirza masroor ahmad will travel to berlin on tuesday , may 27 .
for his followers , the caliph is for followers a representative of the promised messiah .
he is democratically elected by the council of the ahmadiyyas and serves for life .
misunderstandings persist the title of " caliph " has been misunderstood by many in the west , said islamic scholar stephan rosiny .
a caliph is the political head of state in an islamic community .
while the practice of the worldly and spiritual leadership being united in the person of the caliph has its origins in the middle ages , modern islamists have used the idea as well .
a recent example was the so-called caliph of cologne , metin kaplan , who , until his movement was outlawed in 2001 dreamed of starting an islamic regime in europe .
“ to equate the ahmadis with something like that is pure sensationalism , ” rosiny said .
rosiny sees a perception problem due to people in the west viewing radical forms of islam as the norm rather than an exception .
rosiny said that islamic beliefs need to be taken in context .
caliph means successor and “ jihad ” for the ahmidiyya movement , as for most muslims , does not mean holy war but rather a struggle to improve oneself or society .
a peaceful movement the ahmadiyya movement stresses the peaceful aspects of islam .
it condemns islamist violence and spoke out against the fatwa against author salman rushdie for his novel “ the satanic verses . ”
“ love for all , hate for none ” is their motto .
yet the ahmidiyya movement is considered heretical by mainstream islam .
for most muslims , mohammed is the last and most important prophet , while ahmadis believe that he was followed by others .
that has won the movement enemies .
in 1974 , pakistan declared followers not to be muslims and legitimized violence against them .
the caliph moved to london .
long history of missionary work the group has been preaching in germany since the weimar republic .
in berlin 's wilmersdorf neighbourhood the splinter group called the lahore ahmadiyya movement opened a mosque in the 1920s .
it is an architectural gem which remains germany 's oldest mosque .
since the beginning of the systematic persecution in pakistan , many pakistani ahmadiyyas came as asylum seekers to germany .
worldwide there are between 10 and 80 million ahmadiyyas .
in pankow-heinersdorf in the northern part of berlin there are almost no muslims , much less ahmadis .
the neighbourhood was chosen for the 100th anniversary celebrations because the group 's first mosque in eastern germany is being built here .
the shell has just been completed after a long and vehement opposition from some of the public .
there were demonstrations and initiatives against the construction .
later , a truck parked at the construction site was burned , police believe it was arson .

in berlin 's wilmersdorf neighbourhood the splinter group called the lahore ahmadiyya movement opened a mosque in the 1920s .
it is an architectural gem which remains germany 's oldest mosque .
since the beginning of the systematic persecution in pakistan , many pakistani ahmadiyyas came as asylum seekers to germany .
worldwide there are between 10 and 80 million ahmadiyyas .
in pankow-heinersdorf in the northern part of berlin there are almost no muslims , much less ahmadis .
the neighbourhood was chosen for the 100th anniversary celebrations because the group 's first mosque in eastern germany is being built here .
the shell has just been completed after a long and vehement opposition from some of the public .
there were demonstrations and initiatives against the construction .
later , a truck parked at the construction site was burned , police believe it was arson .
“ i can understand the fear the people have , ” said abdullah wagishauser , a german convert , has been head of the group in germany since 1984 .
“ there is a fundamental distrust about islam . ”
wanting to be neighborly but his experience with other mosque projects is that dialogue and information can overcome this antagonism .
“ after one of two years we always have a fully normal neighbourly relationship , ” he said .
in the meantime they have tried to smooth things over with their neighbors .
in august the mosque will be opened and the first muslim will move into the area .
he wo n't be a missionary , but rather the mosque 's imam . oliver samson -lrb- th -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

the peaceful beliefs of ahmadis , who can be found in small numbers in germany , are seen as heretical by most muslims . it 's been 100 years since mirza ghulam ahmad founded the ahmadiyya muslim faith .
the controversial indian religious figure claimed to be the promised messiah awaited by all the major religions , whether christian , buddhist jewish or muslim .
his followers believed that within 300 years most of the world will join the islamic brotherhood , which will usher in an era of peace .
that goal implies worldwide missionary work , which has lead ahmadis , as the members of the ahmidiyya community call themselves , to proselitize the world .
they 've even ended up in the unlikely berlin neighborhood of pankow-heinersdorf .
with a new mosque under construction and 100th anniversary parties planned , mirza masroor ahmad will travel to berlin on tuesday , may 27 .
for his followers , the caliph is for followers a representative of the promised messiah .
he is democratically elected by the council of the ahmadiyyas and serves for life .
misunderstandings persist the title of " caliph " has been misunderstood by many in the west , said islamic scholar stephan rosiny .
a caliph is the political head of state in an islamic community .
while the practice of the worldly and spiritual leadership being united in the person of the caliph has its origins in the middle ages , modern islamists have used the idea as well .
a recent example was the so-called caliph of cologne , metin kaplan , who , until his movement was outlawed in 2001 dreamed of starting an islamic regime in europe .
“ to equate the ahmadis with something like that is pure sensationalism , ” rosiny said .
rosiny sees a perception problem due to people in the west viewing radical forms of islam as the norm rather than an exception .
rosiny said that islamic beliefs need to be taken in context .
caliph means successor and “ jihad ” for the ahmidiyya movement , as for most muslims , does not mean holy war but rather a struggle to improve oneself or society .
a peaceful movement the ahmadiyya movement stresses the peaceful aspects of islam .
it condemns islamist violence and spoke out against the fatwa against author salman rushdie for his novel “ the satanic verses . ”
“ love for all , hate for none ” is their motto .
yet the ahmidiyya movement is considered heretical by mainstream islam .
for most muslims , mohammed is the last and most important prophet , while ahmadis believe that he was followed by others .
that has won the movement enemies .
in 1974 , pakistan declared followers not to be muslims and legitimized violence against them .
the caliph moved to london .
long history of missionary work the group has been preaching in germany since the weimar republic .
in berlin 's wilmersdorf neighbourhood the splinter group called the lahore ahmadiyya movement opened a mosque in the 1920s .
it is an architectural gem which remains germany 's oldest mosque .
since the beginning of the systematic persecution in pakistan , many pakistani ahmadiyyas came as asylum seekers to germany .
worldwide there are between 10 and 80 million ahmadiyyas .
in pankow-heinersdorf in the northern part of berlin there are almost no muslims , much less ahmadis .
the neighbourhood was chosen for the 100th anniversary celebrations because the group 's first mosque in eastern germany is being built here .
the shell has just been completed after a long and vehement opposition from some of the public .
there were demonstrations and initiatives against the construction .
later , a truck parked at the construction site was burned , police believe it was arson .
“ i can understand the fear the people have , ” said abdullah wagishauser , a german convert , has been head of the group in germany since 1984 .
“ there is a fundamental distrust about islam . ”
wanting to be neighborly but his experience with other mosque projects is that dialogue and information can overcome this antagonism .
“ after one of two years we always have a fully normal neighbourly relationship , ” he said .
in the meantime they have tried to smooth things over with their neighbors .
in august the mosque will be opened and the first muslim will move into the area .
he wo n't be a missionary , but rather the mosque 's imam . oliver samson -lrb- th -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de in focus : dossier : preserving biodiversity biodiversity conference ends with mixed results merkel warns of extinction threat to life on earth merkel pledges funds at un biodiversity talks biodiversity loss can dent world economy , study warns environment -pipe- 26.05.2008 progress at mid-way point for un biodiversity conference großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : delegates at the un biodiversity conference are trying to find a balance in their debates halfway through a two-week conference in germany on biodiversity , enough progress has been made to avoid total failure , but much more remains to be done at the un event . more than 6,000 delegates from 200 nations have debated and pored over tons of conference papers .
after a week , they have isolated key issues splitting the ninth conference of the parties to the convention on biological diversity -lrb- cbd -rrb- that runs until may 30 .
on sunday , may 25 , they were told to forget weekend-break plans and attend extra sessions summoned by the chairman of the mammoth conference , german environment minister sigmar gabriel .
the delegates must find a way to preserve biological diversity on the planet .
despite a minimum of progress , decisive action to halt the global destruction of virgin natural sites like rain forests and to prevent the extinction of flora and fauna has not yet been agreed upon .
the talks have prompted greater public awareness and concern about the exploitation of natural resources for the profit of the few .
gabriel says the sheer survival of billions of people may depend on this meeting 's resolutions , and that most government officials have praised the " constructive " atmosphere in the debates .
that should move the talks forward , said gabriel , whose role as chairman has been important in setting the fast pace .
praise heaped on german hosts bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : gabriel and his colleagues have been praised for their work ahmed djoghlaf , chief of the un convention secretariat , has been unstinting in his praise of the germans and gabriel for their no-nonsense management of the negotiations .
it is a gargantuan task getting so many nations to agree .
like the un climate-change convention , the pact on biodiversity requires " consensus " decision-making by the 191 parties under the aegis of the united nations .
it takes only one nay-sayer to torpedo any agreement , so conflicting national interests must be balanced up .
there have been critics in bonn quietly suggesting that such a decision-making method is impossibly unwieldy , but no one openly proposes the alternative : voting and letting a majority decide .
conference managers shrug and say , " if we started a debate about making decisions by a majority , we 'd never hear the end of it . "
eradication of bio-piracy a key issue one of the key issues at the conference has been how to achieve access to the natural resources mankind needs , and at the same time compensate poor countries , for example for the use of their unique plant species as sources of drugs .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : protests focused on the abuse of natural resources there has been some progress towards drafting a bonn " road map " on future talks about this .
such a road map would lead to a treaty being adopted by the next biodiversity conference in nagoya , japan in 2010 .
gabriel says both developing and industrialized countries will benefit from having clear ground rules about profit-sharing with the poor nations .
nature reserve network plan under fire meanwhile , the idea of creating a world network of nature reserves on land and under the sea has caused antagonism .
sources in the delegations say there is little prospect of any deal .
environmentalist group greenpeace alleges that the industrialized world is not sufficiently willing to foot the bill .
developing nations say they can not afford to create reserves alone .
as a solution , gabriel has proposed a " life web , " in which poorer nations would offer specific tracts for adoption and rich nations would post the money to convert them to reserves .
some cash offers have already been made in bonn .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the price of bio-fuels on the environment is a key issue the environmental harm done by bio-fuel plantations has been a point of controversy , as had been expected .
gabriel describes the bonn meet as the first international conference to debate the emerging problem .
" that in itself is a success and a breakthrough , " he said .
brazil was the loudest of those who questioned whether the conference had any authority to discuss the topic , arguing that it was not within the ambit of a biodiversity convention .
in the end , brazil , which grows ethanol crops , agreed to the debate , but insisted it must not be pilloried as an offender .
delegates agreed that ecological guidelines should be drafted to demonstrate how bio-energy crops can be grown beneficially .
protestors target bio-fuels environmentalists have homed in on the bio-fuel trade as a target , and demanded the crops be banned .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : critics say bio-fuels add to the global food crisis the critics say the plantations wipe out forests , destroy plants which are useful in other ways and deny food output to the hungry .
the tempo of the talks is set to pick up this week with the end in sight and well over 100 environment ministers from the different countries set to arrive and head the delegations in the top-level phase from wednesday until friday .
environmentalists are hoping chancellor angela merkel , a former environment minister herself , will galvanize the talks when she speaks at the bonn meeting , perhaps with a ringing appeal for action or with a surprise pledge of funds . dw staff / dpa -lrb- nda -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

after a week , they have isolated key issues splitting the ninth conference of the parties to the convention on biological diversity -lrb- cbd -rrb- that runs until may 30 .
on sunday , may 25 , they were told to forget weekend-break plans and attend extra sessions summoned by the chairman of the mammoth conference , german environment minister sigmar gabriel .
the delegates must find a way to preserve biological diversity on the planet .
despite a minimum of progress , decisive action to halt the global destruction of virgin natural sites like rain forests and to prevent the extinction of flora and fauna has not yet been agreed upon .
the talks have prompted greater public awareness and concern about the exploitation of natural resources for the profit of the few .
gabriel says the sheer survival of billions of people may depend on this meeting 's resolutions , and that most government officials have praised the " constructive " atmosphere in the debates .

like the un climate-change convention , the pact on biodiversity requires " consensus " decision-making by the 191 parties under the aegis of the united nations .
it takes only one nay-sayer to torpedo any agreement , so conflicting national interests must be balanced up .
there have been critics in bonn quietly suggesting that such a decision-making method is impossibly unwieldy , but no one openly proposes the alternative : voting and letting a majority decide .
conference managers shrug and say , " if we started a debate about making decisions by a majority , we 'd never hear the end of it . "

such a road map would lead to a treaty being adopted by the next biodiversity conference in nagoya , japan in 2010 .
gabriel says both developing and industrialized countries will benefit from having clear ground rules about profit-sharing with the poor nations .
nature reserve network plan under fire meanwhile , the idea of creating a world network of nature reserves on land and under the sea has caused antagonism .
sources in the delegations say there is little prospect of any deal .
environmentalist group greenpeace alleges that the industrialized world is not sufficiently willing to foot the bill .
developing nations say they can not afford to create reserves alone .
as a solution , gabriel has proposed a " life web , " in which poorer nations would offer specific tracts for adoption and rich nations would post the money to convert them to reserves .
some cash offers have already been made in bonn .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the price of bio-fuels on the environment is a key issue the environmental harm done by bio-fuel plantations has been a point of controversy , as had been expected .

brazil was the loudest of those who questioned whether the conference had any authority to discuss the topic , arguing that it was not within the ambit of a biodiversity convention .

after a week , they have isolated key issues splitting the ninth conference of the parties to the convention on biological diversity -lrb- cbd -rrb- that runs until may 30 .
on sunday , may 25 , they were told to forget weekend-break plans and attend extra sessions summoned by the chairman of the mammoth conference , german environment minister sigmar gabriel .
the delegates must find a way to preserve biological diversity on the planet .
despite a minimum of progress , decisive action to halt the global destruction of virgin natural sites like rain forests and to prevent the extinction of flora and fauna has not yet been agreed upon .
the talks have prompted greater public awareness and concern about the exploitation of natural resources for the profit of the few .
gabriel says the sheer survival of billions of people may depend on this meeting 's resolutions , and that most government officials have praised the " constructive " atmosphere in the debates .
that should move the talks forward , said gabriel , whose role as chairman has been important in setting the fast pace .
praise heaped on german hosts bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : gabriel and his colleagues have been praised for their work ahmed djoghlaf , chief of the un convention secretariat , has been unstinting in his praise of the germans and gabriel for their no-nonsense management of the negotiations .
it is a gargantuan task getting so many nations to agree .
like the un climate-change convention , the pact on biodiversity requires " consensus " decision-making by the 191 parties under the aegis of the united nations .
it takes only one nay-sayer to torpedo any agreement , so conflicting national interests must be balanced up .
there have been critics in bonn quietly suggesting that such a decision-making method is impossibly unwieldy , but no one openly proposes the alternative : voting and letting a majority decide .
conference managers shrug and say , " if we started a debate about making decisions by a majority , we 'd never hear the end of it . "
eradication of bio-piracy a key issue one of the key issues at the conference has been how to achieve access to the natural resources mankind needs , and at the same time compensate poor countries , for example for the use of their unique plant species as sources of drugs .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : protests focused on the abuse of natural resources there has been some progress towards drafting a bonn " road map " on future talks about this .
such a road map would lead to a treaty being adopted by the next biodiversity conference in nagoya , japan in 2010 .
gabriel says both developing and industrialized countries will benefit from having clear ground rules about profit-sharing with the poor nations .
nature reserve network plan under fire meanwhile , the idea of creating a world network of nature reserves on land and under the sea has caused antagonism .
sources in the delegations say there is little prospect of any deal .
environmentalist group greenpeace alleges that the industrialized world is not sufficiently willing to foot the bill .
developing nations say they can not afford to create reserves alone .
as a solution , gabriel has proposed a " life web , " in which poorer nations would offer specific tracts for adoption and rich nations would post the money to convert them to reserves .
some cash offers have already been made in bonn .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the price of bio-fuels on the environment is a key issue the environmental harm done by bio-fuel plantations has been a point of controversy , as had been expected .
gabriel describes the bonn meet as the first international conference to debate the emerging problem .
" that in itself is a success and a breakthrough , " he said .
brazil was the loudest of those who questioned whether the conference had any authority to discuss the topic , arguing that it was not within the ambit of a biodiversity convention .
in the end , brazil , which grows ethanol crops , agreed to the debate , but insisted it must not be pilloried as an offender .
delegates agreed that ecological guidelines should be drafted to demonstrate how bio-energy crops can be grown beneficially .
protestors target bio-fuels environmentalists have homed in on the bio-fuel trade as a target , and demanded the crops be banned .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : critics say bio-fuels add to the global food crisis the critics say the plantations wipe out forests , destroy plants which are useful in other ways and deny food output to the hungry .
the tempo of the talks is set to pick up this week with the end in sight and well over 100 environment ministers from the different countries set to arrive and head the delegations in the top-level phase from wednesday until friday .
environmentalists are hoping chancellor angela merkel , a former environment minister herself , will galvanize the talks when she speaks at the bonn meeting , perhaps with a ringing appeal for action or with a surprise pledge of funds . dw staff / dpa -lrb- nda -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

the last time france emerged from the festival with top honors was more than two decades ago . the jury president , us actor and director sean penn , was expected to favor a social or political film , and it came as a surprise that israeli ari folman 's groundbreaking animated documentary " waltz with bashir " went unrecognized .
using innovative techniques to retell events surrounding the sabra and shatila massacres in 1982 , the film was considered a contender for the top prize . penn had told a french newspaper ahead of the competition that cannes ' duty was to " do just the opposite " of the oscars and to honor a ground-breaking , unconventional picture . french film tackles hot political topic bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : cantet , right , accepted the award with his " class " screened during the final days of the competition , " the class " -lrb- " entre les murs " -rrb- is a docu-drama with real teachers and students playing the roles in a tough french school .
the young cast of joined cantet on stage to accept the palme d 'or , a moment the director described as deeply moving . based on an autobiographical novel by francois begaudeau , a young french teacher , genet , turns the classroom portrayed in the movie into a microcosm of contemporary france .
begaudeau also plays the role of a dedicated but sometimes flawed teacher in the movie . it was a subject that " interests the whole world , " said cantet at a press conference .
" people have the same issues , whichever country they are in . " the film has been praised for its realistic approach and its exploration of universal issues like race , individuality and truth . the last french film to walk away with the palme d 'or for best film at cannes - in 1987 - was maurice pialat 's " under the sun of satan , " a melodrama about a 16-year-old girl who kills her lover and the priest to whom she confesses the crime . italy scores double bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : israel 's animated documentary was expected to do better italian directors also scored top awards at this year 's cannes festival , with the nation 's two movies that were entered in the main competition both winning key prizes . while paolo sorrentino was awarded the jury prize for his political satire about italy 's seven-time prime minister giulio andreotti , matteo garrone 's powerful mafia expose , " gomorrah , " emerged from the festival with the grand prix . garrone was applauded for his courage in looking at a touchy subject , particularly since the author of the bestselling book the film is based on has been living under police protection for the past two years . turkey 's nuri bilge ceylan won the festival 's best director award for his brooding family drama " three monkeys " -lrb- " uc maymum " -rrb- . in accepting the prize , ceylan said he was dedicating the award " to my beautiful country , which i love passionately .

the decision is sure to cause friction within germany 's coalition government . schwan , a 65-year-old university professor , was announced on monday , may 26 , as the social democratic party 's -lrb- spd -rrb- choice for the high-profile office of german president .
schwan nearly won the post five years ago , but lost out to horst koehler , a former head of the international monetary fund .
koehler has the support of chancellor angela merkel 's christian democratic union -lrb- cdu -rrb- , who wants to see him serve a second five-year term .
members of the cdu and its bavarian sister party , the christian social union -lrb- csu -rrb- , were upset to hear that the spd would put forth its own candidate .
the parties form a left-right coalition together .
chancellor merkel expressed her anger about the decision of her coalition partners to nominate their own candidate . " we have a president who is respected around the world , " merkel said .
" so it is regrettable that the social democrats have put up their own candidate in this step that can only be explained by the internal state of the party . ” schwan 's candidacy runs counter to a longstanding tradition observed by the two main political blocs not to put up a challenger to a president seeking a second term . " i believe that this candidacy will fail and that horst koehler will remain president , as is the wish of the majority of our citizens , " she added .
coalition will stay together bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : they do not always see eye to eye spd head hubertus heil said that he does not worry that the move will rupture the coalition ahead of federal elections , which are scheduled to take place in 2009 .
the csu also faces state elections in bavaria later this year .
" a little competition is n't going to cause any harm to a functioning democracy , " heil said .
" the csu is nervous ahead of the state elections in september .
i urge them just to relax . "
spd leader kurt beck said that his party would not " campaign against the incumbent . "
" in a democracy , we view a rival candidacy as a good opportunity for a broad discussion of the issues , " beck said monday .
merkel 's spokesman ulrich wilhelm also rejected any suggestion of the coalition breaking apart at a news conference .
" the chancellor has made it clear that the spd decision puts a strain on the coalition but that she , as well as the chairmen of the spd and csu , remains interested in carrying on the work on policies in the best interests of germany , " wilhelm said .
secret vote bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : koehler wants another five years schwan narrowly lost to koehler in 2004 when the cdu and free democrats -lrb- fdp -rrb- had a majority in the federal assembly , which is made up of members of parliament and delegates from each of germany 's 16 federal states .
the vote for president is done by secret ballot , meaning any federal assembly member can vote for any candidate .
the assembly meets every five years to elect a president .
the assembly vote for president will take place in may of 2009 .
political analysts say that center-left parties could have enough votes to elect schwan .
while the spd has refused to enter into a coalition with the left party in forming a government , it would presumably rely on the left and the greens to elect schwan . dw staff -lrb- th -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

schwan nearly won the post five years ago , but lost out to horst koehler , a former head of the international monetary fund .
koehler has the support of chancellor angela merkel 's christian democratic union -lrb- cdu -rrb- , who wants to see him serve a second five-year term .
members of the cdu and its bavarian sister party , the christian social union -lrb- csu -rrb- , were upset to hear that the spd would put forth its own candidate .
the parties form a left-right coalition together .
chancellor merkel expressed her anger about the decision of her coalition partners to nominate their own candidate . " we have a president who is respected around the world , " merkel said .
" so it is regrettable that the social democrats have put up their own candidate in this step that can only be explained by the internal state of the party . ” schwan 's candidacy runs counter to a longstanding tradition observed by the two main political blocs not to put up a challenger to a president seeking a second term . " i believe that this candidacy will fail and that horst koehler will remain president , as is the wish of the majority of our citizens , " she added .
coalition will stay together bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : they do not always see eye to eye spd head hubertus heil said that he does not worry that the move will rupture the coalition ahead of federal elections , which are scheduled to take place in 2009 .
the csu also faces state elections in bavaria later this year .
" a little competition is n't going to cause any harm to a functioning democracy , " heil said .
" the csu is nervous ahead of the state elections in september .
i urge them just to relax . "
spd leader kurt beck said that his party would not " campaign against the incumbent . "
" in a democracy , we view a rival candidacy as a good opportunity for a broad discussion of the issues , " beck said monday .
merkel 's spokesman ulrich wilhelm also rejected any suggestion of the coalition breaking apart at a news conference .
" the chancellor has made it clear that the spd decision puts a strain on the coalition but that she , as well as the chairmen of the spd and csu , remains interested in carrying on the work on policies in the best interests of germany , " wilhelm said .
secret vote bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : koehler wants another five years schwan narrowly lost to koehler in 2004 when the cdu and free democrats -lrb- fdp -rrb- had a majority in the federal assembly , which is made up of members of parliament and delegates from each of germany 's 16 federal states .
the vote for president is done by secret ballot , meaning any federal assembly member can vote for any candidate .
the assembly meets every five years to elect a president .
the assembly vote for president will take place in may of 2009 .
political analysts say that center-left parties could have enough votes to elect schwan .

the decision is sure to cause friction within germany 's coalition government . schwan , a 65-year-old university professor , was announced on monday , may 26 , as the social democratic party 's -lrb- spd -rrb- choice for the high-profile office of german president .
schwan nearly won the post five years ago , but lost out to horst koehler , a former head of the international monetary fund .
koehler has the support of chancellor angela merkel 's christian democratic union -lrb- cdu -rrb- , who wants to see him serve a second five-year term .
members of the cdu and its bavarian sister party , the christian social union -lrb- csu -rrb- , were upset to hear that the spd would put forth its own candidate .
the parties form a left-right coalition together .
chancellor merkel expressed her anger about the decision of her coalition partners to nominate their own candidate . " we have a president who is respected around the world , " merkel said .
" so it is regrettable that the social democrats have put up their own candidate in this step that can only be explained by the internal state of the party . ” schwan 's candidacy runs counter to a longstanding tradition observed by the two main political blocs not to put up a challenger to a president seeking a second term . " i believe that this candidacy will fail and that horst koehler will remain president , as is the wish of the majority of our citizens , " she added .
coalition will stay together bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : they do not always see eye to eye spd head hubertus heil said that he does not worry that the move will rupture the coalition ahead of federal elections , which are scheduled to take place in 2009 .
the csu also faces state elections in bavaria later this year .
" a little competition is n't going to cause any harm to a functioning democracy , " heil said .
" the csu is nervous ahead of the state elections in september .
i urge them just to relax . "
spd leader kurt beck said that his party would not " campaign against the incumbent . "
" in a democracy , we view a rival candidacy as a good opportunity for a broad discussion of the issues , " beck said monday .
merkel 's spokesman ulrich wilhelm also rejected any suggestion of the coalition breaking apart at a news conference .
" the chancellor has made it clear that the spd decision puts a strain on the coalition but that she , as well as the chairmen of the spd and csu , remains interested in carrying on the work on policies in the best interests of germany , " wilhelm said .
secret vote bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : koehler wants another five years schwan narrowly lost to koehler in 2004 when the cdu and free democrats -lrb- fdp -rrb- had a majority in the federal assembly , which is made up of members of parliament and delegates from each of germany 's 16 federal states .
the vote for president is done by secret ballot , meaning any federal assembly member can vote for any candidate .
the assembly meets every five years to elect a president .
the assembly vote for president will take place in may of 2009 .
political analysts say that center-left parties could have enough votes to elect schwan .
while the spd has refused to enter into a coalition with the left party in forming a government , it would presumably rely on the left and the greens to elect schwan . dw staff -lrb- th -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

it is intended to replace the current partnership and cooperation agreement -lrb- pca -rrb- , which ran out in 2007 , and should include legally-binding measures on such issues as energy , security , trade and education . negotiations are to be formally launched in siberia on june 26-27 , when new president dmitry medvedev will represent russia for the first time .
they were only made possible after lithuania , the last eu member to block the talks , was assured that its concerns about energy supply and moscow 's stance on georgia would be addressed . officials in brussels predict complex negotiations with moscow are likely to last about a year , with a further year required for its ratification by eu member states and russia . eu ministers also listened to polish plans for strengthening ties with ukraine , moldova , georgia , armenia , azerbaijan and , eventually , belarus . supported by sweden and blessed by heavyweights france and germany , the so-called eastern partnership comes on the back of french plans to boost the eu 's ties with its southern neighbors in a union for the mediterranean . visa-free travel in sight according to a text seen by german news agency dpa , the proposed eastern partnership would seek to deepen cooperation and focus on concrete proposals in the area of migration , with an eye to moving towards a visa-free regime . it would also seek to create a free trade area , provide support for reforms designed to bring those countries up to eu standards , and arrange more student exchange programs . the partnership would use existing neighborhood funds and would have an institutional structure that is " as light-weight and goal-oriented as possible . " human rights , a frequent bone of contention under russia 's former president vladimir putin , and energy supply are also likely to become major topics of discussion . benita ferrero-waldner , the commissioner in charge of the eu 's external relations , said the eu executive would only support the plan if it provided " added value " and did not duplicate existing eu policies . " the negotiation will certainly not be easy … i think they will take quite some time , " she said . poland advocates eastern focus polish and swedish diplomats say the partnership will encourage " multilateral cooperation " and " foster regional links . " cooperation with belarus , whose democratic credentials have been thrown into question , would initially take place only on a " technical and expert level . " the polish-swedish plan was welcomed by the czech republic , which is due to take over the rotating presidency of the eu on jan .
1 . france , which launched the idea of the mediterranean union , is due to hold the eu presidency from july 1 this year . " this year is the mediterranean year , next year would be the eastern year , " said the czech deputy prime minister for european affairs , alexander vondra . kosovo handover unrealistic another major issue up for discussion in brussels is the bloc 's eu-lex law mission in kosovo . the mission was originally meant to take over the administration of the newly independent country from the united nations on june 15 . but eu officials now concede that legal and logistical difficulties mean that the deadline is unrealistic .

it is intended to replace the current partnership and cooperation agreement -lrb- pca -rrb- , which ran out in 2007 , and should include legally-binding measures on such issues as energy , security , trade and education . negotiations are to be formally launched in siberia on june 26-27 , when new president dmitry medvedev will represent russia for the first time .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de civil rights -pipe- 26.05.2008 memorial for gays persecuted by nazis opens in berlin großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the memorial and its creators german politicians will dedicate a memorial in berlin this week to the tens of thousands of homosexuals persecuted during the nazi regime .
gay activists say the memorial is long overdue . seventy-five years ago nazis launched a series of raids and public book burnings aimed at homosexuals .
it was the start of adolf hitler ’ s crusade against homosexuality which saw an unknown number of gays arrested , tortured and murdered by the nazis .
the subject of nazi persecution of homosexuals has long been swept under the carpet .
yet a new memorial which opens tuesday , may 27 , will bring the past persecution and ongoing struggles of homosexuals to be accepted in society to the heart of the german capital .
showing a forbidden kiss bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the memorial will be officially unveiled this week the homosexual memorial will consist of a grey rectangular block some four meters -lrb- 13 feet -rrb- tall .
one side will have a small opening through which viewers will see a black and white art film scene of two men kissing .
" a simple kiss could land you in trouble , " says the text which accompanies the memorial .
the memorial was designed by the danish-norweigan artistic duo michael elmgreen and ingar dragset .
the memorial has a prominent place in berlin 's tiergarten park , half a block from brandenburg gate .
the monument sits across from the jewish holocaust memorial .
originally it was debated whether homosexuals should be included in the larger memorial before the decision was made to give homosexuals their own monument .
but the design corresponds to the holocaust memorial 's field of steles , a series of concrete blocks of varying sizes .
while the nazi persecution of the jews is well known , for many years there was little public acknowledgement of nazi atrocities towards homosexuals .
estimates put the number of homosexuals arrested by nazis at about 54,000 with 7,000 being killed in concentration camps .
" it is not easy for a gay man to live in this country and this society .
it 's important to remember that this society punished homosexuality for 20 years after national socialism ended , " said günter dworek of the federation of gays and lesbians in germany -lrb- lsvd -rrb- , a driving force behind the project .
gays making strides bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : berlin 's mayor is gay homosexuality remained illegal in germany until 1969 and was only formally decriminalized in 1994 .
it was n't until 2000 that germany 's parliament first passed a resolution acknowledging discrimination had occurred , dworek said .
the decision to fund the memorial , which cost 450,000 euros -lrb- $ 710,000 -rrb- , happened three years later .
the city 's current mayor , social democrat klaus wowereit , announced shortly before taking office seven years ago that he is gay .
wowereit 's legendary outing has given many others courage , dworek said .
" that opened a lot of people 's eyes .
you can not simply assume that politicians who already have a career behind them , like klaus wowereit , are by nature heterosexual , " dworek said .
germany also has a law which allows same-sex couples to register their partnerships .
yet many activists would like to see more , including anti-discrimination laws .
neo-nazi violence is still a very real threat , said albert eckert , head of the gay holocaust memorial committee . " but at last we have a monument to those who suffered and died under the nazis , " eckert said .
a tribute to hirschfeld bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : it is similar in style to the holocaust memorial eckert said he was also happy that the dedication was close to the birthday and death day of magnus hirschfeld , who died in exile in southern france on may 14 , 1935 .
a jewish homosexual , hirschfeld was a medical doctor who dedicated his life to the scientific study of homosexuality and lobbied the german government to repeal laws which outlawed gay sex .
the word " transsexual " was coined by hirschfeld to describe the phenomenon that he argued was a natural extension of human sexuality .
for his work , the nazis targeted hirschfeld as an example of decadent bolshevistic / jewish influence infecting the purity of the german people , luring the aryan race into impure and destructive perversity .
his institute was ransacked and his books were burned in rallies on may 10 , 1933 .
it was n't long before gay men were being rounded up and sent to mental hospitals or concentration camps .
" we have no idea how many thousands died in concentration camps because many were also jewish or were communists .
we know that many were left in prison after the war when post-war courts upheld the nazi jail sentences against them , " eckert says .
" anyone who was gay was automatically a criminal .
this monument is for all of them . "
making an international statement bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : a kiss can be a political statement the parliament decided on december 12 , 2003 to fund the homosexual memorial .
it was a nice birthday present for the green politician and well-known gay activist volker beck who turned 43 that day .
beck felt the memorial was especially important because the laws used to prosecute homosexuals continued long after the nazis had been defeated .
and persecution still exists in many countries today , making the memorial as important as ever , beck said .
he cites 80 countries which criminalize homosexual acts between consenting adults and 12 where the death penalty can be handed down .
beck believes germany 's memorial " sends an important signal that in this country , where in the past -lsb- homosexuals -rsb- were also systematically persecuted , we now have constructed a symbol against this human rights violation . " but homosexuals are still not fully accepted in society , beck said .
he worries about the refusal of some conservative christians and muslims to accept homosexuality .
beck said he does n't have any problem with the memorial 's design , which has come under criticism , particularly from women .
the first scene will portray men kissing , but later it will show women .
dworek said he is " downright happy " with the memorial 's design and likes the idea that the kissing scene will switch every two years .
" this will keep the memorial fresh .
there is always be something new , " dworek said .
" it will be a dynamic memorial . " dw staff -lrb- th -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

it 's important to remember that this society punished homosexuality for 20 years after national socialism ended , " said günter dworek of the federation of gays and lesbians in germany -lrb- lsvd -rrb- , a driving force behind the project .
gays making strides bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : berlin 's mayor is gay homosexuality remained illegal in germany until 1969 and was only formally decriminalized in 1994 .
it was n't until 2000 that germany 's parliament first passed a resolution acknowledging discrimination had occurred , dworek said .
the decision to fund the memorial , which cost 450,000 euros -lrb- $ 710,000 -rrb- , happened three years later .
the city 's current mayor , social democrat klaus wowereit , announced shortly before taking office seven years ago that he is gay .
wowereit 's legendary outing has given many others courage , dworek said .
" that opened a lot of people 's eyes .
you can not simply assume that politicians who already have a career behind them , like klaus wowereit , are by nature heterosexual , " dworek said .
germany also has a law which allows same-sex couples to register their partnerships .
yet many activists would like to see more , including anti-discrimination laws .
neo-nazi violence is still a very real threat , said albert eckert , head of the gay holocaust memorial committee . " but at last we have a monument to those who suffered and died under the nazis , " eckert said .
a tribute to hirschfeld bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : it is similar in style to the holocaust memorial eckert said he was also happy that the dedication was close to the birthday and death day of magnus hirschfeld , who died in exile in southern france on may 14 , 1935 .
a jewish homosexual , hirschfeld was a medical doctor who dedicated his life to the scientific study of homosexuality and lobbied the german government to repeal laws which outlawed gay sex .
the word " transsexual " was coined by hirschfeld to describe the phenomenon that he argued was a natural extension of human sexuality .
for his work , the nazis targeted hirschfeld as an example of decadent bolshevistic / jewish influence infecting the purity of the german people , luring the aryan race into impure and destructive perversity .
his institute was ransacked and his books were burned in rallies on may 10 , 1933 .
it was n't long before gay men were being rounded up and sent to mental hospitals or concentration camps .
" we have no idea how many thousands died in concentration camps because many were also jewish or were communists .
we know that many were left in prison after the war when post-war courts upheld the nazi jail sentences against them , " eckert says .
" anyone who was gay was automatically a criminal .
this monument is for all of them . "
making an international statement bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : a kiss can be a political statement the parliament decided on december 12 , 2003 to fund the homosexual memorial .
it was a nice birthday present for the green politician and well-known gay activist volker beck who turned 43 that day .
beck felt the memorial was especially important because the laws used to prosecute homosexuals continued long after the nazis had been defeated .
and persecution still exists in many countries today , making the memorial as important as ever , beck said .
he cites 80 countries which criminalize homosexual acts between consenting adults and 12 where the death penalty can be handed down .
beck believes germany 's memorial " sends an important signal that in this country , where in the past -lsb- homosexuals -rsb- were also systematically persecuted , we now have constructed a symbol against this human rights violation . " but homosexuals are still not fully accepted in society , beck said .
he worries about the refusal of some conservative christians and muslims to accept homosexuality .
beck said he does n't have any problem with the memorial 's design , which has come under criticism , particularly from women .
the first scene will portray men kissing , but later it will show women .
dworek said he is " downright happy " with the memorial 's design and likes the idea that the kissing scene will switch every two years .

gay activists say the memorial is long overdue . seventy-five years ago nazis launched a series of raids and public book burnings aimed at homosexuals .
it was the start of adolf hitler ’ s crusade against homosexuality which saw an unknown number of gays arrested , tortured and murdered by the nazis .
the subject of nazi persecution of homosexuals has long been swept under the carpet .
yet a new memorial which opens tuesday , may 27 , will bring the past persecution and ongoing struggles of homosexuals to be accepted in society to the heart of the german capital .
showing a forbidden kiss bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the memorial will be officially unveiled this week the homosexual memorial will consist of a grey rectangular block some four meters -lrb- 13 feet -rrb- tall .
one side will have a small opening through which viewers will see a black and white art film scene of two men kissing .
" a simple kiss could land you in trouble , " says the text which accompanies the memorial .
the memorial was designed by the danish-norweigan artistic duo michael elmgreen and ingar dragset .
the memorial has a prominent place in berlin 's tiergarten park , half a block from brandenburg gate .
the monument sits across from the jewish holocaust memorial .
originally it was debated whether homosexuals should be included in the larger memorial before the decision was made to give homosexuals their own monument .
but the design corresponds to the holocaust memorial 's field of steles , a series of concrete blocks of varying sizes .
while the nazi persecution of the jews is well known , for many years there was little public acknowledgement of nazi atrocities towards homosexuals .
estimates put the number of homosexuals arrested by nazis at about 54,000 with 7,000 being killed in concentration camps .

gay activists say the memorial is long overdue . seventy-five years ago nazis launched a series of raids and public book burnings aimed at homosexuals .
it was the start of adolf hitler ’ s crusade against homosexuality which saw an unknown number of gays arrested , tortured and murdered by the nazis .
the subject of nazi persecution of homosexuals has long been swept under the carpet .
yet a new memorial which opens tuesday , may 27 , will bring the past persecution and ongoing struggles of homosexuals to be accepted in society to the heart of the german capital .
showing a forbidden kiss bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the memorial will be officially unveiled this week the homosexual memorial will consist of a grey rectangular block some four meters -lrb- 13 feet -rrb- tall .
one side will have a small opening through which viewers will see a black and white art film scene of two men kissing .
" a simple kiss could land you in trouble , " says the text which accompanies the memorial .
the memorial was designed by the danish-norweigan artistic duo michael elmgreen and ingar dragset .
the memorial has a prominent place in berlin 's tiergarten park , half a block from brandenburg gate .
the monument sits across from the jewish holocaust memorial .
originally it was debated whether homosexuals should be included in the larger memorial before the decision was made to give homosexuals their own monument .
but the design corresponds to the holocaust memorial 's field of steles , a series of concrete blocks of varying sizes .
while the nazi persecution of the jews is well known , for many years there was little public acknowledgement of nazi atrocities towards homosexuals .
estimates put the number of homosexuals arrested by nazis at about 54,000 with 7,000 being killed in concentration camps .
" it is not easy for a gay man to live in this country and this society .
it 's important to remember that this society punished homosexuality for 20 years after national socialism ended , " said günter dworek of the federation of gays and lesbians in germany -lrb- lsvd -rrb- , a driving force behind the project .
gays making strides bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : berlin 's mayor is gay homosexuality remained illegal in germany until 1969 and was only formally decriminalized in 1994 .
it was n't until 2000 that germany 's parliament first passed a resolution acknowledging discrimination had occurred , dworek said .
the decision to fund the memorial , which cost 450,000 euros -lrb- $ 710,000 -rrb- , happened three years later .
the city 's current mayor , social democrat klaus wowereit , announced shortly before taking office seven years ago that he is gay .
wowereit 's legendary outing has given many others courage , dworek said .
" that opened a lot of people 's eyes .
you can not simply assume that politicians who already have a career behind them , like klaus wowereit , are by nature heterosexual , " dworek said .
germany also has a law which allows same-sex couples to register their partnerships .
yet many activists would like to see more , including anti-discrimination laws .
neo-nazi violence is still a very real threat , said albert eckert , head of the gay holocaust memorial committee . " but at last we have a monument to those who suffered and died under the nazis , " eckert said .
a tribute to hirschfeld bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : it is similar in style to the holocaust memorial eckert said he was also happy that the dedication was close to the birthday and death day of magnus hirschfeld , who died in exile in southern france on may 14 , 1935 .
a jewish homosexual , hirschfeld was a medical doctor who dedicated his life to the scientific study of homosexuality and lobbied the german government to repeal laws which outlawed gay sex .
the word " transsexual " was coined by hirschfeld to describe the phenomenon that he argued was a natural extension of human sexuality .
for his work , the nazis targeted hirschfeld as an example of decadent bolshevistic / jewish influence infecting the purity of the german people , luring the aryan race into impure and destructive perversity .
his institute was ransacked and his books were burned in rallies on may 10 , 1933 .
it was n't long before gay men were being rounded up and sent to mental hospitals or concentration camps .
" we have no idea how many thousands died in concentration camps because many were also jewish or were communists .
we know that many were left in prison after the war when post-war courts upheld the nazi jail sentences against them , " eckert says .
" anyone who was gay was automatically a criminal .
this monument is for all of them . "
making an international statement bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : a kiss can be a political statement the parliament decided on december 12 , 2003 to fund the homosexual memorial .
it was a nice birthday present for the green politician and well-known gay activist volker beck who turned 43 that day .
beck felt the memorial was especially important because the laws used to prosecute homosexuals continued long after the nazis had been defeated .
and persecution still exists in many countries today , making the memorial as important as ever , beck said .
he cites 80 countries which criminalize homosexual acts between consenting adults and 12 where the death penalty can be handed down .
beck believes germany 's memorial " sends an important signal that in this country , where in the past -lsb- homosexuals -rsb- were also systematically persecuted , we now have constructed a symbol against this human rights violation . " but homosexuals are still not fully accepted in society , beck said .
he worries about the refusal of some conservative christians and muslims to accept homosexuality .
beck said he does n't have any problem with the memorial 's design , which has come under criticism , particularly from women .
the first scene will portray men kissing , but later it will show women .
dworek said he is " downright happy " with the memorial 's design and likes the idea that the kissing scene will switch every two years .

reyes ' death has been the biggest blow to the marxist guerrilla movement in latin america since farc , which has more than 17,000 members , was founded in the 1960s .

it should also boost employment in the region . the express mail delivery and logistics company dhl , which is a division of germany 's postal giant deutsche post ag , inaugurated its principle european hub at leipzig-halle airport in eastern germany on monday , may 26 .
in 2004 , deutsche post had already announced the planned move from brussels to leipzig , since the belgian capital refused to permit additional nighttime flights .
dhl added that besides being able to operate around the clock in leipzig , the central european location was ideal as a hub for emerging markets in eastern europe and asia .
" demand for express services is growing worldwide , " said the new ceo of the post ag parent company , frank appel at the opening ceremony attended by prominent politicians , such as german foreign minister frank-walter steinmeier .
" this is a day to be proud of .

georg milbradt , the state premier of saxony , where leipzig is the capital , hailed the move as a " job motor " which will help boost the economy in the eastern states , which have higher unemployment rates than in the west .
at present dhl already operates flights to the middle east and india from leipzig-halle , where it plans to increase its personnel from about 2,000 to 3,500 employees by 2012 .

about 60 freight aircraft bearing the dhl logo take off and land in leipzig per day .
worldwide , dhl flies to nearly 50 destinations , of which leipzig will become one of three main hubs that include wilmington , ohio in the us and hong kong .
not everyone was happy about the new hub however .

" the eu general affairs and external relations council has decided the eu should double the number of participants in the eupol mission in afghanistan , " said a statement from the slovenian presidency of the bloc .
" this measure will strengthen efforts towards police reform , " it added .
launched in june 2007 and expected to last for at least three years , the eupol mission consists of about 200 experts tasked with training afghan policemen and officials at the interior ministry .
their numbers are now expected to rise to about 400 over the next 12 months , diplomats said .

italy considering sending troops to danger zones bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : frattini said isaf requests would determine italy 's plans separately , new italian foreign minister franco frattini said his government was ready to drop some of its caveats and deploy its troops to more dangerous battle zones , as requested by nato .
" we are talking about greater geographical flexibility , " frattini said .
" we want to align italy to its other great nato partners . "
italy currently has about 2,360 soldiers in afghanistan .
but they are mainly deployed in kabul and in the less restive west of the country .
the previous centre-left government of romano prodi refused to give in to us requests for the troops to be sent to southern hotspots , where nato is fighting taliban insurgents .
germany has maintained a similar position , thus infuriating the united states , britain , canada and the netherlands , which have suffered significant casualties around the kandahar region .
new direction for italian leadership frattini did not rule out sending troops to the south , saying redeployment would depend on the requests made by nato 's international security assistance force -lrb- isaf -rrb- .
but with a political storm brewing back home , italian defence minister ignazio la russa later clarified that such redeployments would be " temporary " rather than permanent .

the peaceful beliefs of ahmadis , who can be found in small numbers in germany , are seen as heretical by most muslims . it 's been 100 years since mirza ghulam ahmad founded the ahmadiyya muslim faith .
the controversial indian religious figure claimed to be the promised messiah awaited by all the major religions , whether christian , buddhist jewish or muslim .
his followers believed that within 300 years most of the world will join the islamic brotherhood , which will usher in an era of peace .
that goal implies worldwide missionary work , which has lead ahmadis , as the members of the ahmidiyya community call themselves , to proselitize the world .
they 've even ended up in the unlikely berlin neighborhood of pankow-heinersdorf .
with a new mosque under construction and 100th anniversary parties planned , mirza masroor ahmad will travel to berlin on tuesday , may 27 .
for his followers , the caliph is for followers a representative of the promised messiah .
he is democratically elected by the council of the ahmadiyyas and serves for life .
misunderstandings persist the title of " caliph " has been misunderstood by many in the west , said islamic scholar stephan rosiny .
a caliph is the political head of state in an islamic community .
while the practice of the worldly and spiritual leadership being united in the person of the caliph has its origins in the middle ages , modern islamists have used the idea as well .
a recent example was the so-called caliph of cologne , metin kaplan , who , until his movement was outlawed in 2001 dreamed of starting an islamic regime in europe .
“ to equate the ahmadis with something like that is pure sensationalism , ” rosiny said .
rosiny sees a perception problem due to people in the west viewing radical forms of islam as the norm rather than an exception .
rosiny said that islamic beliefs need to be taken in context .
caliph means successor and “ jihad ” for the ahmidiyya movement , as for most muslims , does not mean holy war but rather a struggle to improve oneself or society .
a peaceful movement the ahmadiyya movement stresses the peaceful aspects of islam .
it condemns islamist violence and spoke out against the fatwa against author salman rushdie for his novel “ the satanic verses . ”
“ love for all , hate for none ” is their motto .
yet the ahmidiyya movement is considered heretical by mainstream islam .
for most muslims , mohammed is the last and most important prophet , while ahmadis believe that he was followed by others .
that has won the movement enemies .
in 1974 , pakistan declared followers not to be muslims and legitimized violence against them .
the caliph moved to london .
long history of missionary work the group has been preaching in germany since the weimar republic .
in berlin 's wilmersdorf neighbourhood the splinter group called the lahore ahmadiyya movement opened a mosque in the 1920s .
it is an architectural gem which remains germany 's oldest mosque .
since the beginning of the systematic persecution in pakistan , many pakistani ahmadiyyas came as asylum seekers to germany .
worldwide there are between 10 and 80 million ahmadiyyas .
in pankow-heinersdorf in the northern part of berlin there are almost no muslims , much less ahmadis .
the neighbourhood was chosen for the 100th anniversary celebrations because the group 's first mosque in eastern germany is being built here .
the shell has just been completed after a long and vehement opposition from some of the public .
there were demonstrations and initiatives against the construction .
later , a truck parked at the construction site was burned , police believe it was arson .

the bjp victory surprised many pollsters and analysts and dealt another blow to the centre-left congress party , which leads the ruling coalition government in new delhi . the bharatiya janata party won 110 of 224 seats - its first outright win in one of india 's four southern states that caps a string of recent wins in regional elections .
in the process , the bjp dealt a major blow to the congress party , which also suffered huge defeats in all three national parliament or lok sabha by-elections for which results were declared sunday .
the bjp 's prime ministerial candidate l.k. advani promptly claimed that 2008 would prove to be a year of political change for india .
a national parliamentary election is due next year .
the bjp , which tasted power for just a week in november last year before being toppled by the janata dal-secular -lrb- jd-s -rrb- , swept large parts of karnataka .
the bjp fought the contest on a three-point agenda : ' betrayal , inflation , terrorism ' .
it went hammer and tongs against the congress for failing to check soaring food prices - and the idea clicked .
anti-incumbency vote the party ’ s general secretary arun jaitley who has been described as the architect behind the victory says : " a large part of our campaign was against the central government .
one part of our campaign was against the politics of opportunism where the losers of the last elections , the congress and the janata dal -lrb- secular -rrb- tried to form the government . "
the congress , which conceded defeat said the result would not impact national politics .
the party ’ s general secretary , kapil sibal says it started off at a disadvantage .
" we must congratulate them for their victory .
but i don ’ t think they can claim that this is a vote against the central government .
let me give you one factor which was really in their favour and that was when we went into the campaign we could not say anything against the bjp because they have never ruled that state , so we can ’ t talk of their administration .
they had a 10 day rule in which the government collapsed and they got some sympathy out of it . they really took advantage of that fact whereas we had to be on the defensive . "
a win in karnataka - a state of 60 million people and home to india 's " silicon valley " of bangalore – - is expected to further boost the bjp 's national profile .
it now rules seven of the country ’ s 29 states and is part of ruling coalitions in five others .
sonia gandhi 's congress party , which heads the national government in new delhi , is currently facing a backlash over surging prices .
the congress will have to do serious stock taking ahead of state elections in madhya pradesh , rajasthan , chattisgarh and delhi later this year and the general elections scheduled for may next year if it wants to stop the bjp ’ s triumphant series of victories .
challenges ahead for the new government as it looks to forming the next government in karnataka , the bjp will have to quickly unclog india ’ s tech hub by building better roads and rail networks and then convince potential investors to look beyond the city of bangalore in terms of setting up offices and factories .
the state capital bangalore houses indian it giants infosys and wipro and local arms of multinationals such as ibm .
it has been thriving on outsourcing of software services from local and international firms , which has seen higher economic growth than the national average of 8 per cent in the last few years . murali krishnan 26/05/08 send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic 9797 media center watch and listen explore new content daily in dw 's multimedia archive .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de asia -pipe- 26.05.2008 " red light means a detour " - investigative journalism in china großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : looking for more diversity - newspaper readers in china that chinese media face a certain amount of censorship and limits in reporting is well known abroad .
but perhaps less well known is that there is meanwhile a well-established tradition of investigative journalism in china .
in a series of events , germany ’ s heinrich böll foundation recently invited experts to discuss media freedom in china ahead of the beijing olympics .
thomas bärthlein attended one of the debates which was held last week at deutsche welle in bonn . after the recent earthquake in sichuan province , the chinese media have been very open in their coverage .
they have shown grieving victims and have discussed sensitive issues : why did so many schools collapse , even as buildings in the neighbourhood were still standing ?
this sudden openness comes only a few weeks after the state ’ s clampdown on tibetan protesters was echoed by all the media without a hint of criticism .
it seems that the chinese media are showing two entirely different faces .
wang keqin from beijing , one of china ’ s leading investigative journalists , tries to explain the difference : " when we studied journalism our teacher gave us this rule : to become a good journalist in china you should become a politician first !
which means : if you do journalism in china you must judge and analyze the current political developments . "
so are there concrete limits to what chinese journalists can do , and what they can not ? " mostly not , " explains wang keqin , " they are rather vague .
of course , there are clear limits , too . normal financial or city newspapers can not as a matter of principle cover the following topics : the military , religious or ethnic issues , or foreign policy . "
but more often than not , the only way to find out what is possible is : start your research and see where it takes you !
wang keqin estimates that only half of the work of china ’ s investigative journalists finally gets published .
testing out the limits li wenkai from guangzhou agrees that it can be quite a challenge to get the political environment right .
a senior journalist at his " southern " newspaper group has developed a catchy metaphor for judging the political environment , says li wenkai : a traffic light .
" if the signal is green , go on smoothly .
if it turns yellow , you still continue , but hurry up .
and if you see a red light , you make a detour and continue your journey . "
it is this spirit of always testing out the limits which has earned li wenkai ’ s " southern metropolitan daily " its name .
his paper is read all over the country for its investigative reports – painstakingly researched by a whole team of twenty journalists .
exposing corruption or bad governance , discussing social problems such as poverty – all of these are no longer taboos in china ’ s media .
olympics might help are the olympics actually going to help the liberalization of the chinese media ?
professor zhan jiang , a leading researcher in journalism from beijing , is cautiously optimistic : " in the past , there have been more and more opportunities for chinese journalists to meet with foreign colleagues .
with the olympics taking place in china , this interaction is bound to increase .
of course we shouldn ’ t believe either that just because of the olympics the opening of chinese media will get a dramatic boost . "
besides , it is n't sure how events are going to unfold this year , he argues : " we all know how much has happened this year in china already .
take the tibet problem , for example , where we were very concerned .
but later the chinese central government changed its stance and decided to have talks with the dalai lama ’ s representatives .
if the olympics are held in a peaceful way , they ’ ll certainly contribute to a further opening of the media . "
chinese journalists have experienced a slow , but continuous process of liberalization for the last thirty years – which might be why they seem more confident about their own situation than some of their western colleagues . thomas bärthlein 26/05/08 send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic 9797 media center watch and listen explore new content daily in dw 's multimedia archive .

after a week , they have isolated key issues splitting the ninth conference of the parties to the convention on biological diversity -lrb- cbd -rrb- that runs until may 30 .
on sunday , may 25 , they were told to forget weekend-break plans and attend extra sessions summoned by the chairman of the mammoth conference , german environment minister sigmar gabriel .
the delegates must find a way to preserve biological diversity on the planet .
despite a minimum of progress , decisive action to halt the global destruction of virgin natural sites like rain forests and to prevent the extinction of flora and fauna has not yet been agreed upon .
the talks have prompted greater public awareness and concern about the exploitation of natural resources for the profit of the few .
gabriel says the sheer survival of billions of people may depend on this meeting 's resolutions , and that most government officials have praised the " constructive " atmosphere in the debates .
that should move the talks forward , said gabriel , whose role as chairman has been important in setting the fast pace .
praise heaped on german hosts bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : gabriel and his colleagues have been praised for their work ahmed djoghlaf , chief of the un convention secretariat , has been unstinting in his praise of the germans and gabriel for their no-nonsense management of the negotiations .
it is a gargantuan task getting so many nations to agree .
like the un climate-change convention , the pact on biodiversity requires " consensus " decision-making by the 191 parties under the aegis of the united nations .
it takes only one nay-sayer to torpedo any agreement , so conflicting national interests must be balanced up .
there have been critics in bonn quietly suggesting that such a decision-making method is impossibly unwieldy , but no one openly proposes the alternative : voting and letting a majority decide .
conference managers shrug and say , " if we started a debate about making decisions by a majority , we 'd never hear the end of it . "
eradication of bio-piracy a key issue one of the key issues at the conference has been how to achieve access to the natural resources mankind needs , and at the same time compensate poor countries , for example for the use of their unique plant species as sources of drugs .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : protests focused on the abuse of natural resources there has been some progress towards drafting a bonn " road map " on future talks about this .
such a road map would lead to a treaty being adopted by the next biodiversity conference in nagoya , japan in 2010 .
gabriel says both developing and industrialized countries will benefit from having clear ground rules about profit-sharing with the poor nations .
nature reserve network plan under fire meanwhile , the idea of creating a world network of nature reserves on land and under the sea has caused antagonism .
sources in the delegations say there is little prospect of any deal .
environmentalist group greenpeace alleges that the industrialized world is not sufficiently willing to foot the bill .
developing nations say they can not afford to create reserves alone .
as a solution , gabriel has proposed a " life web , " in which poorer nations would offer specific tracts for adoption and rich nations would post the money to convert them to reserves .
some cash offers have already been made in bonn .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the price of bio-fuels on the environment is a key issue the environmental harm done by bio-fuel plantations has been a point of controversy , as had been expected .
gabriel describes the bonn meet as the first international conference to debate the emerging problem .
" that in itself is a success and a breakthrough , " he said .
brazil was the loudest of those who questioned whether the conference had any authority to discuss the topic , arguing that it was not within the ambit of a biodiversity convention .
in the end , brazil , which grows ethanol crops , agreed to the debate , but insisted it must not be pilloried as an offender .
delegates agreed that ecological guidelines should be drafted to demonstrate how bio-energy crops can be grown beneficially .
protestors target bio-fuels environmentalists have homed in on the bio-fuel trade as a target , and demanded the crops be banned .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : critics say bio-fuels add to the global food crisis the critics say the plantations wipe out forests , destroy plants which are useful in other ways and deny food output to the hungry .
the tempo of the talks is set to pick up this week with the end in sight and well over 100 environment ministers from the different countries set to arrive and head the delegations in the top-level phase from wednesday until friday .
environmentalists are hoping chancellor angela merkel , a former environment minister herself , will galvanize the talks when she speaks at the bonn meeting , perhaps with a ringing appeal for action or with a surprise pledge of funds . dw staff / dpa -lrb- nda -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

gay activists say the memorial is long overdue . seventy-five years ago nazis launched a series of raids and public book burnings aimed at homosexuals .
it was the start of adolf hitler ’ s crusade against homosexuality which saw an unknown number of gays arrested , tortured and murdered by the nazis .
the subject of nazi persecution of homosexuals has long been swept under the carpet .
yet a new memorial which opens tuesday , may 27 , will bring the past persecution and ongoing struggles of homosexuals to be accepted in society to the heart of the german capital .
showing a forbidden kiss bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the memorial will be officially unveiled this week the homosexual memorial will consist of a grey rectangular block some four meters -lrb- 13 feet -rrb- tall .
one side will have a small opening through which viewers will see a black and white art film scene of two men kissing .
" a simple kiss could land you in trouble , " says the text which accompanies the memorial .
the memorial was designed by the danish-norweigan artistic duo michael elmgreen and ingar dragset .
the memorial has a prominent place in berlin 's tiergarten park , half a block from brandenburg gate .
the monument sits across from the jewish holocaust memorial .
originally it was debated whether homosexuals should be included in the larger memorial before the decision was made to give homosexuals their own monument .
but the design corresponds to the holocaust memorial 's field of steles , a series of concrete blocks of varying sizes .
while the nazi persecution of the jews is well known , for many years there was little public acknowledgement of nazi atrocities towards homosexuals .
estimates put the number of homosexuals arrested by nazis at about 54,000 with 7,000 being killed in concentration camps .
" it is not easy for a gay man to live in this country and this society .
it 's important to remember that this society punished homosexuality for 20 years after national socialism ended , " said günter dworek of the federation of gays and lesbians in germany -lrb- lsvd -rrb- , a driving force behind the project .
gays making strides bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : berlin 's mayor is gay homosexuality remained illegal in germany until 1969 and was only formally decriminalized in 1994 .
it was n't until 2000 that germany 's parliament first passed a resolution acknowledging discrimination had occurred , dworek said .
the decision to fund the memorial , which cost 450,000 euros -lrb- $ 710,000 -rrb- , happened three years later .
the city 's current mayor , social democrat klaus wowereit , announced shortly before taking office seven years ago that he is gay .
wowereit 's legendary outing has given many others courage , dworek said .
" that opened a lot of people 's eyes .
you can not simply assume that politicians who already have a career behind them , like klaus wowereit , are by nature heterosexual , " dworek said .
germany also has a law which allows same-sex couples to register their partnerships .
yet many activists would like to see more , including anti-discrimination laws .
neo-nazi violence is still a very real threat , said albert eckert , head of the gay holocaust memorial committee . " but at last we have a monument to those who suffered and died under the nazis , " eckert said .
a tribute to hirschfeld bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : it is similar in style to the holocaust memorial eckert said he was also happy that the dedication was close to the birthday and death day of magnus hirschfeld , who died in exile in southern france on may 14 , 1935 .
a jewish homosexual , hirschfeld was a medical doctor who dedicated his life to the scientific study of homosexuality and lobbied the german government to repeal laws which outlawed gay sex .
the word " transsexual " was coined by hirschfeld to describe the phenomenon that he argued was a natural extension of human sexuality .
for his work , the nazis targeted hirschfeld as an example of decadent bolshevistic / jewish influence infecting the purity of the german people , luring the aryan race into impure and destructive perversity .
his institute was ransacked and his books were burned in rallies on may 10 , 1933 .
it was n't long before gay men were being rounded up and sent to mental hospitals or concentration camps .
" we have no idea how many thousands died in concentration camps because many were also jewish or were communists .
we know that many were left in prison after the war when post-war courts upheld the nazi jail sentences against them , " eckert says .
" anyone who was gay was automatically a criminal .
this monument is for all of them . "
making an international statement bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : a kiss can be a political statement the parliament decided on december 12 , 2003 to fund the homosexual memorial .
it was a nice birthday present for the green politician and well-known gay activist volker beck who turned 43 that day .
beck felt the memorial was especially important because the laws used to prosecute homosexuals continued long after the nazis had been defeated .
and persecution still exists in many countries today , making the memorial as important as ever , beck said .
he cites 80 countries which criminalize homosexual acts between consenting adults and 12 where the death penalty can be handed down .
beck believes germany 's memorial " sends an important signal that in this country , where in the past -lsb- homosexuals -rsb- were also systematically persecuted , we now have constructed a symbol against this human rights violation . " but homosexuals are still not fully accepted in society , beck said .
he worries about the refusal of some conservative christians and muslims to accept homosexuality .
beck said he does n't have any problem with the memorial 's design , which has come under criticism , particularly from women .
the first scene will portray men kissing , but later it will show women .
dworek said he is " downright happy " with the memorial 's design and likes the idea that the kissing scene will switch every two years .
" this will keep the memorial fresh .
there is always be something new , " dworek said .
" it will be a dynamic memorial . " dw staff -lrb- th -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

it should also boost employment in the region . the express mail delivery and logistics company dhl , which is a division of germany 's postal giant deutsche post ag , inaugurated its principle european hub at leipzig-halle airport in eastern germany on monday , may 26 .
in 2004 , deutsche post had already announced the planned move from brussels to leipzig , since the belgian capital refused to permit additional nighttime flights .
dhl added that besides being able to operate around the clock in leipzig , the central european location was ideal as a hub for emerging markets in eastern europe and asia .
" demand for express services is growing worldwide , " said the new ceo of the post ag parent company , frank appel at the opening ceremony attended by prominent politicians , such as german foreign minister frank-walter steinmeier .
" this is a day to be proud of .
we are looking towards the future , " he said .
georg milbradt , the state premier of saxony , where leipzig is the capital , hailed the move as a " job motor " which will help boost the economy in the eastern states , which have higher unemployment rates than in the west .
at present dhl already operates flights to the middle east and india from leipzig-halle , where it plans to increase its personnel from about 2,000 to 3,500 employees by 2012 .
" with dhl here , the state of saxony will without a doubt become a central logistics point in europe , " said the state 's economics minister thomas jurk .
some 300 million euros -lrb- $ 474 million -rrb- have already been invested in the new hub , which has an air freight turnover of 1,500 tons a day .
about 60 freight aircraft bearing the dhl logo take off and land in leipzig per day .
worldwide , dhl flies to nearly 50 destinations , of which leipzig will become one of three main hubs that include wilmington , ohio in the us and hong kong .
not everyone was happy about the new hub however .
dozens of local residents staged a protest at the inauguration over the potential increase in noise levels at night .
" we will only fly when necessary , " said appel .
a hearing on night time flights will be held in the federal courts in leipzig on july 15 . dw staff -lrb- df -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

it should also boost employment in the region . the express mail delivery and logistics company dhl , which is a division of germany 's postal giant deutsche post ag , inaugurated its principle european hub at leipzig-halle airport in eastern germany on monday , may 26 .
in 2004 , deutsche post had already announced the planned move from brussels to leipzig , since the belgian capital refused to permit additional nighttime flights .
dhl added that besides being able to operate around the clock in leipzig , the central european location was ideal as a hub for emerging markets in eastern europe and asia .
" demand for express services is growing worldwide , " said the new ceo of the post ag parent company , frank appel at the opening ceremony attended by prominent politicians , such as german foreign minister frank-walter steinmeier .
" this is a day to be proud of .
we are looking towards the future , " he said .
georg milbradt , the state premier of saxony , where leipzig is the capital , hailed the move as a " job motor " which will help boost the economy in the eastern states , which have higher unemployment rates than in the west .
at present dhl already operates flights to the middle east and india from leipzig-halle , where it plans to increase its personnel from about 2,000 to 3,500 employees by 2012 .
" with dhl here , the state of saxony will without a doubt become a central logistics point in europe , " said the state 's economics minister thomas jurk .
some 300 million euros -lrb- $ 474 million -rrb- have already been invested in the new hub , which has an air freight turnover of 1,500 tons a day .
about 60 freight aircraft bearing the dhl logo take off and land in leipzig per day .
worldwide , dhl flies to nearly 50 destinations , of which leipzig will become one of three main hubs that include wilmington , ohio in the us and hong kong .
not everyone was happy about the new hub however .
dozens of local residents staged a protest at the inauguration over the potential increase in noise levels at night .
" we will only fly when necessary , " said appel .
a hearing on night time flights will be held in the federal courts in leipzig on july 15 . dw staff -lrb- df -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

after a week , they have isolated key issues splitting the ninth conference of the parties to the convention on biological diversity -lrb- cbd -rrb- that runs until may 30 .
on sunday , may 25 , they were told to forget weekend-break plans and attend extra sessions summoned by the chairman of the mammoth conference , german environment minister sigmar gabriel .
the delegates must find a way to preserve biological diversity on the planet .
despite a minimum of progress , decisive action to halt the global destruction of virgin natural sites like rain forests and to prevent the extinction of flora and fauna has not yet been agreed upon .
the talks have prompted greater public awareness and concern about the exploitation of natural resources for the profit of the few .
gabriel says the sheer survival of billions of people may depend on this meeting 's resolutions , and that most government officials have praised the " constructive " atmosphere in the debates .

it is a gargantuan task getting so many nations to agree .
like the un climate-change convention , the pact on biodiversity requires " consensus " decision-making by the 191 parties under the aegis of the united nations .
it takes only one nay-sayer to torpedo any agreement , so conflicting national interests must be balanced up .
there have been critics in bonn quietly suggesting that such a decision-making method is impossibly unwieldy , but no one openly proposes the alternative : voting and letting a majority decide .
conference managers shrug and say , " if we started a debate about making decisions by a majority , we 'd never hear the end of it . "

such a road map would lead to a treaty being adopted by the next biodiversity conference in nagoya , japan in 2010 .
gabriel says both developing and industrialized countries will benefit from having clear ground rules about profit-sharing with the poor nations .
nature reserve network plan under fire meanwhile , the idea of creating a world network of nature reserves on land and under the sea has caused antagonism .
sources in the delegations say there is little prospect of any deal .
environmentalist group greenpeace alleges that the industrialized world is not sufficiently willing to foot the bill .
developing nations say they can not afford to create reserves alone .
as a solution , gabriel has proposed a " life web , " in which poorer nations would offer specific tracts for adoption and rich nations would post the money to convert them to reserves .
some cash offers have already been made in bonn .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the price of bio-fuels on the environment is a key issue the environmental harm done by bio-fuel plantations has been a point of controversy , as had been expected .
gabriel describes the bonn meet as the first international conference to debate the emerging problem .
" that in itself is a success and a breakthrough , " he said .
brazil was the loudest of those who questioned whether the conference had any authority to discuss the topic , arguing that it was not within the ambit of a biodiversity convention .

that should move the talks forward , said gabriel , whose role as chairman has been important in setting the fast pace .
praise heaped on german hosts bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : gabriel and his colleagues have been praised for their work ahmed djoghlaf , chief of the un convention secretariat , has been unstinting in his praise of the germans and gabriel for their no-nonsense management of the negotiations .
it is a gargantuan task getting so many nations to agree .
like the un climate-change convention , the pact on biodiversity requires " consensus " decision-making by the 191 parties under the aegis of the united nations .
it takes only one nay-sayer to torpedo any agreement , so conflicting national interests must be balanced up .
there have been critics in bonn quietly suggesting that such a decision-making method is impossibly unwieldy , but no one openly proposes the alternative : voting and letting a majority decide .
conference managers shrug and say , " if we started a debate about making decisions by a majority , we 'd never hear the end of it . "
eradication of bio-piracy a key issue one of the key issues at the conference has been how to achieve access to the natural resources mankind needs , and at the same time compensate poor countries , for example for the use of their unique plant species as sources of drugs .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : protests focused on the abuse of natural resources there has been some progress towards drafting a bonn " road map " on future talks about this .
such a road map would lead to a treaty being adopted by the next biodiversity conference in nagoya , japan in 2010 .
gabriel says both developing and industrialized countries will benefit from having clear ground rules about profit-sharing with the poor nations .
nature reserve network plan under fire meanwhile , the idea of creating a world network of nature reserves on land and under the sea has caused antagonism .
sources in the delegations say there is little prospect of any deal .
environmentalist group greenpeace alleges that the industrialized world is not sufficiently willing to foot the bill .
developing nations say they can not afford to create reserves alone .
as a solution , gabriel has proposed a " life web , " in which poorer nations would offer specific tracts for adoption and rich nations would post the money to convert them to reserves .
some cash offers have already been made in bonn .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the price of bio-fuels on the environment is a key issue the environmental harm done by bio-fuel plantations has been a point of controversy , as had been expected .
gabriel describes the bonn meet as the first international conference to debate the emerging problem .
" that in itself is a success and a breakthrough , " he said .
brazil was the loudest of those who questioned whether the conference had any authority to discuss the topic , arguing that it was not within the ambit of a biodiversity convention .
in the end , brazil , which grows ethanol crops , agreed to the debate , but insisted it must not be pilloried as an offender .
delegates agreed that ecological guidelines should be drafted to demonstrate how bio-energy crops can be grown beneficially .
protestors target bio-fuels environmentalists have homed in on the bio-fuel trade as a target , and demanded the crops be banned .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : critics say bio-fuels add to the global food crisis the critics say the plantations wipe out forests , destroy plants which are useful in other ways and deny food output to the hungry .
the tempo of the talks is set to pick up this week with the end in sight and well over 100 environment ministers from the different countries set to arrive and head the delegations in the top-level phase from wednesday until friday .
environmentalists are hoping chancellor angela merkel , a former environment minister herself , will galvanize the talks when she speaks at the bonn meeting , perhaps with a ringing appeal for action or with a surprise pledge of funds . dw staff / dpa -lrb- nda -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

it should also boost employment in the region . the express mail delivery and logistics company dhl , which is a division of germany 's postal giant deutsche post ag , inaugurated its principle european hub at leipzig-halle airport in eastern germany on monday , may 26 .
in 2004 , deutsche post had already announced the planned move from brussels to leipzig , since the belgian capital refused to permit additional nighttime flights .
dhl added that besides being able to operate around the clock in leipzig , the central european location was ideal as a hub for emerging markets in eastern europe and asia .
" demand for express services is growing worldwide , " said the new ceo of the post ag parent company , frank appel at the opening ceremony attended by prominent politicians , such as german foreign minister frank-walter steinmeier .
" this is a day to be proud of .
we are looking towards the future , " he said .
georg milbradt , the state premier of saxony , where leipzig is the capital , hailed the move as a " job motor " which will help boost the economy in the eastern states , which have higher unemployment rates than in the west .
at present dhl already operates flights to the middle east and india from leipzig-halle , where it plans to increase its personnel from about 2,000 to 3,500 employees by 2012 .
" with dhl here , the state of saxony will without a doubt become a central logistics point in europe , " said the state 's economics minister thomas jurk .
some 300 million euros -lrb- $ 474 million -rrb- have already been invested in the new hub , which has an air freight turnover of 1,500 tons a day .
about 60 freight aircraft bearing the dhl logo take off and land in leipzig per day .
worldwide , dhl flies to nearly 50 destinations , of which leipzig will become one of three main hubs that include wilmington , ohio in the us and hong kong .
not everyone was happy about the new hub however .
dozens of local residents staged a protest at the inauguration over the potential increase in noise levels at night .
" we will only fly when necessary , " said appel .
a hearing on night time flights will be held in the federal courts in leipzig on july 15 . dw staff -lrb- df -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

" the eu general affairs and external relations council has decided the eu should double the number of participants in the eupol mission in afghanistan , " said a statement from the slovenian presidency of the bloc .
" this measure will strengthen efforts towards police reform , " it added .
launched in june 2007 and expected to last for at least three years , the eupol mission consists of about 200 experts tasked with training afghan policemen and officials at the interior ministry .
their numbers are now expected to rise to about 400 over the next 12 months , diplomats said .
" we want the afghan government to be able to take care of security themselves , " said german defence minister franz josef jung , whose country was strongly behind the initiative .
italy considering sending troops to danger zones bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : frattini said isaf requests would determine italy 's plans separately , new italian foreign minister franco frattini said his government was ready to drop some of its caveats and deploy its troops to more dangerous battle zones , as requested by nato .
" we are talking about greater geographical flexibility , " frattini said .
" we want to align italy to its other great nato partners . "
italy currently has about 2,360 soldiers in afghanistan .
but they are mainly deployed in kabul and in the less restive west of the country .
the previous centre-left government of romano prodi refused to give in to us requests for the troops to be sent to southern hotspots , where nato is fighting taliban insurgents .
germany has maintained a similar position , thus infuriating the united states , britain , canada and the netherlands , which have suffered significant casualties around the kandahar region .
new direction for italian leadership frattini did not rule out sending troops to the south , saying redeployment would depend on the requests made by nato 's international security assistance force -lrb- isaf -rrb- .
but with a political storm brewing back home , italian defence minister ignazio la russa later clarified that such redeployments would be " temporary " rather than permanent .
" we are not against , should the need arise , temporary interventions aimed at lending a hand to those facing greater difficulties than ours , " he said . dw staff / dpa -lrb- nda -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

the peaceful beliefs of ahmadis , who can be found in small numbers in germany , are seen as heretical by most muslims . it 's been 100 years since mirza ghulam ahmad founded the ahmadiyya muslim faith .
the controversial indian religious figure claimed to be the promised messiah awaited by all the major religions , whether christian , buddhist jewish or muslim .
his followers believed that within 300 years most of the world will join the islamic brotherhood , which will usher in an era of peace .
that goal implies worldwide missionary work , which has lead ahmadis , as the members of the ahmidiyya community call themselves , to proselitize the world .
they 've even ended up in the unlikely berlin neighborhood of pankow-heinersdorf .
with a new mosque under construction and 100th anniversary parties planned , mirza masroor ahmad will travel to berlin on tuesday , may 27 .
for his followers , the caliph is for followers a representative of the promised messiah .
he is democratically elected by the council of the ahmadiyyas and serves for life .
misunderstandings persist the title of " caliph " has been misunderstood by many in the west , said islamic scholar stephan rosiny .
a caliph is the political head of state in an islamic community .
while the practice of the worldly and spiritual leadership being united in the person of the caliph has its origins in the middle ages , modern islamists have used the idea as well .
a recent example was the so-called caliph of cologne , metin kaplan , who , until his movement was outlawed in 2001 dreamed of starting an islamic regime in europe .
“ to equate the ahmadis with something like that is pure sensationalism , ” rosiny said .
rosiny sees a perception problem due to people in the west viewing radical forms of islam as the norm rather than an exception .
rosiny said that islamic beliefs need to be taken in context .
caliph means successor and “ jihad ” for the ahmidiyya movement , as for most muslims , does not mean holy war but rather a struggle to improve oneself or society .
a peaceful movement the ahmadiyya movement stresses the peaceful aspects of islam .
it condemns islamist violence and spoke out against the fatwa against author salman rushdie for his novel “ the satanic verses . ”
“ love for all , hate for none ” is their motto .
yet the ahmidiyya movement is considered heretical by mainstream islam .
for most muslims , mohammed is the last and most important prophet , while ahmadis believe that he was followed by others .
that has won the movement enemies .
in 1974 , pakistan declared followers not to be muslims and legitimized violence against them .
the caliph moved to london .
long history of missionary work the group has been preaching in germany since the weimar republic .
in berlin 's wilmersdorf neighbourhood the splinter group called the lahore ahmadiyya movement opened a mosque in the 1920s .
it is an architectural gem which remains germany 's oldest mosque .
since the beginning of the systematic persecution in pakistan , many pakistani ahmadiyyas came as asylum seekers to germany .
worldwide there are between 10 and 80 million ahmadiyyas .
in pankow-heinersdorf in the northern part of berlin there are almost no muslims , much less ahmadis .
the neighbourhood was chosen for the 100th anniversary celebrations because the group 's first mosque in eastern germany is being built here .
the shell has just been completed after a long and vehement opposition from some of the public .
there were demonstrations and initiatives against the construction .
later , a truck parked at the construction site was burned , police believe it was arson .
“ i can understand the fear the people have , ” said abdullah wagishauser , a german convert , has been head of the group in germany since 1984 .
“ there is a fundamental distrust about islam . ”
wanting to be neighborly but his experience with other mosque projects is that dialogue and information can overcome this antagonism .
“ after one of two years we always have a fully normal neighbourly relationship , ” he said .
in the meantime they have tried to smooth things over with their neighbors .

the decision is sure to cause friction within germany 's coalition government . schwan , a 65-year-old university professor , was announced on monday , may 26 , as the social democratic party 's -lrb- spd -rrb- choice for the high-profile office of german president .
schwan nearly won the post five years ago , but lost out to horst koehler , a former head of the international monetary fund .
koehler has the support of chancellor angela merkel 's christian democratic union -lrb- cdu -rrb- , who wants to see him serve a second five-year term .
members of the cdu and its bavarian sister party , the christian social union -lrb- csu -rrb- , were upset to hear that the spd would put forth its own candidate .
the parties form a left-right coalition together .
chancellor merkel expressed her anger about the decision of her coalition partners to nominate their own candidate . " we have a president who is respected around the world , " merkel said .
" so it is regrettable that the social democrats have put up their own candidate in this step that can only be explained by the internal state of the party . ” schwan 's candidacy runs counter to a longstanding tradition observed by the two main political blocs not to put up a challenger to a president seeking a second term . " i believe that this candidacy will fail and that horst koehler will remain president , as is the wish of the majority of our citizens , " she added .
coalition will stay together bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : they do not always see eye to eye spd head hubertus heil said that he does not worry that the move will rupture the coalition ahead of federal elections , which are scheduled to take place in 2009 .
the csu also faces state elections in bavaria later this year .
" a little competition is n't going to cause any harm to a functioning democracy , " heil said .
" the csu is nervous ahead of the state elections in september .
i urge them just to relax . "
spd leader kurt beck said that his party would not " campaign against the incumbent . "
" in a democracy , we view a rival candidacy as a good opportunity for a broad discussion of the issues , " beck said monday .
merkel 's spokesman ulrich wilhelm also rejected any suggestion of the coalition breaking apart at a news conference .
" the chancellor has made it clear that the spd decision puts a strain on the coalition but that she , as well as the chairmen of the spd and csu , remains interested in carrying on the work on policies in the best interests of germany , " wilhelm said .
secret vote bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : koehler wants another five years schwan narrowly lost to koehler in 2004 when the cdu and free democrats -lrb- fdp -rrb- had a majority in the federal assembly , which is made up of members of parliament and delegates from each of germany 's 16 federal states .
the vote for president is done by secret ballot , meaning any federal assembly member can vote for any candidate .
the assembly meets every five years to elect a president .
the assembly vote for president will take place in may of 2009 .
political analysts say that center-left parties could have enough votes to elect schwan .
while the spd has refused to enter into a coalition with the left party in forming a government , it would presumably rely on the left and the greens to elect schwan . dw staff -lrb- th -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

it is intended to replace the current partnership and cooperation agreement -lrb- pca -rrb- , which ran out in 2007 , and should include legally-binding measures on such issues as energy , security , trade and education . negotiations are to be formally launched in siberia on june 26-27 , when new president dmitry medvedev will represent russia for the first time .
they were only made possible after lithuania , the last eu member to block the talks , was assured that its concerns about energy supply and moscow 's stance on georgia would be addressed . officials in brussels predict complex negotiations with moscow are likely to last about a year , with a further year required for its ratification by eu member states and russia . eu ministers also listened to polish plans for strengthening ties with ukraine , moldova , georgia , armenia , azerbaijan and , eventually , belarus . supported by sweden and blessed by heavyweights france and germany , the so-called eastern partnership comes on the back of french plans to boost the eu 's ties with its southern neighbors in a union for the mediterranean . visa-free travel in sight according to a text seen by german news agency dpa , the proposed eastern partnership would seek to deepen cooperation and focus on concrete proposals in the area of migration , with an eye to moving towards a visa-free regime . it would also seek to create a free trade area , provide support for reforms designed to bring those countries up to eu standards , and arrange more student exchange programs . the partnership would use existing neighborhood funds and would have an institutional structure that is " as light-weight and goal-oriented as possible . " human rights , a frequent bone of contention under russia 's former president vladimir putin , and energy supply are also likely to become major topics of discussion . benita ferrero-waldner , the commissioner in charge of the eu 's external relations , said the eu executive would only support the plan if it provided " added value " and did not duplicate existing eu policies . " the negotiation will certainly not be easy … i think they will take quite some time , " she said . poland advocates eastern focus polish and swedish diplomats say the partnership will encourage " multilateral cooperation " and " foster regional links .

it is intended to replace the current partnership and cooperation agreement -lrb- pca -rrb- , which ran out in 2007 , and should include legally-binding measures on such issues as energy , security , trade and education . negotiations are to be formally launched in siberia on june 26-27 , when new president dmitry medvedev will represent russia for the first time .
they were only made possible after lithuania , the last eu member to block the talks , was assured that its concerns about energy supply and moscow 's stance on georgia would be addressed . officials in brussels predict complex negotiations with moscow are likely to last about a year , with a further year required for its ratification by eu member states and russia . eu ministers also listened to polish plans for strengthening ties with ukraine , moldova , georgia , armenia , azerbaijan and , eventually , belarus . supported by sweden and blessed by heavyweights france and germany , the so-called eastern partnership comes on the back of french plans to boost the eu 's ties with its southern neighbors in a union for the mediterranean . visa-free travel in sight according to a text seen by german news agency dpa , the proposed eastern partnership would seek to deepen cooperation and focus on concrete proposals in the area of migration , with an eye to moving towards a visa-free regime . it would also seek to create a free trade area , provide support for reforms designed to bring those countries up to eu standards , and arrange more student exchange programs . the partnership would use existing neighborhood funds and would have an institutional structure that is " as light-weight and goal-oriented as possible . " human rights , a frequent bone of contention under russia 's former president vladimir putin , and energy supply are also likely to become major topics of discussion . benita ferrero-waldner , the commissioner in charge of the eu 's external relations , said the eu executive would only support the plan if it provided " added value " and did not duplicate existing eu policies . " the negotiation will certainly not be easy … i think they will take quite some time , " she said . poland advocates eastern focus polish and swedish diplomats say the partnership will encourage " multilateral cooperation " and " foster regional links . " cooperation with belarus , whose democratic credentials have been thrown into question , would initially take place only on a " technical and expert level . " the polish-swedish plan was welcomed by the czech republic , which is due to take over the rotating presidency of the eu on jan .
1 . france , which launched the idea of the mediterranean union , is due to hold the eu presidency from july 1 this year . " this year is the mediterranean year , next year would be the eastern year , " said the czech deputy prime minister for european affairs , alexander vondra . kosovo handover unrealistic another major issue up for discussion in brussels is the bloc 's eu-lex law mission in kosovo . the mission was originally meant to take over the administration of the newly independent country from the united nations on june 15 . but eu officials now concede that legal and logistical difficulties mean that the deadline is unrealistic . " eu-lex is going slowly but surely , " said slovenian foreign minister dimitrij rupel , who chaired monday 's meeting as current eu president . dw staff with dpa news reports -lrb- kjb -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de civil rights -pipe- 26.05.2008 memorial for gays persecuted by nazis opens in berlin großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the memorial and its creators german politicians will dedicate a memorial in berlin this week to the tens of thousands of homosexuals persecuted during the nazi regime .
gay activists say the memorial is long overdue . seventy-five years ago nazis launched a series of raids and public book burnings aimed at homosexuals .
it was the start of adolf hitler ’ s crusade against homosexuality which saw an unknown number of gays arrested , tortured and murdered by the nazis .
the subject of nazi persecution of homosexuals has long been swept under the carpet .
yet a new memorial which opens tuesday , may 27 , will bring the past persecution and ongoing struggles of homosexuals to be accepted in society to the heart of the german capital .
showing a forbidden kiss bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the memorial will be officially unveiled this week the homosexual memorial will consist of a grey rectangular block some four meters -lrb- 13 feet -rrb- tall .
one side will have a small opening through which viewers will see a black and white art film scene of two men kissing .
" a simple kiss could land you in trouble , " says the text which accompanies the memorial .
the memorial was designed by the danish-norweigan artistic duo michael elmgreen and ingar dragset .
the memorial has a prominent place in berlin 's tiergarten park , half a block from brandenburg gate .
the monument sits across from the jewish holocaust memorial .
originally it was debated whether homosexuals should be included in the larger memorial before the decision was made to give homosexuals their own monument .
but the design corresponds to the holocaust memorial 's field of steles , a series of concrete blocks of varying sizes .
while the nazi persecution of the jews is well known , for many years there was little public acknowledgement of nazi atrocities towards homosexuals .
estimates put the number of homosexuals arrested by nazis at about 54,000 with 7,000 being killed in concentration camps .
" it is not easy for a gay man to live in this country and this society .
it 's important to remember that this society punished homosexuality for 20 years after national socialism ended , " said günter dworek of the federation of gays and lesbians in germany -lrb- lsvd -rrb- , a driving force behind the project .
gays making strides bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : berlin 's mayor is gay homosexuality remained illegal in germany until 1969 and was only formally decriminalized in 1994 .
it was n't until 2000 that germany 's parliament first passed a resolution acknowledging discrimination had occurred , dworek said .
the decision to fund the memorial , which cost 450,000 euros -lrb- $ 710,000 -rrb- , happened three years later .
the city 's current mayor , social democrat klaus wowereit , announced shortly before taking office seven years ago that he is gay .
wowereit 's legendary outing has given many others courage , dworek said .
" that opened a lot of people 's eyes .
you can not simply assume that politicians who already have a career behind them , like klaus wowereit , are by nature heterosexual , " dworek said .
germany also has a law which allows same-sex couples to register their partnerships .
yet many activists would like to see more , including anti-discrimination laws .
neo-nazi violence is still a very real threat , said albert eckert , head of the gay holocaust memorial committee . " but at last we have a monument to those who suffered and died under the nazis , " eckert said .
a tribute to hirschfeld bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : it is similar in style to the holocaust memorial eckert said he was also happy that the dedication was close to the birthday and death day of magnus hirschfeld , who died in exile in southern france on may 14 , 1935 .
a jewish homosexual , hirschfeld was a medical doctor who dedicated his life to the scientific study of homosexuality and lobbied the german government to repeal laws which outlawed gay sex .
the word " transsexual " was coined by hirschfeld to describe the phenomenon that he argued was a natural extension of human sexuality .
for his work , the nazis targeted hirschfeld as an example of decadent bolshevistic / jewish influence infecting the purity of the german people , luring the aryan race into impure and destructive perversity .
his institute was ransacked and his books were burned in rallies on may 10 , 1933 .
it was n't long before gay men were being rounded up and sent to mental hospitals or concentration camps .
" we have no idea how many thousands died in concentration camps because many were also jewish or were communists .
we know that many were left in prison after the war when post-war courts upheld the nazi jail sentences against them , " eckert says .
" anyone who was gay was automatically a criminal .
this monument is for all of them . "
making an international statement bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : a kiss can be a political statement the parliament decided on december 12 , 2003 to fund the homosexual memorial .
it was a nice birthday present for the green politician and well-known gay activist volker beck who turned 43 that day .
beck felt the memorial was especially important because the laws used to prosecute homosexuals continued long after the nazis had been defeated .
and persecution still exists in many countries today , making the memorial as important as ever , beck said .
he cites 80 countries which criminalize homosexual acts between consenting adults and 12 where the death penalty can be handed down .
beck believes germany 's memorial " sends an important signal that in this country , where in the past -lsb- homosexuals -rsb- were also systematically persecuted , we now have constructed a symbol against this human rights violation . " but homosexuals are still not fully accepted in society , beck said .
he worries about the refusal of some conservative christians and muslims to accept homosexuality .
beck said he does n't have any problem with the memorial 's design , which has come under criticism , particularly from women .
the first scene will portray men kissing , but later it will show women .
dworek said he is " downright happy " with the memorial 's design and likes the idea that the kissing scene will switch every two years .
" this will keep the memorial fresh .
there is always be something new , " dworek said .
" it will be a dynamic memorial . " dw staff -lrb- th -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

the last time france emerged from the festival with top honors was more than two decades ago . the jury president , us actor and director sean penn , was expected to favor a social or political film , and it came as a surprise that israeli ari folman 's groundbreaking animated documentary " waltz with bashir " went unrecognized .
using innovative techniques to retell events surrounding the sabra and shatila massacres in 1982 , the film was considered a contender for the top prize . penn had told a french newspaper ahead of the competition that cannes ' duty was to " do just the opposite " of the oscars and to honor a ground-breaking , unconventional picture . french film tackles hot political topic bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : cantet , right , accepted the award with his " class " screened during the final days of the competition , " the class " -lrb- " entre les murs " -rrb- is a docu-drama with real teachers and students playing the roles in a tough french school .
the young cast of joined cantet on stage to accept the palme d 'or , a moment the director described as deeply moving . based on an autobiographical novel by francois begaudeau , a young french teacher , genet , turns the classroom portrayed in the movie into a microcosm of contemporary france .
begaudeau also plays the role of a dedicated but sometimes flawed teacher in the movie . it was a subject that " interests the whole world , " said cantet at a press conference .
" people have the same issues , whichever country they are in . " the film has been praised for its realistic approach and its exploration of universal issues like race , individuality and truth . the last french film to walk away with the palme d 'or for best film at cannes - in 1987 - was maurice pialat 's " under the sun of satan , " a melodrama about a 16-year-old girl who kills her lover and the priest to whom she confesses the crime . italy scores double bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : israel 's animated documentary was expected to do better italian directors also scored top awards at this year 's cannes festival , with the nation 's two movies that were entered in the main competition both winning key prizes . while paolo sorrentino was awarded the jury prize for his political satire about italy 's seven-time prime minister giulio andreotti , matteo garrone 's powerful mafia expose , " gomorrah , " emerged from the festival with the grand prix . garrone was applauded for his courage in looking at a touchy subject , particularly since the author of the bestselling book the film is based on has been living under police protection for the past two years . turkey 's nuri bilge ceylan won the festival 's best director award for his brooding family drama " three monkeys " -lrb- " uc maymum " -rrb- . in accepting the prize , ceylan said he was dedicating the award " to my beautiful country , which i love passionately . " the nine-member festival jury acknowledged the strong presence of latin american-themed films at this year 's festival .
sandra corveloni was awarded the best actress prize for her role in " line of passage " -lrb- " linha de passe " -rrb- from brazilian directors walter salles and daniela thomas , which tells the story of four brothers trying to follow their dreams in the sao paulo slums . the best actor award went to benicio del toro , who played che guevara in hollywood director steven soderbergh 's four-and-a-half-hour , two-part epic about the latin american revolutionary leader .
del toro said he wanted to dedicate the award " to the man himself , che guevara . " romania comes back strong bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : benicio del toro took the best actor award for his role in " che " the cannes festival award for best screenplay went to belgian brothers jean-pierre and luc dardenne for " lorna 's silence , " which looks at immigration in modern europe as told by a young albanian woman who is caught up in the murky business of arranged marriages . the festival 's camera d 'or for best first feature film , awarded to debut directors , went this year to london-born steve mcqueen 's " hunger , " about a northern irish prisoner who died on a hunger strike . once again , romania demonstrated that it has emerged as a key filmmaking nation , with marian crisan winning the festival 's award for best short film for his movie " megatron . "
cristian mungiu 's " 4 months , 3 weeks and 2 days " about abortion in communist romania won the palme d 'or last year . this year 's festival acknowledged the long-standing contributions to cinema by french actress catherine deneuve , who had a film in the main competition , and veteran us director clint eastwood , whose " the exchange , " starring angelina jolie , was also in the running for the palme d 'or . dw staff -lrb- kjb -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

but perhaps less well known is that there is meanwhile a well-established tradition of investigative journalism in china .
in a series of events , germany ’ s heinrich böll foundation recently invited experts to discuss media freedom in china ahead of the beijing olympics .
thomas bärthlein attended one of the debates which was held last week at deutsche welle in bonn . after the recent earthquake in sichuan province , the chinese media have been very open in their coverage .
they have shown grieving victims and have discussed sensitive issues : why did so many schools collapse , even as buildings in the neighbourhood were still standing ?
this sudden openness comes only a few weeks after the state ’ s clampdown on tibetan protesters was echoed by all the media without a hint of criticism .
it seems that the chinese media are showing two entirely different faces .
wang keqin from beijing , one of china ’ s leading investigative journalists , tries to explain the difference : " when we studied journalism our teacher gave us this rule : to become a good journalist in china you should become a politician first !
which means : if you do journalism in china you must judge and analyze the current political developments . "
so are there concrete limits to what chinese journalists can do , and what they can not ? " mostly not , " explains wang keqin , " they are rather vague .
of course , there are clear limits , too . normal financial or city newspapers can not as a matter of principle cover the following topics : the military , religious or ethnic issues , or foreign policy . "
but more often than not , the only way to find out what is possible is : start your research and see where it takes you !
wang keqin estimates that only half of the work of china ’ s investigative journalists finally gets published .
testing out the limits li wenkai from guangzhou agrees that it can be quite a challenge to get the political environment right .
a senior journalist at his " southern " newspaper group has developed a catchy metaphor for judging the political environment , says li wenkai : a traffic light .
" if the signal is green , go on smoothly .
if it turns yellow , you still continue , but hurry up .
and if you see a red light , you make a detour and continue your journey . "
it is this spirit of always testing out the limits which has earned li wenkai ’ s " southern metropolitan daily " its name .

olympics might help are the olympics actually going to help the liberalization of the chinese media ?
professor zhan jiang , a leading researcher in journalism from beijing , is cautiously optimistic : " in the past , there have been more and more opportunities for chinese journalists to meet with foreign colleagues .
with the olympics taking place in china , this interaction is bound to increase .
of course we shouldn ’ t believe either that just because of the olympics the opening of chinese media will get a dramatic boost . "
besides , it is n't sure how events are going to unfold this year , he argues : " we all know how much has happened this year in china already .
take the tibet problem , for example , where we were very concerned .
but later the chinese central government changed its stance and decided to have talks with the dalai lama ’ s representatives .
if the olympics are held in a peaceful way , they ’ ll certainly contribute to a further opening of the media . "

the decision is sure to cause friction within germany 's coalition government . schwan , a 65-year-old university professor , was announced on monday , may 26 , as the social democratic party 's -lrb- spd -rrb- choice for the high-profile office of german president .
schwan nearly won the post five years ago , but lost out to horst koehler , a former head of the international monetary fund .
koehler has the support of chancellor angela merkel 's christian democratic union -lrb- cdu -rrb- , who wants to see him serve a second five-year term .
members of the cdu and its bavarian sister party , the christian social union -lrb- csu -rrb- , were upset to hear that the spd would put forth its own candidate .
the parties form a left-right coalition together .
chancellor merkel expressed her anger about the decision of her coalition partners to nominate their own candidate . " we have a president who is respected around the world , " merkel said .
" so it is regrettable that the social democrats have put up their own candidate in this step that can only be explained by the internal state of the party . ” schwan 's candidacy runs counter to a longstanding tradition observed by the two main political blocs not to put up a challenger to a president seeking a second term . " i believe that this candidacy will fail and that horst koehler will remain president , as is the wish of the majority of our citizens , " she added .
coalition will stay together bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : they do not always see eye to eye spd head hubertus heil said that he does not worry that the move will rupture the coalition ahead of federal elections , which are scheduled to take place in 2009 .
the csu also faces state elections in bavaria later this year .
" a little competition is n't going to cause any harm to a functioning democracy , " heil said .
" the csu is nervous ahead of the state elections in september .
i urge them just to relax . "
spd leader kurt beck said that his party would not " campaign against the incumbent . "
" in a democracy , we view a rival candidacy as a good opportunity for a broad discussion of the issues , " beck said monday .
merkel 's spokesman ulrich wilhelm also rejected any suggestion of the coalition breaking apart at a news conference .
" the chancellor has made it clear that the spd decision puts a strain on the coalition but that she , as well as the chairmen of the spd and csu , remains interested in carrying on the work on policies in the best interests of germany , " wilhelm said .
secret vote bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : koehler wants another five years schwan narrowly lost to koehler in 2004 when the cdu and free democrats -lrb- fdp -rrb- had a majority in the federal assembly , which is made up of members of parliament and delegates from each of germany 's 16 federal states .
the vote for president is done by secret ballot , meaning any federal assembly member can vote for any candidate .
the assembly meets every five years to elect a president .
the assembly vote for president will take place in may of 2009 .
political analysts say that center-left parties could have enough votes to elect schwan .
while the spd has refused to enter into a coalition with the left party in forming a government , it would presumably rely on the left and the greens to elect schwan . dw staff -lrb- th -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

after a week , they have isolated key issues splitting the ninth conference of the parties to the convention on biological diversity -lrb- cbd -rrb- that runs until may 30 .
on sunday , may 25 , they were told to forget weekend-break plans and attend extra sessions summoned by the chairman of the mammoth conference , german environment minister sigmar gabriel .
the delegates must find a way to preserve biological diversity on the planet .
despite a minimum of progress , decisive action to halt the global destruction of virgin natural sites like rain forests and to prevent the extinction of flora and fauna has not yet been agreed upon .
the talks have prompted greater public awareness and concern about the exploitation of natural resources for the profit of the few .
gabriel says the sheer survival of billions of people may depend on this meeting 's resolutions , and that most government officials have praised the " constructive " atmosphere in the debates .
that should move the talks forward , said gabriel , whose role as chairman has been important in setting the fast pace .
praise heaped on german hosts bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : gabriel and his colleagues have been praised for their work ahmed djoghlaf , chief of the un convention secretariat , has been unstinting in his praise of the germans and gabriel for their no-nonsense management of the negotiations .
it is a gargantuan task getting so many nations to agree .
like the un climate-change convention , the pact on biodiversity requires " consensus " decision-making by the 191 parties under the aegis of the united nations .
it takes only one nay-sayer to torpedo any agreement , so conflicting national interests must be balanced up .
there have been critics in bonn quietly suggesting that such a decision-making method is impossibly unwieldy , but no one openly proposes the alternative : voting and letting a majority decide .
conference managers shrug and say , " if we started a debate about making decisions by a majority , we 'd never hear the end of it . "
eradication of bio-piracy a key issue one of the key issues at the conference has been how to achieve access to the natural resources mankind needs , and at the same time compensate poor countries , for example for the use of their unique plant species as sources of drugs .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : protests focused on the abuse of natural resources there has been some progress towards drafting a bonn " road map " on future talks about this .
such a road map would lead to a treaty being adopted by the next biodiversity conference in nagoya , japan in 2010 .
gabriel says both developing and industrialized countries will benefit from having clear ground rules about profit-sharing with the poor nations .
nature reserve network plan under fire meanwhile , the idea of creating a world network of nature reserves on land and under the sea has caused antagonism .
sources in the delegations say there is little prospect of any deal .
environmentalist group greenpeace alleges that the industrialized world is not sufficiently willing to foot the bill .
developing nations say they can not afford to create reserves alone .
as a solution , gabriel has proposed a " life web , " in which poorer nations would offer specific tracts for adoption and rich nations would post the money to convert them to reserves .
some cash offers have already been made in bonn .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the price of bio-fuels on the environment is a key issue the environmental harm done by bio-fuel plantations has been a point of controversy , as had been expected .
gabriel describes the bonn meet as the first international conference to debate the emerging problem .
" that in itself is a success and a breakthrough , " he said .
brazil was the loudest of those who questioned whether the conference had any authority to discuss the topic , arguing that it was not within the ambit of a biodiversity convention .
in the end , brazil , which grows ethanol crops , agreed to the debate , but insisted it must not be pilloried as an offender .
delegates agreed that ecological guidelines should be drafted to demonstrate how bio-energy crops can be grown beneficially .
protestors target bio-fuels environmentalists have homed in on the bio-fuel trade as a target , and demanded the crops be banned .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : critics say bio-fuels add to the global food crisis the critics say the plantations wipe out forests , destroy plants which are useful in other ways and deny food output to the hungry .
the tempo of the talks is set to pick up this week with the end in sight and well over 100 environment ministers from the different countries set to arrive and head the delegations in the top-level phase from wednesday until friday .
environmentalists are hoping chancellor angela merkel , a former environment minister herself , will galvanize the talks when she speaks at the bonn meeting , perhaps with a ringing appeal for action or with a surprise pledge of funds . dw staff / dpa -lrb- nda -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

gay activists say the memorial is long overdue . seventy-five years ago nazis launched a series of raids and public book burnings aimed at homosexuals .
it was the start of adolf hitler ’ s crusade against homosexuality which saw an unknown number of gays arrested , tortured and murdered by the nazis .
the subject of nazi persecution of homosexuals has long been swept under the carpet .
yet a new memorial which opens tuesday , may 27 , will bring the past persecution and ongoing struggles of homosexuals to be accepted in society to the heart of the german capital .
showing a forbidden kiss bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the memorial will be officially unveiled this week the homosexual memorial will consist of a grey rectangular block some four meters -lrb- 13 feet -rrb- tall .
one side will have a small opening through which viewers will see a black and white art film scene of two men kissing .
" a simple kiss could land you in trouble , " says the text which accompanies the memorial .
the memorial was designed by the danish-norweigan artistic duo michael elmgreen and ingar dragset .
the memorial has a prominent place in berlin 's tiergarten park , half a block from brandenburg gate .
the monument sits across from the jewish holocaust memorial .
originally it was debated whether homosexuals should be included in the larger memorial before the decision was made to give homosexuals their own monument .
but the design corresponds to the holocaust memorial 's field of steles , a series of concrete blocks of varying sizes .
while the nazi persecution of the jews is well known , for many years there was little public acknowledgement of nazi atrocities towards homosexuals .
estimates put the number of homosexuals arrested by nazis at about 54,000 with 7,000 being killed in concentration camps .
" it is not easy for a gay man to live in this country and this society .
it 's important to remember that this society punished homosexuality for 20 years after national socialism ended , " said günter dworek of the federation of gays and lesbians in germany -lrb- lsvd -rrb- , a driving force behind the project .
gays making strides bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : berlin 's mayor is gay homosexuality remained illegal in germany until 1969 and was only formally decriminalized in 1994 .
it was n't until 2000 that germany 's parliament first passed a resolution acknowledging discrimination had occurred , dworek said .
the decision to fund the memorial , which cost 450,000 euros -lrb- $ 710,000 -rrb- , happened three years later .
the city 's current mayor , social democrat klaus wowereit , announced shortly before taking office seven years ago that he is gay .
wowereit 's legendary outing has given many others courage , dworek said .
" that opened a lot of people 's eyes .
you can not simply assume that politicians who already have a career behind them , like klaus wowereit , are by nature heterosexual , " dworek said .
germany also has a law which allows same-sex couples to register their partnerships .
yet many activists would like to see more , including anti-discrimination laws .
neo-nazi violence is still a very real threat , said albert eckert , head of the gay holocaust memorial committee . " but at last we have a monument to those who suffered and died under the nazis , " eckert said .
a tribute to hirschfeld bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : it is similar in style to the holocaust memorial eckert said he was also happy that the dedication was close to the birthday and death day of magnus hirschfeld , who died in exile in southern france on may 14 , 1935 .
a jewish homosexual , hirschfeld was a medical doctor who dedicated his life to the scientific study of homosexuality and lobbied the german government to repeal laws which outlawed gay sex .
the word " transsexual " was coined by hirschfeld to describe the phenomenon that he argued was a natural extension of human sexuality .
for his work , the nazis targeted hirschfeld as an example of decadent bolshevistic / jewish influence infecting the purity of the german people , luring the aryan race into impure and destructive perversity .
his institute was ransacked and his books were burned in rallies on may 10 , 1933 .
it was n't long before gay men were being rounded up and sent to mental hospitals or concentration camps .
" we have no idea how many thousands died in concentration camps because many were also jewish or were communists .
we know that many were left in prison after the war when post-war courts upheld the nazi jail sentences against them , " eckert says .
" anyone who was gay was automatically a criminal .
this monument is for all of them . "
making an international statement bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : a kiss can be a political statement the parliament decided on december 12 , 2003 to fund the homosexual memorial .
it was a nice birthday present for the green politician and well-known gay activist volker beck who turned 43 that day .
beck felt the memorial was especially important because the laws used to prosecute homosexuals continued long after the nazis had been defeated .
and persecution still exists in many countries today , making the memorial as important as ever , beck said .
he cites 80 countries which criminalize homosexual acts between consenting adults and 12 where the death penalty can be handed down .
beck believes germany 's memorial " sends an important signal that in this country , where in the past -lsb- homosexuals -rsb- were also systematically persecuted , we now have constructed a symbol against this human rights violation . " but homosexuals are still not fully accepted in society , beck said .
he worries about the refusal of some conservative christians and muslims to accept homosexuality .
beck said he does n't have any problem with the memorial 's design , which has come under criticism , particularly from women .
the first scene will portray men kissing , but later it will show women .
dworek said he is " downright happy " with the memorial 's design and likes the idea that the kissing scene will switch every two years .
" this will keep the memorial fresh .
there is always be something new , " dworek said .
" it will be a dynamic memorial . " dw staff -lrb- th -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

reyes ' death has been the biggest blow to the marxist guerrilla movement in latin america since farc , which has more than 17,000 members , was founded in the 1960s .
e-mail communication on reyes ' lap top show that the guerrilla leader had sent his son to germany on a secret mission in january 2005 .
in germany , reyes ' son had met with german communist party members , including wolfgang gehrcke , an extreme leftist politician , who said he would pressure the european parliament in strasbourg to remove the farc from its list of banned terrorist organizations .
the farc , which is believed to hold hundreds of people hostage including the case involving the highly publicized french-colombian politician ingrid betancourt , is also on washington 's watch list of terror groups .
it has also been accused of funding its insurgency through kidnapping for huge ransoms and trafficking cocaine .
the meeting between gehrcke and reyes ' son was described as “ very positive " in an e-mail found on reyes ' laptop .
" we were able to substantiate several points in support of the struggle of the colombian people , " quoted der spiegel in the email .
computer data found after the raid has already heightened tensions in south america , with colombian officials saying that they have substantiated links between the farc , ecuadoran and venezuelan president hugo chavez . dw staff -lrb- df -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de religion -pipe- 26.05.2008 germany 's ahmidiyya muslims celebrate 100 years großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : hazrat mirza masroor ahmad , the caliph of the ahmadiyya movement muslim missionaries found in western cities are often part of the messianic ahmidiyya movement .
the peaceful beliefs of ahmadis , who can be found in small numbers in germany , are seen as heretical by most muslims . it 's been 100 years since mirza ghulam ahmad founded the ahmadiyya muslim faith .
the controversial indian religious figure claimed to be the promised messiah awaited by all the major religions , whether christian , buddhist jewish or muslim .
his followers believed that within 300 years most of the world will join the islamic brotherhood , which will usher in an era of peace .
that goal implies worldwide missionary work , which has lead ahmadis , as the members of the ahmidiyya community call themselves , to proselitize the world .
they 've even ended up in the unlikely berlin neighborhood of pankow-heinersdorf .
with a new mosque under construction and 100th anniversary parties planned , mirza masroor ahmad will travel to berlin on tuesday , may 27 .
for his followers , the caliph is for followers a representative of the promised messiah .
he is democratically elected by the council of the ahmadiyyas and serves for life .
misunderstandings persist the title of " caliph " has been misunderstood by many in the west , said islamic scholar stephan rosiny .
a caliph is the political head of state in an islamic community .
while the practice of the worldly and spiritual leadership being united in the person of the caliph has its origins in the middle ages , modern islamists have used the idea as well .
a recent example was the so-called caliph of cologne , metin kaplan , who , until his movement was outlawed in 2001 dreamed of starting an islamic regime in europe .
“ to equate the ahmadis with something like that is pure sensationalism , ” rosiny said .
rosiny sees a perception problem due to people in the west viewing radical forms of islam as the norm rather than an exception .
rosiny said that islamic beliefs need to be taken in context .
caliph means successor and “ jihad ” for the ahmidiyya movement , as for most muslims , does not mean holy war but rather a struggle to improve oneself or society .
a peaceful movement the ahmadiyya movement stresses the peaceful aspects of islam .
it condemns islamist violence and spoke out against the fatwa against author salman rushdie for his novel “ the satanic verses . ”
“ love for all , hate for none ” is their motto .
yet the ahmidiyya movement is considered heretical by mainstream islam .
for most muslims , mohammed is the last and most important prophet , while ahmadis believe that he was followed by others .
that has won the movement enemies .
in 1974 , pakistan declared followers not to be muslims and legitimized violence against them .
the caliph moved to london .
long history of missionary work the group has been preaching in germany since the weimar republic .
in berlin 's wilmersdorf neighbourhood the splinter group called the lahore ahmadiyya movement opened a mosque in the 1920s .
it is an architectural gem which remains germany 's oldest mosque .
since the beginning of the systematic persecution in pakistan , many pakistani ahmadiyyas came as asylum seekers to germany .
worldwide there are between 10 and 80 million ahmadiyyas .
in pankow-heinersdorf in the northern part of berlin there are almost no muslims , much less ahmadis .
the neighbourhood was chosen for the 100th anniversary celebrations because the group 's first mosque in eastern germany is being built here .
the shell has just been completed after a long and vehement opposition from some of the public .
there were demonstrations and initiatives against the construction .
later , a truck parked at the construction site was burned , police believe it was arson .
“ i can understand the fear the people have , ” said abdullah wagishauser , a german convert , has been head of the group in germany since 1984 .
“ there is a fundamental distrust about islam . ”
wanting to be neighborly but his experience with other mosque projects is that dialogue and information can overcome this antagonism .
“ after one of two years we always have a fully normal neighbourly relationship , ” he said .
in the meantime they have tried to smooth things over with their neighbors .
in august the mosque will be opened and the first muslim will move into the area .
he wo n't be a missionary , but rather the mosque 's imam . oliver samson -lrb- th -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

it is intended to replace the current partnership and cooperation agreement -lrb- pca -rrb- , which ran out in 2007 , and should include legally-binding measures on such issues as energy , security , trade and education . negotiations are to be formally launched in siberia on june 26-27 , when new president dmitry medvedev will represent russia for the first time .
they were only made possible after lithuania , the last eu member to block the talks , was assured that its concerns about energy supply and moscow 's stance on georgia would be addressed . officials in brussels predict complex negotiations with moscow are likely to last about a year , with a further year required for its ratification by eu member states and russia . eu ministers also listened to polish plans for strengthening ties with ukraine , moldova , georgia , armenia , azerbaijan and , eventually , belarus . supported by sweden and blessed by heavyweights france and germany , the so-called eastern partnership comes on the back of french plans to boost the eu 's ties with its southern neighbors in a union for the mediterranean . visa-free travel in sight according to a text seen by german news agency dpa , the proposed eastern partnership would seek to deepen cooperation and focus on concrete proposals in the area of migration , with an eye to moving towards a visa-free regime . it would also seek to create a free trade area , provide support for reforms designed to bring those countries up to eu standards , and arrange more student exchange programs . the partnership would use existing neighborhood funds and would have an institutional structure that is " as light-weight and goal-oriented as possible . " human rights , a frequent bone of contention under russia 's former president vladimir putin , and energy supply are also likely to become major topics of discussion . benita ferrero-waldner , the commissioner in charge of the eu 's external relations , said the eu executive would only support the plan if it provided " added value " and did not duplicate existing eu policies . " the negotiation will certainly not be easy … i think they will take quite some time , " she said . poland advocates eastern focus polish and swedish diplomats say the partnership will encourage " multilateral cooperation " and " foster regional links . " cooperation with belarus , whose democratic credentials have been thrown into question , would initially take place only on a " technical and expert level . " the polish-swedish plan was welcomed by the czech republic , which is due to take over the rotating presidency of the eu on jan .
1 . france , which launched the idea of the mediterranean union , is due to hold the eu presidency from july 1 this year . " this year is the mediterranean year , next year would be the eastern year , " said the czech deputy prime minister for european affairs , alexander vondra . kosovo handover unrealistic another major issue up for discussion in brussels is the bloc 's eu-lex law mission in kosovo . the mission was originally meant to take over the administration of the newly independent country from the united nations on june 15 . but eu officials now concede that legal and logistical difficulties mean that the deadline is unrealistic . " eu-lex is going slowly but surely , " said slovenian foreign minister dimitrij rupel , who chaired monday 's meeting as current eu president . dw staff with dpa news reports -lrb- kjb -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

gay activists say the memorial is long overdue . seventy-five years ago nazis launched a series of raids and public book burnings aimed at homosexuals .
it was the start of adolf hitler ’ s crusade against homosexuality which saw an unknown number of gays arrested , tortured and murdered by the nazis .
the subject of nazi persecution of homosexuals has long been swept under the carpet .
yet a new memorial which opens tuesday , may 27 , will bring the past persecution and ongoing struggles of homosexuals to be accepted in society to the heart of the german capital .
showing a forbidden kiss bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the memorial will be officially unveiled this week the homosexual memorial will consist of a grey rectangular block some four meters -lrb- 13 feet -rrb- tall .
one side will have a small opening through which viewers will see a black and white art film scene of two men kissing .
" a simple kiss could land you in trouble , " says the text which accompanies the memorial .
the memorial was designed by the danish-norweigan artistic duo michael elmgreen and ingar dragset .
the memorial has a prominent place in berlin 's tiergarten park , half a block from brandenburg gate .
the monument sits across from the jewish holocaust memorial .
originally it was debated whether homosexuals should be included in the larger memorial before the decision was made to give homosexuals their own monument .
but the design corresponds to the holocaust memorial 's field of steles , a series of concrete blocks of varying sizes .
while the nazi persecution of the jews is well known , for many years there was little public acknowledgement of nazi atrocities towards homosexuals .
estimates put the number of homosexuals arrested by nazis at about 54,000 with 7,000 being killed in concentration camps .
" it is not easy for a gay man to live in this country and this society .
it 's important to remember that this society punished homosexuality for 20 years after national socialism ended , " said günter dworek of the federation of gays and lesbians in germany -lrb- lsvd -rrb- , a driving force behind the project .
gays making strides bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : berlin 's mayor is gay homosexuality remained illegal in germany until 1969 and was only formally decriminalized in 1994 .
it was n't until 2000 that germany 's parliament first passed a resolution acknowledging discrimination had occurred , dworek said .
the decision to fund the memorial , which cost 450,000 euros -lrb- $ 710,000 -rrb- , happened three years later .
the city 's current mayor , social democrat klaus wowereit , announced shortly before taking office seven years ago that he is gay .
wowereit 's legendary outing has given many others courage , dworek said .
" that opened a lot of people 's eyes .
you can not simply assume that politicians who already have a career behind them , like klaus wowereit , are by nature heterosexual , " dworek said .
germany also has a law which allows same-sex couples to register their partnerships .
yet many activists would like to see more , including anti-discrimination laws .
neo-nazi violence is still a very real threat , said albert eckert , head of the gay holocaust memorial committee . " but at last we have a monument to those who suffered and died under the nazis , " eckert said .
a tribute to hirschfeld bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : it is similar in style to the holocaust memorial eckert said he was also happy that the dedication was close to the birthday and death day of magnus hirschfeld , who died in exile in southern france on may 14 , 1935 .
a jewish homosexual , hirschfeld was a medical doctor who dedicated his life to the scientific study of homosexuality and lobbied the german government to repeal laws which outlawed gay sex .
the word " transsexual " was coined by hirschfeld to describe the phenomenon that he argued was a natural extension of human sexuality .
for his work , the nazis targeted hirschfeld as an example of decadent bolshevistic / jewish influence infecting the purity of the german people , luring the aryan race into impure and destructive perversity .
his institute was ransacked and his books were burned in rallies on may 10 , 1933 .
it was n't long before gay men were being rounded up and sent to mental hospitals or concentration camps .
" we have no idea how many thousands died in concentration camps because many were also jewish or were communists .
we know that many were left in prison after the war when post-war courts upheld the nazi jail sentences against them , " eckert says .
" anyone who was gay was automatically a criminal .
this monument is for all of them . "
making an international statement bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : a kiss can be a political statement the parliament decided on december 12 , 2003 to fund the homosexual memorial .
it was a nice birthday present for the green politician and well-known gay activist volker beck who turned 43 that day .
beck felt the memorial was especially important because the laws used to prosecute homosexuals continued long after the nazis had been defeated .
and persecution still exists in many countries today , making the memorial as important as ever , beck said .
he cites 80 countries which criminalize homosexual acts between consenting adults and 12 where the death penalty can be handed down .
beck believes germany 's memorial " sends an important signal that in this country , where in the past -lsb- homosexuals -rsb- were also systematically persecuted , we now have constructed a symbol against this human rights violation . " but homosexuals are still not fully accepted in society , beck said .
he worries about the refusal of some conservative christians and muslims to accept homosexuality .
beck said he does n't have any problem with the memorial 's design , which has come under criticism , particularly from women .
the first scene will portray men kissing , but later it will show women .
dworek said he is " downright happy " with the memorial 's design and likes the idea that the kissing scene will switch every two years .
" this will keep the memorial fresh .
there is always be something new , " dworek said .

gay activists say the memorial is long overdue . seventy-five years ago nazis launched a series of raids and public book burnings aimed at homosexuals .
it was the start of adolf hitler ’ s crusade against homosexuality which saw an unknown number of gays arrested , tortured and murdered by the nazis .
the subject of nazi persecution of homosexuals has long been swept under the carpet .
yet a new memorial which opens tuesday , may 27 , will bring the past persecution and ongoing struggles of homosexuals to be accepted in society to the heart of the german capital .
showing a forbidden kiss bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the memorial will be officially unveiled this week the homosexual memorial will consist of a grey rectangular block some four meters -lrb- 13 feet -rrb- tall .
one side will have a small opening through which viewers will see a black and white art film scene of two men kissing .
" a simple kiss could land you in trouble , " says the text which accompanies the memorial .
the memorial was designed by the danish-norweigan artistic duo michael elmgreen and ingar dragset .
the memorial has a prominent place in berlin 's tiergarten park , half a block from brandenburg gate .
the monument sits across from the jewish holocaust memorial .
originally it was debated whether homosexuals should be included in the larger memorial before the decision was made to give homosexuals their own monument .
but the design corresponds to the holocaust memorial 's field of steles , a series of concrete blocks of varying sizes .
while the nazi persecution of the jews is well known , for many years there was little public acknowledgement of nazi atrocities towards homosexuals .
estimates put the number of homosexuals arrested by nazis at about 54,000 with 7,000 being killed in concentration camps .
" it is not easy for a gay man to live in this country and this society .
it 's important to remember that this society punished homosexuality for 20 years after national socialism ended , " said günter dworek of the federation of gays and lesbians in germany -lrb- lsvd -rrb- , a driving force behind the project .
gays making strides bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : berlin 's mayor is gay homosexuality remained illegal in germany until 1969 and was only formally decriminalized in 1994 .
it was n't until 2000 that germany 's parliament first passed a resolution acknowledging discrimination had occurred , dworek said .
the decision to fund the memorial , which cost 450,000 euros -lrb- $ 710,000 -rrb- , happened three years later .
the city 's current mayor , social democrat klaus wowereit , announced shortly before taking office seven years ago that he is gay .
wowereit 's legendary outing has given many others courage , dworek said .
" that opened a lot of people 's eyes .
you can not simply assume that politicians who already have a career behind them , like klaus wowereit , are by nature heterosexual , " dworek said .
germany also has a law which allows same-sex couples to register their partnerships .
yet many activists would like to see more , including anti-discrimination laws .
neo-nazi violence is still a very real threat , said albert eckert , head of the gay holocaust memorial committee . " but at last we have a monument to those who suffered and died under the nazis , " eckert said .
a tribute to hirschfeld bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : it is similar in style to the holocaust memorial eckert said he was also happy that the dedication was close to the birthday and death day of magnus hirschfeld , who died in exile in southern france on may 14 , 1935 .
a jewish homosexual , hirschfeld was a medical doctor who dedicated his life to the scientific study of homosexuality and lobbied the german government to repeal laws which outlawed gay sex .
the word " transsexual " was coined by hirschfeld to describe the phenomenon that he argued was a natural extension of human sexuality .
for his work , the nazis targeted hirschfeld as an example of decadent bolshevistic / jewish influence infecting the purity of the german people , luring the aryan race into impure and destructive perversity .
his institute was ransacked and his books were burned in rallies on may 10 , 1933 .
it was n't long before gay men were being rounded up and sent to mental hospitals or concentration camps .
" we have no idea how many thousands died in concentration camps because many were also jewish or were communists .
we know that many were left in prison after the war when post-war courts upheld the nazi jail sentences against them , " eckert says .
" anyone who was gay was automatically a criminal .
this monument is for all of them . "
making an international statement bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : a kiss can be a political statement the parliament decided on december 12 , 2003 to fund the homosexual memorial .
it was a nice birthday present for the green politician and well-known gay activist volker beck who turned 43 that day .
beck felt the memorial was especially important because the laws used to prosecute homosexuals continued long after the nazis had been defeated .
and persecution still exists in many countries today , making the memorial as important as ever , beck said .
he cites 80 countries which criminalize homosexual acts between consenting adults and 12 where the death penalty can be handed down .
beck believes germany 's memorial " sends an important signal that in this country , where in the past -lsb- homosexuals -rsb- were also systematically persecuted , we now have constructed a symbol against this human rights violation . " but homosexuals are still not fully accepted in society , beck said .

reyes ' death has been the biggest blow to the marxist guerrilla movement in latin america since farc , which has more than 17,000 members , was founded in the 1960s .
e-mail communication on reyes ' lap top show that the guerrilla leader had sent his son to germany on a secret mission in january 2005 .
in germany , reyes ' son had met with german communist party members , including wolfgang gehrcke , an extreme leftist politician , who said he would pressure the european parliament in strasbourg to remove the farc from its list of banned terrorist organizations .
the farc , which is believed to hold hundreds of people hostage including the case involving the highly publicized french-colombian politician ingrid betancourt , is also on washington 's watch list of terror groups .
it has also been accused of funding its insurgency through kidnapping for huge ransoms and trafficking cocaine .
the meeting between gehrcke and reyes ' son was described as “ very positive " in an e-mail found on reyes ' laptop .
" we were able to substantiate several points in support of the struggle of the colombian people , " quoted der spiegel in the email .

the decision is sure to cause friction within germany 's coalition government . schwan , a 65-year-old university professor , was announced on monday , may 26 , as the social democratic party 's -lrb- spd -rrb- choice for the high-profile office of german president .
schwan nearly won the post five years ago , but lost out to horst koehler , a former head of the international monetary fund .
koehler has the support of chancellor angela merkel 's christian democratic union -lrb- cdu -rrb- , who wants to see him serve a second five-year term .
members of the cdu and its bavarian sister party , the christian social union -lrb- csu -rrb- , were upset to hear that the spd would put forth its own candidate .
the parties form a left-right coalition together .
chancellor merkel expressed her anger about the decision of her coalition partners to nominate their own candidate . " we have a president who is respected around the world , " merkel said .
" so it is regrettable that the social democrats have put up their own candidate in this step that can only be explained by the internal state of the party . ” schwan 's candidacy runs counter to a longstanding tradition observed by the two main political blocs not to put up a challenger to a president seeking a second term . " i believe that this candidacy will fail and that horst koehler will remain president , as is the wish of the majority of our citizens , " she added .
coalition will stay together bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : they do not always see eye to eye spd head hubertus heil said that he does not worry that the move will rupture the coalition ahead of federal elections , which are scheduled to take place in 2009 .
the csu also faces state elections in bavaria later this year .
" a little competition is n't going to cause any harm to a functioning democracy , " heil said .
" the csu is nervous ahead of the state elections in september .
i urge them just to relax . "
spd leader kurt beck said that his party would not " campaign against the incumbent . "
" in a democracy , we view a rival candidacy as a good opportunity for a broad discussion of the issues , " beck said monday .
merkel 's spokesman ulrich wilhelm also rejected any suggestion of the coalition breaking apart at a news conference .
" the chancellor has made it clear that the spd decision puts a strain on the coalition but that she , as well as the chairmen of the spd and csu , remains interested in carrying on the work on policies in the best interests of germany , " wilhelm said .
secret vote bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : koehler wants another five years schwan narrowly lost to koehler in 2004 when the cdu and free democrats -lrb- fdp -rrb- had a majority in the federal assembly , which is made up of members of parliament and delegates from each of germany 's 16 federal states .
the vote for president is done by secret ballot , meaning any federal assembly member can vote for any candidate .
the assembly meets every five years to elect a president .
the assembly vote for president will take place in may of 2009 .
political analysts say that center-left parties could have enough votes to elect schwan .
while the spd has refused to enter into a coalition with the left party in forming a government , it would presumably rely on the left and the greens to elect schwan . dw staff -lrb- th -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

the decision is sure to cause friction within germany 's coalition government . schwan , a 65-year-old university professor , was announced on monday , may 26 , as the social democratic party 's -lrb- spd -rrb- choice for the high-profile office of german president .
schwan nearly won the post five years ago , but lost out to horst koehler , a former head of the international monetary fund .
koehler has the support of chancellor angela merkel 's christian democratic union -lrb- cdu -rrb- , who wants to see him serve a second five-year term .
members of the cdu and its bavarian sister party , the christian social union -lrb- csu -rrb- , were upset to hear that the spd would put forth its own candidate .
the parties form a left-right coalition together .
chancellor merkel expressed her anger about the decision of her coalition partners to nominate their own candidate . " we have a president who is respected around the world , " merkel said .
" so it is regrettable that the social democrats have put up their own candidate in this step that can only be explained by the internal state of the party . ” schwan 's candidacy runs counter to a longstanding tradition observed by the two main political blocs not to put up a challenger to a president seeking a second term . " i believe that this candidacy will fail and that horst koehler will remain president , as is the wish of the majority of our citizens , " she added .
coalition will stay together bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : they do not always see eye to eye spd head hubertus heil said that he does not worry that the move will rupture the coalition ahead of federal elections , which are scheduled to take place in 2009 .
the csu also faces state elections in bavaria later this year .
" a little competition is n't going to cause any harm to a functioning democracy , " heil said .
" the csu is nervous ahead of the state elections in september .
i urge them just to relax . "
spd leader kurt beck said that his party would not " campaign against the incumbent . "
" in a democracy , we view a rival candidacy as a good opportunity for a broad discussion of the issues , " beck said monday .
merkel 's spokesman ulrich wilhelm also rejected any suggestion of the coalition breaking apart at a news conference .
" the chancellor has made it clear that the spd decision puts a strain on the coalition but that she , as well as the chairmen of the spd and csu , remains interested in carrying on the work on policies in the best interests of germany , " wilhelm said .
secret vote bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : koehler wants another five years schwan narrowly lost to koehler in 2004 when the cdu and free democrats -lrb- fdp -rrb- had a majority in the federal assembly , which is made up of members of parliament and delegates from each of germany 's 16 federal states .
the vote for president is done by secret ballot , meaning any federal assembly member can vote for any candidate .
the assembly meets every five years to elect a president .
the assembly vote for president will take place in may of 2009 .
political analysts say that center-left parties could have enough votes to elect schwan .
while the spd has refused to enter into a coalition with the left party in forming a government , it would presumably rely on the left and the greens to elect schwan . dw staff -lrb- th -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

it should also boost employment in the region . the express mail delivery and logistics company dhl , which is a division of germany 's postal giant deutsche post ag , inaugurated its principle european hub at leipzig-halle airport in eastern germany on monday , may 26 .
in 2004 , deutsche post had already announced the planned move from brussels to leipzig , since the belgian capital refused to permit additional nighttime flights .
dhl added that besides being able to operate around the clock in leipzig , the central european location was ideal as a hub for emerging markets in eastern europe and asia .
" demand for express services is growing worldwide , " said the new ceo of the post ag parent company , frank appel at the opening ceremony attended by prominent politicians , such as german foreign minister frank-walter steinmeier .
" this is a day to be proud of .
we are looking towards the future , " he said .
georg milbradt , the state premier of saxony , where leipzig is the capital , hailed the move as a " job motor " which will help boost the economy in the eastern states , which have higher unemployment rates than in the west .
at present dhl already operates flights to the middle east and india from leipzig-halle , where it plans to increase its personnel from about 2,000 to 3,500 employees by 2012 .

the peaceful beliefs of ahmadis , who can be found in small numbers in germany , are seen as heretical by most muslims . it 's been 100 years since mirza ghulam ahmad founded the ahmadiyya muslim faith .
the controversial indian religious figure claimed to be the promised messiah awaited by all the major religions , whether christian , buddhist jewish or muslim .
his followers believed that within 300 years most of the world will join the islamic brotherhood , which will usher in an era of peace .
that goal implies worldwide missionary work , which has lead ahmadis , as the members of the ahmidiyya community call themselves , to proselitize the world .
they 've even ended up in the unlikely berlin neighborhood of pankow-heinersdorf .
with a new mosque under construction and 100th anniversary parties planned , mirza masroor ahmad will travel to berlin on tuesday , may 27 .
for his followers , the caliph is for followers a representative of the promised messiah .
he is democratically elected by the council of the ahmadiyyas and serves for life .
misunderstandings persist the title of " caliph " has been misunderstood by many in the west , said islamic scholar stephan rosiny .
a caliph is the political head of state in an islamic community .
while the practice of the worldly and spiritual leadership being united in the person of the caliph has its origins in the middle ages , modern islamists have used the idea as well .
a recent example was the so-called caliph of cologne , metin kaplan , who , until his movement was outlawed in 2001 dreamed of starting an islamic regime in europe .
“ to equate the ahmadis with something like that is pure sensationalism , ” rosiny said .
rosiny sees a perception problem due to people in the west viewing radical forms of islam as the norm rather than an exception .
rosiny said that islamic beliefs need to be taken in context .
caliph means successor and “ jihad ” for the ahmidiyya movement , as for most muslims , does not mean holy war but rather a struggle to improve oneself or society .
a peaceful movement the ahmadiyya movement stresses the peaceful aspects of islam .
it condemns islamist violence and spoke out against the fatwa against author salman rushdie for his novel “ the satanic verses . ”
“ love for all , hate for none ” is their motto .
yet the ahmidiyya movement is considered heretical by mainstream islam .
for most muslims , mohammed is the last and most important prophet , while ahmadis believe that he was followed by others .
that has won the movement enemies .
in 1974 , pakistan declared followers not to be muslims and legitimized violence against them .
the caliph moved to london .
long history of missionary work the group has been preaching in germany since the weimar republic .
in berlin 's wilmersdorf neighbourhood the splinter group called the lahore ahmadiyya movement opened a mosque in the 1920s .
it is an architectural gem which remains germany 's oldest mosque .
since the beginning of the systematic persecution in pakistan , many pakistani ahmadiyyas came as asylum seekers to germany .
worldwide there are between 10 and 80 million ahmadiyyas .
in pankow-heinersdorf in the northern part of berlin there are almost no muslims , much less ahmadis .
the neighbourhood was chosen for the 100th anniversary celebrations because the group 's first mosque in eastern germany is being built here .
the shell has just been completed after a long and vehement opposition from some of the public .
there were demonstrations and initiatives against the construction .
later , a truck parked at the construction site was burned , police believe it was arson .
“ i can understand the fear the people have , ” said abdullah wagishauser , a german convert , has been head of the group in germany since 1984 .
“ there is a fundamental distrust about islam . ”
wanting to be neighborly but his experience with other mosque projects is that dialogue and information can overcome this antagonism .
“ after one of two years we always have a fully normal neighbourly relationship , ” he said .

the peaceful beliefs of ahmadis , who can be found in small numbers in germany , are seen as heretical by most muslims . it 's been 100 years since mirza ghulam ahmad founded the ahmadiyya muslim faith .
the controversial indian religious figure claimed to be the promised messiah awaited by all the major religions , whether christian , buddhist jewish or muslim .
his followers believed that within 300 years most of the world will join the islamic brotherhood , which will usher in an era of peace .
that goal implies worldwide missionary work , which has lead ahmadis , as the members of the ahmidiyya community call themselves , to proselitize the world .
they 've even ended up in the unlikely berlin neighborhood of pankow-heinersdorf .
with a new mosque under construction and 100th anniversary parties planned , mirza masroor ahmad will travel to berlin on tuesday , may 27 .
for his followers , the caliph is for followers a representative of the promised messiah .
he is democratically elected by the council of the ahmadiyyas and serves for life .
misunderstandings persist the title of " caliph " has been misunderstood by many in the west , said islamic scholar stephan rosiny .
a caliph is the political head of state in an islamic community .
while the practice of the worldly and spiritual leadership being united in the person of the caliph has its origins in the middle ages , modern islamists have used the idea as well .
a recent example was the so-called caliph of cologne , metin kaplan , who , until his movement was outlawed in 2001 dreamed of starting an islamic regime in europe .
“ to equate the ahmadis with something like that is pure sensationalism , ” rosiny said .
rosiny sees a perception problem due to people in the west viewing radical forms of islam as the norm rather than an exception .
rosiny said that islamic beliefs need to be taken in context .
caliph means successor and “ jihad ” for the ahmidiyya movement , as for most muslims , does not mean holy war but rather a struggle to improve oneself or society .
a peaceful movement the ahmadiyya movement stresses the peaceful aspects of islam .
it condemns islamist violence and spoke out against the fatwa against author salman rushdie for his novel “ the satanic verses . ”
“ love for all , hate for none ” is their motto .
yet the ahmidiyya movement is considered heretical by mainstream islam .
for most muslims , mohammed is the last and most important prophet , while ahmadis believe that he was followed by others .
that has won the movement enemies .
in 1974 , pakistan declared followers not to be muslims and legitimized violence against them .
the caliph moved to london .
long history of missionary work the group has been preaching in germany since the weimar republic .
in berlin 's wilmersdorf neighbourhood the splinter group called the lahore ahmadiyya movement opened a mosque in the 1920s .
it is an architectural gem which remains germany 's oldest mosque .
since the beginning of the systematic persecution in pakistan , many pakistani ahmadiyyas came as asylum seekers to germany .
worldwide there are between 10 and 80 million ahmadiyyas .
in pankow-heinersdorf in the northern part of berlin there are almost no muslims , much less ahmadis .
the neighbourhood was chosen for the 100th anniversary celebrations because the group 's first mosque in eastern germany is being built here .
the shell has just been completed after a long and vehement opposition from some of the public .
there were demonstrations and initiatives against the construction .
later , a truck parked at the construction site was burned , police believe it was arson .
“ i can understand the fear the people have , ” said abdullah wagishauser , a german convert , has been head of the group in germany since 1984 .
“ there is a fundamental distrust about islam . ”
wanting to be neighborly but his experience with other mosque projects is that dialogue and information can overcome this antagonism .
“ after one of two years we always have a fully normal neighbourly relationship , ” he said .
in the meantime they have tried to smooth things over with their neighbors .
in august the mosque will be opened and the first muslim will move into the area .
he wo n't be a missionary , but rather the mosque 's imam . oliver samson -lrb- th -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

it boasts an estimated 73,500 members germany-wide and , with 10 to 14 percent of the national vote , is the country 's third largest party next to the social democratic party -lrb- spd -rrb- and the christian democratic union -lrb- cdu -rrb- . " we are being hailed as the most successful new party in decades and they say we are setting the political agenda in germany , " lafontaine told some 600 supporters at the party 's first national convention , over the weekend , in the eastern town of cottbus . dubbed germany 's " secret chancellor " by the media , the 64-year-old former spd chairman was re-elected head of the left at the conference , though with 10 percent fewer votes than last year . party platform includes drastic reforms during the convention , the party proposed a 50-billion-euro federal program that foresees the creation of publicly funded jobs and a nationwide minimum wage of 10 euros per hour -lrb- $ 15.77 -rrb- .
it also includes a ban on layoffs in profitable firms and higher property , corporate and inheritance taxes to balance the national deficit . in addition , lafontaine spoke out against nato , calling it a us-led military machine that violates human rights around the world .
the left said it strictly rejects " all domestic and foreign military operations " and called for the removal of german troops from afghanistan . referring to recent troubles on global financial markets , the party chief also presented a 12-point plan to counter what he called the " perversity " of market-driven capitalism , which included a ban on hedge funds and stock options . " we are having a huge influence , " said kathrin vogler , a delegate from the western state of north rhine-westphalia .
the 44-year-old had been a member of the spd for 18 years before joining the left party .
" we raise these issues and berlin shakes . " questionable dealings with communism quickly becoming an influential political force over the past year , the left has shifted the balance of party politics , forcing the cdu and the spd to rethink their traditional coalition formations . but despite its popularity , the party has regularly been dogged by controversy .
ahead of the cottbus convention , left member sahra wagenknecht was forced to drop her candidacy for deputy party leader because of her involvement in the communist platform , an organization that advocates the overthrow of capitalism and is monitored by germany 's intelligence apparatus . last week , newly opened stasi archives suggested that gregor gysi , parliamentary leader for the left , may have been an informer for the east german secret police .
he has refuted the accusations . bildunterschrift : both the chair , oskar lafontaine -lrb- left -rrb- , and co-chair of the left , lothar bisky , were re-elected at the convention dw staff -lrb- kjb -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

it is intended to replace the current partnership and cooperation agreement -lrb- pca -rrb- , which ran out in 2007 , and should include legally-binding measures on such issues as energy , security , trade and education . negotiations are to be formally launched in siberia on june 26-27 , when new president dmitry medvedev will represent russia for the first time .
they were only made possible after lithuania , the last eu member to block the talks , was assured that its concerns about energy supply and moscow 's stance on georgia would be addressed . officials in brussels predict complex negotiations with moscow are likely to last about a year , with a further year required for its ratification by eu member states and russia . eu ministers also listened to polish plans for strengthening ties with ukraine , moldova , georgia , armenia , azerbaijan and , eventually , belarus . supported by sweden and blessed by heavyweights france and germany , the so-called eastern partnership comes on the back of french plans to boost the eu 's ties with its southern neighbors in a union for the mediterranean . visa-free travel in sight according to a text seen by german news agency dpa , the proposed eastern partnership would seek to deepen cooperation and focus on concrete proposals in the area of migration , with an eye to moving towards a visa-free regime . it would also seek to create a free trade area , provide support for reforms designed to bring those countries up to eu standards , and arrange more student exchange programs . the partnership would use existing neighborhood funds and would have an institutional structure that is " as light-weight and goal-oriented as possible . " human rights , a frequent bone of contention under russia 's former president vladimir putin , and energy supply are also likely to become major topics of discussion . benita ferrero-waldner , the commissioner in charge of the eu 's external relations , said the eu executive would only support the plan if it provided " added value " and did not duplicate existing eu policies . " the negotiation will certainly not be easy … i think they will take quite some time , " she said . poland advocates eastern focus polish and swedish diplomats say the partnership will encourage " multilateral cooperation " and " foster regional links . " cooperation with belarus , whose democratic credentials have been thrown into question , would initially take place only on a " technical and expert level . " the polish-swedish plan was welcomed by the czech republic , which is due to take over the rotating presidency of the eu on jan .
1 . france , which launched the idea of the mediterranean union , is due to hold the eu presidency from july 1 this year . " this year is the mediterranean year , next year would be the eastern year , " said the czech deputy prime minister for european affairs , alexander vondra . kosovo handover unrealistic another major issue up for discussion in brussels is the bloc 's eu-lex law mission in kosovo . the mission was originally meant to take over the administration of the newly independent country from the united nations on june 15 . but eu officials now concede that legal and logistical difficulties mean that the deadline is unrealistic . " eu-lex is going slowly but surely , " said slovenian foreign minister dimitrij rupel , who chaired monday 's meeting as current eu president . dw staff with dpa news reports -lrb- kjb -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

after a week , they have isolated key issues splitting the ninth conference of the parties to the convention on biological diversity -lrb- cbd -rrb- that runs until may 30 .
on sunday , may 25 , they were told to forget weekend-break plans and attend extra sessions summoned by the chairman of the mammoth conference , german environment minister sigmar gabriel .
the delegates must find a way to preserve biological diversity on the planet .
despite a minimum of progress , decisive action to halt the global destruction of virgin natural sites like rain forests and to prevent the extinction of flora and fauna has not yet been agreed upon .
the talks have prompted greater public awareness and concern about the exploitation of natural resources for the profit of the few .
gabriel says the sheer survival of billions of people may depend on this meeting 's resolutions , and that most government officials have praised the " constructive " atmosphere in the debates .
that should move the talks forward , said gabriel , whose role as chairman has been important in setting the fast pace .
praise heaped on german hosts bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : gabriel and his colleagues have been praised for their work ahmed djoghlaf , chief of the un convention secretariat , has been unstinting in his praise of the germans and gabriel for their no-nonsense management of the negotiations .
it is a gargantuan task getting so many nations to agree .
like the un climate-change convention , the pact on biodiversity requires " consensus " decision-making by the 191 parties under the aegis of the united nations .
it takes only one nay-sayer to torpedo any agreement , so conflicting national interests must be balanced up .
there have been critics in bonn quietly suggesting that such a decision-making method is impossibly unwieldy , but no one openly proposes the alternative : voting and letting a majority decide .
conference managers shrug and say , " if we started a debate about making decisions by a majority , we 'd never hear the end of it . "
eradication of bio-piracy a key issue one of the key issues at the conference has been how to achieve access to the natural resources mankind needs , and at the same time compensate poor countries , for example for the use of their unique plant species as sources of drugs .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : protests focused on the abuse of natural resources there has been some progress towards drafting a bonn " road map " on future talks about this .
such a road map would lead to a treaty being adopted by the next biodiversity conference in nagoya , japan in 2010 .
gabriel says both developing and industrialized countries will benefit from having clear ground rules about profit-sharing with the poor nations .
nature reserve network plan under fire meanwhile , the idea of creating a world network of nature reserves on land and under the sea has caused antagonism .
sources in the delegations say there is little prospect of any deal .
environmentalist group greenpeace alleges that the industrialized world is not sufficiently willing to foot the bill .
developing nations say they can not afford to create reserves alone .
as a solution , gabriel has proposed a " life web , " in which poorer nations would offer specific tracts for adoption and rich nations would post the money to convert them to reserves .
some cash offers have already been made in bonn .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the price of bio-fuels on the environment is a key issue the environmental harm done by bio-fuel plantations has been a point of controversy , as had been expected .
gabriel describes the bonn meet as the first international conference to debate the emerging problem .
" that in itself is a success and a breakthrough , " he said .
brazil was the loudest of those who questioned whether the conference had any authority to discuss the topic , arguing that it was not within the ambit of a biodiversity convention .
in the end , brazil , which grows ethanol crops , agreed to the debate , but insisted it must not be pilloried as an offender .
delegates agreed that ecological guidelines should be drafted to demonstrate how bio-energy crops can be grown beneficially .
protestors target bio-fuels environmentalists have homed in on the bio-fuel trade as a target , and demanded the crops be banned .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : critics say bio-fuels add to the global food crisis the critics say the plantations wipe out forests , destroy plants which are useful in other ways and deny food output to the hungry .
the tempo of the talks is set to pick up this week with the end in sight and well over 100 environment ministers from the different countries set to arrive and head the delegations in the top-level phase from wednesday until friday .

after a week , they have isolated key issues splitting the ninth conference of the parties to the convention on biological diversity -lrb- cbd -rrb- that runs until may 30 .
on sunday , may 25 , they were told to forget weekend-break plans and attend extra sessions summoned by the chairman of the mammoth conference , german environment minister sigmar gabriel .
the delegates must find a way to preserve biological diversity on the planet .
despite a minimum of progress , decisive action to halt the global destruction of virgin natural sites like rain forests and to prevent the extinction of flora and fauna has not yet been agreed upon .
the talks have prompted greater public awareness and concern about the exploitation of natural resources for the profit of the few .
gabriel says the sheer survival of billions of people may depend on this meeting 's resolutions , and that most government officials have praised the " constructive " atmosphere in the debates .

like the un climate-change convention , the pact on biodiversity requires " consensus " decision-making by the 191 parties under the aegis of the united nations .
it takes only one nay-sayer to torpedo any agreement , so conflicting national interests must be balanced up .
there have been critics in bonn quietly suggesting that such a decision-making method is impossibly unwieldy , but no one openly proposes the alternative : voting and letting a majority decide .
conference managers shrug and say , " if we started a debate about making decisions by a majority , we 'd never hear the end of it . "

" there are going to be harsh consequences " if allegations that deutsche telekom spied on company officials and journalists by monitoring phone traffic between them in order to uncover the source of information leaks are true , said ceo rene obermann in a statement published in the german mass circulation bild zeitung on monday , may 26 .
" this is a breach of our data privacy laws .
cases of misconduct must be clarified , " said obermann , who assured telekom customers that their phone records would remain confidential .
" the billing records of our millions of fixed-line and mobile customers remain secure , " he said , adding that he has faith in telekom 's 240,000 employees .
the alleged misconduct took place over the course of more than a year in 2005-2006 under obermann 's predecessor kai-uwe ricke , who was ousted at a time of diminishing profits and management disputes .
" earth-shattering " ricke and klaus zumwinkel , who was head of the telecom giant 's supervisory board at the time , both denied commissioning the analysis of the data , which recorded the numbers dialed and the time and the duration of phone calls . obermann was head of the mobile division of deutsche telekom at the time .
hundreds of thousands of phone calls made by top management and supervisory board members were monitored , but not tapped , according to newsmagazine " der spiegel . "
a private berlin agency has been analyzing the data .
numerous phone calls out of new york were also monitored , " der spiegel " reported .
the new york-based blackstone group , a private equities firm , owns a significant stake in deutsche telekom , which is one-third state controlled .
the criminal inquiry , which has been handed over to public prosecutors , threatens to undermine relations with labor leaders at a point when management has been making massive job cuts in restructuring its domestic operations .
max stadler a parliamentarian and internal affairs spokesman for the opposition fdp , told the frankfurter rundschau newspaper it was " earth-shattering that a company that has a special responsibility for protecting private data " violated germany 's data privacy laws . dw staff -lrb- df -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

gay activists say the memorial is long overdue . seventy-five years ago nazis launched a series of raids and public book burnings aimed at homosexuals .
it was the start of adolf hitler ’ s crusade against homosexuality which saw an unknown number of gays arrested , tortured and murdered by the nazis .
the subject of nazi persecution of homosexuals has long been swept under the carpet .
yet a new memorial which opens tuesday , may 27 , will bring the past persecution and ongoing struggles of homosexuals to be accepted in society to the heart of the german capital .
showing a forbidden kiss bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the memorial will be officially unveiled this week the homosexual memorial will consist of a grey rectangular block some four meters -lrb- 13 feet -rrb- tall .
one side will have a small opening through which viewers will see a black and white art film scene of two men kissing .
" a simple kiss could land you in trouble , " says the text which accompanies the memorial .
the memorial was designed by the danish-norweigan artistic duo michael elmgreen and ingar dragset .
the memorial has a prominent place in berlin 's tiergarten park , half a block from brandenburg gate .
the monument sits across from the jewish holocaust memorial .
originally it was debated whether homosexuals should be included in the larger memorial before the decision was made to give homosexuals their own monument .
but the design corresponds to the holocaust memorial 's field of steles , a series of concrete blocks of varying sizes .
while the nazi persecution of the jews is well known , for many years there was little public acknowledgement of nazi atrocities towards homosexuals .
estimates put the number of homosexuals arrested by nazis at about 54,000 with 7,000 being killed in concentration camps .
" it is not easy for a gay man to live in this country and this society .
it 's important to remember that this society punished homosexuality for 20 years after national socialism ended , " said günter dworek of the federation of gays and lesbians in germany -lrb- lsvd -rrb- , a driving force behind the project .
gays making strides bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : berlin 's mayor is gay homosexuality remained illegal in germany until 1969 and was only formally decriminalized in 1994 .
it was n't until 2000 that germany 's parliament first passed a resolution acknowledging discrimination had occurred , dworek said .
the decision to fund the memorial , which cost 450,000 euros -lrb- $ 710,000 -rrb- , happened three years later .
the city 's current mayor , social democrat klaus wowereit , announced shortly before taking office seven years ago that he is gay .
wowereit 's legendary outing has given many others courage , dworek said .
" that opened a lot of people 's eyes .
you can not simply assume that politicians who already have a career behind them , like klaus wowereit , are by nature heterosexual , " dworek said .
germany also has a law which allows same-sex couples to register their partnerships .
yet many activists would like to see more , including anti-discrimination laws .
neo-nazi violence is still a very real threat , said albert eckert , head of the gay holocaust memorial committee . " but at last we have a monument to those who suffered and died under the nazis , " eckert said .
a tribute to hirschfeld bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : it is similar in style to the holocaust memorial eckert said he was also happy that the dedication was close to the birthday and death day of magnus hirschfeld , who died in exile in southern france on may 14 , 1935 .
a jewish homosexual , hirschfeld was a medical doctor who dedicated his life to the scientific study of homosexuality and lobbied the german government to repeal laws which outlawed gay sex .
the word " transsexual " was coined by hirschfeld to describe the phenomenon that he argued was a natural extension of human sexuality .
for his work , the nazis targeted hirschfeld as an example of decadent bolshevistic / jewish influence infecting the purity of the german people , luring the aryan race into impure and destructive perversity .
his institute was ransacked and his books were burned in rallies on may 10 , 1933 .
it was n't long before gay men were being rounded up and sent to mental hospitals or concentration camps .
" we have no idea how many thousands died in concentration camps because many were also jewish or were communists .
we know that many were left in prison after the war when post-war courts upheld the nazi jail sentences against them , " eckert says .
" anyone who was gay was automatically a criminal .
this monument is for all of them . "
making an international statement bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : a kiss can be a political statement the parliament decided on december 12 , 2003 to fund the homosexual memorial .
it was a nice birthday present for the green politician and well-known gay activist volker beck who turned 43 that day .
beck felt the memorial was especially important because the laws used to prosecute homosexuals continued long after the nazis had been defeated .
and persecution still exists in many countries today , making the memorial as important as ever , beck said .
he cites 80 countries which criminalize homosexual acts between consenting adults and 12 where the death penalty can be handed down .
beck believes germany 's memorial " sends an important signal that in this country , where in the past -lsb- homosexuals -rsb- were also systematically persecuted , we now have constructed a symbol against this human rights violation . " but homosexuals are still not fully accepted in society , beck said .
he worries about the refusal of some conservative christians and muslims to accept homosexuality .
beck said he does n't have any problem with the memorial 's design , which has come under criticism , particularly from women .
the first scene will portray men kissing , but later it will show women .
dworek said he is " downright happy " with the memorial 's design and likes the idea that the kissing scene will switch every two years .
" this will keep the memorial fresh .
there is always be something new , " dworek said .
" it will be a dynamic memorial . " dw staff -lrb- th -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

" we are being hailed as the most successful new party in decades and they say we are setting the political agenda in germany , " lafontaine told some 600 supporters at the party 's first national convention , over the weekend , in the eastern town of cottbus . dubbed germany 's " secret chancellor " by the media , the 64-year-old former spd chairman was re-elected head of the left at the conference , though with 10 percent fewer votes than last year . party platform includes drastic reforms during the convention , the party proposed a 50-billion-euro federal program that foresees the creation of publicly funded jobs and a nationwide minimum wage of 10 euros per hour -lrb- $ 15.77 -rrb- .
it also includes a ban on layoffs in profitable firms and higher property , corporate and inheritance taxes to balance the national deficit . in addition , lafontaine spoke out against nato , calling it a us-led military machine that violates human rights around the world .
the left said it strictly rejects " all domestic and foreign military operations " and called for the removal of german troops from afghanistan . referring to recent troubles on global financial markets , the party chief also presented a 12-point plan to counter what he called the " perversity " of market-driven capitalism , which included a ban on hedge funds and stock options . " we are having a huge influence , " said kathrin vogler , a delegate from the western state of north rhine-westphalia .
the 44-year-old had been a member of the spd for 18 years before joining the left party .
" we raise these issues and berlin shakes . " questionable dealings with communism quickly becoming an influential political force over the past year , the left has shifted the balance of party politics , forcing the cdu and the spd to rethink their traditional coalition formations . but despite its popularity , the party has regularly been dogged by controversy .
ahead of the cottbus convention , left member sahra wagenknecht was forced to drop her candidacy for deputy party leader because of her involvement in the communist platform , an organization that advocates the overthrow of capitalism and is monitored by germany 's intelligence apparatus . last week , newly opened stasi archives suggested that gregor gysi , parliamentary leader for the left , may have been an informer for the east german secret police .

gay activists say the memorial is long overdue . seventy-five years ago nazis launched a series of raids and public book burnings aimed at homosexuals .
it was the start of adolf hitler ’ s crusade against homosexuality which saw an unknown number of gays arrested , tortured and murdered by the nazis .
the subject of nazi persecution of homosexuals has long been swept under the carpet .
yet a new memorial which opens tuesday , may 27 , will bring the past persecution and ongoing struggles of homosexuals to be accepted in society to the heart of the german capital .
showing a forbidden kiss bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the memorial will be officially unveiled this week the homosexual memorial will consist of a grey rectangular block some four meters -lrb- 13 feet -rrb- tall .
one side will have a small opening through which viewers will see a black and white art film scene of two men kissing .
" a simple kiss could land you in trouble , " says the text which accompanies the memorial .
the memorial was designed by the danish-norweigan artistic duo michael elmgreen and ingar dragset .
the memorial has a prominent place in berlin 's tiergarten park , half a block from brandenburg gate .
the monument sits across from the jewish holocaust memorial .
originally it was debated whether homosexuals should be included in the larger memorial before the decision was made to give homosexuals their own monument .
but the design corresponds to the holocaust memorial 's field of steles , a series of concrete blocks of varying sizes .
while the nazi persecution of the jews is well known , for many years there was little public acknowledgement of nazi atrocities towards homosexuals .
estimates put the number of homosexuals arrested by nazis at about 54,000 with 7,000 being killed in concentration camps .
" it is not easy for a gay man to live in this country and this society .
it 's important to remember that this society punished homosexuality for 20 years after national socialism ended , " said günter dworek of the federation of gays and lesbians in germany -lrb- lsvd -rrb- , a driving force behind the project .
gays making strides bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : berlin 's mayor is gay homosexuality remained illegal in germany until 1969 and was only formally decriminalized in 1994 .
it was n't until 2000 that germany 's parliament first passed a resolution acknowledging discrimination had occurred , dworek said .
the decision to fund the memorial , which cost 450,000 euros -lrb- $ 710,000 -rrb- , happened three years later .
the city 's current mayor , social democrat klaus wowereit , announced shortly before taking office seven years ago that he is gay .
wowereit 's legendary outing has given many others courage , dworek said .
" that opened a lot of people 's eyes .
you can not simply assume that politicians who already have a career behind them , like klaus wowereit , are by nature heterosexual , " dworek said .
germany also has a law which allows same-sex couples to register their partnerships .
yet many activists would like to see more , including anti-discrimination laws .
neo-nazi violence is still a very real threat , said albert eckert , head of the gay holocaust memorial committee . " but at last we have a monument to those who suffered and died under the nazis , " eckert said .
a tribute to hirschfeld bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : it is similar in style to the holocaust memorial eckert said he was also happy that the dedication was close to the birthday and death day of magnus hirschfeld , who died in exile in southern france on may 14 , 1935 .
a jewish homosexual , hirschfeld was a medical doctor who dedicated his life to the scientific study of homosexuality and lobbied the german government to repeal laws which outlawed gay sex .
the word " transsexual " was coined by hirschfeld to describe the phenomenon that he argued was a natural extension of human sexuality .
for his work , the nazis targeted hirschfeld as an example of decadent bolshevistic / jewish influence infecting the purity of the german people , luring the aryan race into impure and destructive perversity .
his institute was ransacked and his books were burned in rallies on may 10 , 1933 .
it was n't long before gay men were being rounded up and sent to mental hospitals or concentration camps .
" we have no idea how many thousands died in concentration camps because many were also jewish or were communists .
we know that many were left in prison after the war when post-war courts upheld the nazi jail sentences against them , " eckert says .
" anyone who was gay was automatically a criminal .
this monument is for all of them . "
making an international statement bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : a kiss can be a political statement the parliament decided on december 12 , 2003 to fund the homosexual memorial .
it was a nice birthday present for the green politician and well-known gay activist volker beck who turned 43 that day .
beck felt the memorial was especially important because the laws used to prosecute homosexuals continued long after the nazis had been defeated .
and persecution still exists in many countries today , making the memorial as important as ever , beck said .
he cites 80 countries which criminalize homosexual acts between consenting adults and 12 where the death penalty can be handed down .
beck believes germany 's memorial " sends an important signal that in this country , where in the past -lsb- homosexuals -rsb- were also systematically persecuted , we now have constructed a symbol against this human rights violation . " but homosexuals are still not fully accepted in society , beck said .
he worries about the refusal of some conservative christians and muslims to accept homosexuality .
beck said he does n't have any problem with the memorial 's design , which has come under criticism , particularly from women .
the first scene will portray men kissing , but later it will show women .
dworek said he is " downright happy " with the memorial 's design and likes the idea that the kissing scene will switch every two years .
" this will keep the memorial fresh .
there is always be something new , " dworek said .

the peaceful beliefs of ahmadis , who can be found in small numbers in germany , are seen as heretical by most muslims . it 's been 100 years since mirza ghulam ahmad founded the ahmadiyya muslim faith .
the controversial indian religious figure claimed to be the promised messiah awaited by all the major religions , whether christian , buddhist jewish or muslim .
his followers believed that within 300 years most of the world will join the islamic brotherhood , which will usher in an era of peace .
that goal implies worldwide missionary work , which has lead ahmadis , as the members of the ahmidiyya community call themselves , to proselitize the world .
they 've even ended up in the unlikely berlin neighborhood of pankow-heinersdorf .
with a new mosque under construction and 100th anniversary parties planned , mirza masroor ahmad will travel to berlin on tuesday , may 27 .
for his followers , the caliph is for followers a representative of the promised messiah .
he is democratically elected by the council of the ahmadiyyas and serves for life .
misunderstandings persist the title of " caliph " has been misunderstood by many in the west , said islamic scholar stephan rosiny .
a caliph is the political head of state in an islamic community .
while the practice of the worldly and spiritual leadership being united in the person of the caliph has its origins in the middle ages , modern islamists have used the idea as well .
a recent example was the so-called caliph of cologne , metin kaplan , who , until his movement was outlawed in 2001 dreamed of starting an islamic regime in europe .
“ to equate the ahmadis with something like that is pure sensationalism , ” rosiny said .
rosiny sees a perception problem due to people in the west viewing radical forms of islam as the norm rather than an exception .
rosiny said that islamic beliefs need to be taken in context .
caliph means successor and “ jihad ” for the ahmidiyya movement , as for most muslims , does not mean holy war but rather a struggle to improve oneself or society .
a peaceful movement the ahmadiyya movement stresses the peaceful aspects of islam .
it condemns islamist violence and spoke out against the fatwa against author salman rushdie for his novel “ the satanic verses . ”
“ love for all , hate for none ” is their motto .
yet the ahmidiyya movement is considered heretical by mainstream islam .
for most muslims , mohammed is the last and most important prophet , while ahmadis believe that he was followed by others .
that has won the movement enemies .
in 1974 , pakistan declared followers not to be muslims and legitimized violence against them .
the caliph moved to london .
long history of missionary work the group has been preaching in germany since the weimar republic .
in berlin 's wilmersdorf neighbourhood the splinter group called the lahore ahmadiyya movement opened a mosque in the 1920s .
it is an architectural gem which remains germany 's oldest mosque .
since the beginning of the systematic persecution in pakistan , many pakistani ahmadiyyas came as asylum seekers to germany .
worldwide there are between 10 and 80 million ahmadiyyas .
in pankow-heinersdorf in the northern part of berlin there are almost no muslims , much less ahmadis .
the neighbourhood was chosen for the 100th anniversary celebrations because the group 's first mosque in eastern germany is being built here .
the shell has just been completed after a long and vehement opposition from some of the public .
there were demonstrations and initiatives against the construction .
later , a truck parked at the construction site was burned , police believe it was arson .
“ i can understand the fear the people have , ” said abdullah wagishauser , a german convert , has been head of the group in germany since 1984 .
“ there is a fundamental distrust about islam . ”
wanting to be neighborly but his experience with other mosque projects is that dialogue and information can overcome this antagonism .
“ after one of two years we always have a fully normal neighbourly relationship , ” he said .
in the meantime they have tried to smooth things over with their neighbors .
in august the mosque will be opened and the first muslim will move into the area .
he wo n't be a missionary , but rather the mosque 's imam . oliver samson -lrb- th -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

the last time france emerged from the festival with top honors was more than two decades ago . the jury president , us actor and director sean penn , was expected to favor a social or political film , and it came as a surprise that israeli ari folman 's groundbreaking animated documentary " waltz with bashir " went unrecognized .
using innovative techniques to retell events surrounding the sabra and shatila massacres in 1982 , the film was considered a contender for the top prize . penn had told a french newspaper ahead of the competition that cannes ' duty was to " do just the opposite " of the oscars and to honor a ground-breaking , unconventional picture . french film tackles hot political topic bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : cantet , right , accepted the award with his " class " screened during the final days of the competition , " the class " -lrb- " entre les murs " -rrb- is a docu-drama with real teachers and students playing the roles in a tough french school .
the young cast of joined cantet on stage to accept the palme d 'or , a moment the director described as deeply moving . based on an autobiographical novel by francois begaudeau , a young french teacher , genet , turns the classroom portrayed in the movie into a microcosm of contemporary france .

it is intended to replace the current partnership and cooperation agreement -lrb- pca -rrb- , which ran out in 2007 , and should include legally-binding measures on such issues as energy , security , trade and education . negotiations are to be formally launched in siberia on june 26-27 , when new president dmitry medvedev will represent russia for the first time .
they were only made possible after lithuania , the last eu member to block the talks , was assured that its concerns about energy supply and moscow 's stance on georgia would be addressed . officials in brussels predict complex negotiations with moscow are likely to last about a year , with a further year required for its ratification by eu member states and russia . eu ministers also listened to polish plans for strengthening ties with ukraine , moldova , georgia , armenia , azerbaijan and , eventually , belarus . supported by sweden and blessed by heavyweights france and germany , the so-called eastern partnership comes on the back of french plans to boost the eu 's ties with its southern neighbors in a union for the mediterranean . visa-free travel in sight according to a text seen by german news agency dpa , the proposed eastern partnership would seek to deepen cooperation and focus on concrete proposals in the area of migration , with an eye to moving towards a visa-free regime . it would also seek to create a free trade area , provide support for reforms designed to bring those countries up to eu standards , and arrange more student exchange programs . the partnership would use existing neighborhood funds and would have an institutional structure that is " as light-weight and goal-oriented as possible . " human rights , a frequent bone of contention under russia 's former president vladimir putin , and energy supply are also likely to become major topics of discussion . benita ferrero-waldner , the commissioner in charge of the eu 's external relations , said the eu executive would only support the plan if it provided " added value " and did not duplicate existing eu policies . " the negotiation will certainly not be easy … i think they will take quite some time , " she said . poland advocates eastern focus polish and swedish diplomats say the partnership will encourage " multilateral cooperation " and " foster regional links .

gay activists say the memorial is long overdue . seventy-five years ago nazis launched a series of raids and public book burnings aimed at homosexuals .
it was the start of adolf hitler ’ s crusade against homosexuality which saw an unknown number of gays arrested , tortured and murdered by the nazis .
the subject of nazi persecution of homosexuals has long been swept under the carpet .
yet a new memorial which opens tuesday , may 27 , will bring the past persecution and ongoing struggles of homosexuals to be accepted in society to the heart of the german capital .
showing a forbidden kiss bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the memorial will be officially unveiled this week the homosexual memorial will consist of a grey rectangular block some four meters -lrb- 13 feet -rrb- tall .
one side will have a small opening through which viewers will see a black and white art film scene of two men kissing .
" a simple kiss could land you in trouble , " says the text which accompanies the memorial .
the memorial was designed by the danish-norweigan artistic duo michael elmgreen and ingar dragset .
the memorial has a prominent place in berlin 's tiergarten park , half a block from brandenburg gate .
the monument sits across from the jewish holocaust memorial .
originally it was debated whether homosexuals should be included in the larger memorial before the decision was made to give homosexuals their own monument .
but the design corresponds to the holocaust memorial 's field of steles , a series of concrete blocks of varying sizes .
while the nazi persecution of the jews is well known , for many years there was little public acknowledgement of nazi atrocities towards homosexuals .
estimates put the number of homosexuals arrested by nazis at about 54,000 with 7,000 being killed in concentration camps .
" it is not easy for a gay man to live in this country and this society .
it 's important to remember that this society punished homosexuality for 20 years after national socialism ended , " said günter dworek of the federation of gays and lesbians in germany -lrb- lsvd -rrb- , a driving force behind the project .
gays making strides bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : berlin 's mayor is gay homosexuality remained illegal in germany until 1969 and was only formally decriminalized in 1994 .
it was n't until 2000 that germany 's parliament first passed a resolution acknowledging discrimination had occurred , dworek said .
the decision to fund the memorial , which cost 450,000 euros -lrb- $ 710,000 -rrb- , happened three years later .
the city 's current mayor , social democrat klaus wowereit , announced shortly before taking office seven years ago that he is gay .
wowereit 's legendary outing has given many others courage , dworek said .
" that opened a lot of people 's eyes .
you can not simply assume that politicians who already have a career behind them , like klaus wowereit , are by nature heterosexual , " dworek said .
germany also has a law which allows same-sex couples to register their partnerships .
yet many activists would like to see more , including anti-discrimination laws .
neo-nazi violence is still a very real threat , said albert eckert , head of the gay holocaust memorial committee . " but at last we have a monument to those who suffered and died under the nazis , " eckert said .
a tribute to hirschfeld bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : it is similar in style to the holocaust memorial eckert said he was also happy that the dedication was close to the birthday and death day of magnus hirschfeld , who died in exile in southern france on may 14 , 1935 .
a jewish homosexual , hirschfeld was a medical doctor who dedicated his life to the scientific study of homosexuality and lobbied the german government to repeal laws which outlawed gay sex .
the word " transsexual " was coined by hirschfeld to describe the phenomenon that he argued was a natural extension of human sexuality .
for his work , the nazis targeted hirschfeld as an example of decadent bolshevistic / jewish influence infecting the purity of the german people , luring the aryan race into impure and destructive perversity .
his institute was ransacked and his books were burned in rallies on may 10 , 1933 .
it was n't long before gay men were being rounded up and sent to mental hospitals or concentration camps .
" we have no idea how many thousands died in concentration camps because many were also jewish or were communists .
we know that many were left in prison after the war when post-war courts upheld the nazi jail sentences against them , " eckert says .
" anyone who was gay was automatically a criminal .
this monument is for all of them . "
making an international statement bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : a kiss can be a political statement the parliament decided on december 12 , 2003 to fund the homosexual memorial .
it was a nice birthday present for the green politician and well-known gay activist volker beck who turned 43 that day .
beck felt the memorial was especially important because the laws used to prosecute homosexuals continued long after the nazis had been defeated .
and persecution still exists in many countries today , making the memorial as important as ever , beck said .
he cites 80 countries which criminalize homosexual acts between consenting adults and 12 where the death penalty can be handed down .
beck believes germany 's memorial " sends an important signal that in this country , where in the past -lsb- homosexuals -rsb- were also systematically persecuted , we now have constructed a symbol against this human rights violation . " but homosexuals are still not fully accepted in society , beck said .
he worries about the refusal of some conservative christians and muslims to accept homosexuality .
beck said he does n't have any problem with the memorial 's design , which has come under criticism , particularly from women .
the first scene will portray men kissing , but later it will show women .
dworek said he is " downright happy " with the memorial 's design and likes the idea that the kissing scene will switch every two years .
" this will keep the memorial fresh .
there is always be something new , " dworek said .
" it will be a dynamic memorial . " dw staff -lrb- th -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

the decision to fund the memorial , which cost 450,000 euros -lrb- $ 710,000 -rrb- , happened three years later .
the city 's current mayor , social democrat klaus wowereit , announced shortly before taking office seven years ago that he is gay .
wowereit 's legendary outing has given many others courage , dworek said .
" that opened a lot of people 's eyes .
you can not simply assume that politicians who already have a career behind them , like klaus wowereit , are by nature heterosexual , " dworek said .
germany also has a law which allows same-sex couples to register their partnerships .
yet many activists would like to see more , including anti-discrimination laws .
neo-nazi violence is still a very real threat , said albert eckert , head of the gay holocaust memorial committee . " but at last we have a monument to those who suffered and died under the nazis , " eckert said .
a tribute to hirschfeld bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : it is similar in style to the holocaust memorial eckert said he was also happy that the dedication was close to the birthday and death day of magnus hirschfeld , who died in exile in southern france on may 14 , 1935 .
a jewish homosexual , hirschfeld was a medical doctor who dedicated his life to the scientific study of homosexuality and lobbied the german government to repeal laws which outlawed gay sex .
the word " transsexual " was coined by hirschfeld to describe the phenomenon that he argued was a natural extension of human sexuality .
for his work , the nazis targeted hirschfeld as an example of decadent bolshevistic / jewish influence infecting the purity of the german people , luring the aryan race into impure and destructive perversity .
his institute was ransacked and his books were burned in rallies on may 10 , 1933 .
it was n't long before gay men were being rounded up and sent to mental hospitals or concentration camps .
" we have no idea how many thousands died in concentration camps because many were also jewish or were communists .
we know that many were left in prison after the war when post-war courts upheld the nazi jail sentences against them , " eckert says .
" anyone who was gay was automatically a criminal .
this monument is for all of them . "
making an international statement bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : a kiss can be a political statement the parliament decided on december 12 , 2003 to fund the homosexual memorial .
it was a nice birthday present for the green politician and well-known gay activist volker beck who turned 43 that day .
beck felt the memorial was especially important because the laws used to prosecute homosexuals continued long after the nazis had been defeated .
and persecution still exists in many countries today , making the memorial as important as ever , beck said .
he cites 80 countries which criminalize homosexual acts between consenting adults and 12 where the death penalty can be handed down .
beck believes germany 's memorial " sends an important signal that in this country , where in the past -lsb- homosexuals -rsb- were also systematically persecuted , we now have constructed a symbol against this human rights violation . " but homosexuals are still not fully accepted in society , beck said .
he worries about the refusal of some conservative christians and muslims to accept homosexuality .
beck said he does n't have any problem with the memorial 's design , which has come under criticism , particularly from women .
the first scene will portray men kissing , but later it will show women .
dworek said he is " downright happy " with the memorial 's design and likes the idea that the kissing scene will switch every two years .
" this will keep the memorial fresh .
there is always be something new , " dworek said .
" it will be a dynamic memorial . " dw staff -lrb- th -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

attempts to trap bruno failed , so it was shot , stuffed and put in a munich museum .
br said the fictionalized story would revolve around a love affair between a tyrolean hunter and a lady animal lover who goes around on all fours wearing a bearskin .
the genuine bear corners the hunter , but mercifully lets him go and lives to raid another day .

the last time france emerged from the festival with top honors was more than two decades ago . the jury president , us actor and director sean penn , was expected to favor a social or political film , and it came as a surprise that israeli ari folman 's groundbreaking animated documentary " waltz with bashir " went unrecognized .
using innovative techniques to retell events surrounding the sabra and shatila massacres in 1982 , the film was considered a contender for the top prize . penn had told a french newspaper ahead of the competition that cannes ' duty was to " do just the opposite " of the oscars and to honor a ground-breaking , unconventional picture . french film tackles hot political topic bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : cantet , right , accepted the award with his " class " screened during the final days of the competition , " the class " -lrb- " entre les murs " -rrb- is a docu-drama with real teachers and students playing the roles in a tough french school .
the young cast of joined cantet on stage to accept the palme d 'or , a moment the director described as deeply moving . based on an autobiographical novel by francois begaudeau , a young french teacher , genet , turns the classroom portrayed in the movie into a microcosm of contemporary france .
begaudeau also plays the role of a dedicated but sometimes flawed teacher in the movie . it was a subject that " interests the whole world , " said cantet at a press conference .
" people have the same issues , whichever country they are in . " the film has been praised for its realistic approach and its exploration of universal issues like race , individuality and truth . the last french film to walk away with the palme d 'or for best film at cannes - in 1987 - was maurice pialat 's " under the sun of satan , " a melodrama about a 16-year-old girl who kills her lover and the priest to whom she confesses the crime . italy scores double bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : israel 's animated documentary was expected to do better italian directors also scored top awards at this year 's cannes festival , with the nation 's two movies that were entered in the main competition both winning key prizes . while paolo sorrentino was awarded the jury prize for his political satire about italy 's seven-time prime minister giulio andreotti , matteo garrone 's powerful mafia expose , " gomorrah , " emerged from the festival with the grand prix . garrone was applauded for his courage in looking at a touchy subject , particularly since the author of the bestselling book the film is based on has been living under police protection for the past two years . turkey 's nuri bilge ceylan won the festival 's best director award for his brooding family drama " three monkeys " -lrb- " uc maymum " -rrb- . in accepting the prize , ceylan said he was dedicating the award " to my beautiful country , which i love passionately . " the nine-member festival jury acknowledged the strong presence of latin american-themed films at this year 's festival .
sandra corveloni was awarded the best actress prize for her role in " line of passage " -lrb- " linha de passe " -rrb- from brazilian directors walter salles and daniela thomas , which tells the story of four brothers trying to follow their dreams in the sao paulo slums . the best actor award went to benicio del toro , who played che guevara in hollywood director steven soderbergh 's four-and-a-half-hour , two-part epic about the latin american revolutionary leader .
del toro said he wanted to dedicate the award " to the man himself , che guevara . " romania comes back strong bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : benicio del toro took the best actor award for his role in " che " the cannes festival award for best screenplay went to belgian brothers jean-pierre and luc dardenne for " lorna 's silence , " which looks at immigration in modern europe as told by a young albanian woman who is caught up in the murky business of arranged marriages . the festival 's camera d 'or for best first feature film , awarded to debut directors , went this year to london-born steve mcqueen 's " hunger , " about a northern irish prisoner who died on a hunger strike . once again , romania demonstrated that it has emerged as a key filmmaking nation , with marian crisan winning the festival 's award for best short film for his movie " megatron . "
cristian mungiu 's " 4 months , 3 weeks and 2 days " about abortion in communist romania won the palme d 'or last year . this year 's festival acknowledged the long-standing contributions to cinema by french actress catherine deneuve , who had a film in the main competition , and veteran us director clint eastwood , whose " the exchange , " starring angelina jolie , was also in the running for the palme d 'or . dw staff -lrb- kjb -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

the peaceful beliefs of ahmadis , who can be found in small numbers in germany , are seen as heretical by most muslims . it 's been 100 years since mirza ghulam ahmad founded the ahmadiyya muslim faith .
the controversial indian religious figure claimed to be the promised messiah awaited by all the major religions , whether christian , buddhist jewish or muslim .
his followers believed that within 300 years most of the world will join the islamic brotherhood , which will usher in an era of peace .
that goal implies worldwide missionary work , which has lead ahmadis , as the members of the ahmidiyya community call themselves , to proselitize the world .
they 've even ended up in the unlikely berlin neighborhood of pankow-heinersdorf .
with a new mosque under construction and 100th anniversary parties planned , mirza masroor ahmad will travel to berlin on tuesday , may 27 .
for his followers , the caliph is for followers a representative of the promised messiah .
he is democratically elected by the council of the ahmadiyyas and serves for life .
misunderstandings persist the title of " caliph " has been misunderstood by many in the west , said islamic scholar stephan rosiny .
a caliph is the political head of state in an islamic community .
while the practice of the worldly and spiritual leadership being united in the person of the caliph has its origins in the middle ages , modern islamists have used the idea as well .
a recent example was the so-called caliph of cologne , metin kaplan , who , until his movement was outlawed in 2001 dreamed of starting an islamic regime in europe .
“ to equate the ahmadis with something like that is pure sensationalism , ” rosiny said .
rosiny sees a perception problem due to people in the west viewing radical forms of islam as the norm rather than an exception .
rosiny said that islamic beliefs need to be taken in context .
caliph means successor and “ jihad ” for the ahmidiyya movement , as for most muslims , does not mean holy war but rather a struggle to improve oneself or society .
a peaceful movement the ahmadiyya movement stresses the peaceful aspects of islam .
it condemns islamist violence and spoke out against the fatwa against author salman rushdie for his novel “ the satanic verses . ”
“ love for all , hate for none ” is their motto .
yet the ahmidiyya movement is considered heretical by mainstream islam .
for most muslims , mohammed is the last and most important prophet , while ahmadis believe that he was followed by others .
that has won the movement enemies .
in 1974 , pakistan declared followers not to be muslims and legitimized violence against them .
the caliph moved to london .
long history of missionary work the group has been preaching in germany since the weimar republic .
in berlin 's wilmersdorf neighbourhood the splinter group called the lahore ahmadiyya movement opened a mosque in the 1920s .
it is an architectural gem which remains germany 's oldest mosque .
since the beginning of the systematic persecution in pakistan , many pakistani ahmadiyyas came as asylum seekers to germany .
worldwide there are between 10 and 80 million ahmadiyyas .
in pankow-heinersdorf in the northern part of berlin there are almost no muslims , much less ahmadis .
the neighbourhood was chosen for the 100th anniversary celebrations because the group 's first mosque in eastern germany is being built here .
the shell has just been completed after a long and vehement opposition from some of the public .
there were demonstrations and initiatives against the construction .
later , a truck parked at the construction site was burned , police believe it was arson .

it should also boost employment in the region . the express mail delivery and logistics company dhl , which is a division of germany 's postal giant deutsche post ag , inaugurated its principle european hub at leipzig-halle airport in eastern germany on monday , may 26 .
in 2004 , deutsche post had already announced the planned move from brussels to leipzig , since the belgian capital refused to permit additional nighttime flights .
dhl added that besides being able to operate around the clock in leipzig , the central european location was ideal as a hub for emerging markets in eastern europe and asia .
" demand for express services is growing worldwide , " said the new ceo of the post ag parent company , frank appel at the opening ceremony attended by prominent politicians , such as german foreign minister frank-walter steinmeier .
" this is a day to be proud of .
we are looking towards the future , " he said .
georg milbradt , the state premier of saxony , where leipzig is the capital , hailed the move as a " job motor " which will help boost the economy in the eastern states , which have higher unemployment rates than in the west .
at present dhl already operates flights to the middle east and india from leipzig-halle , where it plans to increase its personnel from about 2,000 to 3,500 employees by 2012 .
" with dhl here , the state of saxony will without a doubt become a central logistics point in europe , " said the state 's economics minister thomas jurk .
some 300 million euros -lrb- $ 474 million -rrb- have already been invested in the new hub , which has an air freight turnover of 1,500 tons a day .
about 60 freight aircraft bearing the dhl logo take off and land in leipzig per day .
worldwide , dhl flies to nearly 50 destinations , of which leipzig will become one of three main hubs that include wilmington , ohio in the us and hong kong .
not everyone was happy about the new hub however .
dozens of local residents staged a protest at the inauguration over the potential increase in noise levels at night .
" we will only fly when necessary , " said appel .
a hearing on night time flights will be held in the federal courts in leipzig on july 15 . dw staff -lrb- df -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

gay activists say the memorial is long overdue . seventy-five years ago nazis launched a series of raids and public book burnings aimed at homosexuals .
it was the start of adolf hitler ’ s crusade against homosexuality which saw an unknown number of gays arrested , tortured and murdered by the nazis .
the subject of nazi persecution of homosexuals has long been swept under the carpet .
yet a new memorial which opens tuesday , may 27 , will bring the past persecution and ongoing struggles of homosexuals to be accepted in society to the heart of the german capital .
showing a forbidden kiss bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the memorial will be officially unveiled this week the homosexual memorial will consist of a grey rectangular block some four meters -lrb- 13 feet -rrb- tall .
one side will have a small opening through which viewers will see a black and white art film scene of two men kissing .
" a simple kiss could land you in trouble , " says the text which accompanies the memorial .
the memorial was designed by the danish-norweigan artistic duo michael elmgreen and ingar dragset .
the memorial has a prominent place in berlin 's tiergarten park , half a block from brandenburg gate .
the monument sits across from the jewish holocaust memorial .
originally it was debated whether homosexuals should be included in the larger memorial before the decision was made to give homosexuals their own monument .
but the design corresponds to the holocaust memorial 's field of steles , a series of concrete blocks of varying sizes .
while the nazi persecution of the jews is well known , for many years there was little public acknowledgement of nazi atrocities towards homosexuals .
estimates put the number of homosexuals arrested by nazis at about 54,000 with 7,000 being killed in concentration camps .
" it is not easy for a gay man to live in this country and this society .
it 's important to remember that this society punished homosexuality for 20 years after national socialism ended , " said günter dworek of the federation of gays and lesbians in germany -lrb- lsvd -rrb- , a driving force behind the project .
gays making strides bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : berlin 's mayor is gay homosexuality remained illegal in germany until 1969 and was only formally decriminalized in 1994 .
it was n't until 2000 that germany 's parliament first passed a resolution acknowledging discrimination had occurred , dworek said .
the decision to fund the memorial , which cost 450,000 euros -lrb- $ 710,000 -rrb- , happened three years later .
the city 's current mayor , social democrat klaus wowereit , announced shortly before taking office seven years ago that he is gay .
wowereit 's legendary outing has given many others courage , dworek said .
" that opened a lot of people 's eyes .
you can not simply assume that politicians who already have a career behind them , like klaus wowereit , are by nature heterosexual , " dworek said .
germany also has a law which allows same-sex couples to register their partnerships .
yet many activists would like to see more , including anti-discrimination laws .
neo-nazi violence is still a very real threat , said albert eckert , head of the gay holocaust memorial committee . " but at last we have a monument to those who suffered and died under the nazis , " eckert said .
a tribute to hirschfeld bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : it is similar in style to the holocaust memorial eckert said he was also happy that the dedication was close to the birthday and death day of magnus hirschfeld , who died in exile in southern france on may 14 , 1935 .
a jewish homosexual , hirschfeld was a medical doctor who dedicated his life to the scientific study of homosexuality and lobbied the german government to repeal laws which outlawed gay sex .
the word " transsexual " was coined by hirschfeld to describe the phenomenon that he argued was a natural extension of human sexuality .
for his work , the nazis targeted hirschfeld as an example of decadent bolshevistic / jewish influence infecting the purity of the german people , luring the aryan race into impure and destructive perversity .
his institute was ransacked and his books were burned in rallies on may 10 , 1933 .
it was n't long before gay men were being rounded up and sent to mental hospitals or concentration camps .
" we have no idea how many thousands died in concentration camps because many were also jewish or were communists .
we know that many were left in prison after the war when post-war courts upheld the nazi jail sentences against them , " eckert says .
" anyone who was gay was automatically a criminal .
this monument is for all of them . "
making an international statement bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : a kiss can be a political statement the parliament decided on december 12 , 2003 to fund the homosexual memorial .
it was a nice birthday present for the green politician and well-known gay activist volker beck who turned 43 that day .
beck felt the memorial was especially important because the laws used to prosecute homosexuals continued long after the nazis had been defeated .
and persecution still exists in many countries today , making the memorial as important as ever , beck said .
he cites 80 countries which criminalize homosexual acts between consenting adults and 12 where the death penalty can be handed down .
beck believes germany 's memorial " sends an important signal that in this country , where in the past -lsb- homosexuals -rsb- were also systematically persecuted , we now have constructed a symbol against this human rights violation . " but homosexuals are still not fully accepted in society , beck said .
he worries about the refusal of some conservative christians and muslims to accept homosexuality .
beck said he does n't have any problem with the memorial 's design , which has come under criticism , particularly from women .
the first scene will portray men kissing , but later it will show women .
dworek said he is " downright happy " with the memorial 's design and likes the idea that the kissing scene will switch every two years .
" this will keep the memorial fresh .
there is always be something new , " dworek said .
" it will be a dynamic memorial . " dw staff -lrb- th -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

it boasts an estimated 73,500 members germany-wide and , with 10 to 14 percent of the national vote , is the country 's third largest party next to the social democratic party -lrb- spd -rrb- and the christian democratic union -lrb- cdu -rrb- . " we are being hailed as the most successful new party in decades and they say we are setting the political agenda in germany , " lafontaine told some 600 supporters at the party 's first national convention , over the weekend , in the eastern town of cottbus . dubbed germany 's " secret chancellor " by the media , the 64-year-old former spd chairman was re-elected head of the left at the conference , though with 10 percent fewer votes than last year . party platform includes drastic reforms during the convention , the party proposed a 50-billion-euro federal program that foresees the creation of publicly funded jobs and a nationwide minimum wage of 10 euros per hour -lrb- $ 15.77 -rrb- .
it also includes a ban on layoffs in profitable firms and higher property , corporate and inheritance taxes to balance the national deficit . in addition , lafontaine spoke out against nato , calling it a us-led military machine that violates human rights around the world .
the left said it strictly rejects " all domestic and foreign military operations " and called for the removal of german troops from afghanistan . referring to recent troubles on global financial markets , the party chief also presented a 12-point plan to counter what he called the " perversity " of market-driven capitalism , which included a ban on hedge funds and stock options . " we are having a huge influence , " said kathrin vogler , a delegate from the western state of north rhine-westphalia .
the 44-year-old had been a member of the spd for 18 years before joining the left party .
" we raise these issues and berlin shakes .

" the eu general affairs and external relations council has decided the eu should double the number of participants in the eupol mission in afghanistan , " said a statement from the slovenian presidency of the bloc .
" this measure will strengthen efforts towards police reform , " it added .
launched in june 2007 and expected to last for at least three years , the eupol mission consists of about 200 experts tasked with training afghan policemen and officials at the interior ministry .
their numbers are now expected to rise to about 400 over the next 12 months , diplomats said .
" we want the afghan government to be able to take care of security themselves , " said german defence minister franz josef jung , whose country was strongly behind the initiative .
italy considering sending troops to danger zones bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : frattini said isaf requests would determine italy 's plans separately , new italian foreign minister franco frattini said his government was ready to drop some of its caveats and deploy its troops to more dangerous battle zones , as requested by nato .
" we are talking about greater geographical flexibility , " frattini said .
" we want to align italy to its other great nato partners . "
italy currently has about 2,360 soldiers in afghanistan .
but they are mainly deployed in kabul and in the less restive west of the country .
the previous centre-left government of romano prodi refused to give in to us requests for the troops to be sent to southern hotspots , where nato is fighting taliban insurgents .
germany has maintained a similar position , thus infuriating the united states , britain , canada and the netherlands , which have suffered significant casualties around the kandahar region .
new direction for italian leadership frattini did not rule out sending troops to the south , saying redeployment would depend on the requests made by nato 's international security assistance force -lrb- isaf -rrb- .
but with a political storm brewing back home , italian defence minister ignazio la russa later clarified that such redeployments would be " temporary " rather than permanent .
" we are not against , should the need arise , temporary interventions aimed at lending a hand to those facing greater difficulties than ours , " he said . dw staff / dpa -lrb- nda -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

the decision is sure to cause friction within germany 's coalition government . schwan , a 65-year-old university professor , was announced on monday , may 26 , as the social democratic party 's -lrb- spd -rrb- choice for the high-profile office of german president .
schwan nearly won the post five years ago , but lost out to horst koehler , a former head of the international monetary fund .
koehler has the support of chancellor angela merkel 's christian democratic union -lrb- cdu -rrb- , who wants to see him serve a second five-year term .
members of the cdu and its bavarian sister party , the christian social union -lrb- csu -rrb- , were upset to hear that the spd would put forth its own candidate .
the parties form a left-right coalition together .
chancellor merkel expressed her anger about the decision of her coalition partners to nominate their own candidate . " we have a president who is respected around the world , " merkel said .
" so it is regrettable that the social democrats have put up their own candidate in this step that can only be explained by the internal state of the party . ” schwan 's candidacy runs counter to a longstanding tradition observed by the two main political blocs not to put up a challenger to a president seeking a second term . " i believe that this candidacy will fail and that horst koehler will remain president , as is the wish of the majority of our citizens , " she added .
coalition will stay together bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : they do not always see eye to eye spd head hubertus heil said that he does not worry that the move will rupture the coalition ahead of federal elections , which are scheduled to take place in 2009 .
the csu also faces state elections in bavaria later this year .
" a little competition is n't going to cause any harm to a functioning democracy , " heil said .
" the csu is nervous ahead of the state elections in september .
i urge them just to relax . "
spd leader kurt beck said that his party would not " campaign against the incumbent . "
" in a democracy , we view a rival candidacy as a good opportunity for a broad discussion of the issues , " beck said monday .
merkel 's spokesman ulrich wilhelm also rejected any suggestion of the coalition breaking apart at a news conference .
" the chancellor has made it clear that the spd decision puts a strain on the coalition but that she , as well as the chairmen of the spd and csu , remains interested in carrying on the work on policies in the best interests of germany , " wilhelm said .
secret vote bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : koehler wants another five years schwan narrowly lost to koehler in 2004 when the cdu and free democrats -lrb- fdp -rrb- had a majority in the federal assembly , which is made up of members of parliament and delegates from each of germany 's 16 federal states .
the vote for president is done by secret ballot , meaning any federal assembly member can vote for any candidate .
the assembly meets every five years to elect a president .
the assembly vote for president will take place in may of 2009 .
political analysts say that center-left parties could have enough votes to elect schwan .
while the spd has refused to enter into a coalition with the left party in forming a government , it would presumably rely on the left and the greens to elect schwan . dw staff -lrb- th -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

the peaceful beliefs of ahmadis , who can be found in small numbers in germany , are seen as heretical by most muslims . it 's been 100 years since mirza ghulam ahmad founded the ahmadiyya muslim faith .
the controversial indian religious figure claimed to be the promised messiah awaited by all the major religions , whether christian , buddhist jewish or muslim .
his followers believed that within 300 years most of the world will join the islamic brotherhood , which will usher in an era of peace .
that goal implies worldwide missionary work , which has lead ahmadis , as the members of the ahmidiyya community call themselves , to proselitize the world .
they 've even ended up in the unlikely berlin neighborhood of pankow-heinersdorf .
with a new mosque under construction and 100th anniversary parties planned , mirza masroor ahmad will travel to berlin on tuesday , may 27 .
for his followers , the caliph is for followers a representative of the promised messiah .
he is democratically elected by the council of the ahmadiyyas and serves for life .
misunderstandings persist the title of " caliph " has been misunderstood by many in the west , said islamic scholar stephan rosiny .
a caliph is the political head of state in an islamic community .
while the practice of the worldly and spiritual leadership being united in the person of the caliph has its origins in the middle ages , modern islamists have used the idea as well .
a recent example was the so-called caliph of cologne , metin kaplan , who , until his movement was outlawed in 2001 dreamed of starting an islamic regime in europe .
“ to equate the ahmadis with something like that is pure sensationalism , ” rosiny said .
rosiny sees a perception problem due to people in the west viewing radical forms of islam as the norm rather than an exception .
rosiny said that islamic beliefs need to be taken in context .
caliph means successor and “ jihad ” for the ahmidiyya movement , as for most muslims , does not mean holy war but rather a struggle to improve oneself or society .
a peaceful movement the ahmadiyya movement stresses the peaceful aspects of islam .
it condemns islamist violence and spoke out against the fatwa against author salman rushdie for his novel “ the satanic verses . ”
“ love for all , hate for none ” is their motto .
yet the ahmidiyya movement is considered heretical by mainstream islam .
for most muslims , mohammed is the last and most important prophet , while ahmadis believe that he was followed by others .
that has won the movement enemies .
in 1974 , pakistan declared followers not to be muslims and legitimized violence against them .
the caliph moved to london .
long history of missionary work the group has been preaching in germany since the weimar republic .
in berlin 's wilmersdorf neighbourhood the splinter group called the lahore ahmadiyya movement opened a mosque in the 1920s .
it is an architectural gem which remains germany 's oldest mosque .
since the beginning of the systematic persecution in pakistan , many pakistani ahmadiyyas came as asylum seekers to germany .
worldwide there are between 10 and 80 million ahmadiyyas .
in pankow-heinersdorf in the northern part of berlin there are almost no muslims , much less ahmadis .
the neighbourhood was chosen for the 100th anniversary celebrations because the group 's first mosque in eastern germany is being built here .
the shell has just been completed after a long and vehement opposition from some of the public .
there were demonstrations and initiatives against the construction .
later , a truck parked at the construction site was burned , police believe it was arson .
“ i can understand the fear the people have , ” said abdullah wagishauser , a german convert , has been head of the group in germany since 1984 .
“ there is a fundamental distrust about islam . ”
wanting to be neighborly but his experience with other mosque projects is that dialogue and information can overcome this antagonism .
“ after one of two years we always have a fully normal neighbourly relationship , ” he said .
in the meantime they have tried to smooth things over with their neighbors .
in august the mosque will be opened and the first muslim will move into the area .

it is intended to replace the current partnership and cooperation agreement -lrb- pca -rrb- , which ran out in 2007 , and should include legally-binding measures on such issues as energy , security , trade and education . negotiations are to be formally launched in siberia on june 26-27 , when new president dmitry medvedev will represent russia for the first time .
they were only made possible after lithuania , the last eu member to block the talks , was assured that its concerns about energy supply and moscow 's stance on georgia would be addressed . officials in brussels predict complex negotiations with moscow are likely to last about a year , with a further year required for its ratification by eu member states and russia . eu ministers also listened to polish plans for strengthening ties with ukraine , moldova , georgia , armenia , azerbaijan and , eventually , belarus . supported by sweden and blessed by heavyweights france and germany , the so-called eastern partnership comes on the back of french plans to boost the eu 's ties with its southern neighbors in a union for the mediterranean . visa-free travel in sight according to a text seen by german news agency dpa , the proposed eastern partnership would seek to deepen cooperation and focus on concrete proposals in the area of migration , with an eye to moving towards a visa-free regime . it would also seek to create a free trade area , provide support for reforms designed to bring those countries up to eu standards , and arrange more student exchange programs . the partnership would use existing neighborhood funds and would have an institutional structure that is " as light-weight and goal-oriented as possible . " human rights , a frequent bone of contention under russia 's former president vladimir putin , and energy supply are also likely to become major topics of discussion . benita ferrero-waldner , the commissioner in charge of the eu 's external relations , said the eu executive would only support the plan if it provided " added value " and did not duplicate existing eu policies . " the negotiation will certainly not be easy … i think they will take quite some time , " she said . poland advocates eastern focus polish and swedish diplomats say the partnership will encourage " multilateral cooperation " and " foster regional links . " cooperation with belarus , whose democratic credentials have been thrown into question , would initially take place only on a " technical and expert level . " the polish-swedish plan was welcomed by the czech republic , which is due to take over the rotating presidency of the eu on jan .
1 . france , which launched the idea of the mediterranean union , is due to hold the eu presidency from july 1 this year . " this year is the mediterranean year , next year would be the eastern year , " said the czech deputy prime minister for european affairs , alexander vondra . kosovo handover unrealistic another major issue up for discussion in brussels is the bloc 's eu-lex law mission in kosovo . the mission was originally meant to take over the administration of the newly independent country from the united nations on june 15 . but eu officials now concede that legal and logistical difficulties mean that the deadline is unrealistic . " eu-lex is going slowly but surely , " said slovenian foreign minister dimitrij rupel , who chaired monday 's meeting as current eu president . dw staff with dpa news reports -lrb- kjb -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

the peaceful beliefs of ahmadis , who can be found in small numbers in germany , are seen as heretical by most muslims . it 's been 100 years since mirza ghulam ahmad founded the ahmadiyya muslim faith .
the controversial indian religious figure claimed to be the promised messiah awaited by all the major religions , whether christian , buddhist jewish or muslim .
his followers believed that within 300 years most of the world will join the islamic brotherhood , which will usher in an era of peace .
that goal implies worldwide missionary work , which has lead ahmadis , as the members of the ahmidiyya community call themselves , to proselitize the world .
they 've even ended up in the unlikely berlin neighborhood of pankow-heinersdorf .
with a new mosque under construction and 100th anniversary parties planned , mirza masroor ahmad will travel to berlin on tuesday , may 27 .
for his followers , the caliph is for followers a representative of the promised messiah .
he is democratically elected by the council of the ahmadiyyas and serves for life .
misunderstandings persist the title of " caliph " has been misunderstood by many in the west , said islamic scholar stephan rosiny .
a caliph is the political head of state in an islamic community .
while the practice of the worldly and spiritual leadership being united in the person of the caliph has its origins in the middle ages , modern islamists have used the idea as well .
a recent example was the so-called caliph of cologne , metin kaplan , who , until his movement was outlawed in 2001 dreamed of starting an islamic regime in europe .
“ to equate the ahmadis with something like that is pure sensationalism , ” rosiny said .
rosiny sees a perception problem due to people in the west viewing radical forms of islam as the norm rather than an exception .
rosiny said that islamic beliefs need to be taken in context .
caliph means successor and “ jihad ” for the ahmidiyya movement , as for most muslims , does not mean holy war but rather a struggle to improve oneself or society .
a peaceful movement the ahmadiyya movement stresses the peaceful aspects of islam .
it condemns islamist violence and spoke out against the fatwa against author salman rushdie for his novel “ the satanic verses . ”
“ love for all , hate for none ” is their motto .
yet the ahmidiyya movement is considered heretical by mainstream islam .
for most muslims , mohammed is the last and most important prophet , while ahmadis believe that he was followed by others .
that has won the movement enemies .
in 1974 , pakistan declared followers not to be muslims and legitimized violence against them .
the caliph moved to london .
long history of missionary work the group has been preaching in germany since the weimar republic .
in berlin 's wilmersdorf neighbourhood the splinter group called the lahore ahmadiyya movement opened a mosque in the 1920s .
it is an architectural gem which remains germany 's oldest mosque .
since the beginning of the systematic persecution in pakistan , many pakistani ahmadiyyas came as asylum seekers to germany .
worldwide there are between 10 and 80 million ahmadiyyas .

the decision is sure to cause friction within germany 's coalition government . schwan , a 65-year-old university professor , was announced on monday , may 26 , as the social democratic party 's -lrb- spd -rrb- choice for the high-profile office of german president .
schwan nearly won the post five years ago , but lost out to horst koehler , a former head of the international monetary fund .
koehler has the support of chancellor angela merkel 's christian democratic union -lrb- cdu -rrb- , who wants to see him serve a second five-year term .
members of the cdu and its bavarian sister party , the christian social union -lrb- csu -rrb- , were upset to hear that the spd would put forth its own candidate .
the parties form a left-right coalition together .
chancellor merkel expressed her anger about the decision of her coalition partners to nominate their own candidate . " we have a president who is respected around the world , " merkel said .
" so it is regrettable that the social democrats have put up their own candidate in this step that can only be explained by the internal state of the party . ” schwan 's candidacy runs counter to a longstanding tradition observed by the two main political blocs not to put up a challenger to a president seeking a second term . " i believe that this candidacy will fail and that horst koehler will remain president , as is the wish of the majority of our citizens , " she added .
coalition will stay together bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : they do not always see eye to eye spd head hubertus heil said that he does not worry that the move will rupture the coalition ahead of federal elections , which are scheduled to take place in 2009 .
the csu also faces state elections in bavaria later this year .
" a little competition is n't going to cause any harm to a functioning democracy , " heil said .
" the csu is nervous ahead of the state elections in september .
i urge them just to relax . "
spd leader kurt beck said that his party would not " campaign against the incumbent . "
" in a democracy , we view a rival candidacy as a good opportunity for a broad discussion of the issues , " beck said monday .
merkel 's spokesman ulrich wilhelm also rejected any suggestion of the coalition breaking apart at a news conference .
" the chancellor has made it clear that the spd decision puts a strain on the coalition but that she , as well as the chairmen of the spd and csu , remains interested in carrying on the work on policies in the best interests of germany , " wilhelm said .
secret vote bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : koehler wants another five years schwan narrowly lost to koehler in 2004 when the cdu and free democrats -lrb- fdp -rrb- had a majority in the federal assembly , which is made up of members of parliament and delegates from each of germany 's 16 federal states .
the vote for president is done by secret ballot , meaning any federal assembly member can vote for any candidate .
the assembly meets every five years to elect a president .
the assembly vote for president will take place in may of 2009 .
political analysts say that center-left parties could have enough votes to elect schwan .

" so it is regrettable that the social democrats have put up their own candidate in this step that can only be explained by the internal state of the party . ” schwan 's candidacy runs counter to a longstanding tradition observed by the two main political blocs not to put up a challenger to a president seeking a second term . " i believe that this candidacy will fail and that horst koehler will remain president , as is the wish of the majority of our citizens , " she added .
coalition will stay together bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : they do not always see eye to eye spd head hubertus heil said that he does not worry that the move will rupture the coalition ahead of federal elections , which are scheduled to take place in 2009 .
the csu also faces state elections in bavaria later this year .
" a little competition is n't going to cause any harm to a functioning democracy , " heil said .
" the csu is nervous ahead of the state elections in september .
i urge them just to relax . "
spd leader kurt beck said that his party would not " campaign against the incumbent . "
" in a democracy , we view a rival candidacy as a good opportunity for a broad discussion of the issues , " beck said monday .
merkel 's spokesman ulrich wilhelm also rejected any suggestion of the coalition breaking apart at a news conference .
" the chancellor has made it clear that the spd decision puts a strain on the coalition but that she , as well as the chairmen of the spd and csu , remains interested in carrying on the work on policies in the best interests of germany , " wilhelm said .
secret vote bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : koehler wants another five years schwan narrowly lost to koehler in 2004 when the cdu and free democrats -lrb- fdp -rrb- had a majority in the federal assembly , which is made up of members of parliament and delegates from each of germany 's 16 federal states .
the vote for president is done by secret ballot , meaning any federal assembly member can vote for any candidate .
the assembly meets every five years to elect a president .
the assembly vote for president will take place in may of 2009 .
political analysts say that center-left parties could have enough votes to elect schwan .
while the spd has refused to enter into a coalition with the left party in forming a government , it would presumably rely on the left and the greens to elect schwan . dw staff -lrb- th -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

it should also boost employment in the region . the express mail delivery and logistics company dhl , which is a division of germany 's postal giant deutsche post ag , inaugurated its principle european hub at leipzig-halle airport in eastern germany on monday , may 26 .
in 2004 , deutsche post had already announced the planned move from brussels to leipzig , since the belgian capital refused to permit additional nighttime flights .
dhl added that besides being able to operate around the clock in leipzig , the central european location was ideal as a hub for emerging markets in eastern europe and asia .
" demand for express services is growing worldwide , " said the new ceo of the post ag parent company , frank appel at the opening ceremony attended by prominent politicians , such as german foreign minister frank-walter steinmeier .
" this is a day to be proud of .
we are looking towards the future , " he said .
georg milbradt , the state premier of saxony , where leipzig is the capital , hailed the move as a " job motor " which will help boost the economy in the eastern states , which have higher unemployment rates than in the west .
at present dhl already operates flights to the middle east and india from leipzig-halle , where it plans to increase its personnel from about 2,000 to 3,500 employees by 2012 .
" with dhl here , the state of saxony will without a doubt become a central logistics point in europe , " said the state 's economics minister thomas jurk .
some 300 million euros -lrb- $ 474 million -rrb- have already been invested in the new hub , which has an air freight turnover of 1,500 tons a day .
about 60 freight aircraft bearing the dhl logo take off and land in leipzig per day .
worldwide , dhl flies to nearly 50 destinations , of which leipzig will become one of three main hubs that include wilmington , ohio in the us and hong kong .
not everyone was happy about the new hub however .
dozens of local residents staged a protest at the inauguration over the potential increase in noise levels at night .
" we will only fly when necessary , " said appel .
a hearing on night time flights will be held in the federal courts in leipzig on july 15 . dw staff -lrb- df -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

" there are going to be harsh consequences " if allegations that deutsche telekom spied on company officials and journalists by monitoring phone traffic between them in order to uncover the source of information leaks are true , said ceo rene obermann in a statement published in the german mass circulation bild zeitung on monday , may 26 .
" this is a breach of our data privacy laws .
cases of misconduct must be clarified , " said obermann , who assured telekom customers that their phone records would remain confidential .
" the billing records of our millions of fixed-line and mobile customers remain secure , " he said , adding that he has faith in telekom 's 240,000 employees .
the alleged misconduct took place over the course of more than a year in 2005-2006 under obermann 's predecessor kai-uwe ricke , who was ousted at a time of diminishing profits and management disputes .
" earth-shattering " ricke and klaus zumwinkel , who was head of the telecom giant 's supervisory board at the time , both denied commissioning the analysis of the data , which recorded the numbers dialed and the time and the duration of phone calls . obermann was head of the mobile division of deutsche telekom at the time .
hundreds of thousands of phone calls made by top management and supervisory board members were monitored , but not tapped , according to newsmagazine " der spiegel . "
a private berlin agency has been analyzing the data .
numerous phone calls out of new york were also monitored , " der spiegel " reported .
the new york-based blackstone group , a private equities firm , owns a significant stake in deutsche telekom , which is one-third state controlled .
the criminal inquiry , which has been handed over to public prosecutors , threatens to undermine relations with labor leaders at a point when management has been making massive job cuts in restructuring its domestic operations .
max stadler a parliamentarian and internal affairs spokesman for the opposition fdp , told the frankfurter rundschau newspaper it was " earth-shattering that a company that has a special responsibility for protecting private data " violated germany 's data privacy laws . dw staff -lrb- df -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

" the eu general affairs and external relations council has decided the eu should double the number of participants in the eupol mission in afghanistan , " said a statement from the slovenian presidency of the bloc .
" this measure will strengthen efforts towards police reform , " it added .
launched in june 2007 and expected to last for at least three years , the eupol mission consists of about 200 experts tasked with training afghan policemen and officials at the interior ministry .
their numbers are now expected to rise to about 400 over the next 12 months , diplomats said .
" we want the afghan government to be able to take care of security themselves , " said german defence minister franz josef jung , whose country was strongly behind the initiative .
italy considering sending troops to danger zones bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : frattini said isaf requests would determine italy 's plans separately , new italian foreign minister franco frattini said his government was ready to drop some of its caveats and deploy its troops to more dangerous battle zones , as requested by nato .
" we are talking about greater geographical flexibility , " frattini said .
" we want to align italy to its other great nato partners . "
italy currently has about 2,360 soldiers in afghanistan .
but they are mainly deployed in kabul and in the less restive west of the country .
the previous centre-left government of romano prodi refused to give in to us requests for the troops to be sent to southern hotspots , where nato is fighting taliban insurgents .
germany has maintained a similar position , thus infuriating the united states , britain , canada and the netherlands , which have suffered significant casualties around the kandahar region .
new direction for italian leadership frattini did not rule out sending troops to the south , saying redeployment would depend on the requests made by nato 's international security assistance force -lrb- isaf -rrb- .
but with a political storm brewing back home , italian defence minister ignazio la russa later clarified that such redeployments would be " temporary " rather than permanent .
" we are not against , should the need arise , temporary interventions aimed at lending a hand to those facing greater difficulties than ours , " he said . dw staff / dpa -lrb- nda -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

after a week , they have isolated key issues splitting the ninth conference of the parties to the convention on biological diversity -lrb- cbd -rrb- that runs until may 30 .
on sunday , may 25 , they were told to forget weekend-break plans and attend extra sessions summoned by the chairman of the mammoth conference , german environment minister sigmar gabriel .
the delegates must find a way to preserve biological diversity on the planet .
despite a minimum of progress , decisive action to halt the global destruction of virgin natural sites like rain forests and to prevent the extinction of flora and fauna has not yet been agreed upon .
the talks have prompted greater public awareness and concern about the exploitation of natural resources for the profit of the few .
gabriel says the sheer survival of billions of people may depend on this meeting 's resolutions , and that most government officials have praised the " constructive " atmosphere in the debates .
that should move the talks forward , said gabriel , whose role as chairman has been important in setting the fast pace .
praise heaped on german hosts bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : gabriel and his colleagues have been praised for their work ahmed djoghlaf , chief of the un convention secretariat , has been unstinting in his praise of the germans and gabriel for their no-nonsense management of the negotiations .

like the un climate-change convention , the pact on biodiversity requires " consensus " decision-making by the 191 parties under the aegis of the united nations .
it takes only one nay-sayer to torpedo any agreement , so conflicting national interests must be balanced up .
there have been critics in bonn quietly suggesting that such a decision-making method is impossibly unwieldy , but no one openly proposes the alternative : voting and letting a majority decide .

reyes ' death has been the biggest blow to the marxist guerrilla movement in latin america since farc , which has more than 17,000 members , was founded in the 1960s .
e-mail communication on reyes ' lap top show that the guerrilla leader had sent his son to germany on a secret mission in january 2005 .
in germany , reyes ' son had met with german communist party members , including wolfgang gehrcke , an extreme leftist politician , who said he would pressure the european parliament in strasbourg to remove the farc from its list of banned terrorist organizations .
the farc , which is believed to hold hundreds of people hostage including the case involving the highly publicized french-colombian politician ingrid betancourt , is also on washington 's watch list of terror groups .
it has also been accused of funding its insurgency through kidnapping for huge ransoms and trafficking cocaine .
the meeting between gehrcke and reyes ' son was described as “ very positive " in an e-mail found on reyes ' laptop .
" we were able to substantiate several points in support of the struggle of the colombian people , " quoted der spiegel in the email .

" there are going to be harsh consequences " if allegations that deutsche telekom spied on company officials and journalists by monitoring phone traffic between them in order to uncover the source of information leaks are true , said ceo rene obermann in a statement published in the german mass circulation bild zeitung on monday , may 26 .
" this is a breach of our data privacy laws .
cases of misconduct must be clarified , " said obermann , who assured telekom customers that their phone records would remain confidential .
" the billing records of our millions of fixed-line and mobile customers remain secure , " he said , adding that he has faith in telekom 's 240,000 employees .
the alleged misconduct took place over the course of more than a year in 2005-2006 under obermann 's predecessor kai-uwe ricke , who was ousted at a time of diminishing profits and management disputes .
" earth-shattering " ricke and klaus zumwinkel , who was head of the telecom giant 's supervisory board at the time , both denied commissioning the analysis of the data , which recorded the numbers dialed and the time and the duration of phone calls . obermann was head of the mobile division of deutsche telekom at the time .
hundreds of thousands of phone calls made by top management and supervisory board members were monitored , but not tapped , according to newsmagazine " der spiegel . "
a private berlin agency has been analyzing the data .
numerous phone calls out of new york were also monitored , " der spiegel " reported .
the new york-based blackstone group , a private equities firm , owns a significant stake in deutsche telekom , which is one-third state controlled .
the criminal inquiry , which has been handed over to public prosecutors , threatens to undermine relations with labor leaders at a point when management has been making massive job cuts in restructuring its domestic operations .

" the eu general affairs and external relations council has decided the eu should double the number of participants in the eupol mission in afghanistan , " said a statement from the slovenian presidency of the bloc .
" this measure will strengthen efforts towards police reform , " it added .
launched in june 2007 and expected to last for at least three years , the eupol mission consists of about 200 experts tasked with training afghan policemen and officials at the interior ministry .
their numbers are now expected to rise to about 400 over the next 12 months , diplomats said .
" we want the afghan government to be able to take care of security themselves , " said german defence minister franz josef jung , whose country was strongly behind the initiative .
italy considering sending troops to danger zones bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : frattini said isaf requests would determine italy 's plans separately , new italian foreign minister franco frattini said his government was ready to drop some of its caveats and deploy its troops to more dangerous battle zones , as requested by nato .
" we are talking about greater geographical flexibility , " frattini said .
" we want to align italy to its other great nato partners . "
italy currently has about 2,360 soldiers in afghanistan .
but they are mainly deployed in kabul and in the less restive west of the country .
the previous centre-left government of romano prodi refused to give in to us requests for the troops to be sent to southern hotspots , where nato is fighting taliban insurgents .
germany has maintained a similar position , thus infuriating the united states , britain , canada and the netherlands , which have suffered significant casualties around the kandahar region .
new direction for italian leadership frattini did not rule out sending troops to the south , saying redeployment would depend on the requests made by nato 's international security assistance force -lrb- isaf -rrb- .
but with a political storm brewing back home , italian defence minister ignazio la russa later clarified that such redeployments would be " temporary " rather than permanent .
" we are not against , should the need arise , temporary interventions aimed at lending a hand to those facing greater difficulties than ours , " he said . dw staff / dpa -lrb- nda -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

after a week , they have isolated key issues splitting the ninth conference of the parties to the convention on biological diversity -lrb- cbd -rrb- that runs until may 30 .
on sunday , may 25 , they were told to forget weekend-break plans and attend extra sessions summoned by the chairman of the mammoth conference , german environment minister sigmar gabriel .
the delegates must find a way to preserve biological diversity on the planet .
despite a minimum of progress , decisive action to halt the global destruction of virgin natural sites like rain forests and to prevent the extinction of flora and fauna has not yet been agreed upon .
the talks have prompted greater public awareness and concern about the exploitation of natural resources for the profit of the few .
gabriel says the sheer survival of billions of people may depend on this meeting 's resolutions , and that most government officials have praised the " constructive " atmosphere in the debates .
that should move the talks forward , said gabriel , whose role as chairman has been important in setting the fast pace .
praise heaped on german hosts bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : gabriel and his colleagues have been praised for their work ahmed djoghlaf , chief of the un convention secretariat , has been unstinting in his praise of the germans and gabriel for their no-nonsense management of the negotiations .
it is a gargantuan task getting so many nations to agree .
like the un climate-change convention , the pact on biodiversity requires " consensus " decision-making by the 191 parties under the aegis of the united nations .
it takes only one nay-sayer to torpedo any agreement , so conflicting national interests must be balanced up .
there have been critics in bonn quietly suggesting that such a decision-making method is impossibly unwieldy , but no one openly proposes the alternative : voting and letting a majority decide .
conference managers shrug and say , " if we started a debate about making decisions by a majority , we 'd never hear the end of it . "
eradication of bio-piracy a key issue one of the key issues at the conference has been how to achieve access to the natural resources mankind needs , and at the same time compensate poor countries , for example for the use of their unique plant species as sources of drugs .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : protests focused on the abuse of natural resources there has been some progress towards drafting a bonn " road map " on future talks about this .
such a road map would lead to a treaty being adopted by the next biodiversity conference in nagoya , japan in 2010 .
gabriel says both developing and industrialized countries will benefit from having clear ground rules about profit-sharing with the poor nations .
nature reserve network plan under fire meanwhile , the idea of creating a world network of nature reserves on land and under the sea has caused antagonism .
sources in the delegations say there is little prospect of any deal .
environmentalist group greenpeace alleges that the industrialized world is not sufficiently willing to foot the bill .
developing nations say they can not afford to create reserves alone .
as a solution , gabriel has proposed a " life web , " in which poorer nations would offer specific tracts for adoption and rich nations would post the money to convert them to reserves .
some cash offers have already been made in bonn .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the price of bio-fuels on the environment is a key issue the environmental harm done by bio-fuel plantations has been a point of controversy , as had been expected .
gabriel describes the bonn meet as the first international conference to debate the emerging problem .
" that in itself is a success and a breakthrough , " he said .
brazil was the loudest of those who questioned whether the conference had any authority to discuss the topic , arguing that it was not within the ambit of a biodiversity convention .
in the end , brazil , which grows ethanol crops , agreed to the debate , but insisted it must not be pilloried as an offender .
delegates agreed that ecological guidelines should be drafted to demonstrate how bio-energy crops can be grown beneficially .
protestors target bio-fuels environmentalists have homed in on the bio-fuel trade as a target , and demanded the crops be banned .

the decision is sure to cause friction within germany 's coalition government . schwan , a 65-year-old university professor , was announced on monday , may 26 , as the social democratic party 's -lrb- spd -rrb- choice for the high-profile office of german president .
schwan nearly won the post five years ago , but lost out to horst koehler , a former head of the international monetary fund .
koehler has the support of chancellor angela merkel 's christian democratic union -lrb- cdu -rrb- , who wants to see him serve a second five-year term .
members of the cdu and its bavarian sister party , the christian social union -lrb- csu -rrb- , were upset to hear that the spd would put forth its own candidate .
the parties form a left-right coalition together .
chancellor merkel expressed her anger about the decision of her coalition partners to nominate their own candidate . " we have a president who is respected around the world , " merkel said .
" so it is regrettable that the social democrats have put up their own candidate in this step that can only be explained by the internal state of the party . ” schwan 's candidacy runs counter to a longstanding tradition observed by the two main political blocs not to put up a challenger to a president seeking a second term . " i believe that this candidacy will fail and that horst koehler will remain president , as is the wish of the majority of our citizens , " she added .
coalition will stay together bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : they do not always see eye to eye spd head hubertus heil said that he does not worry that the move will rupture the coalition ahead of federal elections , which are scheduled to take place in 2009 .
the csu also faces state elections in bavaria later this year .
" a little competition is n't going to cause any harm to a functioning democracy , " heil said .
" the csu is nervous ahead of the state elections in september .
i urge them just to relax . "
spd leader kurt beck said that his party would not " campaign against the incumbent . "
" in a democracy , we view a rival candidacy as a good opportunity for a broad discussion of the issues , " beck said monday .
merkel 's spokesman ulrich wilhelm also rejected any suggestion of the coalition breaking apart at a news conference .
" the chancellor has made it clear that the spd decision puts a strain on the coalition but that she , as well as the chairmen of the spd and csu , remains interested in carrying on the work on policies in the best interests of germany , " wilhelm said .
secret vote bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : koehler wants another five years schwan narrowly lost to koehler in 2004 when the cdu and free democrats -lrb- fdp -rrb- had a majority in the federal assembly , which is made up of members of parliament and delegates from each of germany 's 16 federal states .
the vote for president is done by secret ballot , meaning any federal assembly member can vote for any candidate .
the assembly meets every five years to elect a president .
the assembly vote for president will take place in may of 2009 .
political analysts say that center-left parties could have enough votes to elect schwan .
while the spd has refused to enter into a coalition with the left party in forming a government , it would presumably rely on the left and the greens to elect schwan . dw staff -lrb- th -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

" i believe that this candidacy will fail and that horst koehler will remain president , as is the wish of the majority of our citizens , " she added .
coalition will stay together bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : they do not always see eye to eye spd head hubertus heil said that he does not worry that the move will rupture the coalition ahead of federal elections , which are scheduled to take place in 2009 .
the csu also faces state elections in bavaria later this year .
" a little competition is n't going to cause any harm to a functioning democracy , " heil said .
" the csu is nervous ahead of the state elections in september .
i urge them just to relax . "
spd leader kurt beck said that his party would not " campaign against the incumbent . "
" in a democracy , we view a rival candidacy as a good opportunity for a broad discussion of the issues , " beck said monday .
merkel 's spokesman ulrich wilhelm also rejected any suggestion of the coalition breaking apart at a news conference .
" the chancellor has made it clear that the spd decision puts a strain on the coalition but that she , as well as the chairmen of the spd and csu , remains interested in carrying on the work on policies in the best interests of germany , " wilhelm said .
secret vote bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : koehler wants another five years schwan narrowly lost to koehler in 2004 when the cdu and free democrats -lrb- fdp -rrb- had a majority in the federal assembly , which is made up of members of parliament and delegates from each of germany 's 16 federal states .
the vote for president is done by secret ballot , meaning any federal assembly member can vote for any candidate .
the assembly meets every five years to elect a president .
the assembly vote for president will take place in may of 2009 .
political analysts say that center-left parties could have enough votes to elect schwan .
while the spd has refused to enter into a coalition with the left party in forming a government , it would presumably rely on the left and the greens to elect schwan . dw staff -lrb- th -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

the chief prosecutor said the massive case would send a clear message . former siemens manager reinhardt siekaczek , 57 , went on trial in munich on monday , may 26 , in a case that may reveal the scale of a suspected bribery network that is already estimated at around 1.3 billion euros -lrb- $ 2 billion -rrb- . siekaczek , who has already admitted to setting up slush funds , has been charged with 58 cases of breach of trust , each of which could bring a jail sentence of up to five years .
he is suspected of embezzling as much as 50 million euros , which went as bribes to individuals who acquired contracts for siemens . siekaczek is not accused of personally pocketing any of the money . senior public prosecutor anton winkler said he hoped the trial would " bring new awareness in corporate culture that bribery will not be tolerated , either in germany or abroad . " some 300 suspects are being investigated by munich prosecutors in an affair that led to the resignation of two siemens executives - former ceos klaus kleinfeld and heinrich von pierer . von pierer is to appear as a witness in the case , as is siemens ' current chief financial officer , joe kaeser . dw staff -lrb- kjb -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

it is intended to replace the current partnership and cooperation agreement -lrb- pca -rrb- , which ran out in 2007 , and should include legally-binding measures on such issues as energy , security , trade and education . negotiations are to be formally launched in siberia on june 26-27 , when new president dmitry medvedev will represent russia for the first time .
they were only made possible after lithuania , the last eu member to block the talks , was assured that its concerns about energy supply and moscow 's stance on georgia would be addressed . officials in brussels predict complex negotiations with moscow are likely to last about a year , with a further year required for its ratification by eu member states and russia . eu ministers also listened to polish plans for strengthening ties with ukraine , moldova , georgia , armenia , azerbaijan and , eventually , belarus . supported by sweden and blessed by heavyweights france and germany , the so-called eastern partnership comes on the back of french plans to boost the eu 's ties with its southern neighbors in a union for the mediterranean . visa-free travel in sight according to a text seen by german news agency dpa , the proposed eastern partnership would seek to deepen cooperation and focus on concrete proposals in the area of migration , with an eye to moving towards a visa-free regime . it would also seek to create a free trade area , provide support for reforms designed to bring those countries up to eu standards , and arrange more student exchange programs . the partnership would use existing neighborhood funds and would have an institutional structure that is " as light-weight and goal-oriented as possible . " human rights , a frequent bone of contention under russia 's former president vladimir putin , and energy supply are also likely to become major topics of discussion . benita ferrero-waldner , the commissioner in charge of the eu 's external relations , said the eu executive would only support the plan if it provided " added value " and did not duplicate existing eu policies . " the negotiation will certainly not be easy … i think they will take quite some time , " she said . poland advocates eastern focus polish and swedish diplomats say the partnership will encourage " multilateral cooperation " and " foster regional links . " cooperation with belarus , whose democratic credentials have been thrown into question , would initially take place only on a " technical and expert level . " the polish-swedish plan was welcomed by the czech republic , which is due to take over the rotating presidency of the eu on jan .
1 . france , which launched the idea of the mediterranean union , is due to hold the eu presidency from july 1 this year . " this year is the mediterranean year , next year would be the eastern year , " said the czech deputy prime minister for european affairs , alexander vondra . kosovo handover unrealistic another major issue up for discussion in brussels is the bloc 's eu-lex law mission in kosovo . the mission was originally meant to take over the administration of the newly independent country from the united nations on june 15 . but eu officials now concede that legal and logistical difficulties mean that the deadline is unrealistic . " eu-lex is going slowly but surely , " said slovenian foreign minister dimitrij rupel , who chaired monday 's meeting as current eu president . dw staff with dpa news reports -lrb- kjb -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

reyes ' death has been the biggest blow to the marxist guerrilla movement in latin america since farc , which has more than 17,000 members , was founded in the 1960s .
e-mail communication on reyes ' lap top show that the guerrilla leader had sent his son to germany on a secret mission in january 2005 .
in germany , reyes ' son had met with german communist party members , including wolfgang gehrcke , an extreme leftist politician , who said he would pressure the european parliament in strasbourg to remove the farc from its list of banned terrorist organizations .
the farc , which is believed to hold hundreds of people hostage including the case involving the highly publicized french-colombian politician ingrid betancourt , is also on washington 's watch list of terror groups .
it has also been accused of funding its insurgency through kidnapping for huge ransoms and trafficking cocaine .
the meeting between gehrcke and reyes ' son was described as “ very positive " in an e-mail found on reyes ' laptop .
" we were able to substantiate several points in support of the struggle of the colombian people , " quoted der spiegel in the email .
computer data found after the raid has already heightened tensions in south america , with colombian officials saying that they have substantiated links between the farc , ecuadoran and venezuelan president hugo chavez . dw staff -lrb- df -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

it is intended to replace the current partnership and cooperation agreement -lrb- pca -rrb- , which ran out in 2007 , and should include legally-binding measures on such issues as energy , security , trade and education . negotiations are to be formally launched in siberia on june 26-27 , when new president dmitry medvedev will represent russia for the first time .
they were only made possible after lithuania , the last eu member to block the talks , was assured that its concerns about energy supply and moscow 's stance on georgia would be addressed . officials in brussels predict complex negotiations with moscow are likely to last about a year , with a further year required for its ratification by eu member states and russia . eu ministers also listened to polish plans for strengthening ties with ukraine , moldova , georgia , armenia , azerbaijan and , eventually , belarus . supported by sweden and blessed by heavyweights france and germany , the so-called eastern partnership comes on the back of french plans to boost the eu 's ties with its southern neighbors in a union for the mediterranean . visa-free travel in sight according to a text seen by german news agency dpa , the proposed eastern partnership would seek to deepen cooperation and focus on concrete proposals in the area of migration , with an eye to moving towards a visa-free regime . it would also seek to create a free trade area , provide support for reforms designed to bring those countries up to eu standards , and arrange more student exchange programs . the partnership would use existing neighborhood funds and would have an institutional structure that is " as light-weight and goal-oriented as possible . " human rights , a frequent bone of contention under russia 's former president vladimir putin , and energy supply are also likely to become major topics of discussion . benita ferrero-waldner , the commissioner in charge of the eu 's external relations , said the eu executive would only support the plan if it provided " added value " and did not duplicate existing eu policies . " the negotiation will certainly not be easy … i think they will take quite some time , " she said . poland advocates eastern focus polish and swedish diplomats say the partnership will encourage " multilateral cooperation " and " foster regional links . " cooperation with belarus , whose democratic credentials have been thrown into question , would initially take place only on a " technical and expert level . " the polish-swedish plan was welcomed by the czech republic , which is due to take over the rotating presidency of the eu on jan .
1 . france , which launched the idea of the mediterranean union , is due to hold the eu presidency from july 1 this year . " this year is the mediterranean year , next year would be the eastern year , " said the czech deputy prime minister for european affairs , alexander vondra . kosovo handover unrealistic another major issue up for discussion in brussels is the bloc 's eu-lex law mission in kosovo . the mission was originally meant to take over the administration of the newly independent country from the united nations on june 15 . but eu officials now concede that legal and logistical difficulties mean that the deadline is unrealistic . " eu-lex is going slowly but surely , " said slovenian foreign minister dimitrij rupel , who chaired monday 's meeting as current eu president . dw staff with dpa news reports -lrb- kjb -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

the peaceful beliefs of ahmadis , who can be found in small numbers in germany , are seen as heretical by most muslims . it 's been 100 years since mirza ghulam ahmad founded the ahmadiyya muslim faith .
the controversial indian religious figure claimed to be the promised messiah awaited by all the major religions , whether christian , buddhist jewish or muslim .
his followers believed that within 300 years most of the world will join the islamic brotherhood , which will usher in an era of peace .
that goal implies worldwide missionary work , which has lead ahmadis , as the members of the ahmidiyya community call themselves , to proselitize the world .
they 've even ended up in the unlikely berlin neighborhood of pankow-heinersdorf .
with a new mosque under construction and 100th anniversary parties planned , mirza masroor ahmad will travel to berlin on tuesday , may 27 .
for his followers , the caliph is for followers a representative of the promised messiah .
he is democratically elected by the council of the ahmadiyyas and serves for life .
misunderstandings persist the title of " caliph " has been misunderstood by many in the west , said islamic scholar stephan rosiny .
a caliph is the political head of state in an islamic community .
while the practice of the worldly and spiritual leadership being united in the person of the caliph has its origins in the middle ages , modern islamists have used the idea as well .
a recent example was the so-called caliph of cologne , metin kaplan , who , until his movement was outlawed in 2001 dreamed of starting an islamic regime in europe .
“ to equate the ahmadis with something like that is pure sensationalism , ” rosiny said .
rosiny sees a perception problem due to people in the west viewing radical forms of islam as the norm rather than an exception .
rosiny said that islamic beliefs need to be taken in context .
caliph means successor and “ jihad ” for the ahmidiyya movement , as for most muslims , does not mean holy war but rather a struggle to improve oneself or society .
a peaceful movement the ahmadiyya movement stresses the peaceful aspects of islam .
it condemns islamist violence and spoke out against the fatwa against author salman rushdie for his novel “ the satanic verses . ”
“ love for all , hate for none ” is their motto .
yet the ahmidiyya movement is considered heretical by mainstream islam .
for most muslims , mohammed is the last and most important prophet , while ahmadis believe that he was followed by others .
that has won the movement enemies .
in 1974 , pakistan declared followers not to be muslims and legitimized violence against them .
the caliph moved to london .
long history of missionary work the group has been preaching in germany since the weimar republic .
in berlin 's wilmersdorf neighbourhood the splinter group called the lahore ahmadiyya movement opened a mosque in the 1920s .
it is an architectural gem which remains germany 's oldest mosque .
since the beginning of the systematic persecution in pakistan , many pakistani ahmadiyyas came as asylum seekers to germany .
worldwide there are between 10 and 80 million ahmadiyyas .
in pankow-heinersdorf in the northern part of berlin there are almost no muslims , much less ahmadis .
the neighbourhood was chosen for the 100th anniversary celebrations because the group 's first mosque in eastern germany is being built here .
the shell has just been completed after a long and vehement opposition from some of the public .
there were demonstrations and initiatives against the construction .
later , a truck parked at the construction site was burned , police believe it was arson .
“ i can understand the fear the people have , ” said abdullah wagishauser , a german convert , has been head of the group in germany since 1984 .
“ there is a fundamental distrust about islam . ”
wanting to be neighborly but his experience with other mosque projects is that dialogue and information can overcome this antagonism .
“ after one of two years we always have a fully normal neighbourly relationship , ” he said .
in the meantime they have tried to smooth things over with their neighbors .

the peaceful beliefs of ahmadis , who can be found in small numbers in germany , are seen as heretical by most muslims . it 's been 100 years since mirza ghulam ahmad founded the ahmadiyya muslim faith .
the controversial indian religious figure claimed to be the promised messiah awaited by all the major religions , whether christian , buddhist jewish or muslim .
his followers believed that within 300 years most of the world will join the islamic brotherhood , which will usher in an era of peace .
that goal implies worldwide missionary work , which has lead ahmadis , as the members of the ahmidiyya community call themselves , to proselitize the world .
they 've even ended up in the unlikely berlin neighborhood of pankow-heinersdorf .
with a new mosque under construction and 100th anniversary parties planned , mirza masroor ahmad will travel to berlin on tuesday , may 27 .
for his followers , the caliph is for followers a representative of the promised messiah .
he is democratically elected by the council of the ahmadiyyas and serves for life .
misunderstandings persist the title of " caliph " has been misunderstood by many in the west , said islamic scholar stephan rosiny .
a caliph is the political head of state in an islamic community .
while the practice of the worldly and spiritual leadership being united in the person of the caliph has its origins in the middle ages , modern islamists have used the idea as well .
a recent example was the so-called caliph of cologne , metin kaplan , who , until his movement was outlawed in 2001 dreamed of starting an islamic regime in europe .
“ to equate the ahmadis with something like that is pure sensationalism , ” rosiny said .
rosiny sees a perception problem due to people in the west viewing radical forms of islam as the norm rather than an exception .
rosiny said that islamic beliefs need to be taken in context .
caliph means successor and “ jihad ” for the ahmidiyya movement , as for most muslims , does not mean holy war but rather a struggle to improve oneself or society .
a peaceful movement the ahmadiyya movement stresses the peaceful aspects of islam .
it condemns islamist violence and spoke out against the fatwa against author salman rushdie for his novel “ the satanic verses . ”
“ love for all , hate for none ” is their motto .
yet the ahmidiyya movement is considered heretical by mainstream islam .
for most muslims , mohammed is the last and most important prophet , while ahmadis believe that he was followed by others .
that has won the movement enemies .
in 1974 , pakistan declared followers not to be muslims and legitimized violence against them .
the caliph moved to london .
long history of missionary work the group has been preaching in germany since the weimar republic .
in berlin 's wilmersdorf neighbourhood the splinter group called the lahore ahmadiyya movement opened a mosque in the 1920s .
it is an architectural gem which remains germany 's oldest mosque .
since the beginning of the systematic persecution in pakistan , many pakistani ahmadiyyas came as asylum seekers to germany .
worldwide there are between 10 and 80 million ahmadiyyas .
in pankow-heinersdorf in the northern part of berlin there are almost no muslims , much less ahmadis .
the neighbourhood was chosen for the 100th anniversary celebrations because the group 's first mosque in eastern germany is being built here .
the shell has just been completed after a long and vehement opposition from some of the public .
there were demonstrations and initiatives against the construction .
later , a truck parked at the construction site was burned , police believe it was arson .
“ i can understand the fear the people have , ” said abdullah wagishauser , a german convert , has been head of the group in germany since 1984 .
“ there is a fundamental distrust about islam . ”
wanting to be neighborly but his experience with other mosque projects is that dialogue and information can overcome this antagonism .
“ after one of two years we always have a fully normal neighbourly relationship , ” he said .
in the meantime they have tried to smooth things over with their neighbors .
in august the mosque will be opened and the first muslim will move into the area .

" the eu general affairs and external relations council has decided the eu should double the number of participants in the eupol mission in afghanistan , " said a statement from the slovenian presidency of the bloc .
" this measure will strengthen efforts towards police reform , " it added .
launched in june 2007 and expected to last for at least three years , the eupol mission consists of about 200 experts tasked with training afghan policemen and officials at the interior ministry .

" we are talking about greater geographical flexibility , " frattini said .
" we want to align italy to its other great nato partners . "
italy currently has about 2,360 soldiers in afghanistan .
but they are mainly deployed in kabul and in the less restive west of the country .
the previous centre-left government of romano prodi refused to give in to us requests for the troops to be sent to southern hotspots , where nato is fighting taliban insurgents .
germany has maintained a similar position , thus infuriating the united states , britain , canada and the netherlands , which have suffered significant casualties around the kandahar region .

it should also boost employment in the region . the express mail delivery and logistics company dhl , which is a division of germany 's postal giant deutsche post ag , inaugurated its principle european hub at leipzig-halle airport in eastern germany on monday , may 26 .
in 2004 , deutsche post had already announced the planned move from brussels to leipzig , since the belgian capital refused to permit additional nighttime flights .
dhl added that besides being able to operate around the clock in leipzig , the central european location was ideal as a hub for emerging markets in eastern europe and asia .
" demand for express services is growing worldwide , " said the new ceo of the post ag parent company , frank appel at the opening ceremony attended by prominent politicians , such as german foreign minister frank-walter steinmeier .
" this is a day to be proud of .
we are looking towards the future , " he said .
georg milbradt , the state premier of saxony , where leipzig is the capital , hailed the move as a " job motor " which will help boost the economy in the eastern states , which have higher unemployment rates than in the west .
at present dhl already operates flights to the middle east and india from leipzig-halle , where it plans to increase its personnel from about 2,000 to 3,500 employees by 2012 .
" with dhl here , the state of saxony will without a doubt become a central logistics point in europe , " said the state 's economics minister thomas jurk .
some 300 million euros -lrb- $ 474 million -rrb- have already been invested in the new hub , which has an air freight turnover of 1,500 tons a day .
about 60 freight aircraft bearing the dhl logo take off and land in leipzig per day .
worldwide , dhl flies to nearly 50 destinations , of which leipzig will become one of three main hubs that include wilmington , ohio in the us and hong kong .
not everyone was happy about the new hub however .
dozens of local residents staged a protest at the inauguration over the potential increase in noise levels at night .
" we will only fly when necessary , " said appel .
a hearing on night time flights will be held in the federal courts in leipzig on july 15 . dw staff -lrb- df -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

reyes ' death has been the biggest blow to the marxist guerrilla movement in latin america since farc , which has more than 17,000 members , was founded in the 1960s .
e-mail communication on reyes ' lap top show that the guerrilla leader had sent his son to germany on a secret mission in january 2005 .
in germany , reyes ' son had met with german communist party members , including wolfgang gehrcke , an extreme leftist politician , who said he would pressure the european parliament in strasbourg to remove the farc from its list of banned terrorist organizations .
the farc , which is believed to hold hundreds of people hostage including the case involving the highly publicized french-colombian politician ingrid betancourt , is also on washington 's watch list of terror groups .
it has also been accused of funding its insurgency through kidnapping for huge ransoms and trafficking cocaine .
the meeting between gehrcke and reyes ' son was described as “ very positive " in an e-mail found on reyes ' laptop .
" we were able to substantiate several points in support of the struggle of the colombian people , " quoted der spiegel in the email .
computer data found after the raid has already heightened tensions in south america , with colombian officials saying that they have substantiated links between the farc , ecuadoran and venezuelan president hugo chavez . dw staff -lrb- df -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

gay activists say the memorial is long overdue . seventy-five years ago nazis launched a series of raids and public book burnings aimed at homosexuals .
it was the start of adolf hitler ’ s crusade against homosexuality which saw an unknown number of gays arrested , tortured and murdered by the nazis .
the subject of nazi persecution of homosexuals has long been swept under the carpet .
yet a new memorial which opens tuesday , may 27 , will bring the past persecution and ongoing struggles of homosexuals to be accepted in society to the heart of the german capital .
showing a forbidden kiss bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the memorial will be officially unveiled this week the homosexual memorial will consist of a grey rectangular block some four meters -lrb- 13 feet -rrb- tall .
one side will have a small opening through which viewers will see a black and white art film scene of two men kissing .
" a simple kiss could land you in trouble , " says the text which accompanies the memorial .
the memorial was designed by the danish-norweigan artistic duo michael elmgreen and ingar dragset .
the memorial has a prominent place in berlin 's tiergarten park , half a block from brandenburg gate .
the monument sits across from the jewish holocaust memorial .
originally it was debated whether homosexuals should be included in the larger memorial before the decision was made to give homosexuals their own monument .
but the design corresponds to the holocaust memorial 's field of steles , a series of concrete blocks of varying sizes .
while the nazi persecution of the jews is well known , for many years there was little public acknowledgement of nazi atrocities towards homosexuals .
estimates put the number of homosexuals arrested by nazis at about 54,000 with 7,000 being killed in concentration camps .
" it is not easy for a gay man to live in this country and this society .
it 's important to remember that this society punished homosexuality for 20 years after national socialism ended , " said günter dworek of the federation of gays and lesbians in germany -lrb- lsvd -rrb- , a driving force behind the project .
gays making strides bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : berlin 's mayor is gay homosexuality remained illegal in germany until 1969 and was only formally decriminalized in 1994 .
it was n't until 2000 that germany 's parliament first passed a resolution acknowledging discrimination had occurred , dworek said .
the decision to fund the memorial , which cost 450,000 euros -lrb- $ 710,000 -rrb- , happened three years later .
the city 's current mayor , social democrat klaus wowereit , announced shortly before taking office seven years ago that he is gay .
wowereit 's legendary outing has given many others courage , dworek said .
" that opened a lot of people 's eyes .
you can not simply assume that politicians who already have a career behind them , like klaus wowereit , are by nature heterosexual , " dworek said .
germany also has a law which allows same-sex couples to register their partnerships .
yet many activists would like to see more , including anti-discrimination laws .
neo-nazi violence is still a very real threat , said albert eckert , head of the gay holocaust memorial committee . " but at last we have a monument to those who suffered and died under the nazis , " eckert said .
a tribute to hirschfeld bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : it is similar in style to the holocaust memorial eckert said he was also happy that the dedication was close to the birthday and death day of magnus hirschfeld , who died in exile in southern france on may 14 , 1935 .
a jewish homosexual , hirschfeld was a medical doctor who dedicated his life to the scientific study of homosexuality and lobbied the german government to repeal laws which outlawed gay sex .
the word " transsexual " was coined by hirschfeld to describe the phenomenon that he argued was a natural extension of human sexuality .
for his work , the nazis targeted hirschfeld as an example of decadent bolshevistic / jewish influence infecting the purity of the german people , luring the aryan race into impure and destructive perversity .
his institute was ransacked and his books were burned in rallies on may 10 , 1933 .
it was n't long before gay men were being rounded up and sent to mental hospitals or concentration camps .
" we have no idea how many thousands died in concentration camps because many were also jewish or were communists .
we know that many were left in prison after the war when post-war courts upheld the nazi jail sentences against them , " eckert says .
" anyone who was gay was automatically a criminal .
this monument is for all of them . "
making an international statement bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : a kiss can be a political statement the parliament decided on december 12 , 2003 to fund the homosexual memorial .
it was a nice birthday present for the green politician and well-known gay activist volker beck who turned 43 that day .
beck felt the memorial was especially important because the laws used to prosecute homosexuals continued long after the nazis had been defeated .
and persecution still exists in many countries today , making the memorial as important as ever , beck said .
he cites 80 countries which criminalize homosexual acts between consenting adults and 12 where the death penalty can be handed down .
beck believes germany 's memorial " sends an important signal that in this country , where in the past -lsb- homosexuals -rsb- were also systematically persecuted , we now have constructed a symbol against this human rights violation . " but homosexuals are still not fully accepted in society , beck said .
he worries about the refusal of some conservative christians and muslims to accept homosexuality .
beck said he does n't have any problem with the memorial 's design , which has come under criticism , particularly from women .
the first scene will portray men kissing , but later it will show women .
dworek said he is " downright happy " with the memorial 's design and likes the idea that the kissing scene will switch every two years .
" this will keep the memorial fresh .
there is always be something new , " dworek said .
" it will be a dynamic memorial . " dw staff -lrb- th -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

making an international statement bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : a kiss can be a political statement the parliament decided on december 12 , 2003 to fund the homosexual memorial .
it was a nice birthday present for the green politician and well-known gay activist volker beck who turned 43 that day .
beck felt the memorial was especially important because the laws used to prosecute homosexuals continued long after the nazis had been defeated .
and persecution still exists in many countries today , making the memorial as important as ever , beck said .
he cites 80 countries which criminalize homosexual acts between consenting adults and 12 where the death penalty can be handed down .
beck believes germany 's memorial " sends an important signal that in this country , where in the past -lsb- homosexuals -rsb- were also systematically persecuted , we now have constructed a symbol against this human rights violation . " but homosexuals are still not fully accepted in society , beck said .
he worries about the refusal of some conservative christians and muslims to accept homosexuality .
beck said he does n't have any problem with the memorial 's design , which has come under criticism , particularly from women .
the first scene will portray men kissing , but later it will show women .
dworek said he is " downright happy " with the memorial 's design and likes the idea that the kissing scene will switch every two years .

gay activists say the memorial is long overdue . seventy-five years ago nazis launched a series of raids and public book burnings aimed at homosexuals .
it was the start of adolf hitler ’ s crusade against homosexuality which saw an unknown number of gays arrested , tortured and murdered by the nazis .
the subject of nazi persecution of homosexuals has long been swept under the carpet .
yet a new memorial which opens tuesday , may 27 , will bring the past persecution and ongoing struggles of homosexuals to be accepted in society to the heart of the german capital .
showing a forbidden kiss bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the memorial will be officially unveiled this week the homosexual memorial will consist of a grey rectangular block some four meters -lrb- 13 feet -rrb- tall .
one side will have a small opening through which viewers will see a black and white art film scene of two men kissing .
" a simple kiss could land you in trouble , " says the text which accompanies the memorial .
the memorial was designed by the danish-norweigan artistic duo michael elmgreen and ingar dragset .
the memorial has a prominent place in berlin 's tiergarten park , half a block from brandenburg gate .
the monument sits across from the jewish holocaust memorial .
originally it was debated whether homosexuals should be included in the larger memorial before the decision was made to give homosexuals their own monument .
but the design corresponds to the holocaust memorial 's field of steles , a series of concrete blocks of varying sizes .
while the nazi persecution of the jews is well known , for many years there was little public acknowledgement of nazi atrocities towards homosexuals .
estimates put the number of homosexuals arrested by nazis at about 54,000 with 7,000 being killed in concentration camps .
" it is not easy for a gay man to live in this country and this society .
it 's important to remember that this society punished homosexuality for 20 years after national socialism ended , " said günter dworek of the federation of gays and lesbians in germany -lrb- lsvd -rrb- , a driving force behind the project .
gays making strides bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : berlin 's mayor is gay homosexuality remained illegal in germany until 1969 and was only formally decriminalized in 1994 .
it was n't until 2000 that germany 's parliament first passed a resolution acknowledging discrimination had occurred , dworek said .
the decision to fund the memorial , which cost 450,000 euros -lrb- $ 710,000 -rrb- , happened three years later .
the city 's current mayor , social democrat klaus wowereit , announced shortly before taking office seven years ago that he is gay .
wowereit 's legendary outing has given many others courage , dworek said .
" that opened a lot of people 's eyes .
you can not simply assume that politicians who already have a career behind them , like klaus wowereit , are by nature heterosexual , " dworek said .
germany also has a law which allows same-sex couples to register their partnerships .
yet many activists would like to see more , including anti-discrimination laws .
neo-nazi violence is still a very real threat , said albert eckert , head of the gay holocaust memorial committee . " but at last we have a monument to those who suffered and died under the nazis , " eckert said .
a tribute to hirschfeld bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : it is similar in style to the holocaust memorial eckert said he was also happy that the dedication was close to the birthday and death day of magnus hirschfeld , who died in exile in southern france on may 14 , 1935 .
a jewish homosexual , hirschfeld was a medical doctor who dedicated his life to the scientific study of homosexuality and lobbied the german government to repeal laws which outlawed gay sex .
the word " transsexual " was coined by hirschfeld to describe the phenomenon that he argued was a natural extension of human sexuality .
for his work , the nazis targeted hirschfeld as an example of decadent bolshevistic / jewish influence infecting the purity of the german people , luring the aryan race into impure and destructive perversity .
his institute was ransacked and his books were burned in rallies on may 10 , 1933 .
it was n't long before gay men were being rounded up and sent to mental hospitals or concentration camps .
" we have no idea how many thousands died in concentration camps because many were also jewish or were communists .
we know that many were left in prison after the war when post-war courts upheld the nazi jail sentences against them , " eckert says .
" anyone who was gay was automatically a criminal .

gay activists say the memorial is long overdue . seventy-five years ago nazis launched a series of raids and public book burnings aimed at homosexuals .
it was the start of adolf hitler ’ s crusade against homosexuality which saw an unknown number of gays arrested , tortured and murdered by the nazis .
the subject of nazi persecution of homosexuals has long been swept under the carpet .
yet a new memorial which opens tuesday , may 27 , will bring the past persecution and ongoing struggles of homosexuals to be accepted in society to the heart of the german capital .
showing a forbidden kiss bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the memorial will be officially unveiled this week the homosexual memorial will consist of a grey rectangular block some four meters -lrb- 13 feet -rrb- tall .
one side will have a small opening through which viewers will see a black and white art film scene of two men kissing .
" a simple kiss could land you in trouble , " says the text which accompanies the memorial .
the memorial was designed by the danish-norweigan artistic duo michael elmgreen and ingar dragset .
the memorial has a prominent place in berlin 's tiergarten park , half a block from brandenburg gate .
the monument sits across from the jewish holocaust memorial .
originally it was debated whether homosexuals should be included in the larger memorial before the decision was made to give homosexuals their own monument .
but the design corresponds to the holocaust memorial 's field of steles , a series of concrete blocks of varying sizes .
while the nazi persecution of the jews is well known , for many years there was little public acknowledgement of nazi atrocities towards homosexuals .
estimates put the number of homosexuals arrested by nazis at about 54,000 with 7,000 being killed in concentration camps .
" it is not easy for a gay man to live in this country and this society .
it 's important to remember that this society punished homosexuality for 20 years after national socialism ended , " said günter dworek of the federation of gays and lesbians in germany -lrb- lsvd -rrb- , a driving force behind the project .
gays making strides bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : berlin 's mayor is gay homosexuality remained illegal in germany until 1969 and was only formally decriminalized in 1994 .
it was n't until 2000 that germany 's parliament first passed a resolution acknowledging discrimination had occurred , dworek said .
the decision to fund the memorial , which cost 450,000 euros -lrb- $ 710,000 -rrb- , happened three years later .
the city 's current mayor , social democrat klaus wowereit , announced shortly before taking office seven years ago that he is gay .
wowereit 's legendary outing has given many others courage , dworek said .
" that opened a lot of people 's eyes .
you can not simply assume that politicians who already have a career behind them , like klaus wowereit , are by nature heterosexual , " dworek said .
germany also has a law which allows same-sex couples to register their partnerships .
yet many activists would like to see more , including anti-discrimination laws .
neo-nazi violence is still a very real threat , said albert eckert , head of the gay holocaust memorial committee . " but at last we have a monument to those who suffered and died under the nazis , " eckert said .
a tribute to hirschfeld bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : it is similar in style to the holocaust memorial eckert said he was also happy that the dedication was close to the birthday and death day of magnus hirschfeld , who died in exile in southern france on may 14 , 1935 .
a jewish homosexual , hirschfeld was a medical doctor who dedicated his life to the scientific study of homosexuality and lobbied the german government to repeal laws which outlawed gay sex .
the word " transsexual " was coined by hirschfeld to describe the phenomenon that he argued was a natural extension of human sexuality .
for his work , the nazis targeted hirschfeld as an example of decadent bolshevistic / jewish influence infecting the purity of the german people , luring the aryan race into impure and destructive perversity .
his institute was ransacked and his books were burned in rallies on may 10 , 1933 .
it was n't long before gay men were being rounded up and sent to mental hospitals or concentration camps .
" we have no idea how many thousands died in concentration camps because many were also jewish or were communists .
we know that many were left in prison after the war when post-war courts upheld the nazi jail sentences against them , " eckert says .
" anyone who was gay was automatically a criminal .
this monument is for all of them . "
making an international statement bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : a kiss can be a political statement the parliament decided on december 12 , 2003 to fund the homosexual memorial .
it was a nice birthday present for the green politician and well-known gay activist volker beck who turned 43 that day .
beck felt the memorial was especially important because the laws used to prosecute homosexuals continued long after the nazis had been defeated .
and persecution still exists in many countries today , making the memorial as important as ever , beck said .
he cites 80 countries which criminalize homosexual acts between consenting adults and 12 where the death penalty can be handed down .
beck believes germany 's memorial " sends an important signal that in this country , where in the past -lsb- homosexuals -rsb- were also systematically persecuted , we now have constructed a symbol against this human rights violation . " but homosexuals are still not fully accepted in society , beck said .
he worries about the refusal of some conservative christians and muslims to accept homosexuality .
beck said he does n't have any problem with the memorial 's design , which has come under criticism , particularly from women .
the first scene will portray men kissing , but later it will show women .
dworek said he is " downright happy " with the memorial 's design and likes the idea that the kissing scene will switch every two years .
" this will keep the memorial fresh .
there is always be something new , " dworek said .
" it will be a dynamic memorial . " dw staff -lrb- th -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

the delegates must find a way to preserve biological diversity on the planet .
despite a minimum of progress , decisive action to halt the global destruction of virgin natural sites like rain forests and to prevent the extinction of flora and fauna has not yet been agreed upon .
the talks have prompted greater public awareness and concern about the exploitation of natural resources for the profit of the few .

it is intended to replace the current partnership and cooperation agreement -lrb- pca -rrb- , which ran out in 2007 , and should include legally-binding measures on such issues as energy , security , trade and education . negotiations are to be formally launched in siberia on june 26-27 , when new president dmitry medvedev will represent russia for the first time .
they were only made possible after lithuania , the last eu member to block the talks , was assured that its concerns about energy supply and moscow 's stance on georgia would be addressed . officials in brussels predict complex negotiations with moscow are likely to last about a year , with a further year required for its ratification by eu member states and russia . eu ministers also listened to polish plans for strengthening ties with ukraine , moldova , georgia , armenia , azerbaijan and , eventually , belarus . supported by sweden and blessed by heavyweights france and germany , the so-called eastern partnership comes on the back of french plans to boost the eu 's ties with its southern neighbors in a union for the mediterranean . visa-free travel in sight according to a text seen by german news agency dpa , the proposed eastern partnership would seek to deepen cooperation and focus on concrete proposals in the area of migration , with an eye to moving towards a visa-free regime . it would also seek to create a free trade area , provide support for reforms designed to bring those countries up to eu standards , and arrange more student exchange programs . the partnership would use existing neighborhood funds and would have an institutional structure that is " as light-weight and goal-oriented as possible . " human rights , a frequent bone of contention under russia 's former president vladimir putin , and energy supply are also likely to become major topics of discussion . benita ferrero-waldner , the commissioner in charge of the eu 's external relations , said the eu executive would only support the plan if it provided " added value " and did not duplicate existing eu policies . " the negotiation will certainly not be easy … i think they will take quite some time , " she said . poland advocates eastern focus polish and swedish diplomats say the partnership will encourage " multilateral cooperation " and " foster regional links . " cooperation with belarus , whose democratic credentials have been thrown into question , would initially take place only on a " technical and expert level .

it is intended to replace the current partnership and cooperation agreement -lrb- pca -rrb- , which ran out in 2007 , and should include legally-binding measures on such issues as energy , security , trade and education . negotiations are to be formally launched in siberia on june 26-27 , when new president dmitry medvedev will represent russia for the first time .
they were only made possible after lithuania , the last eu member to block the talks , was assured that its concerns about energy supply and moscow 's stance on georgia would be addressed . officials in brussels predict complex negotiations with moscow are likely to last about a year , with a further year required for its ratification by eu member states and russia . eu ministers also listened to polish plans for strengthening ties with ukraine , moldova , georgia , armenia , azerbaijan and , eventually , belarus . supported by sweden and blessed by heavyweights france and germany , the so-called eastern partnership comes on the back of french plans to boost the eu 's ties with its southern neighbors in a union for the mediterranean . visa-free travel in sight according to a text seen by german news agency dpa , the proposed eastern partnership would seek to deepen cooperation and focus on concrete proposals in the area of migration , with an eye to moving towards a visa-free regime . it would also seek to create a free trade area , provide support for reforms designed to bring those countries up to eu standards , and arrange more student exchange programs . the partnership would use existing neighborhood funds and would have an institutional structure that is " as light-weight and goal-oriented as possible . " human rights , a frequent bone of contention under russia 's former president vladimir putin , and energy supply are also likely to become major topics of discussion . benita ferrero-waldner , the commissioner in charge of the eu 's external relations , said the eu executive would only support the plan if it provided " added value " and did not duplicate existing eu policies . " the negotiation will certainly not be easy … i think they will take quite some time , " she said . poland advocates eastern focus polish and swedish diplomats say the partnership will encourage " multilateral cooperation " and " foster regional links .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de politics -pipe- 26.05.2008 german presidential contender causes coalition strain großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : schwan is the left 's choice gesine schwan is the social democrats ' choice to fill the ceremonial president 's office .
the decision is sure to cause friction within germany 's coalition government . schwan , a 65-year-old university professor , was announced on monday , may 26 , as the social democratic party 's -lrb- spd -rrb- choice for the high-profile office of german president .
schwan nearly won the post five years ago , but lost out to horst koehler , a former head of the international monetary fund .
koehler has the support of chancellor angela merkel 's christian democratic union -lrb- cdu -rrb- , who wants to see him serve a second five-year term .
members of the cdu and its bavarian sister party , the christian social union -lrb- csu -rrb- , were upset to hear that the spd would put forth its own candidate .
the parties form a left-right coalition together .
chancellor merkel expressed her anger about the decision of her coalition partners to nominate their own candidate . " we have a president who is respected around the world , " merkel said .
" so it is regrettable that the social democrats have put up their own candidate in this step that can only be explained by the internal state of the party . ” schwan 's candidacy runs counter to a longstanding tradition observed by the two main political blocs not to put up a challenger to a president seeking a second term . " i believe that this candidacy will fail and that horst koehler will remain president , as is the wish of the majority of our citizens , " she added .
coalition will stay together bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : they do not always see eye to eye spd head hubertus heil said that he does not worry that the move will rupture the coalition ahead of federal elections , which are scheduled to take place in 2009 .
the csu also faces state elections in bavaria later this year .
" a little competition is n't going to cause any harm to a functioning democracy , " heil said .

" there are going to be harsh consequences " if allegations that deutsche telekom spied on company officials and journalists by monitoring phone traffic between them in order to uncover the source of information leaks are true , said ceo rene obermann in a statement published in the german mass circulation bild zeitung on monday , may 26 .

" the billing records of our millions of fixed-line and mobile customers remain secure , " he said , adding that he has faith in telekom 's 240,000 employees .
the alleged misconduct took place over the course of more than a year in 2005-2006 under obermann 's predecessor kai-uwe ricke , who was ousted at a time of diminishing profits and management disputes .
" earth-shattering " ricke and klaus zumwinkel , who was head of the telecom giant 's supervisory board at the time , both denied commissioning the analysis of the data , which recorded the numbers dialed and the time and the duration of phone calls . obermann was head of the mobile division of deutsche telekom at the time .

after a week , they have isolated key issues splitting the ninth conference of the parties to the convention on biological diversity -lrb- cbd -rrb- that runs until may 30 .
on sunday , may 25 , they were told to forget weekend-break plans and attend extra sessions summoned by the chairman of the mammoth conference , german environment minister sigmar gabriel .
the delegates must find a way to preserve biological diversity on the planet .
despite a minimum of progress , decisive action to halt the global destruction of virgin natural sites like rain forests and to prevent the extinction of flora and fauna has not yet been agreed upon .
the talks have prompted greater public awareness and concern about the exploitation of natural resources for the profit of the few .
gabriel says the sheer survival of billions of people may depend on this meeting 's resolutions , and that most government officials have praised the " constructive " atmosphere in the debates .
that should move the talks forward , said gabriel , whose role as chairman has been important in setting the fast pace .
praise heaped on german hosts bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : gabriel and his colleagues have been praised for their work ahmed djoghlaf , chief of the un convention secretariat , has been unstinting in his praise of the germans and gabriel for their no-nonsense management of the negotiations .
it is a gargantuan task getting so many nations to agree .
like the un climate-change convention , the pact on biodiversity requires " consensus " decision-making by the 191 parties under the aegis of the united nations .
it takes only one nay-sayer to torpedo any agreement , so conflicting national interests must be balanced up .
there have been critics in bonn quietly suggesting that such a decision-making method is impossibly unwieldy , but no one openly proposes the alternative : voting and letting a majority decide .
conference managers shrug and say , " if we started a debate about making decisions by a majority , we 'd never hear the end of it . "
eradication of bio-piracy a key issue one of the key issues at the conference has been how to achieve access to the natural resources mankind needs , and at the same time compensate poor countries , for example for the use of their unique plant species as sources of drugs .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : protests focused on the abuse of natural resources there has been some progress towards drafting a bonn " road map " on future talks about this .
such a road map would lead to a treaty being adopted by the next biodiversity conference in nagoya , japan in 2010 .
gabriel says both developing and industrialized countries will benefit from having clear ground rules about profit-sharing with the poor nations .
nature reserve network plan under fire meanwhile , the idea of creating a world network of nature reserves on land and under the sea has caused antagonism .
sources in the delegations say there is little prospect of any deal .
environmentalist group greenpeace alleges that the industrialized world is not sufficiently willing to foot the bill .
developing nations say they can not afford to create reserves alone .
as a solution , gabriel has proposed a " life web , " in which poorer nations would offer specific tracts for adoption and rich nations would post the money to convert them to reserves .
some cash offers have already been made in bonn .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the price of bio-fuels on the environment is a key issue the environmental harm done by bio-fuel plantations has been a point of controversy , as had been expected .
gabriel describes the bonn meet as the first international conference to debate the emerging problem .
" that in itself is a success and a breakthrough , " he said .
brazil was the loudest of those who questioned whether the conference had any authority to discuss the topic , arguing that it was not within the ambit of a biodiversity convention .
in the end , brazil , which grows ethanol crops , agreed to the debate , but insisted it must not be pilloried as an offender .
delegates agreed that ecological guidelines should be drafted to demonstrate how bio-energy crops can be grown beneficially .
protestors target bio-fuels environmentalists have homed in on the bio-fuel trade as a target , and demanded the crops be banned .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : critics say bio-fuels add to the global food crisis the critics say the plantations wipe out forests , destroy plants which are useful in other ways and deny food output to the hungry .
the tempo of the talks is set to pick up this week with the end in sight and well over 100 environment ministers from the different countries set to arrive and head the delegations in the top-level phase from wednesday until friday .
environmentalists are hoping chancellor angela merkel , a former environment minister herself , will galvanize the talks when she speaks at the bonn meeting , perhaps with a ringing appeal for action or with a surprise pledge of funds . dw staff / dpa -lrb- nda -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

gay activists say the memorial is long overdue . seventy-five years ago nazis launched a series of raids and public book burnings aimed at homosexuals .
it was the start of adolf hitler ’ s crusade against homosexuality which saw an unknown number of gays arrested , tortured and murdered by the nazis .
the subject of nazi persecution of homosexuals has long been swept under the carpet .
yet a new memorial which opens tuesday , may 27 , will bring the past persecution and ongoing struggles of homosexuals to be accepted in society to the heart of the german capital .
showing a forbidden kiss bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the memorial will be officially unveiled this week the homosexual memorial will consist of a grey rectangular block some four meters -lrb- 13 feet -rrb- tall .
one side will have a small opening through which viewers will see a black and white art film scene of two men kissing .
" a simple kiss could land you in trouble , " says the text which accompanies the memorial .
the memorial was designed by the danish-norweigan artistic duo michael elmgreen and ingar dragset .
the memorial has a prominent place in berlin 's tiergarten park , half a block from brandenburg gate .
the monument sits across from the jewish holocaust memorial .
originally it was debated whether homosexuals should be included in the larger memorial before the decision was made to give homosexuals their own monument .
but the design corresponds to the holocaust memorial 's field of steles , a series of concrete blocks of varying sizes .
while the nazi persecution of the jews is well known , for many years there was little public acknowledgement of nazi atrocities towards homosexuals .
estimates put the number of homosexuals arrested by nazis at about 54,000 with 7,000 being killed in concentration camps .
" it is not easy for a gay man to live in this country and this society .
it 's important to remember that this society punished homosexuality for 20 years after national socialism ended , " said günter dworek of the federation of gays and lesbians in germany -lrb- lsvd -rrb- , a driving force behind the project .
gays making strides bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : berlin 's mayor is gay homosexuality remained illegal in germany until 1969 and was only formally decriminalized in 1994 .
it was n't until 2000 that germany 's parliament first passed a resolution acknowledging discrimination had occurred , dworek said .
the decision to fund the memorial , which cost 450,000 euros -lrb- $ 710,000 -rrb- , happened three years later .
the city 's current mayor , social democrat klaus wowereit , announced shortly before taking office seven years ago that he is gay .
wowereit 's legendary outing has given many others courage , dworek said .
" that opened a lot of people 's eyes .
you can not simply assume that politicians who already have a career behind them , like klaus wowereit , are by nature heterosexual , " dworek said .
germany also has a law which allows same-sex couples to register their partnerships .
yet many activists would like to see more , including anti-discrimination laws .
neo-nazi violence is still a very real threat , said albert eckert , head of the gay holocaust memorial committee . " but at last we have a monument to those who suffered and died under the nazis , " eckert said .
a tribute to hirschfeld bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : it is similar in style to the holocaust memorial eckert said he was also happy that the dedication was close to the birthday and death day of magnus hirschfeld , who died in exile in southern france on may 14 , 1935 .
a jewish homosexual , hirschfeld was a medical doctor who dedicated his life to the scientific study of homosexuality and lobbied the german government to repeal laws which outlawed gay sex .
the word " transsexual " was coined by hirschfeld to describe the phenomenon that he argued was a natural extension of human sexuality .
for his work , the nazis targeted hirschfeld as an example of decadent bolshevistic / jewish influence infecting the purity of the german people , luring the aryan race into impure and destructive perversity .
his institute was ransacked and his books were burned in rallies on may 10 , 1933 .
it was n't long before gay men were being rounded up and sent to mental hospitals or concentration camps .
" we have no idea how many thousands died in concentration camps because many were also jewish or were communists .
we know that many were left in prison after the war when post-war courts upheld the nazi jail sentences against them , " eckert says .
" anyone who was gay was automatically a criminal .
this monument is for all of them . "
making an international statement bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : a kiss can be a political statement the parliament decided on december 12 , 2003 to fund the homosexual memorial .
it was a nice birthday present for the green politician and well-known gay activist volker beck who turned 43 that day .
beck felt the memorial was especially important because the laws used to prosecute homosexuals continued long after the nazis had been defeated .
and persecution still exists in many countries today , making the memorial as important as ever , beck said .
he cites 80 countries which criminalize homosexual acts between consenting adults and 12 where the death penalty can be handed down .
beck believes germany 's memorial " sends an important signal that in this country , where in the past -lsb- homosexuals -rsb- were also systematically persecuted , we now have constructed a symbol against this human rights violation . " but homosexuals are still not fully accepted in society , beck said .
he worries about the refusal of some conservative christians and muslims to accept homosexuality .
beck said he does n't have any problem with the memorial 's design , which has come under criticism , particularly from women .
the first scene will portray men kissing , but later it will show women .
dworek said he is " downright happy " with the memorial 's design and likes the idea that the kissing scene will switch every two years .
" this will keep the memorial fresh .
there is always be something new , " dworek said .
" it will be a dynamic memorial . " dw staff -lrb- th -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

bbc news -pipe- business -pipe- q & a : basic state pension bbc news / business graphics version bbc sport home news front page -pipe- africa -pipe- americas -pipe- asia-pacific -pipe- europe -pipe- middle east -pipe- south asia -pipe- uk -pipe- business -pipe- health -pipe- science & environment -pipe- technology -pipe- entertainment -pipe- also in the news -pipe- have your say -pipe- business contents : your money -pipe- economy companies 07:08 gmt , monday , 26 may 2008 08:08 uk q & a : basic state pension as part of its understanding pensions series , the bbc news website provides an introduction to the basic state pension .
what is the basic state pension ?
the basic state pension is paid to women at 60 and men at 65 , who fulfil national insurance -lrb- ni -rrb- contribution requirements .
from 6 april 2020 , the state pension age for both men and women will be 65 .
the government will introduce the change gradually from age 60 to 65 for women over a 10-year period from 2010 to 2020 how much is it worth ?
the full weekly rates are -lrb- year to april 2009 -rrb- : single person : £ 90.70 couple : £ 145.05 will i get the full basic state pension ?
not necessarily .
what you get will depend on your national insurance -lrb- ni -rrb- contributions - and the rules are stringent .
your pension depends on how long you have worked for and the number of " qualifying years " you have .
a woman with a working life of 44 years will need 39 qualifying years for a full pension and a man with a working life of 49 years will need 44 qualifying years .
the government plans to reduce the number of qualifying years it takes to earn a full basic state pension to 30 as part of its overhaul of the uk pensions system .
however , the contribution record of people who have been unable to work due to unemployment , sickness or caring responsibilities , may be protected by credits or " home responsibilities protection " .
what happens if i have not made enough contributions ?
if you have not paid sufficient contributions you may get a partial pension or you may not receive a pension at all .
if you are not entitled to a full basic pension you may receive a reduced amount .
but if you retire with less than 25 % of the qualifying years for a full pension , you wo n't get anything at all .
people aged 80 and over receive a non-contributory pension , at 60 % of the basic state pension as long as they fulfil other requirements , such as residency rules .
age concern 's fact sheet on the state pension has a useful table , which can help you work out entitlement -lrb- see contact list link below -rrb- .
what about the earnings link ?
a link between state pensions and earnings was introduced by barbara castle in 1974 .
this ensured that state pensions kept up with the rate at which salaries were rising .
however , it was scrapped six years later by margaret thatcher , and more pensioners must now rely on private savings to make up the difference .
restoring the link with earnings would cost an estimated £ 0.5bn in the first year , rising to £ 10bn by 2010 , according to government figures .
is n't the state pension age changing for women ?
legislation to equalise the pension age at 65 for both men and women has been passed .
the change will be phased in between 2010 and 2020 and will not affect anyone born before 6 april 1950 .
if you are a woman and born between 6 april 1950 and 5 april 1955 , your state pension age will fall somewhere between 60 and 65 .
the government 's pensionguide.gov.uk -lrb- see link below -rrb- has details on the age and date when you will be able to receive the state pension .
longer term further rises are planned for both men and women , eventually taking the pension age to 68 by 2044 .

for the first time in uk law there will be a duty on all businesses not to trade unfairly .
the law aims to tackle everything from aggressive sales tactics by rogue builders to bogus closing-down sales .
fortune-tellers , astrologers and mediums are among those affected by the rules , which require them to say their services are for " entertainment only " .
some 31 specific practices will now be banned , and the law 's wider duty not to trade unfairly is intended to avoid the need for a new law to cover every new scam .
however , unlike in ireland , the rules do not extend so far as allowing disgruntled customers to claim compensation when businesses treat them unfairly .
and concerns have been raised that there are not enough trading standards officers to police the new scheme effectively .
carl belgrove , of the national consumer council , said the new rules were a welcome change in the law after 20 years of campaigning by support groups .
" these new laws represent a big boost to consumer protection , particularly for vulnerable people who are targeted by rogue traders , " he said .
harry hodder , a retired factory worker from nottingham , is one such person .
he spent £ 250 replying to bogus prize draw letters promising him millions .
" one promised £ 75,000 was owed to me and i thought i could get my own bungalow , but now i know where this junk mail goes ... in the shredder , " he said .
" what a way to blackmail people into parting with their hard-earned money . "
the new legislation outlaws information which , even if it is factually correct , deceives the average consumer into making a transaction he or she would not have taken otherwise .
wide-ranging law the consumer protection regulations , which implement the eu directive on unfair commercial practices , mark the biggest shake-up in consumer law for 40 years . "
this brings in a new concept of fairness , a brave new world for businesses dealing with consumers and advertising " lawyer philip carnell will fake business blogs crash and burn ?
as well as a duty for companies not to trade unfairly and to avoid misleading statements or omissions , there is also a duty on businesses not to conduct aggressive sales practices , such as harassment , coercion and undue influence .
this would tackle cases such as the pushy sales tactics vivien herbert said she had to endure .
ms herbert said a solar panel salesman got very annoyed and called her a timewaster when she pointed out that she was not going to sign up for a system costing thousands of pounds during his first visit .
but the wide-ranging nature of the regulations mean that they will also cover issues such as fake testimonials by " customers " giving favourable reviews of products , holidays or shows .
" this brings in a new concept of fairness , a brave new world for businesses dealing with consumers and advertising , " said lawyer philip carnell of cms cameron mckenna .
" if marketing companies are going to try and be sneaky , that will now be a strictly liable criminal offence . "
brought to justice some of the 31 specific unfair sales tactics used by companies that are covered in the legislation overlap existing rules .
they also include advertising products knowing there is insufficient stock to meet demand , falsely claiming that customers would get a better deal if they signed up immediately , and directly targeting children to say they would be disadvantaged without a certain product .
trading standards officers will be policing the new regulations .
they could concentrate on the most prevalent complaints such as second-hand car sales and property repairs .
david sanders , lead officer for civil law at the trading standards institute , said that the more serious cases were likely to be dealt with under criminal law .
this would mean maximum penalties of up to £ 5,000 for anyone found guilty in a magistrates ' court , or a fine of up to £ 5,000 and / or two years in prison in cases heard in a crown court .
but mr sanders had a word of caution for consumers expecting all con-artists to face justice .
" we are a limited band of people and we are only going to investigate the most serious cases , " he said .
and mr sanders added that , especially in the smallest local authorities , there were not enough trading standards officers and they were not well enough resourced to conduct in-depth investigations into every potential breach of the rules .

for the first time in uk law there will be a duty on all businesses not to trade unfairly .
the law aims to tackle everything from aggressive sales tactics by rogue builders to bogus closing-down sales .
fortune-tellers , astrologers and mediums are among those affected by the rules , which require them to say their services are for " entertainment only " .
some 31 specific practices will now be banned , and the law 's wider duty not to trade unfairly is intended to avoid the need for a new law to cover every new scam .
however , unlike in ireland , the rules do not extend so far as allowing disgruntled customers to claim compensation when businesses treat them unfairly .

carl belgrove from the national consumer council welcomes the changes and concerns have been raised that there are not enough trading standards officers to police the new scheme effectively .
carl belgrove , of the national consumer council , said the new rules were a welcome change in the law after 20 years of campaigning by support groups .
" these new laws represent a big boost to consumer protection , particularly for vulnerable people who are targeted by rogue traders , " he said .
harry hodder , a retired factory worker from nottingham , is one such person .
he spent £ 250 replying to bogus prize draw letters promising him millions .
" one promised £ 75,000 was owed to me and i thought i could get my own bungalow , but now i know where this junk mail goes ... in the shredder , " he said .
" what a way to blackmail people into parting with their hard-earned money . "
the new legislation outlaws information which , even if it is factually correct , deceives the average consumer into making a transaction he or she would not have taken otherwise .
wide-ranging law the consumer protection regulations , which implement the eu directive on unfair commercial practices , mark the biggest shake-up in consumer law for 40 years .
this brings in a new concept of fairness , a brave new world for businesses dealing with consumers and advertising lawyer philip carnell will fake business blogs crash and burn ?
as well as a duty for companies not to trade unfairly and to avoid misleading statements or omissions , there is also a duty on businesses not to conduct aggressive sales practices , such as harassment , coercion and undue influence .
this would tackle cases such as the pushy sales tactics vivien herbert said she had to endure .
ms herbert said a solar panel salesman got very annoyed and called her a timewaster when she pointed out that she was not going to sign up for a system costing thousands of pounds during his first visit .

the limited number of icons include castles , the wales millennium centre and millennium stadium in cardiff , the national parks and a few famous personalities ranging from dylan thomas to tom jones .
" there is a need to harness the power of the sum of the parts rather than to rely on ' headline acts ' , " said the review .
it also found that tourists can be bombarded with leaflets and information , " which dilutes the impact and undermines wales ' attractiveness as a cultural destination . "
the review cites cities like rome , barcelona , bilbao , nashville and stockholm - where partnerships have been effective in selling cultural tourism .
there is praise though for " innovative " tourism examples in wales already , ranging from the traditional cottage holiday company under the thatch and the melin tregwynt wool mill in west wales to the faenol festival in gwynedd and the marketing of the wye and dyfi valleys .
the review , which sets out recommendations until 2015 , states : " a failure to heed these lessons and to learn from best practice will give wales a lagging tourism economy and , increasingly , an unattractive visitor destination . "
responding to the report , mr thomas , said : " for tourism in wales to prosper the country 's unique national , regional and local culture has to be fully embedded in all aspects of the tourism economy . "
he described how wales had to " aspire to equal the best cultural tourism experiences in the world . "
he also said that tourism had to capitalise on its assets , including its heritage properties , museums , galleries , landscape , events and festivals , and promote food and drink and the welsh language .
he added that local community festivals and events in wales make a significant contribution to local economies and " give visitors a sense of place " .

the limited number of icons include castles , the wales millennium centre and millennium stadium in cardiff , the national parks and a few famous personalities ranging from dylan thomas to tom jones .
" there is a need to harness the power of the sum of the parts rather than to rely on ' headline acts ' , " said the review .

the review cites cities like rome , barcelona , bilbao , nashville and stockholm - where partnerships have been effective in selling cultural tourism .
there is praise though for " innovative " tourism examples in wales already , ranging from the traditional cottage holiday company under the thatch and the melin tregwynt wool mill in west wales to the faenol festival in gwynedd and the marketing of the wye and dyfi valleys .
the review , which sets out recommendations until 2015 , states : " a failure to heed these lessons and to learn from best practice will give wales a lagging tourism economy and , increasingly , an unattractive visitor destination . "
responding to the report , mr thomas , said : " for tourism in wales to prosper the country 's unique national , regional and local culture has to be fully embedded in all aspects of the tourism economy . "
he described how wales had to " aspire to equal the best cultural tourism experiences in the world . "
he also said that tourism had to capitalise on its assets , including its heritage properties , museums , galleries , landscape , events and festivals , and promote food and drink and the welsh language .
he added that local community festivals and events in wales make a significant contribution to local economies and " give visitors a sense of place " .

the award , given out each year to first-time film-makers , was given to mcqueen by us actor dennis hopper .
" the film is about people in a situation of extreme pressure and what people do and what we do , " mcqueen told the festival 's closing ceremony .
hunger stars michael fassbender as sands , who died aged 27 in 1981 . "
there was this man called bobby sands whose image appeared on tv with a number underneath it " steve mcqueen hunger 's forceful look at ireland the actor had to go on a medically-supervised diet to portray sands , who refused food for 66 days in the maze prison in a bid to be recognised as a political prisoner .
the film does not yet have a uk release date .
an earlier film on sands ' life , some mother 's son , caused controversy when it screened in cannes in 1996 .

one scene features a conversation between sands and a catholic priest about the decision to go on hunger strike .
filmed in one continuous 10-minute take , it was shot on the first day of filming in northern ireland and took fassbender and co-star liam cunningham four attempts to complete .
hunger was co-written by irish playwright enda walsh and co-funded by northern ireland screen and the broadcasting commission of ireland .
the irish government 's arts minister martin cullen said it was the third year in a row that an irish-backed film had been successful at cannes .
he added : " following the success of the wind that shakes the barley and garage , this camera d 'or will keep irish film practitioners in the world 's eye for the foreseeable future .

advertisement director steve mcqueen in action on the set of hunger artist steve mcqueen 's debut film hunger - about ira hunger striker bobby sands ' final days - has won the camera d 'or prize at the cannes film festival .
the award , given out each year to first-time film-makers , was given to mcqueen by us actor dennis hopper .
" the film is about people in a situation of extreme pressure and what people do and what we do , " mcqueen told the festival 's closing ceremony .
hunger stars michael fassbender as sands , who died aged 27 in 1981 .
there was this man called bobby sands whose image appeared on tv with a number underneath it steve mcqueen hunger 's forceful look at ireland the actor had to go on a medically-supervised diet to portray sands , who refused food for 66 days in the maze prison in a bid to be recognised as a political prisoner .
the film does not yet have a uk release date .
an earlier film on sands ' life , some mother 's son , caused controversy when it screened in cannes in 1996 .
director mcqueen , who won the turner prize in 1999 for a collection of films which included a buster keaton-style silent movie stunt , told the bbc earlier this month he was inspired by the memory of seeing sands on tv news bulletins when he was 11 .
" there was this man called bobby sands whose image appeared on tv with a number underneath it , " he recalled .
one scene features a conversation between sands and a catholic priest about the decision to go on hunger strike .
filmed in one continuous 10-minute take , it was shot on the first day of filming in northern ireland and took fassbender and co-star liam cunningham four attempts to complete .
hunger was co-written by irish playwright enda walsh and co-funded by northern ireland screen and the broadcasting commission of ireland .
the irish government 's arts minister martin cullen said it was the third year in a row that an irish-backed film had been successful at cannes .
he added : " following the success of the wind that shakes the barley and garage , this camera d 'or will keep irish film practitioners in the world 's eye for the foreseeable future .
" this film covers a very turbulent part of our history with an unadorned reality and reminds us of how far we have come as an island in the last quarter century . "

on sunday , vice minister of water resources e jingping said that the lakes were " under control " but described the situation as grim .

of particular concern is the tangjiashan lake , 2 miles -lrb- 3km -rrb- from beichuan town , which has been rising fast .
water levels now stand only 29 metres below the level of the barrier , xinhua said .
" the lake is now holding more than 128 million cubic metres of water and may cause a devastating flood if the barrier bursts , " it said .

ex-rebel pierre nkurunziza was elected president in 2005 under a deal to end years of conflict between the tutsi army and hutu rebels .

what do you know about charles lindbergh ?
you probably know he was an american aviator .
he achieved overnight world stardom when he became the first person to fly non-stop across the atlantic , solo , in 1927 .
you might also know that lindbergh was strongly opposed to american involvement in world war ii - until pearl harbor , after which he volunteered to fly combat missions in the pacific .
and you might know that in later life he became a prolific author , an explorer and an environmentalist .
but did you know that he was also a machine-obsessed inventor , who entered into a macabre alliance with a french-born surgeon to try to achieve immortality ?
forget aviation hero .
on the side , lindbergh was a dr frankenstein figure , who used his mechanical genius to explore the possibility of conquering death - but only for the select few who were considered " worthy " of living forever .
" beating death was something he thought about his entire life " , says david m friedman , american author of the new book the immortalists .
" even as a small child , he could n't accept that people had to die .
he would ask : ' why do you have to die to get to heaven ? " '
machine-enabled people friedman 's the immortalists relates the untold story of lindbergh 's frequently bizarre efforts to cheat death by creating machines that might sustain human life .
lindberg and his monoplane which flew from new york to paris in the 1930s , after his historic flight over the atlantic , lindbergh hooked up with alexis carrel , a brilliant surgeon born in france but who worked in a laboratory at the rockefeller institute in manhattan .
carrel - who was a mystic as well as a scientist - had already won a nobel prize for his pioneering work on the transplantation of blood vessels .
but his real dream was a future in which the human body would become , in friedman 's words , " a machine with constantly reparable or replaceable parts " .
this is where lindbergh entered the frame .
carrel hoped that his own scientific nous combined with lindbergh 's machine-making proficiency -lrb- lindbergh had , after all , already helped design a plane that flew non-stop to paris -rrb- would make his fantasy about immortal machine-enabled human beings a reality .
" both of their needs were met in this rather strange relationship " , says friedman .
" carrel benefited from lindbergh 's mechanical genius and inventiveness , and for lindbergh - well , carrel became the most important person in his life , effectively steering the way he viewed the world and the people who lived in it . "
at the rockefeller lab , lindbergh and carrel - almost like a real-life jekyll and hyde double act - made some extraordinary breakthroughs .
lindbergh created something that carrel 's team had singularly failed to : a perfusion pump that could keep a human organ alive outside of the body .
it was called the " model t " pump .
in later years , lindbergh 's pump was further developed by others , eventually leading to the construction of the first heart-lung machine .
eugenics " some people , even academics and science students , are still shocked when they hear about the contribution that the aviator lindbergh made to developing life-saving cardiac machinery , " says friedman .
as a pilot , he felt he had escaped the chains of mortality - he had had a god-like experience david m friedman but there was a serious downside to what friedman refers to as lindbergh and carrel 's " daring quest " to live forever .
carrel was a eugenicist with fascistic leanings .
he believed the world was split into superior and inferior beings , and hoped that science would allow the superior - which included himself and lindbergh , of course - to dominate and eventually weed out the inferiors .
he thought the planet was " encumbered " with people who " should be dead " , including " the weak , the diseased , and the fools " .
something like lindbergh 's pump was not intended to help the many , but the few .
lindbergh himself sympathised with the nazis .
" i would n't say lindbergh was the philosophical partner of himmler or hitler , " says friedman .
" but yes , he certainly admired the order , science and technology of nazi germany - and the idea of creating an ethnically pure race . "
friedman says lindbergh considered himself a " superior being " .
" let 's not forget that , as a pilot , he felt he had escaped the chains of mortality .
he had had a god-like experience .
he flew amongst the clouds , often in a cockpit that was open to the elements .
flying was such a rare experience back then .
in taking to the skies , he did something humans have dreamt of for centuries .
so it is perhaps not surprising that he ended up trying to play god in a laboratory . "
ethical ever-lasting life even contemporary transhumanists - the name given to those who want to extend human longevity and possibly conquer death - are surprised to hear about lindbergh 's contribution to machine-assisted life .
alexis carrel 's quest for ever-lasting life goes on , but is now more ' ethical ' " i never knew that " , says nick bostrom , director of the future of humanity institute at oxford university and president of the world transhumanism association .
for bostrom and his colleagues , aware that some people think transhumanism is the same thing as eugenics , the key today is the " ethical use of technology to extend human capabilities " .
" there are many ways we have used science and technology effectively to ' cheat death " ' , says bostrom , " whether it 's through antibiotics , organ transplantation , or even lightning rods to deflect electrical currents from the sky .
you know , when they were first invented some people said it was ' playing god ' to try to deal with lightning in this way . "
bostrom believes that reversing the ageing process , or at least using stem cell therapy to slow down the negative effects of ageing , should be " the next frontier " in medical science .
" but it should be for the benefit of everyone and it should be done ethically - somewhat different to what lindbergh got up to " , he argues .
stuart derbyshire , a leading expert in pain based at the university of birmingham , says it is certainly " desirable to live a long and healthy life " - but from lindbergh 's experiments to today 's ethical question for longevity , he says there is also a " troubling " side to the " quest to live forever " .
" any life , long or short , is only worthwhile if it is lived towards some purpose .
the zealous pursuit of health and longevity can too easily become a substitute for real purpose .
" health itself becomes a quasi-religious crusade against the old sins of the flesh - gluttony , sloth , lust - with all the attendant odious associations of physical impairment or disease with moral turpitude or a bad life . "
his implication is clear - while lindbergh and carrel 's quest had all the hallmarks of nazi-promoted eugenics , it 's perhaps impossible to separate the pursuit of ever-lasting life with notions of supremacy .
the immortalists by david m friedman is published in the uk by jr books on 16 june .

there is a trend towards human immortality that is almost inevitable .
the research being done in cybernetics , stem cell regeneration , genetics etc ... all lend themselves to fulfilling the quest for longer lives .

what do you know about charles lindbergh ?
you probably know he was an american aviator .
he achieved overnight world stardom when he became the first person to fly non-stop across the atlantic , solo , in 1927 .
you might also know that lindbergh was strongly opposed to american involvement in world war ii - until pearl harbor , after which he volunteered to fly combat missions in the pacific .
and you might know that in later life he became a prolific author , an explorer and an environmentalist .
but did you know that he was also a machine-obsessed inventor , who entered into a macabre alliance with a french-born surgeon to try to achieve immortality ?
forget aviation hero .
on the side , lindbergh was a dr frankenstein figure , who used his mechanical genius to explore the possibility of conquering death - but only for the select few who were considered " worthy " of living forever .
" beating death was something he thought about his entire life " , says david m friedman , american author of the new book the immortalists .
" even as a small child , he could n't accept that people had to die .
he would ask : ' why do you have to die to get to heaven ? " '
machine-enabled people friedman 's the immortalists relates the untold story of lindbergh 's frequently bizarre efforts to cheat death by creating machines that might sustain human life .
lindberg and his monoplane which flew from new york to paris in the 1930s , after his historic flight over the atlantic , lindbergh hooked up with alexis carrel , a brilliant surgeon born in france but who worked in a laboratory at the rockefeller institute in manhattan .
carrel - who was a mystic as well as a scientist - had already won a nobel prize for his pioneering work on the transplantation of blood vessels .
but his real dream was a future in which the human body would become , in friedman 's words , " a machine with constantly reparable or replaceable parts " .
this is where lindbergh entered the frame .
carrel hoped that his own scientific nous combined with lindbergh 's machine-making proficiency -lrb- lindbergh had , after all , already helped design a plane that flew non-stop to paris -rrb- would make his fantasy about immortal machine-enabled human beings a reality .
" both of their needs were met in this rather strange relationship " , says friedman .
" carrel benefited from lindbergh 's mechanical genius and inventiveness , and for lindbergh - well , carrel became the most important person in his life , effectively steering the way he viewed the world and the people who lived in it . "
at the rockefeller lab , lindbergh and carrel - almost like a real-life jekyll and hyde double act - made some extraordinary breakthroughs .
lindbergh created something that carrel 's team had singularly failed to : a perfusion pump that could keep a human organ alive outside of the body .
it was called the " model t " pump .
in later years , lindbergh 's pump was further developed by others , eventually leading to the construction of the first heart-lung machine .
eugenics " some people , even academics and science students , are still shocked when they hear about the contribution that the aviator lindbergh made to developing life-saving cardiac machinery , " says friedman .
as a pilot , he felt he had escaped the chains of mortality - he had had a god-like experience david m friedman but there was a serious downside to what friedman refers to as lindbergh and carrel 's " daring quest " to live forever .
carrel was a eugenicist with fascistic leanings .
he believed the world was split into superior and inferior beings , and hoped that science would allow the superior - which included himself and lindbergh , of course - to dominate and eventually weed out the inferiors .
he thought the planet was " encumbered " with people who " should be dead " , including " the weak , the diseased , and the fools " .
something like lindbergh 's pump was not intended to help the many , but the few .

what do you know about charles lindbergh ?
you probably know he was an american aviator .
he achieved overnight world stardom when he became the first person to fly non-stop across the atlantic , solo , in 1927 .
you might also know that lindbergh was strongly opposed to american involvement in world war ii - until pearl harbor , after which he volunteered to fly combat missions in the pacific .
and you might know that in later life he became a prolific author , an explorer and an environmentalist .
but did you know that he was also a machine-obsessed inventor , who entered into a macabre alliance with a french-born surgeon to try to achieve immortality ?
forget aviation hero .
on the side , lindbergh was a dr frankenstein figure , who used his mechanical genius to explore the possibility of conquering death - but only for the select few who were considered " worthy " of living forever .
" beating death was something he thought about his entire life " , says david m friedman , american author of the new book the immortalists .
" even as a small child , he could n't accept that people had to die .
he would ask : ' why do you have to die to get to heaven ? " '
machine-enabled people friedman 's the immortalists relates the untold story of lindbergh 's frequently bizarre efforts to cheat death by creating machines that might sustain human life .
lindberg and his monoplane which flew from new york to paris in the 1930s , after his historic flight over the atlantic , lindbergh hooked up with alexis carrel , a brilliant surgeon born in france but who worked in a laboratory at the rockefeller institute in manhattan .
carrel - who was a mystic as well as a scientist - had already won a nobel prize for his pioneering work on the transplantation of blood vessels .
but his real dream was a future in which the human body would become , in friedman 's words , " a machine with constantly reparable or replaceable parts " .
this is where lindbergh entered the frame .
carrel hoped that his own scientific nous combined with lindbergh 's machine-making proficiency -lrb- lindbergh had , after all , already helped design a plane that flew non-stop to paris -rrb- would make his fantasy about immortal machine-enabled human beings a reality .
" both of their needs were met in this rather strange relationship " , says friedman .
" carrel benefited from lindbergh 's mechanical genius and inventiveness , and for lindbergh - well , carrel became the most important person in his life , effectively steering the way he viewed the world and the people who lived in it . "
at the rockefeller lab , lindbergh and carrel - almost like a real-life jekyll and hyde double act - made some extraordinary breakthroughs .
lindbergh created something that carrel 's team had singularly failed to : a perfusion pump that could keep a human organ alive outside of the body .
it was called the " model t " pump .
in later years , lindbergh 's pump was further developed by others , eventually leading to the construction of the first heart-lung machine .
eugenics " some people , even academics and science students , are still shocked when they hear about the contribution that the aviator lindbergh made to developing life-saving cardiac machinery , " says friedman .
as a pilot , he felt he had escaped the chains of mortality - he had had a god-like experience david m friedman but there was a serious downside to what friedman refers to as lindbergh and carrel 's " daring quest " to live forever .
carrel was a eugenicist with fascistic leanings .
he believed the world was split into superior and inferior beings , and hoped that science would allow the superior - which included himself and lindbergh , of course - to dominate and eventually weed out the inferiors .
he thought the planet was " encumbered " with people who " should be dead " , including " the weak , the diseased , and the fools " .
something like lindbergh 's pump was not intended to help the many , but the few .
lindbergh himself sympathised with the nazis .
" i would n't say lindbergh was the philosophical partner of himmler or hitler , " says friedman .
" but yes , he certainly admired the order , science and technology of nazi germany - and the idea of creating an ethnically pure race . "
friedman says lindbergh considered himself a " superior being " .
" let 's not forget that , as a pilot , he felt he had escaped the chains of mortality .
he had had a god-like experience .
he flew amongst the clouds , often in a cockpit that was open to the elements .
flying was such a rare experience back then .
in taking to the skies , he did something humans have dreamt of for centuries .
so it is perhaps not surprising that he ended up trying to play god in a laboratory . "
ethical ever-lasting life even contemporary transhumanists - the name given to those who want to extend human longevity and possibly conquer death - are surprised to hear about lindbergh 's contribution to machine-assisted life .
alexis carrel 's quest for ever-lasting life goes on , but is now more ' ethical ' " i never knew that " , says nick bostrom , director of the future of humanity institute at oxford university and president of the world transhumanism association .
for bostrom and his colleagues , aware that some people think transhumanism is the same thing as eugenics , the key today is the " ethical use of technology to extend human capabilities " .
" there are many ways we have used science and technology effectively to ' cheat death " ' , says bostrom , " whether it 's through antibiotics , organ transplantation , or even lightning rods to deflect electrical currents from the sky .
you know , when they were first invented some people said it was ' playing god ' to try to deal with lightning in this way . "
bostrom believes that reversing the ageing process , or at least using stem cell therapy to slow down the negative effects of ageing , should be " the next frontier " in medical science .
" but it should be for the benefit of everyone and it should be done ethically - somewhat different to what lindbergh got up to " , he argues .
stuart derbyshire , a leading expert in pain based at the university of birmingham , says it is certainly " desirable to live a long and healthy life " - but from lindbergh 's experiments to today 's ethical question for longevity , he says there is also a " troubling " side to the " quest to live forever " .
" any life , long or short , is only worthwhile if it is lived towards some purpose .
the zealous pursuit of health and longevity can too easily become a substitute for real purpose .
" health itself becomes a quasi-religious crusade against the old sins of the flesh - gluttony , sloth , lust - with all the attendant odious associations of physical impairment or disease with moral turpitude or a bad life . "
his implication is clear - while lindbergh and carrel 's quest had all the hallmarks of nazi-promoted eugenics , it 's perhaps impossible to separate the pursuit of ever-lasting life with notions of supremacy .

ian macnab , based at the rothera research station was one of 20 challengers taking on 71-year-old boris spassky simultaneously .
the scientist played " aggressively " during the two-hour game .
other opponents included comedian dom joly , liberal democrat am peter black and a number of local chess prodigies .
mr macnab , 52 , from manchester , had said prior to the match that he was not " very optimistic " and spassky did not have " much to be afraid of " .
spassky , the former world number one , famously lost the world championship to american bobby fischer at the height of the cold war in 1972 .
he played against all 20 opponents simultaneously on sunday , but mr macnab was the only one who was not in the mid wales festival in person . "
i would describe myself as an amateur , but i was quite good as a teenager " ian macnab mr macnab is a field assistant with the british antarctic survey on adelaide island , antarctica .

ahead of the match he said : " i would describe myself as an amateur , but i was quite good as a teenager . "
mr macnab opted for a " sicilian defence " and gained a spatial advantage over the russian , who offered him a draw which the scientist accepted .
onlookers from a local chess club speculated that at times , mr macnab had the edge .
" in grandmaster play , it would have probably boiled down to a draw , but in my opinion , ian had a slight edge , " said jim friar , whose son also played spassky at the event .
after the game , spassky said of mr macnab : " the man from the antarctic is a serious player . "
mr macnab said in an email : " this has inspired me to take up chess again . "
the british antarctic survey has previously held darts matches by radio with rival local bases , but this is claimed to be the first time a chess match has been played against the outside world from the region .
an eight-year-old player was also be among the players taking on spassky , who was born in leningrad but now lives in paris , and is still active in the chess world .
university team the former champion , who learned to play chess at the age of five and became grand master at 18 , moved around all of the players ' chess boards , making one move at a time .
mr black , the liberal democrat am for south west wales , who used to be in his university chess team , was raising money for the charity childline during his match .
the matches took place at 1800 bst on sunday at richard booth 's bookshop in hay-on-wye .
