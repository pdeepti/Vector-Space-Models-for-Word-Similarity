another spaniard acquitted at the original trial was convicted at the latest hearing and jailed for four years .
the court also confirmed the acquittal of rabei osman el-sayed ahmed , known as mohammed the egyptian , who was suspected of masterminding the march 11 , 2004 , attacks on four commuter trains .
the 36-year-old was acquitted of belonging to a terrorist organization because he had already been sentenced for the same crime in italy .
many victims were shocked by the sentences , which in many cases were much lower than the state attorney had requested , and angry at the acquittals .
at the original trial , 17 arabs and four spaniards were found guilty and sentenced to prison terms ranging from three years to 40,000 years .

but the changes do n't go far enough , says deutsche welle 's sabine kinkartz . imagine that you 're highly qualified .
you 've completed your studies and gotten the best grades , you 've been working for a couple of years as an engineer , a process technician or an it specialist , you 've done additional training , fine-tuned your skills and are earning good money . maybe you ’ ve started a family and found friends .
in short - you 're feeling good and have found your place in life , wherever it may be .
what could bring you to give up all this , immigrate to germany and work here ?
ca n't think of anything ?
i can understand . but germany 's federal government does n't .
it still hopes that it can lure highly skilled people with a university degree to germany in large numbers .
it 's an old hope that 's been disappointed so far : in 2006 , only 456 highly qualified people received permanent residence status - 10 fewer than last year . minimum salary the minimum salary requirement is the biggest hurdle .
anyone who wants to come here without fulfilling any other requirements has to be able to prove that he or she is earning a hefty salary - in the future , it 'll still be twice the amount of an average german salary . but who earns that much and more ?
senior specialists and not young , highly qualified graduates at the beginning of their careers .
the latter , however , are the ones being sought by industry here , because they are still flexible . that 's why the new action program to secure the supply of specialists has business leaders shaking their heads . a system that does n't take into account the needs of the german labor market and an applicant 's ability to integrate can not work . in the it sector , every second company is saying that business is down because vacant positions can not be filled .
the association of german engineers says that there are 96,000 jobs available - twice as many as four years ago . politicians not listening the government hears what the business community is saying - but it does n't really want to listen .
the labor minister says that the lack of skilled workers ca n't be as bad as the industry is saying .
at the same time , he admits that he does n't really know what the situation is like .
why should he ?
in the end , he 's more concerned with protecting rather than opening the labor market .
germany has three million unemployed people - a long-time social democrat can not open borders under such circumstances ! other states do exactly that and are way ahead when it comes to competing for the world 's smartest heads .
the netherlands , for example , has adjusted the minimum salary requirements to be in line with those of skilled local professional beginners . plenty of choices the german labor market on the other hand is only opening up for those who do n't have to work in germany .
it 's opening up for people so highly qualified that they can decide whether they want to stay in their own countries or - if they 're from india , china or south america - would n't rather go to english-speaking countries such as australia , britain , canada or the us , where the will have to worry less about resentment . the new immigration measures taken by the federal government are a step in the right direction .
but they 're miles away from reaching the target . sabine kinkartz is dw-radio 's business correspondent in berlin . -lrb- win -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

" the whole of germany is looking forward to the 2018 winter games in munich , " said german interior minister wolfgang schaeuble when the official bid committee was inaugurated on this week in the city 's town hall . " it has been quite a while since we successfully bid for the olympic games .
we will do everything to succeed , " he said . the 1972 summer games in munich were the last olympics in the country - with berlin and garmisch-partenkirchen hosting the summer and winter editions , respectively , in 1936 . berchtesgaden flopped for the 1992 winter games , while berlin and leipzig came nowhere close to international olympic committee confidence in their bids for the 2000 and 2012 summer games . " munich plus two " garmisch is in the frame again as part of munich 's bid , set to stage the snow events .
sliding competition is to take place on the existing track in koeniggssee while all other ice events are set for the host city of munich . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the last german olympic games were in munich in 1972 - and marked by tragedy the campaign is suitably named " munich plus two " as other famous bavarian wintersport venues such as inzell -lrb- speed-skating -rrb- and ruhpolding -lrb- biathlon -rrb- were dropped in favor of a bid as compact as possible . munich mayor christian ude did not hide the city 's determination to make history as the first host of summer and winter games - preferably with the first attempt like in 1972 . " munich has a tradition to get the nod on the first attempt .
it is a fantastic perspective for munich 's future to become the first city in the world to stage the wwinter games after the summer games , " said ude . german olympic supremo thomas bach said there was no plan b should munich fail in the 2011 ioc vote . wilfried spronk , the experienced former head of munich 's olympiapark -lrb- the main area of the 1972 games -rrb- company , has been hired as managing director . spronk 's first task is to raise the 30 million euros -lrb- $ 47.8 million -rrb- munich needs for the bid procedure .

the recent munich expo attracted more than 1,000 exhibitors and 50,000 attendees from 140 countries . in contrast , the san francisco intersolar has only 200 exhibitors and 12,000 attendees . the major reason for the difference is the scope of government support , or the lack of it in the united states .

vice president dick cheney famously dismissed conservation as a meaningless personal virtue . though the us does offer homeowners a one-time , $ 2,000 federal tax credit for the installation of photo-voltaic systems that convert solar energy into electricity , weber argued that it needed a so-called feed-in tariff to really allow the sector to take off .
such a tariff offers energy producers a guaranteed price for energy that they feed into the grid from renewable sources , and was the key stimulus in boosting the european solar sector . but there are many other factors in play . the next big thing ? for instance , it 's no coincidence that the conference is taking place in san francisco .

hitler probably realized that himself . after the army had advanced 2,000 kilometers -lrb- 1,200 miles -rrb- east of german soil , nazi germany 's war of aggression morphed into failure during late 1941 and early 1942 when the wehrmacht -lrb- the official german army , navy and air force -rrb- could not achieve any knock-out blow . yet it took nearly three more years to end the war .
the wehrmacht did not capitulate until after the fuehrer had committed suicide in his berlin bunker in april 1945 . decades of research part 10 of the war history , which has just come out in two volumes , examines the collapse of the third reich in 1945 .
the entire history , " das deutsche reich und der zweite weltkrieg " -lrb- the german reich and the second world war -rrb- , was researched by the german military history unit mgfa , which is now based in potsdam near berlin .
the project began in 1978 . the part on 1945 has chapters on naval warfare , the allied air onslaught on germany , the operations of the red army on german soil , german industry and the transition to post-war reconstruction , the fate of prisoners of war and ethnic " cleansing " as the war ended . part 8 several years ago foreshadowed the answer to the question of why the nazis did not give up . to the very end , the nazi regime required germans to recite their belief in " ultimate victory . "
but in the final years of the war , part 8 suggested , hitler 's mind gradually focused on staging a vain but heroic last stand . part 10 explores various explanations , including a " suicidal urge " in the dictator 's personality . suicide mission hitler 's all-or-nothing approach has been described by his biographers as a key to his rise , and an exiled german writer , sebastian haffner , suggested as early as 1940 that the method was also the mark of a " potential self-killer . " with all dissent punished , the changing attitudes of the german public and the soldiers is more difficult to establish , particularly in the closing months of the war , when the documentary record of a germany sinking into chaos and defeat is sparse . the history emphasizes that german fanaticism was not monolithic and that german attitudes in any case were contradictory . while other types of history explore the moral failure that led the germans to ravage europe and unleash the holocaust , a military history takes a more technical look at what the military did , how it nursed its resources and what its political masters aimed for . tired germans rolf-dieter mueller , editor of part 10 and leader of its 11 authors , writes in an analytic summary that by 1943 , after four exhausting years of war , a majority of germans probably would have accepted a surrender if it had not been for hitler 's determination to fight on regardless . the volume 's account of the war on the western front in 1944 and 1945 describes the german military fighting on towards self-destruction under mottoes such as " for honor " and " for the fatherland , " believing they were " doing their duty . " " that was their common denominator with a majority of the germans , who had been simply sticking to what they were doing , or had not sought any alternative , or had not been able to visualize any other way , " the book says . the chapter on the army 's last stand describes the fanatical refusal to surrender that made germany 's own military the greatest danger to germany 's own people , but it also refers to the many cases of officers and men who indirectly saved fellow germans ' lives . on their own responsibility and often risking execution for treason , some of the german military openly disobeyed orders or subtly wasted time so that the allied invasion of germany could proceed quickly without even more loss of lives and property . no alternative ? the epilogue to the work states , " hitler waged his personal war for six years , supported by sentiment in germany that remained broadly favorable even after a series of defeats and never turned to public resentment , despite growing apathy and war weariness . " to the germans , no alternative appeared feasible , other than the unconditional surrender demanded by the enemy , " the book adds . most of the rest of the world was needed to defeat the most efficient fighting machine of its generation , which had battled on despite hitler 's strategic blunders . its commanders refused to sue for peace when it became the militarily rational thing to do , and remained loyal to the dictator because of their own collaboration with his criminal objectives . explaining modern germany 's reluctance to fight the taliban and its focus on collective defense , the last part says the war taught post-war germans an abiding lesson and they deliberately renounced any capacity to wage a war of their own ever again . germany 's submission to nato has meant that the second world war was the " last war of the germans " in history . dpa news agency -lrb- win -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

" this is my appeal to break out of the spiral of violence .
a lack of dialogue is not an option for the future , " he said after meeting with his georgian counterpart eka tkeshelashvili .
steinmeier , who chairs the so-called group of friends of the united nations ' secretary on georgia , is proposing a three-phase peace plan based on a mutual declaration of non-violence and repatriation of about 25,000 ethnic georgians expelled from abkhazia in the 1990s .
negotiations over the status of the two rebel regions , which have enjoyed de facto autonomy since the end of a civil war in 1994 , was reserved for the final phase of negotiations .
tkeshelashvili said , " the plan has great potential for success , " but added that the most difficult thing would be to convince russia .
peace talks remain distant the threat of armed conflict in the region last month has given urgency to international pressure for renewed peace talks , but tbilisi , moscow and the russian-backed regions remain far apart on the basic premises for restarting peace talks .

russia 's foreign minister sergei lavrov was skeptical of peace efforts thursday .
" signing of a treaty on the return of georgian refugees to abkhazia is unreal now , because such a return requires a calm situation , " lavrov was quoted as saying by news agency ria-novosti .
" we think that signing a treaty on the non-use of force without any preconditions is an absolutely unavoidable first step , " he added .
experts see little hope for steinmeier 's plan analysts do not expect anything conclusive from steinmeier 's trip , pointing to intransigence on the part of the abkhaz president sergei bagapsh , who said he would " not consider the plan . "
" we are not going to discuss abkhazia 's status with anyone .
we are building an independent , democratic state , " bagapsh was quoted by georgian news agencies as saying .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the presence of russian troops in abkhazia has aggravated tensions with georgia speaking to journalists ahead of the meetings thursday , steinmeier admitted : " we do n't have any illusions about simple answers , but we can not stand by without acting on this conflict .
that would be irresponsible . "
from tbilisi , the german minister is to travel to the black sea city of batumi for talks with georgian president mikhail saakashvili and then to abkhazia on friday before ending his three-day tour in moscow .
most citizens of the breakaway republics have been issued russian passports and over 2,500 russian peacekeeping troops patrol the region under a un ceasefire agreement .

the german delegation would meet with the de-facto president of the breakaway region , sergei bagapsh , in sukhumi , which is a port city on the black sea .
" the goal of the trip is to find with all the affected parties ways out of the logic of escalation , out of this spiral of constantly escalating incidents .

steinmeier would try to build trust and explore a solution acceptable to all parties .
in tbilisi , he would meet with president mikheil saakashvili and the georgian opposition .

russia and georgia are at odds over two regions which separated from georgia in the early 1990s .

"
tbilisi has protested the presence of russian forces in the territories and offers of russian citizenship to their residents as a de facto annexation of its territory .
peschke said berlin had a special responsibility in the conflict .

the third stage would be to resolve the legal status of abkhazia .
the plan to settle the conflict between georgia and abkhazia was rejected out of hand by abkhaz leader sergei bagapsh monday , according to russian media .
steinmeier met with visiting un chief ban ki-moon tuesday and called lavrov and us secretary of state condoleezza rice this week to discuss abkhazia .
lavrov told him that moscow wanted " both sides to accept obligations not to use force , " and for georgian troops to pull out of the strategic kodori gorge in abkhazia , the russian foreign ministry said .
" the russian side stressed that to de-escalate the situation in the conflict zone it is necessary to have the sides accept obligations not to use force , " the ministry said in a statement .

" this could sink a possible resolution " of the crisis , lavrov was quoted as saying by the interfax news agency after meeting bagapsh .
he was referring to us assertions that giving georgia a so-called membership action plan -lrb- map -rrb- for nato membership could help resolve its " frozen conflicts " in abkhazia and south ossetia .
at its latest summit in april , nato shied away from formally granting a map to georgia and another ex-soviet republic near russia , ukraine , amid opposition from germany , france and some other european states .

it 's also trying to make a name for itself in the fashion world , although it 's proving to be an uphill road . proponents of berlin as a emerging fashion metropolis say it 's beginning to come into its own , and in addition to the small , one-room fashion start-ups run by young people in their 20s , well-known designers are also coming to the german capital to present their collections , even if it 's usually their secondary lines . vivienne westwood will show her number two line " anglomania " this week and bigger german labels " hugo , " " joop jeans " and " strenesse blue " are showing their 2009 spring and summer collections . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : from the fall / winter 2008/2009 collection of the label strenesse blue " we think berlin will gain importance as a fashion city , just because of the location , " mercedes-benz fashion week spokeswoman nora rochlitzer told the koelner stadt-anzeiger daily .
" berlin is in the center of europe and from here we can conquer anything , even eastern europe . " the capital will be dotted with smaller venues which will show off work from younger designers , such as the 120 who have been invited to a series of small storefronts in berlin 's largely immigrant wedding district . " we do n't want to withdraw and drink champagne , but celebrate with our neighbors , " said christoph steinweg , the organizer of " wedding dress 3 . " larger stores , like the galeries lafayette department store in downtown berlin , are showing off the collections of 13 well known berlin labels , such as c.neeon , von wedel & tiedeken and pulver . lots of creativity , little commerce but while germany is strong when it comes to creative potential , with its lively arts and fashion scene , it 's the business aspect of things that is lacking , experts say . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : berlin 's got the creative spirit , but fashion business is still done in duesseldorf " berlin does n't have any commercial dimension , " said thomas rasch , director of the german fashion association germany fashion .
" business is done in duesseldorf . " rochlitzer defends berlin as a fashion capital , saying people love to talk it down , but they should give it a chance .
she points out that the fashion week in new york , one of today 's undisputed capitals of couture , was not a great success when it began . but perhaps most telling , and perhaps discouraging for fashionistas in berlin , was a recent interview in the tagesspiegel daily with suzy menkes , one of the world 's top fashion journalists . when asked if she thought berlin 's fashion week was important , she responded , " oh , i have to admit , i did n't really know that a fashion week was taking place in berlin .

" this is my appeal to break out of the spiral of violence .
a lack of dialogue is not an option for the future , " he said after meeting with his georgian counterpart eka tkeshelashvili .
steinmeier , who chairs the so-called group of friends of the united nations ' secretary on georgia , is proposing a three-phase peace plan based on a mutual declaration of non-violence and repatriation of about 25,000 ethnic georgians expelled from abkhazia in the 1990s .
negotiations over the status of the two rebel regions , which have enjoyed de facto autonomy since the end of a civil war in 1994 , was reserved for the final phase of negotiations .

" we think that signing a treaty on the non-use of force without any preconditions is an absolutely unavoidable first step , " he added .
experts see little hope for steinmeier 's plan analysts do not expect anything conclusive from steinmeier 's trip , pointing to intransigence on the part of the abkhaz president sergei bagapsh , who said he would " not consider the plan . "
" we are not going to discuss abkhazia 's status with anyone .

" this is my appeal to break out of the spiral of violence .
a lack of dialogue is not an option for the future , " he said after meeting with his georgian counterpart eka tkeshelashvili .
steinmeier , who chairs the so-called group of friends of the united nations ' secretary on georgia , is proposing a three-phase peace plan based on a mutual declaration of non-violence and repatriation of about 25,000 ethnic georgians expelled from abkhazia in the 1990s .
negotiations over the status of the two rebel regions , which have enjoyed de facto autonomy since the end of a civil war in 1994 , was reserved for the final phase of negotiations .
tkeshelashvili said , " the plan has great potential for success , " but added that the most difficult thing would be to convince russia .
peace talks remain distant the threat of armed conflict in the region last month has given urgency to international pressure for renewed peace talks , but tbilisi , moscow and the russian-backed regions remain far apart on the basic premises for restarting peace talks .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : lavrov , left , sees little hope for steinmeier 's road map officials in tbilisi oppose a treaty on the non-use of force without guarantees on the return of refugees and the withdrawal of russian peacekeeping forces base in the region .
russia 's foreign minister sergei lavrov was skeptical of peace efforts thursday .
" signing of a treaty on the return of georgian refugees to abkhazia is unreal now , because such a return requires a calm situation , " lavrov was quoted as saying by news agency ria-novosti .
" we think that signing a treaty on the non-use of force without any preconditions is an absolutely unavoidable first step , " he added .
experts see little hope for steinmeier 's plan analysts do not expect anything conclusive from steinmeier 's trip , pointing to intransigence on the part of the abkhaz president sergei bagapsh , who said he would " not consider the plan . "
" we are not going to discuss abkhazia 's status with anyone .
we are building an independent , democratic state , " bagapsh was quoted by georgian news agencies as saying .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the presence of russian troops in abkhazia has aggravated tensions with georgia speaking to journalists ahead of the meetings thursday , steinmeier admitted : " we do n't have any illusions about simple answers , but we can not stand by without acting on this conflict .
that would be irresponsible . "
from tbilisi , the german minister is to travel to the black sea city of batumi for talks with georgian president mikhail saakashvili and then to abkhazia on friday before ending his three-day tour in moscow .
most citizens of the breakaway republics have been issued russian passports and over 2,500 russian peacekeeping troops patrol the region under a un ceasefire agreement .

the german delegation would meet with the de-facto president of the breakaway region , sergei bagapsh , in sukhumi , which is a port city on the black sea .
" the goal of the trip is to find with all the affected parties ways out of the logic of escalation , out of this spiral of constantly escalating incidents .
it is about building trust and creating the specific conditions for a solution that will be acceptable for all , " said peschke .
steinmeier would try to build trust and explore a solution acceptable to all parties .
in tbilisi , he would meet with president mikheil saakashvili and the georgian opposition .
" we 've been in close and regular contact with all parties , " said the spokesman .
russia and georgia are at odds over two regions which separated from georgia in the early 1990s .
bombings and fly-overs up the ante bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : fly-overs by russian jets have increased tensions tensions mounted this month with a series of bombings in abkhazia , the arrest by another separatist republic , south ossetia , of four georgian soldiers and flights over south ossetia by russia 's air force , which moscow says are needed to prevent " bloodshed . "
tbilisi has protested the presence of russian forces in the territories and offers of russian citizenship to their residents as a de facto annexation of its territory .
peschke said berlin had a special responsibility in the conflict .
since 2003 , germany has been coordinator of a panel known as the friends of the united nations secretary general for georgia .
the other members are britain , russia , the united states and france .
german road map dismissed by abkhazia bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : steinmeier 's plan has already been dismissed steinmeier is expected to advocate a three-stage german road-map for peace that has already received a cool reception from the abkhazians . it proposes a year of confidence-building measures , including an end to violence and a return of georgian refugees to abkhazia , with a reconstruction phase to follow .
the third stage would be to resolve the legal status of abkhazia .
the plan to settle the conflict between georgia and abkhazia was rejected out of hand by abkhaz leader sergei bagapsh monday , according to russian media .
steinmeier met with visiting un chief ban ki-moon tuesday and called lavrov and us secretary of state condoleezza rice this week to discuss abkhazia .
lavrov told him that moscow wanted " both sides to accept obligations not to use force , " and for georgian troops to pull out of the strategic kodori gorge in abkhazia , the russian foreign ministry said .
" the russian side stressed that to de-escalate the situation in the conflict zone it is necessary to have the sides accept obligations not to use force , " the ministry said in a statement .
georgia for its part accuses russia of tacit support for the rebels and stoking tensions in both regions .
russia says nato plans increase threat bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : steinmeier and lavrov will hold further talks on georgia lavrov last week held talks in moscow with the separatist leader of abkhazia , sergei bagapsh , and warned afterwards that a plan to bring georgia closer to joining nato would scuttle any peace efforts .
" this could sink a possible resolution " of the crisis , lavrov was quoted as saying by the interfax news agency after meeting bagapsh .
he was referring to us assertions that giving georgia a so-called membership action plan -lrb- map -rrb- for nato membership could help resolve its " frozen conflicts " in abkhazia and south ossetia .
at its latest summit in april , nato shied away from formally granting a map to georgia and another ex-soviet republic near russia , ukraine , amid opposition from germany , france and some other european states .
georgia boosts military spending lawmakers in georgia on tuesday increased army numbers and boosted defense spending in response to " aggressive actions " from russia and as part of a bid to join the nato alliance .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : saakashvili says georgia faces its biggest threat " threat assessment has shown that threats have increased and reached a critical level after russia 's aggressive actions , " givi targamadze , a member of president mikhail saakashvili 's ruling party , said in broadcast comments .
" georgia faces the highest level of threat since independence , " he said .
the 15-percent boost in army numbers from 32,000 to 37,000 " will strengthen our defenses and build an army compatible with the nato criteria , " nicoloz rurua , also from the united national movement party , said earlier .
the parliament , which is dominated by saakashvili 's party , also approved a government proposal to increase defense spending this year by $ 209 million -lrb- 131 million euros -rrb- to around $ 989 million . dw staff -lrb- nda -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de russia -pipe- 17.07.2008 germany to mediate in russia-georgia crisis over abkhazia großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : georgia is increasing its military spending as the specter of war with russia looms amid fears that the abkhazia conflict will escalate into war , german foreign minister frank-walter steinmeier is to mediate this week , beginning a diplomatic swing thursday , july 17 , in the georgian capital tbilisi . steinmeier would then travel to sukhumi , the chief town of the moscow-backed breakaway georgian region of abkhazia , and on to moscow to meet russian foreign minister sergei lavrov , according to foreign ministry deputy spokesman andreas peschke on wednesday .
the german delegation would meet with the de-facto president of the breakaway region , sergei bagapsh , in sukhumi , which is a port city on the black sea .
" the goal of the trip is to find with all the affected parties ways out of the logic of escalation , out of this spiral of constantly escalating incidents .
it is about building trust and creating the specific conditions for a solution that will be acceptable for all , " said peschke .
steinmeier would try to build trust and explore a solution acceptable to all parties .
in tbilisi , he would meet with president mikheil saakashvili and the georgian opposition .
" we 've been in close and regular contact with all parties , " said the spokesman .
russia and georgia are at odds over two regions which separated from georgia in the early 1990s .
bombings and fly-overs up the ante bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : fly-overs by russian jets have increased tensions tensions mounted this month with a series of bombings in abkhazia , the arrest by another separatist republic , south ossetia , of four georgian soldiers and flights over south ossetia by russia 's air force , which moscow says are needed to prevent " bloodshed . "
tbilisi has protested the presence of russian forces in the territories and offers of russian citizenship to their residents as a de facto annexation of its territory .
peschke said berlin had a special responsibility in the conflict .
since 2003 , germany has been coordinator of a panel known as the friends of the united nations secretary general for georgia .
the other members are britain , russia , the united states and france .
german road map dismissed by abkhazia bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : steinmeier 's plan has already been dismissed steinmeier is expected to advocate a three-stage german road-map for peace that has already received a cool reception from the abkhazians . it proposes a year of confidence-building measures , including an end to violence and a return of georgian refugees to abkhazia , with a reconstruction phase to follow .
the third stage would be to resolve the legal status of abkhazia .
the plan to settle the conflict between georgia and abkhazia was rejected out of hand by abkhaz leader sergei bagapsh monday , according to russian media .
steinmeier met with visiting un chief ban ki-moon tuesday and called lavrov and us secretary of state condoleezza rice this week to discuss abkhazia .
lavrov told him that moscow wanted " both sides to accept obligations not to use force , " and for georgian troops to pull out of the strategic kodori gorge in abkhazia , the russian foreign ministry said .
" the russian side stressed that to de-escalate the situation in the conflict zone it is necessary to have the sides accept obligations not to use force , " the ministry said in a statement .
georgia for its part accuses russia of tacit support for the rebels and stoking tensions in both regions .
russia says nato plans increase threat bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : steinmeier and lavrov will hold further talks on georgia lavrov last week held talks in moscow with the separatist leader of abkhazia , sergei bagapsh , and warned afterwards that a plan to bring georgia closer to joining nato would scuttle any peace efforts .
" this could sink a possible resolution " of the crisis , lavrov was quoted as saying by the interfax news agency after meeting bagapsh .
he was referring to us assertions that giving georgia a so-called membership action plan -lrb- map -rrb- for nato membership could help resolve its " frozen conflicts " in abkhazia and south ossetia .
at its latest summit in april , nato shied away from formally granting a map to georgia and another ex-soviet republic near russia , ukraine , amid opposition from germany , france and some other european states .
georgia boosts military spending lawmakers in georgia on tuesday increased army numbers and boosted defense spending in response to " aggressive actions " from russia and as part of a bid to join the nato alliance .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : saakashvili says georgia faces its biggest threat " threat assessment has shown that threats have increased and reached a critical level after russia 's aggressive actions , " givi targamadze , a member of president mikhail saakashvili 's ruling party , said in broadcast comments .
" georgia faces the highest level of threat since independence , " he said .
the 15-percent boost in army numbers from 32,000 to 37,000 " will strengthen our defenses and build an army compatible with the nato criteria , " nicoloz rurua , also from the united national movement party , said earlier .

hitler probably realized that himself . after the army had advanced 2,000 kilometers -lrb- 1,200 miles -rrb- east of german soil , nazi germany 's war of aggression morphed into failure during late 1941 and early 1942 when the wehrmacht -lrb- the official german army , navy and air force -rrb- could not achieve any knock-out blow . yet it took nearly three more years to end the war .
the wehrmacht did not capitulate until after the fuehrer had committed suicide in his berlin bunker in april 1945 . decades of research part 10 of the war history , which has just come out in two volumes , examines the collapse of the third reich in 1945 .
the entire history , " das deutsche reich und der zweite weltkrieg " -lrb- the german reich and the second world war -rrb- , was researched by the german military history unit mgfa , which is now based in potsdam near berlin .
the project began in 1978 . the part on 1945 has chapters on naval warfare , the allied air onslaught on germany , the operations of the red army on german soil , german industry and the transition to post-war reconstruction , the fate of prisoners of war and ethnic " cleansing " as the war ended . part 8 several years ago foreshadowed the answer to the question of why the nazis did not give up . to the very end , the nazi regime required germans to recite their belief in " ultimate victory .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de energy -pipe- 17.07.2008 german expert predicts us solar energy boom großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : this might soon be a common sight in the us , according to some the us might still lag behind in promoting alternative energies , but at least one german expert is convinced that this is bound to change in the very near future . there 's something incongruous about experts from normally cloudy germany coming to california , the land of eternal sunshine , to teach the locals about how to harness solar power . but that 's was happening this week in san francisco , where organizers of the world 's largest solar exhibition , germany 's intersolar , launched an american version of their confab amid predictions of a massive solar boom in the ailing us economy . conference chairman professor eicke weber , director of the fraunhofer institute for solar energy systems , insists that it makes perfect sense for germans to bring their solar accumen to the golden state . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : americans are already beginning to cut back on their driving habits as soaring fuel costs combine with rapidly changing public perceptions about the dangers of climate change , the us embrace of solar power is at a tipping point , he predicts .
soon , the us will follow the massive investments already made in europe in renewable energy , where thanks to strong government support the solar industry is years ahead of its american counterpart . " before , our only argument was the environment , but now with oil at $ 140 -lrb- 88 euros -rrb- a barrel , i think the much stronger argument will be the pocketbook , " he said .
" that 's why i think solar energy will have a great future in the united states . " no backing from bush one indication of the gulf that separates the two continents is the size of their solar exhibitions .
the german intersolar has been growing at some 30 percent a year .
the recent munich expo attracted more than 1,000 exhibitors and 50,000 attendees from 140 countries . in contrast , the san francisco intersolar has only 200 exhibitors and 12,000 attendees . the major reason for the difference is the scope of government support , or the lack of it in the united states .
under president george w. bush , a former oil company executive , the federal government until recently denied the science of climate change .

soon , the us will follow the massive investments already made in europe in renewable energy , where thanks to strong government support the solar industry is years ahead of its american counterpart . " before , our only argument was the environment , but now with oil at $ 140 -lrb- 88 euros -rrb- a barrel , i think the much stronger argument will be the pocketbook , " he said .
" that 's why i think solar energy will have a great future in the united states . " no backing from bush one indication of the gulf that separates the two continents is the size of their solar exhibitions .
the german intersolar has been growing at some 30 percent a year .
the recent munich expo attracted more than 1,000 exhibitors and 50,000 attendees from 140 countries . in contrast , the san francisco intersolar has only 200 exhibitors and 12,000 attendees . the major reason for the difference is the scope of government support , or the lack of it in the united states .
under president george w. bush , a former oil company executive , the federal government until recently denied the science of climate change .
vice president dick cheney famously dismissed conservation as a meaningless personal virtue . though the us does offer homeowners a one-time , $ 2,000 federal tax credit for the installation of photo-voltaic systems that convert solar energy into electricity , weber argued that it needed a so-called feed-in tariff to really allow the sector to take off .
such a tariff offers energy producers a guaranteed price for energy that they feed into the grid from renewable sources , and was the key stimulus in boosting the european solar sector . but there are many other factors in play . the next big thing ? for instance , it 's no coincidence that the conference is taking place in san francisco .
the city is the northern anchor of silicon valley , where an ever-increasing pool of venture capital and a growing number of start-ups are chasing the solar dream . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : sunpower corp. ceo thomas warner next to the solar panels on the roof of the sunpower building in san jose many are already predicting a solar boom , akin to the dot-com boom that accompanied the rise of the internet .
some start-ups like nanosolar and solyndra are already valued at more than $ 1 billion before they 've ever made a profit , reflecting the huge growth potential that wall street sees in the solar field . the comparisons to california 's tech industry do not end there .
solar-cell production is a close cousin to the production of computer chips , and there is a constant exchange of personnel , techniques and equipment between the two sectors . " each time we double the volume of production , the cost goes down by 20 percent , " weber said .
" at the end of the day , it will be the least expensive energy of all .
we just need a little help to ignite the revolution . " dan martin , who heads semicon west , a trade association of semiconductor manufacturers , believes the same dynamic - that dramatically reduced the price of computer chips while simultaneously increasing their power - will also characterize the solar voltaics sector .

ca n't think of anything ?
i can understand . but germany 's federal government does n't .
it still hopes that it can lure highly skilled people with a university degree to germany in large numbers .
it 's an old hope that 's been disappointed so far : in 2006 , only 456 highly qualified people received permanent residence status - 10 fewer than last year . minimum salary the minimum salary requirement is the biggest hurdle .
anyone who wants to come here without fulfilling any other requirements has to be able to prove that he or she is earning a hefty salary - in the future , it 'll still be twice the amount of an average german salary . but who earns that much and more ?

the association of german engineers says that there are 96,000 jobs available - twice as many as four years ago . politicians not listening the government hears what the business community is saying - but it does n't really want to listen .
the labor minister says that the lack of skilled workers ca n't be as bad as the industry is saying .

the netherlands , for example , has adjusted the minimum salary requirements to be in line with those of skilled local professional beginners . plenty of choices the german labor market on the other hand is only opening up for those who do n't have to work in germany .

but the changes do n't go far enough , says deutsche welle 's sabine kinkartz . imagine that you 're highly qualified .
you 've completed your studies and gotten the best grades , you 've been working for a couple of years as an engineer , a process technician or an it specialist , you 've done additional training , fine-tuned your skills and are earning good money . maybe you ’ ve started a family and found friends .
in short - you 're feeling good and have found your place in life , wherever it may be .
what could bring you to give up all this , immigrate to germany and work here ?
ca n't think of anything ?
i can understand . but germany 's federal government does n't .
it still hopes that it can lure highly skilled people with a university degree to germany in large numbers .
it 's an old hope that 's been disappointed so far : in 2006 , only 456 highly qualified people received permanent residence status - 10 fewer than last year . minimum salary the minimum salary requirement is the biggest hurdle .
anyone who wants to come here without fulfilling any other requirements has to be able to prove that he or she is earning a hefty salary - in the future , it 'll still be twice the amount of an average german salary . but who earns that much and more ?
senior specialists and not young , highly qualified graduates at the beginning of their careers .
the latter , however , are the ones being sought by industry here , because they are still flexible . that 's why the new action program to secure the supply of specialists has business leaders shaking their heads . a system that does n't take into account the needs of the german labor market and an applicant 's ability to integrate can not work . in the it sector , every second company is saying that business is down because vacant positions can not be filled .
the association of german engineers says that there are 96,000 jobs available - twice as many as four years ago . politicians not listening the government hears what the business community is saying - but it does n't really want to listen .
the labor minister says that the lack of skilled workers ca n't be as bad as the industry is saying .
at the same time , he admits that he does n't really know what the situation is like .
why should he ?
in the end , he 's more concerned with protecting rather than opening the labor market .
germany has three million unemployed people - a long-time social democrat can not open borders under such circumstances ! other states do exactly that and are way ahead when it comes to competing for the world 's smartest heads .
the netherlands , for example , has adjusted the minimum salary requirements to be in line with those of skilled local professional beginners . plenty of choices the german labor market on the other hand is only opening up for those who do n't have to work in germany .
it 's opening up for people so highly qualified that they can decide whether they want to stay in their own countries or - if they 're from india , china or south america - would n't rather go to english-speaking countries such as australia , britain , canada or the us , where the will have to worry less about resentment . the new immigration measures taken by the federal government are a step in the right direction .
but they 're miles away from reaching the target . sabine kinkartz is dw-radio 's business correspondent in berlin . -lrb- win -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

" rome should provide a signal that crimes such as genocide , crimes against humanity , war crimes and crimes of aggression will in the future no longer go unpunished , " said the head of the german delegation in rome , gerd westdickenberg . the fundamental idea that emerged from the rome conference was that every country should pass laws that would require even high-ranking politicians and military officials to answer charges of human rights abuses before a court . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : luis moreno ocampo the icc , which was launched in 2002 , is based on the theory that such people could be extradited to a standing international court if a country 's own justice system was not capable of prosecuting them . " we 're a backup system , " said the icc 's lead prosecutor luis moreno-ocampo .
" we 're not a supreme court of the world . " several countries have since passed laws that allow war crimes , even genocide , to be prosecuted in national courts .
germany passed its own legislation in 2002 that regulated crimes against public international law to bring its own laws into accordance with the rome statue .
indirectly , it prevents german citizens from being taken in front of the icc . refusing to sign but those who support an international court which steps in when national courts can not , or will not , are distressed by the refusal of those countries that refused to sign the treaty . these are not a few small nations run by dictators , but major world players such as the united states and india .
china and russia have also withheld their signatures . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : sudan and the situation in darfur is now a concern of the icc even today , us president george w. bush has shown no sign of reconsidering his refusal to sign the rome statute and in a move almost unique in legal history , even withdrew american support after it had been given . the administration of previous president bill clinton had signed the treaty in its last days in office so that it could take part in consultations on details of the court . but in 2002 , washington " unsigned " the treaty , arguing that the court could create havoc for the united states , exposing american soldiers and officials overseas to capricious and mischievous prosecutions . " as the united states works to bring peace around the whole world , our diplomats and our soldiers could be dragged into this court , " bush said .
" and that 's very troubling to me .
we 'll try to work out the impasse at the united nations but one thing we 're not going to do is sign on to the international criminal court . " bush has shown no interest in following germany 's example and passing laws that would make war crimes a punishable offense .
instead , he has tried to weaken the icc by establishing non-extradition agreements with individual nations regarding american citizens . those are linked with threats to withhold military aid for the land if such deals are not made .
he has had some success with this strategy . growing credibility bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : judges of the international criminal court at the start of a hearing in the meantime , the row over the icc between critics of the rome statute , such as washington , and its biggest proponents , who are mostly in europe , has gotten quieter .
that has something to do with the fact that the court is busy for now with cases in the democratic republic of congo , uganda , the central african republic and darfur . " i had to choose the cases according to gravity .
and the gravest cases happened in africa , " said prosecutor moreno-ocampo . but as the icc continues its work to bring those who commit grave human rights abuses to justice , new york-based political analyst jeff laurenti believes it is gaining credibility around the globe , despite the vocal critics . " the court will be proving itself despite the bush administration 's knee-jerk hostility , " he said .
" that creates the opportunity to demonstrate that the paranoia about the icc that has been propagated by the right wing is unjustified and misplaced . " a change in washington 's attitude could be developing .
when the un security council referred the case of darfur and sudanese president omar hassan al-bashir to the hague , the us could have vetoed the move , but did n't .
instead , it just stayed silent . dw staff -lrb- jam -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de energy -pipe- 17.07.2008 german expert predicts us solar energy boom großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : this might soon be a common sight in the us , according to some the us might still lag behind in promoting alternative energies , but at least one german expert is convinced that this is bound to change in the very near future . there 's something incongruous about experts from normally cloudy germany coming to california , the land of eternal sunshine , to teach the locals about how to harness solar power . but that 's was happening this week in san francisco , where organizers of the world 's largest solar exhibition , germany 's intersolar , launched an american version of their confab amid predictions of a massive solar boom in the ailing us economy . conference chairman professor eicke weber , director of the fraunhofer institute for solar energy systems , insists that it makes perfect sense for germans to bring their solar accumen to the golden state . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : americans are already beginning to cut back on their driving habits as soaring fuel costs combine with rapidly changing public perceptions about the dangers of climate change , the us embrace of solar power is at a tipping point , he predicts .
soon , the us will follow the massive investments already made in europe in renewable energy , where thanks to strong government support the solar industry is years ahead of its american counterpart . " before , our only argument was the environment , but now with oil at $ 140 -lrb- 88 euros -rrb- a barrel , i think the much stronger argument will be the pocketbook , " he said .
" that 's why i think solar energy will have a great future in the united states . " no backing from bush one indication of the gulf that separates the two continents is the size of their solar exhibitions .
the german intersolar has been growing at some 30 percent a year .
the recent munich expo attracted more than 1,000 exhibitors and 50,000 attendees from 140 countries . in contrast , the san francisco intersolar has only 200 exhibitors and 12,000 attendees . the major reason for the difference is the scope of government support , or the lack of it in the united states .
under president george w. bush , a former oil company executive , the federal government until recently denied the science of climate change .
vice president dick cheney famously dismissed conservation as a meaningless personal virtue . though the us does offer homeowners a one-time , $ 2,000 federal tax credit for the installation of photo-voltaic systems that convert solar energy into electricity , weber argued that it needed a so-called feed-in tariff to really allow the sector to take off .
such a tariff offers energy producers a guaranteed price for energy that they feed into the grid from renewable sources , and was the key stimulus in boosting the european solar sector . but there are many other factors in play . the next big thing ? for instance , it 's no coincidence that the conference is taking place in san francisco .
the city is the northern anchor of silicon valley , where an ever-increasing pool of venture capital and a growing number of start-ups are chasing the solar dream . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : sunpower corp. ceo thomas warner next to the solar panels on the roof of the sunpower building in san jose many are already predicting a solar boom , akin to the dot-com boom that accompanied the rise of the internet .
some start-ups like nanosolar and solyndra are already valued at more than $ 1 billion before they 've ever made a profit , reflecting the huge growth potential that wall street sees in the solar field . the comparisons to california 's tech industry do not end there .
solar-cell production is a close cousin to the production of computer chips , and there is a constant exchange of personnel , techniques and equipment between the two sectors . " each time we double the volume of production , the cost goes down by 20 percent , " weber said .
" at the end of the day , it will be the least expensive energy of all .
we just need a little help to ignite the revolution . " dan martin , who heads semicon west , a trade association of semiconductor manufacturers , believes the same dynamic - that dramatically reduced the price of computer chips while simultaneously increasing their power - will also characterize the solar voltaics sector . " we are going to change the world , " he said .

it creates a fund of 4.6 million euros -lrb- $ 2.9 million -rrb- from which the compensation payments will be made . beneficiaries are to be those survivors from the alsace-lorraine region who were forced to work for the nazi german wartime authorities during the second world war .
the fund will be financed in equal shares by the french state and the foundation . the compensation would amount to about 800 euros per surviving victim .
most of the survivors today are women over the age of 80 . " we had to wait many years until we finally gained the recognition we demanded , " said germaine rohrbach , 82 , spokeswoman for the former forced-labor victims . too little , too late ? the final compensation , however , is " much too low in relation to the fate we suffered , " she added . originally the alsace-lorraine group had been hoping for the same amount of compensation - some 1,300 euros - which more than 86,000 people from the alsace-lorraine region who had once been forced into service of the german wehrmacht had received in the 1980s . that compensation came from a fund jointly established in 1981 by former french president valery giscard d 'estaing and then-west german chancellor helmut schmidt . stalled process thursday 's accord came after many years in which france had balked at recognizing the alsace-lorraine forced laborers as actual victims of the nazis .
it was finally last year , that president nicolas sarkozy gave the green light to resolve the issue quickly . the alsace-lorraine region straddles part of the border between france and germany , with a unique mix of the two countries ' languages and cultures . last year , german wound up its compensation payments to all surviving nazi regime forced-laborers , paying some 4.4 billion euros to 1.7 million victims in more than 100 countries . dpa news agency -lrb- win -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

" rome should provide a signal that crimes such as genocide , crimes against humanity , war crimes and crimes of aggression will in the future no longer go unpunished , " said the head of the german delegation in rome , gerd westdickenberg . the fundamental idea that emerged from the rome conference was that every country should pass laws that would require even high-ranking politicians and military officials to answer charges of human rights abuses before a court . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : luis moreno ocampo the icc , which was launched in 2002 , is based on the theory that such people could be extradited to a standing international court if a country 's own justice system was not capable of prosecuting them . " we 're a backup system , " said the icc 's lead prosecutor luis moreno-ocampo .
" we 're not a supreme court of the world . " several countries have since passed laws that allow war crimes , even genocide , to be prosecuted in national courts .
germany passed its own legislation in 2002 that regulated crimes against public international law to bring its own laws into accordance with the rome statue .
indirectly , it prevents german citizens from being taken in front of the icc . refusing to sign but those who support an international court which steps in when national courts can not , or will not , are distressed by the refusal of those countries that refused to sign the treaty . these are not a few small nations run by dictators , but major world players such as the united states and india .
china and russia have also withheld their signatures . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : sudan and the situation in darfur is now a concern of the icc even today , us president george w. bush has shown no sign of reconsidering his refusal to sign the rome statute and in a move almost unique in legal history , even withdrew american support after it had been given . the administration of previous president bill clinton had signed the treaty in its last days in office so that it could take part in consultations on details of the court . but in 2002 , washington " unsigned " the treaty , arguing that the court could create havoc for the united states , exposing american soldiers and officials overseas to capricious and mischievous prosecutions . " as the united states works to bring peace around the whole world , our diplomats and our soldiers could be dragged into this court , " bush said .
" and that 's very troubling to me .
we 'll try to work out the impasse at the united nations but one thing we 're not going to do is sign on to the international criminal court . " bush has shown no interest in following germany 's example and passing laws that would make war crimes a punishable offense .
instead , he has tried to weaken the icc by establishing non-extradition agreements with individual nations regarding american citizens . those are linked with threats to withhold military aid for the land if such deals are not made .
he has had some success with this strategy . growing credibility bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : judges of the international criminal court at the start of a hearing in the meantime , the row over the icc between critics of the rome statute , such as washington , and its biggest proponents , who are mostly in europe , has gotten quieter .
that has something to do with the fact that the court is busy for now with cases in the democratic republic of congo , uganda , the central african republic and darfur . " i had to choose the cases according to gravity .
and the gravest cases happened in africa , " said prosecutor moreno-ocampo . but as the icc continues its work to bring those who commit grave human rights abuses to justice , new york-based political analyst jeff laurenti believes it is gaining credibility around the globe , despite the vocal critics . " the court will be proving itself despite the bush administration 's knee-jerk hostility , " he said .
" that creates the opportunity to demonstrate that the paranoia about the icc that has been propagated by the right wing is unjustified and misplaced . " a change in washington 's attitude could be developing .
when the un security council referred the case of darfur and sudanese president omar hassan al-bashir to the hague , the us could have vetoed the move , but did n't .
instead , it just stayed silent . dw staff -lrb- jam -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

while originally supporting the idea , the city 's mayor is now not so certain any more that the winning design is the best one to build . the city is home to the oldest jewish community north of the alps and still has significant remains of the old jewish quarter , including the ruins of a mikwe , or ritual bath , just in front of cologne 's city hall . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the mikwe in front of city hall can be seen through a glass pyramid that 's why this particular spot was also chosen as the location of a future museum .
a design by saarbruecken-based architectural firm wandel hoefer lorch was overwhelmingly chosen by an expert jury . it all happened so quickly that members of the private foundation planning to pay for the construction said that it had n't collected any of the 20 million euros -lrb- $ 31.7 million -rrb- needed . they might not have to hurry . while cologne 's conservative mayor fritz schramma had originally voiced enthusiastic support for the plan , he 's since backed away from it . too massive ? bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : schramma supports the museum idea in general schramma says that he 's concerned that the new building would be too massive for the square in front of city hall .
the mayor now wants to give residents a chance to review all of the designs that were entered in the competition and then vote on them . while not accusing the mayor of anti-semitism , jewish leaders criticized schramma for giving in to concerns by others , including a neighboring arts museum . " there are rumors that the wallraf richartz museum is n't happy with the design , " salomon korn , a vice president of the central council of jews in germany , who sat on the selection jury , told german public radio deutschlandradio . an authentic place bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : korn thinks the square at city hall would be the best place korn , who is an architect himself , said that the winning design is far from massive and would actually return the space closer to its original state before buildings there were destroyed during world war ii . he also said that it made little sense to move the museum elsewhere , since the location in front of city hall was the historic site of germany 's jewish community and could therefore become a " crystallization core for remembrance . " " there 's only one authentic place " for the museum , korn said . dw staff -lrb- win -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

it creates a fund of 4.6 million euros -lrb- $ 2.9 million -rrb- from which the compensation payments will be made . beneficiaries are to be those survivors from the alsace-lorraine region who were forced to work for the nazi german wartime authorities during the second world war .
the fund will be financed in equal shares by the french state and the foundation . the compensation would amount to about 800 euros per surviving victim .
most of the survivors today are women over the age of 80 . " we had to wait many years until we finally gained the recognition we demanded , " said germaine rohrbach , 82 , spokeswoman for the former forced-labor victims . too little , too late ? the final compensation , however , is " much too low in relation to the fate we suffered , " she added . originally the alsace-lorraine group had been hoping for the same amount of compensation - some 1,300 euros - which more than 86,000 people from the alsace-lorraine region who had once been forced into service of the german wehrmacht had received in the 1980s . that compensation came from a fund jointly established in 1981 by former french president valery giscard d 'estaing and then-west german chancellor helmut schmidt . stalled process thursday 's accord came after many years in which france had balked at recognizing the alsace-lorraine forced laborers as actual victims of the nazis .
it was finally last year , that president nicolas sarkozy gave the green light to resolve the issue quickly . the alsace-lorraine region straddles part of the border between france and germany , with a unique mix of the two countries ' languages and cultures . last year , german wound up its compensation payments to all surviving nazi regime forced-laborers , paying some 4.4 billion euros to 1.7 million victims in more than 100 countries . dpa news agency -lrb- win -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

it creates a fund of 4.6 million euros -lrb- $ 2.9 million -rrb- from which the compensation payments will be made . beneficiaries are to be those survivors from the alsace-lorraine region who were forced to work for the nazi german wartime authorities during the second world war .
the fund will be financed in equal shares by the french state and the foundation . the compensation would amount to about 800 euros per surviving victim .
most of the survivors today are women over the age of 80 . " we had to wait many years until we finally gained the recognition we demanded , " said germaine rohrbach , 82 , spokeswoman for the former forced-labor victims . too little , too late ? the final compensation , however , is " much too low in relation to the fate we suffered , " she added . originally the alsace-lorraine group had been hoping for the same amount of compensation - some 1,300 euros - which more than 86,000 people from the alsace-lorraine region who had once been forced into service of the german wehrmacht had received in the 1980s . that compensation came from a fund jointly established in 1981 by former french president valery giscard d 'estaing and then-west german chancellor helmut schmidt . stalled process thursday 's accord came after many years in which france had balked at recognizing the alsace-lorraine forced laborers as actual victims of the nazis .
it was finally last year , that president nicolas sarkozy gave the green light to resolve the issue quickly . the alsace-lorraine region straddles part of the border between france and germany , with a unique mix of the two countries ' languages and cultures . last year , german wound up its compensation payments to all surviving nazi regime forced-laborers , paying some 4.4 billion euros to 1.7 million victims in more than 100 countries . dpa news agency -lrb- win -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

" this is my appeal to break out of the spiral of violence .
a lack of dialogue is not an option for the future , " he said after meeting with his georgian counterpart eka tkeshelashvili .
steinmeier , who chairs the so-called group of friends of the united nations ' secretary on georgia , is proposing a three-phase peace plan based on a mutual declaration of non-violence and repatriation of about 25,000 ethnic georgians expelled from abkhazia in the 1990s .
negotiations over the status of the two rebel regions , which have enjoyed de facto autonomy since the end of a civil war in 1994 , was reserved for the final phase of negotiations .
tkeshelashvili said , " the plan has great potential for success , " but added that the most difficult thing would be to convince russia .

" signing of a treaty on the return of georgian refugees to abkhazia is unreal now , because such a return requires a calm situation , " lavrov was quoted as saying by news agency ria-novosti .
" we think that signing a treaty on the non-use of force without any preconditions is an absolutely unavoidable first step , " he added .
experts see little hope for steinmeier 's plan analysts do not expect anything conclusive from steinmeier 's trip , pointing to intransigence on the part of the abkhaz president sergei bagapsh , who said he would " not consider the plan . "
" we are not going to discuss abkhazia 's status with anyone .
we are building an independent , democratic state , " bagapsh was quoted by georgian news agencies as saying .

" this is my appeal to break out of the spiral of violence .
a lack of dialogue is not an option for the future , " he said after meeting with his georgian counterpart eka tkeshelashvili .
steinmeier , who chairs the so-called group of friends of the united nations ' secretary on georgia , is proposing a three-phase peace plan based on a mutual declaration of non-violence and repatriation of about 25,000 ethnic georgians expelled from abkhazia in the 1990s .
negotiations over the status of the two rebel regions , which have enjoyed de facto autonomy since the end of a civil war in 1994 , was reserved for the final phase of negotiations .
tkeshelashvili said , " the plan has great potential for success , " but added that the most difficult thing would be to convince russia .
peace talks remain distant the threat of armed conflict in the region last month has given urgency to international pressure for renewed peace talks , but tbilisi , moscow and the russian-backed regions remain far apart on the basic premises for restarting peace talks .

russia 's foreign minister sergei lavrov was skeptical of peace efforts thursday .
" signing of a treaty on the return of georgian refugees to abkhazia is unreal now , because such a return requires a calm situation , " lavrov was quoted as saying by news agency ria-novosti .
" we think that signing a treaty on the non-use of force without any preconditions is an absolutely unavoidable first step , " he added .
experts see little hope for steinmeier 's plan analysts do not expect anything conclusive from steinmeier 's trip , pointing to intransigence on the part of the abkhaz president sergei bagapsh , who said he would " not consider the plan . "
" we are not going to discuss abkhazia 's status with anyone .
we are building an independent , democratic state , " bagapsh was quoted by georgian news agencies as saying .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de russia -pipe- 17.07.2008 germany to mediate in russia-georgia crisis over abkhazia großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : georgia is increasing its military spending as the specter of war with russia looms amid fears that the abkhazia conflict will escalate into war , german foreign minister frank-walter steinmeier is to mediate this week , beginning a diplomatic swing thursday , july 17 , in the georgian capital tbilisi . steinmeier would then travel to sukhumi , the chief town of the moscow-backed breakaway georgian region of abkhazia , and on to moscow to meet russian foreign minister sergei lavrov , according to foreign ministry deputy spokesman andreas peschke on wednesday .
the german delegation would meet with the de-facto president of the breakaway region , sergei bagapsh , in sukhumi , which is a port city on the black sea .
" the goal of the trip is to find with all the affected parties ways out of the logic of escalation , out of this spiral of constantly escalating incidents .
it is about building trust and creating the specific conditions for a solution that will be acceptable for all , " said peschke .
steinmeier would try to build trust and explore a solution acceptable to all parties .
in tbilisi , he would meet with president mikheil saakashvili and the georgian opposition .
" we 've been in close and regular contact with all parties , " said the spokesman .
russia and georgia are at odds over two regions which separated from georgia in the early 1990s .
bombings and fly-overs up the ante bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : fly-overs by russian jets have increased tensions tensions mounted this month with a series of bombings in abkhazia , the arrest by another separatist republic , south ossetia , of four georgian soldiers and flights over south ossetia by russia 's air force , which moscow says are needed to prevent " bloodshed . "
tbilisi has protested the presence of russian forces in the territories and offers of russian citizenship to their residents as a de facto annexation of its territory .
peschke said berlin had a special responsibility in the conflict .
since 2003 , germany has been coordinator of a panel known as the friends of the united nations secretary general for georgia .
the other members are britain , russia , the united states and france .
german road map dismissed by abkhazia bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : steinmeier 's plan has already been dismissed steinmeier is expected to advocate a three-stage german road-map for peace that has already received a cool reception from the abkhazians . it proposes a year of confidence-building measures , including an end to violence and a return of georgian refugees to abkhazia , with a reconstruction phase to follow .
the third stage would be to resolve the legal status of abkhazia .
the plan to settle the conflict between georgia and abkhazia was rejected out of hand by abkhaz leader sergei bagapsh monday , according to russian media .
steinmeier met with visiting un chief ban ki-moon tuesday and called lavrov and us secretary of state condoleezza rice this week to discuss abkhazia .
lavrov told him that moscow wanted " both sides to accept obligations not to use force , " and for georgian troops to pull out of the strategic kodori gorge in abkhazia , the russian foreign ministry said .
" the russian side stressed that to de-escalate the situation in the conflict zone it is necessary to have the sides accept obligations not to use force , " the ministry said in a statement .
georgia for its part accuses russia of tacit support for the rebels and stoking tensions in both regions .
russia says nato plans increase threat bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : steinmeier and lavrov will hold further talks on georgia lavrov last week held talks in moscow with the separatist leader of abkhazia , sergei bagapsh , and warned afterwards that a plan to bring georgia closer to joining nato would scuttle any peace efforts .
" this could sink a possible resolution " of the crisis , lavrov was quoted as saying by the interfax news agency after meeting bagapsh .
he was referring to us assertions that giving georgia a so-called membership action plan -lrb- map -rrb- for nato membership could help resolve its " frozen conflicts " in abkhazia and south ossetia .
at its latest summit in april , nato shied away from formally granting a map to georgia and another ex-soviet republic near russia , ukraine , amid opposition from germany , france and some other european states .
georgia boosts military spending lawmakers in georgia on tuesday increased army numbers and boosted defense spending in response to " aggressive actions " from russia and as part of a bid to join the nato alliance .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : saakashvili says georgia faces its biggest threat " threat assessment has shown that threats have increased and reached a critical level after russia 's aggressive actions , " givi targamadze , a member of president mikhail saakashvili 's ruling party , said in broadcast comments .
" georgia faces the highest level of threat since independence , " he said .
the 15-percent boost in army numbers from 32,000 to 37,000 " will strengthen our defenses and build an army compatible with the nato criteria , " nicoloz rurua , also from the united national movement party , said earlier .
the parliament , which is dominated by saakashvili 's party , also approved a government proposal to increase defense spending this year by $ 209 million -lrb- 131 million euros -rrb- to around $ 989 million . dw staff -lrb- nda -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

soon , the us will follow the massive investments already made in europe in renewable energy , where thanks to strong government support the solar industry is years ahead of its american counterpart . " before , our only argument was the environment , but now with oil at $ 140 -lrb- 88 euros -rrb- a barrel , i think the much stronger argument will be the pocketbook , " he said .
" that 's why i think solar energy will have a great future in the united states . " no backing from bush one indication of the gulf that separates the two continents is the size of their solar exhibitions .
the german intersolar has been growing at some 30 percent a year .
the recent munich expo attracted more than 1,000 exhibitors and 50,000 attendees from 140 countries . in contrast , the san francisco intersolar has only 200 exhibitors and 12,000 attendees . the major reason for the difference is the scope of government support , or the lack of it in the united states .
under president george w. bush , a former oil company executive , the federal government until recently denied the science of climate change .
vice president dick cheney famously dismissed conservation as a meaningless personal virtue . though the us does offer homeowners a one-time , $ 2,000 federal tax credit for the installation of photo-voltaic systems that convert solar energy into electricity , weber argued that it needed a so-called feed-in tariff to really allow the sector to take off .
such a tariff offers energy producers a guaranteed price for energy that they feed into the grid from renewable sources , and was the key stimulus in boosting the european solar sector . but there are many other factors in play . the next big thing ? for instance , it 's no coincidence that the conference is taking place in san francisco .
the city is the northern anchor of silicon valley , where an ever-increasing pool of venture capital and a growing number of start-ups are chasing the solar dream . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : sunpower corp. ceo thomas warner next to the solar panels on the roof of the sunpower building in san jose many are already predicting a solar boom , akin to the dot-com boom that accompanied the rise of the internet .
some start-ups like nanosolar and solyndra are already valued at more than $ 1 billion before they 've ever made a profit , reflecting the huge growth potential that wall street sees in the solar field . the comparisons to california 's tech industry do not end there .
solar-cell production is a close cousin to the production of computer chips , and there is a constant exchange of personnel , techniques and equipment between the two sectors . " each time we double the volume of production , the cost goes down by 20 percent , " weber said .

soon , the us will follow the massive investments already made in europe in renewable energy , where thanks to strong government support the solar industry is years ahead of its american counterpart . " before , our only argument was the environment , but now with oil at $ 140 -lrb- 88 euros -rrb- a barrel , i think the much stronger argument will be the pocketbook , " he said .
" that 's why i think solar energy will have a great future in the united states . " no backing from bush one indication of the gulf that separates the two continents is the size of their solar exhibitions .
the german intersolar has been growing at some 30 percent a year .
the recent munich expo attracted more than 1,000 exhibitors and 50,000 attendees from 140 countries . in contrast , the san francisco intersolar has only 200 exhibitors and 12,000 attendees . the major reason for the difference is the scope of government support , or the lack of it in the united states .
under president george w. bush , a former oil company executive , the federal government until recently denied the science of climate change .
vice president dick cheney famously dismissed conservation as a meaningless personal virtue . though the us does offer homeowners a one-time , $ 2,000 federal tax credit for the installation of photo-voltaic systems that convert solar energy into electricity , weber argued that it needed a so-called feed-in tariff to really allow the sector to take off .
such a tariff offers energy producers a guaranteed price for energy that they feed into the grid from renewable sources , and was the key stimulus in boosting the european solar sector . but there are many other factors in play . the next big thing ? for instance , it 's no coincidence that the conference is taking place in san francisco .
the city is the northern anchor of silicon valley , where an ever-increasing pool of venture capital and a growing number of start-ups are chasing the solar dream . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : sunpower corp. ceo thomas warner next to the solar panels on the roof of the sunpower building in san jose many are already predicting a solar boom , akin to the dot-com boom that accompanied the rise of the internet .
some start-ups like nanosolar and solyndra are already valued at more than $ 1 billion before they 've ever made a profit , reflecting the huge growth potential that wall street sees in the solar field . the comparisons to california 's tech industry do not end there .
solar-cell production is a close cousin to the production of computer chips , and there is a constant exchange of personnel , techniques and equipment between the two sectors . " each time we double the volume of production , the cost goes down by 20 percent , " weber said .
" at the end of the day , it will be the least expensive energy of all .
we just need a little help to ignite the revolution . " dan martin , who heads semicon west , a trade association of semiconductor manufacturers , believes the same dynamic - that dramatically reduced the price of computer chips while simultaneously increasing their power - will also characterize the solar voltaics sector .

the beleaguered treaty 's future is still in doubt after irish voters rejected it last month . both houses of the british parliament as well as the head of state queen elizabeth ii gave the nod to the reform treaty . all steps for the final ratification were taken and the documents were deposited in rome , where the 1957 treaty of rome for the founding the european economic community was signed . britain was considered a " swing candidate " as far as ratification went .
after ireland rejected the reform treaty in a referendum on june 12 , there were calls among euroskeptics in britain as well for a referendum on the issue . the lisbon treaty , which is designed to streamline decision-making in the expanding bloc , was thrown into limbo after irish voters rejected it in a referendum on june 12 . leaders of the 27-nation bloc are grappling with how to salvage the treaty after the irish " no " vote , since it has to be ratified by all member states to come into force . britain 's parliament passed the treaty on june 18 , and it was given royal assent the next day , despite fierce opposition by the main opposition conservative party and other euroskeptic critics . sarkozy uproar the ratification comes as french president nicolas sarkozy , prepares for a visit to ireland next week , where he will like meet opposition to a proposal he made for ireland to hold another vote on the lisbon treaty , media reports have said . irish foreign affairs minister micheal martin said sarkozy would be in a " listening mode " during his brief trip on monday , and would not be imposing any solutions . " we 're not entertaining any prospect or any bullying from anybody .
we 'll be looking at it from an irish perspective and what 's in the best interests of ireland , " martin said in a radio interview wednesday . french and dutch voters torpedoed the eu constitution by voting against it in popular votes in 2005 .

the german delegation would meet with the de-facto president of the breakaway region , sergei bagapsh , in sukhumi , which is a port city on the black sea .
" the goal of the trip is to find with all the affected parties ways out of the logic of escalation , out of this spiral of constantly escalating incidents .
it is about building trust and creating the specific conditions for a solution that will be acceptable for all , " said peschke .
steinmeier would try to build trust and explore a solution acceptable to all parties .
in tbilisi , he would meet with president mikheil saakashvili and the georgian opposition .
" we 've been in close and regular contact with all parties , " said the spokesman .
russia and georgia are at odds over two regions which separated from georgia in the early 1990s .
bombings and fly-overs up the ante bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : fly-overs by russian jets have increased tensions tensions mounted this month with a series of bombings in abkhazia , the arrest by another separatist republic , south ossetia , of four georgian soldiers and flights over south ossetia by russia 's air force , which moscow says are needed to prevent " bloodshed . "
tbilisi has protested the presence of russian forces in the territories and offers of russian citizenship to their residents as a de facto annexation of its territory .
peschke said berlin had a special responsibility in the conflict .
since 2003 , germany has been coordinator of a panel known as the friends of the united nations secretary general for georgia .
the other members are britain , russia , the united states and france .
german road map dismissed by abkhazia bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : steinmeier 's plan has already been dismissed steinmeier is expected to advocate a three-stage german road-map for peace that has already received a cool reception from the abkhazians . it proposes a year of confidence-building measures , including an end to violence and a return of georgian refugees to abkhazia , with a reconstruction phase to follow .
the third stage would be to resolve the legal status of abkhazia .
the plan to settle the conflict between georgia and abkhazia was rejected out of hand by abkhaz leader sergei bagapsh monday , according to russian media .
steinmeier met with visiting un chief ban ki-moon tuesday and called lavrov and us secretary of state condoleezza rice this week to discuss abkhazia .
lavrov told him that moscow wanted " both sides to accept obligations not to use force , " and for georgian troops to pull out of the strategic kodori gorge in abkhazia , the russian foreign ministry said .
" the russian side stressed that to de-escalate the situation in the conflict zone it is necessary to have the sides accept obligations not to use force , " the ministry said in a statement .
georgia for its part accuses russia of tacit support for the rebels and stoking tensions in both regions .
russia says nato plans increase threat bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : steinmeier and lavrov will hold further talks on georgia lavrov last week held talks in moscow with the separatist leader of abkhazia , sergei bagapsh , and warned afterwards that a plan to bring georgia closer to joining nato would scuttle any peace efforts .
" this could sink a possible resolution " of the crisis , lavrov was quoted as saying by the interfax news agency after meeting bagapsh .
he was referring to us assertions that giving georgia a so-called membership action plan -lrb- map -rrb- for nato membership could help resolve its " frozen conflicts " in abkhazia and south ossetia .
at its latest summit in april , nato shied away from formally granting a map to georgia and another ex-soviet republic near russia , ukraine , amid opposition from germany , france and some other european states .
georgia boosts military spending lawmakers in georgia on tuesday increased army numbers and boosted defense spending in response to " aggressive actions " from russia and as part of a bid to join the nato alliance .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : saakashvili says georgia faces its biggest threat " threat assessment has shown that threats have increased and reached a critical level after russia 's aggressive actions , " givi targamadze , a member of president mikhail saakashvili 's ruling party , said in broadcast comments .

but the changes do n't go far enough , says deutsche welle 's sabine kinkartz . imagine that you 're highly qualified .
you 've completed your studies and gotten the best grades , you 've been working for a couple of years as an engineer , a process technician or an it specialist , you 've done additional training , fine-tuned your skills and are earning good money . maybe you ’ ve started a family and found friends .
in short - you 're feeling good and have found your place in life , wherever it may be .
what could bring you to give up all this , immigrate to germany and work here ?
ca n't think of anything ?
i can understand . but germany 's federal government does n't .
it still hopes that it can lure highly skilled people with a university degree to germany in large numbers .
it 's an old hope that 's been disappointed so far : in 2006 , only 456 highly qualified people received permanent residence status - 10 fewer than last year . minimum salary the minimum salary requirement is the biggest hurdle .
anyone who wants to come here without fulfilling any other requirements has to be able to prove that he or she is earning a hefty salary - in the future , it 'll still be twice the amount of an average german salary . but who earns that much and more ?
senior specialists and not young , highly qualified graduates at the beginning of their careers .
the latter , however , are the ones being sought by industry here , because they are still flexible . that 's why the new action program to secure the supply of specialists has business leaders shaking their heads . a system that does n't take into account the needs of the german labor market and an applicant 's ability to integrate can not work . in the it sector , every second company is saying that business is down because vacant positions can not be filled .
the association of german engineers says that there are 96,000 jobs available - twice as many as four years ago . politicians not listening the government hears what the business community is saying - but it does n't really want to listen .
the labor minister says that the lack of skilled workers ca n't be as bad as the industry is saying .
at the same time , he admits that he does n't really know what the situation is like .
why should he ?
in the end , he 's more concerned with protecting rather than opening the labor market .
germany has three million unemployed people - a long-time social democrat can not open borders under such circumstances ! other states do exactly that and are way ahead when it comes to competing for the world 's smartest heads .
the netherlands , for example , has adjusted the minimum salary requirements to be in line with those of skilled local professional beginners . plenty of choices the german labor market on the other hand is only opening up for those who do n't have to work in germany .
it 's opening up for people so highly qualified that they can decide whether they want to stay in their own countries or - if they 're from india , china or south america - would n't rather go to english-speaking countries such as australia , britain , canada or the us , where the will have to worry less about resentment . the new immigration measures taken by the federal government are a step in the right direction .
but they 're miles away from reaching the target . sabine kinkartz is dw-radio 's business correspondent in berlin . -lrb- win -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

but the changes do n't go far enough , says deutsche welle 's sabine kinkartz . imagine that you 're highly qualified .
you 've completed your studies and gotten the best grades , you 've been working for a couple of years as an engineer , a process technician or an it specialist , you 've done additional training , fine-tuned your skills and are earning good money . maybe you ’ ve started a family and found friends .
in short - you 're feeling good and have found your place in life , wherever it may be .
what could bring you to give up all this , immigrate to germany and work here ?
ca n't think of anything ?
i can understand . but germany 's federal government does n't .
it still hopes that it can lure highly skilled people with a university degree to germany in large numbers .
it 's an old hope that 's been disappointed so far : in 2006 , only 456 highly qualified people received permanent residence status - 10 fewer than last year . minimum salary the minimum salary requirement is the biggest hurdle .
anyone who wants to come here without fulfilling any other requirements has to be able to prove that he or she is earning a hefty salary - in the future , it 'll still be twice the amount of an average german salary . but who earns that much and more ?
senior specialists and not young , highly qualified graduates at the beginning of their careers .
the latter , however , are the ones being sought by industry here , because they are still flexible . that 's why the new action program to secure the supply of specialists has business leaders shaking their heads . a system that does n't take into account the needs of the german labor market and an applicant 's ability to integrate can not work . in the it sector , every second company is saying that business is down because vacant positions can not be filled .
the association of german engineers says that there are 96,000 jobs available - twice as many as four years ago . politicians not listening the government hears what the business community is saying - but it does n't really want to listen .
the labor minister says that the lack of skilled workers ca n't be as bad as the industry is saying .
at the same time , he admits that he does n't really know what the situation is like .
why should he ?
in the end , he 's more concerned with protecting rather than opening the labor market .
germany has three million unemployed people - a long-time social democrat can not open borders under such circumstances ! other states do exactly that and are way ahead when it comes to competing for the world 's smartest heads .
the netherlands , for example , has adjusted the minimum salary requirements to be in line with those of skilled local professional beginners . plenty of choices the german labor market on the other hand is only opening up for those who do n't have to work in germany .
it 's opening up for people so highly qualified that they can decide whether they want to stay in their own countries or - if they 're from india , china or south america - would n't rather go to english-speaking countries such as australia , britain , canada or the us , where the will have to worry less about resentment . the new immigration measures taken by the federal government are a step in the right direction .
but they 're miles away from reaching the target . sabine kinkartz is dw-radio 's business correspondent in berlin . -lrb- win -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

but the changes do n't go far enough , says deutsche welle 's sabine kinkartz . imagine that you 're highly qualified .
you 've completed your studies and gotten the best grades , you 've been working for a couple of years as an engineer , a process technician or an it specialist , you 've done additional training , fine-tuned your skills and are earning good money . maybe you ’ ve started a family and found friends .
in short - you 're feeling good and have found your place in life , wherever it may be .
what could bring you to give up all this , immigrate to germany and work here ?
ca n't think of anything ?
i can understand . but germany 's federal government does n't .
it still hopes that it can lure highly skilled people with a university degree to germany in large numbers .
it 's an old hope that 's been disappointed so far : in 2006 , only 456 highly qualified people received permanent residence status - 10 fewer than last year . minimum salary the minimum salary requirement is the biggest hurdle .
anyone who wants to come here without fulfilling any other requirements has to be able to prove that he or she is earning a hefty salary - in the future , it 'll still be twice the amount of an average german salary . but who earns that much and more ?
senior specialists and not young , highly qualified graduates at the beginning of their careers .
the latter , however , are the ones being sought by industry here , because they are still flexible . that 's why the new action program to secure the supply of specialists has business leaders shaking their heads . a system that does n't take into account the needs of the german labor market and an applicant 's ability to integrate can not work . in the it sector , every second company is saying that business is down because vacant positions can not be filled .
the association of german engineers says that there are 96,000 jobs available - twice as many as four years ago . politicians not listening the government hears what the business community is saying - but it does n't really want to listen .
the labor minister says that the lack of skilled workers ca n't be as bad as the industry is saying .
at the same time , he admits that he does n't really know what the situation is like .
why should he ?
in the end , he 's more concerned with protecting rather than opening the labor market .
germany has three million unemployed people - a long-time social democrat can not open borders under such circumstances ! other states do exactly that and are way ahead when it comes to competing for the world 's smartest heads .
the netherlands , for example , has adjusted the minimum salary requirements to be in line with those of skilled local professional beginners . plenty of choices the german labor market on the other hand is only opening up for those who do n't have to work in germany .
it 's opening up for people so highly qualified that they can decide whether they want to stay in their own countries or - if they 're from india , china or south america - would n't rather go to english-speaking countries such as australia , britain , canada or the us , where the will have to worry less about resentment . the new immigration measures taken by the federal government are a step in the right direction .
but they 're miles away from reaching the target . sabine kinkartz is dw-radio 's business correspondent in berlin . -lrb- win -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

but the changes do n't go far enough , says deutsche welle 's sabine kinkartz . imagine that you 're highly qualified .
you 've completed your studies and gotten the best grades , you 've been working for a couple of years as an engineer , a process technician or an it specialist , you 've done additional training , fine-tuned your skills and are earning good money . maybe you ’ ve started a family and found friends .
in short - you 're feeling good and have found your place in life , wherever it may be .
what could bring you to give up all this , immigrate to germany and work here ?
ca n't think of anything ?
i can understand . but germany 's federal government does n't .
it still hopes that it can lure highly skilled people with a university degree to germany in large numbers .
it 's an old hope that 's been disappointed so far : in 2006 , only 456 highly qualified people received permanent residence status - 10 fewer than last year . minimum salary the minimum salary requirement is the biggest hurdle .
anyone who wants to come here without fulfilling any other requirements has to be able to prove that he or she is earning a hefty salary - in the future , it 'll still be twice the amount of an average german salary . but who earns that much and more ?
senior specialists and not young , highly qualified graduates at the beginning of their careers .
the latter , however , are the ones being sought by industry here , because they are still flexible . that 's why the new action program to secure the supply of specialists has business leaders shaking their heads . a system that does n't take into account the needs of the german labor market and an applicant 's ability to integrate can not work . in the it sector , every second company is saying that business is down because vacant positions can not be filled .
the association of german engineers says that there are 96,000 jobs available - twice as many as four years ago . politicians not listening the government hears what the business community is saying - but it does n't really want to listen .
the labor minister says that the lack of skilled workers ca n't be as bad as the industry is saying .
at the same time , he admits that he does n't really know what the situation is like .
why should he ?
in the end , he 's more concerned with protecting rather than opening the labor market .
germany has three million unemployed people - a long-time social democrat can not open borders under such circumstances ! other states do exactly that and are way ahead when it comes to competing for the world 's smartest heads .
the netherlands , for example , has adjusted the minimum salary requirements to be in line with those of skilled local professional beginners . plenty of choices the german labor market on the other hand is only opening up for those who do n't have to work in germany .
it 's opening up for people so highly qualified that they can decide whether they want to stay in their own countries or - if they 're from india , china or south america - would n't rather go to english-speaking countries such as australia , britain , canada or the us , where the will have to worry less about resentment . the new immigration measures taken by the federal government are a step in the right direction .
but they 're miles away from reaching the target . sabine kinkartz is dw-radio 's business correspondent in berlin . -lrb- win -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

while originally supporting the idea , the city 's mayor is now not so certain any more that the winning design is the best one to build . the city is home to the oldest jewish community north of the alps and still has significant remains of the old jewish quarter , including the ruins of a mikwe , or ritual bath , just in front of cologne 's city hall . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the mikwe in front of city hall can be seen through a glass pyramid that 's why this particular spot was also chosen as the location of a future museum .
a design by saarbruecken-based architectural firm wandel hoefer lorch was overwhelmingly chosen by an expert jury . it all happened so quickly that members of the private foundation planning to pay for the construction said that it had n't collected any of the 20 million euros -lrb- $ 31.7 million -rrb- needed . they might not have to hurry . while cologne 's conservative mayor fritz schramma had originally voiced enthusiastic support for the plan , he 's since backed away from it . too massive ? bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : schramma supports the museum idea in general schramma says that he 's concerned that the new building would be too massive for the square in front of city hall .
the mayor now wants to give residents a chance to review all of the designs that were entered in the competition and then vote on them . while not accusing the mayor of anti-semitism , jewish leaders criticized schramma for giving in to concerns by others , including a neighboring arts museum . " there are rumors that the wallraf richartz museum is n't happy with the design , " salomon korn , a vice president of the central council of jews in germany , who sat on the selection jury , told german public radio deutschlandradio . an authentic place bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : korn thinks the square at city hall would be the best place korn , who is an architect himself , said that the winning design is far from massive and would actually return the space closer to its original state before buildings there were destroyed during world war ii . he also said that it made little sense to move the museum elsewhere , since the location in front of city hall was the historic site of germany 's jewish community and could therefore become a " crystallization core for remembrance . " " there 's only one authentic place " for the museum , korn said . dw staff -lrb- win -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

" rome should provide a signal that crimes such as genocide , crimes against humanity , war crimes and crimes of aggression will in the future no longer go unpunished , " said the head of the german delegation in rome , gerd westdickenberg . the fundamental idea that emerged from the rome conference was that every country should pass laws that would require even high-ranking politicians and military officials to answer charges of human rights abuses before a court . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : luis moreno ocampo the icc , which was launched in 2002 , is based on the theory that such people could be extradited to a standing international court if a country 's own justice system was not capable of prosecuting them . " we 're a backup system , " said the icc 's lead prosecutor luis moreno-ocampo .
" we 're not a supreme court of the world . " several countries have since passed laws that allow war crimes , even genocide , to be prosecuted in national courts .

" as the united states works to bring peace around the whole world , our diplomats and our soldiers could be dragged into this court , " bush said .
" and that 's very troubling to me .
we 'll try to work out the impasse at the united nations but one thing we 're not going to do is sign on to the international criminal court . " bush has shown no interest in following germany 's example and passing laws that would make war crimes a punishable offense .
instead , he has tried to weaken the icc by establishing non-extradition agreements with individual nations regarding american citizens . those are linked with threats to withhold military aid for the land if such deals are not made .
he has had some success with this strategy . growing credibility bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : judges of the international criminal court at the start of a hearing in the meantime , the row over the icc between critics of the rome statute , such as washington , and its biggest proponents , who are mostly in europe , has gotten quieter .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de russia -pipe- 17.07.2008 germany to mediate in russia-georgia crisis over abkhazia großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : georgia is increasing its military spending as the specter of war with russia looms amid fears that the abkhazia conflict will escalate into war , german foreign minister frank-walter steinmeier is to mediate this week , beginning a diplomatic swing thursday , july 17 , in the georgian capital tbilisi . steinmeier would then travel to sukhumi , the chief town of the moscow-backed breakaway georgian region of abkhazia , and on to moscow to meet russian foreign minister sergei lavrov , according to foreign ministry deputy spokesman andreas peschke on wednesday .
the german delegation would meet with the de-facto president of the breakaway region , sergei bagapsh , in sukhumi , which is a port city on the black sea .
" the goal of the trip is to find with all the affected parties ways out of the logic of escalation , out of this spiral of constantly escalating incidents .
it is about building trust and creating the specific conditions for a solution that will be acceptable for all , " said peschke .
steinmeier would try to build trust and explore a solution acceptable to all parties .
in tbilisi , he would meet with president mikheil saakashvili and the georgian opposition .
" we 've been in close and regular contact with all parties , " said the spokesman .
russia and georgia are at odds over two regions which separated from georgia in the early 1990s .
bombings and fly-overs up the ante bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : fly-overs by russian jets have increased tensions tensions mounted this month with a series of bombings in abkhazia , the arrest by another separatist republic , south ossetia , of four georgian soldiers and flights over south ossetia by russia 's air force , which moscow says are needed to prevent " bloodshed . "
tbilisi has protested the presence of russian forces in the territories and offers of russian citizenship to their residents as a de facto annexation of its territory .
peschke said berlin had a special responsibility in the conflict .
since 2003 , germany has been coordinator of a panel known as the friends of the united nations secretary general for georgia .
the other members are britain , russia , the united states and france .
german road map dismissed by abkhazia bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : steinmeier 's plan has already been dismissed steinmeier is expected to advocate a three-stage german road-map for peace that has already received a cool reception from the abkhazians . it proposes a year of confidence-building measures , including an end to violence and a return of georgian refugees to abkhazia , with a reconstruction phase to follow .
the third stage would be to resolve the legal status of abkhazia .
the plan to settle the conflict between georgia and abkhazia was rejected out of hand by abkhaz leader sergei bagapsh monday , according to russian media .
steinmeier met with visiting un chief ban ki-moon tuesday and called lavrov and us secretary of state condoleezza rice this week to discuss abkhazia .
lavrov told him that moscow wanted " both sides to accept obligations not to use force , " and for georgian troops to pull out of the strategic kodori gorge in abkhazia , the russian foreign ministry said .
" the russian side stressed that to de-escalate the situation in the conflict zone it is necessary to have the sides accept obligations not to use force , " the ministry said in a statement .
georgia for its part accuses russia of tacit support for the rebels and stoking tensions in both regions .
russia says nato plans increase threat bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : steinmeier and lavrov will hold further talks on georgia lavrov last week held talks in moscow with the separatist leader of abkhazia , sergei bagapsh , and warned afterwards that a plan to bring georgia closer to joining nato would scuttle any peace efforts .
" this could sink a possible resolution " of the crisis , lavrov was quoted as saying by the interfax news agency after meeting bagapsh .
he was referring to us assertions that giving georgia a so-called membership action plan -lrb- map -rrb- for nato membership could help resolve its " frozen conflicts " in abkhazia and south ossetia .
at its latest summit in april , nato shied away from formally granting a map to georgia and another ex-soviet republic near russia , ukraine , amid opposition from germany , france and some other european states .
georgia boosts military spending lawmakers in georgia on tuesday increased army numbers and boosted defense spending in response to " aggressive actions " from russia and as part of a bid to join the nato alliance .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : saakashvili says georgia faces its biggest threat " threat assessment has shown that threats have increased and reached a critical level after russia 's aggressive actions , " givi targamadze , a member of president mikhail saakashvili 's ruling party , said in broadcast comments .
" georgia faces the highest level of threat since independence , " he said .
the 15-percent boost in army numbers from 32,000 to 37,000 " will strengthen our defenses and build an army compatible with the nato criteria , " nicoloz rurua , also from the united national movement party , said earlier .
the parliament , which is dominated by saakashvili 's party , also approved a government proposal to increase defense spending this year by $ 209 million -lrb- 131 million euros -rrb- to around $ 989 million . dw staff -lrb- nda -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

" rome should provide a signal that crimes such as genocide , crimes against humanity , war crimes and crimes of aggression will in the future no longer go unpunished , " said the head of the german delegation in rome , gerd westdickenberg . the fundamental idea that emerged from the rome conference was that every country should pass laws that would require even high-ranking politicians and military officials to answer charges of human rights abuses before a court . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : luis moreno ocampo the icc , which was launched in 2002 , is based on the theory that such people could be extradited to a standing international court if a country 's own justice system was not capable of prosecuting them . " we 're a backup system , " said the icc 's lead prosecutor luis moreno-ocampo .
" we 're not a supreme court of the world . " several countries have since passed laws that allow war crimes , even genocide , to be prosecuted in national courts .
germany passed its own legislation in 2002 that regulated crimes against public international law to bring its own laws into accordance with the rome statue .
indirectly , it prevents german citizens from being taken in front of the icc . refusing to sign but those who support an international court which steps in when national courts can not , or will not , are distressed by the refusal of those countries that refused to sign the treaty . these are not a few small nations run by dictators , but major world players such as the united states and india .
china and russia have also withheld their signatures . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : sudan and the situation in darfur is now a concern of the icc even today , us president george w. bush has shown no sign of reconsidering his refusal to sign the rome statute and in a move almost unique in legal history , even withdrew american support after it had been given . the administration of previous president bill clinton had signed the treaty in its last days in office so that it could take part in consultations on details of the court . but in 2002 , washington " unsigned " the treaty , arguing that the court could create havoc for the united states , exposing american soldiers and officials overseas to capricious and mischievous prosecutions . " as the united states works to bring peace around the whole world , our diplomats and our soldiers could be dragged into this court , " bush said .
" and that 's very troubling to me .
we 'll try to work out the impasse at the united nations but one thing we 're not going to do is sign on to the international criminal court . " bush has shown no interest in following germany 's example and passing laws that would make war crimes a punishable offense .
instead , he has tried to weaken the icc by establishing non-extradition agreements with individual nations regarding american citizens . those are linked with threats to withhold military aid for the land if such deals are not made .
he has had some success with this strategy . growing credibility bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : judges of the international criminal court at the start of a hearing in the meantime , the row over the icc between critics of the rome statute , such as washington , and its biggest proponents , who are mostly in europe , has gotten quieter .
that has something to do with the fact that the court is busy for now with cases in the democratic republic of congo , uganda , the central african republic and darfur . " i had to choose the cases according to gravity .
and the gravest cases happened in africa , " said prosecutor moreno-ocampo . but as the icc continues its work to bring those who commit grave human rights abuses to justice , new york-based political analyst jeff laurenti believes it is gaining credibility around the globe , despite the vocal critics . " the court will be proving itself despite the bush administration 's knee-jerk hostility , " he said .
" that creates the opportunity to demonstrate that the paranoia about the icc that has been propagated by the right wing is unjustified and misplaced . " a change in washington 's attitude could be developing .
when the un security council referred the case of darfur and sudanese president omar hassan al-bashir to the hague , the us could have vetoed the move , but did n't .
instead , it just stayed silent . dw staff -lrb- jam -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

it 's also trying to make a name for itself in the fashion world , although it 's proving to be an uphill road . proponents of berlin as a emerging fashion metropolis say it 's beginning to come into its own , and in addition to the small , one-room fashion start-ups run by young people in their 20s , well-known designers are also coming to the german capital to present their collections , even if it 's usually their secondary lines . vivienne westwood will show her number two line " anglomania " this week and bigger german labels " hugo , " " joop jeans " and " strenesse blue " are showing their 2009 spring and summer collections . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : from the fall / winter 2008/2009 collection of the label strenesse blue " we think berlin will gain importance as a fashion city , just because of the location , " mercedes-benz fashion week spokeswoman nora rochlitzer told the koelner stadt-anzeiger daily .

the beleaguered treaty 's future is still in doubt after irish voters rejected it last month . both houses of the british parliament as well as the head of state queen elizabeth ii gave the nod to the reform treaty . all steps for the final ratification were taken and the documents were deposited in rome , where the 1957 treaty of rome for the founding the european economic community was signed . britain was considered a " swing candidate " as far as ratification went .
after ireland rejected the reform treaty in a referendum on june 12 , there were calls among euroskeptics in britain as well for a referendum on the issue . the lisbon treaty , which is designed to streamline decision-making in the expanding bloc , was thrown into limbo after irish voters rejected it in a referendum on june 12 . leaders of the 27-nation bloc are grappling with how to salvage the treaty after the irish " no " vote , since it has to be ratified by all member states to come into force . britain 's parliament passed the treaty on june 18 , and it was given royal assent the next day , despite fierce opposition by the main opposition conservative party and other euroskeptic critics . sarkozy uproar the ratification comes as french president nicolas sarkozy , prepares for a visit to ireland next week , where he will like meet opposition to a proposal he made for ireland to hold another vote on the lisbon treaty , media reports have said . irish foreign affairs minister micheal martin said sarkozy would be in a " listening mode " during his brief trip on monday , and would not be imposing any solutions .

it 's also trying to make a name for itself in the fashion world , although it 's proving to be an uphill road . proponents of berlin as a emerging fashion metropolis say it 's beginning to come into its own , and in addition to the small , one-room fashion start-ups run by young people in their 20s , well-known designers are also coming to the german capital to present their collections , even if it 's usually their secondary lines . vivienne westwood will show her number two line " anglomania " this week and bigger german labels " hugo , " " joop jeans " and " strenesse blue " are showing their 2009 spring and summer collections . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : from the fall / winter 2008/2009 collection of the label strenesse blue " we think berlin will gain importance as a fashion city , just because of the location , " mercedes-benz fashion week spokeswoman nora rochlitzer told the koelner stadt-anzeiger daily .
" berlin is in the center of europe and from here we can conquer anything , even eastern europe . " the capital will be dotted with smaller venues which will show off work from younger designers , such as the 120 who have been invited to a series of small storefronts in berlin 's largely immigrant wedding district . " we do n't want to withdraw and drink champagne , but celebrate with our neighbors , " said christoph steinweg , the organizer of " wedding dress 3 . " larger stores , like the galeries lafayette department store in downtown berlin , are showing off the collections of 13 well known berlin labels , such as c.neeon , von wedel & tiedeken and pulver . lots of creativity , little commerce but while germany is strong when it comes to creative potential , with its lively arts and fashion scene , it 's the business aspect of things that is lacking , experts say . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : berlin 's got the creative spirit , but fashion business is still done in duesseldorf " berlin does n't have any commercial dimension , " said thomas rasch , director of the german fashion association germany fashion .

the beleaguered treaty 's future is still in doubt after irish voters rejected it last month . both houses of the british parliament as well as the head of state queen elizabeth ii gave the nod to the reform treaty . all steps for the final ratification were taken and the documents were deposited in rome , where the 1957 treaty of rome for the founding the european economic community was signed . britain was considered a " swing candidate " as far as ratification went .
after ireland rejected the reform treaty in a referendum on june 12 , there were calls among euroskeptics in britain as well for a referendum on the issue . the lisbon treaty , which is designed to streamline decision-making in the expanding bloc , was thrown into limbo after irish voters rejected it in a referendum on june 12 . leaders of the 27-nation bloc are grappling with how to salvage the treaty after the irish " no " vote , since it has to be ratified by all member states to come into force . britain 's parliament passed the treaty on june 18 , and it was given royal assent the next day , despite fierce opposition by the main opposition conservative party and other euroskeptic critics . sarkozy uproar the ratification comes as french president nicolas sarkozy , prepares for a visit to ireland next week , where he will like meet opposition to a proposal he made for ireland to hold another vote on the lisbon treaty , media reports have said . irish foreign affairs minister micheal martin said sarkozy would be in a " listening mode " during his brief trip on monday , and would not be imposing any solutions . " we 're not entertaining any prospect or any bullying from anybody .
we 'll be looking at it from an irish perspective and what 's in the best interests of ireland , " martin said in a radio interview wednesday . french and dutch voters torpedoed the eu constitution by voting against it in popular votes in 2005 .
the lisbon treaty replaced it , but critics say it is basically the same document with a different name . dpa news agency -lrb- jam -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

" rome should provide a signal that crimes such as genocide , crimes against humanity , war crimes and crimes of aggression will in the future no longer go unpunished , " said the head of the german delegation in rome , gerd westdickenberg . the fundamental idea that emerged from the rome conference was that every country should pass laws that would require even high-ranking politicians and military officials to answer charges of human rights abuses before a court . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : luis moreno ocampo the icc , which was launched in 2002 , is based on the theory that such people could be extradited to a standing international court if a country 's own justice system was not capable of prosecuting them . " we 're a backup system , " said the icc 's lead prosecutor luis moreno-ocampo .
" we 're not a supreme court of the world . " several countries have since passed laws that allow war crimes , even genocide , to be prosecuted in national courts .

" as the united states works to bring peace around the whole world , our diplomats and our soldiers could be dragged into this court , " bush said .
" and that 's very troubling to me .
we 'll try to work out the impasse at the united nations but one thing we 're not going to do is sign on to the international criminal court . " bush has shown no interest in following germany 's example and passing laws that would make war crimes a punishable offense .
instead , he has tried to weaken the icc by establishing non-extradition agreements with individual nations regarding american citizens . those are linked with threats to withhold military aid for the land if such deals are not made .
he has had some success with this strategy . growing credibility bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : judges of the international criminal court at the start of a hearing in the meantime , the row over the icc between critics of the rome statute , such as washington , and its biggest proponents , who are mostly in europe , has gotten quieter .
that has something to do with the fact that the court is busy for now with cases in the democratic republic of congo , uganda , the central african republic and darfur . " i had to choose the cases according to gravity .
and the gravest cases happened in africa , " said prosecutor moreno-ocampo . but as the icc continues its work to bring those who commit grave human rights abuses to justice , new york-based political analyst jeff laurenti believes it is gaining credibility around the globe , despite the vocal critics . " the court will be proving itself despite the bush administration 's knee-jerk hostility , " he said .
" that creates the opportunity to demonstrate that the paranoia about the icc that has been propagated by the right wing is unjustified and misplaced . " a change in washington 's attitude could be developing .
when the un security council referred the case of darfur and sudanese president omar hassan al-bashir to the hague , the us could have vetoed the move , but did n't .

the beleaguered treaty 's future is still in doubt after irish voters rejected it last month . both houses of the british parliament as well as the head of state queen elizabeth ii gave the nod to the reform treaty . all steps for the final ratification were taken and the documents were deposited in rome , where the 1957 treaty of rome for the founding the european economic community was signed . britain was considered a " swing candidate " as far as ratification went .
after ireland rejected the reform treaty in a referendum on june 12 , there were calls among euroskeptics in britain as well for a referendum on the issue . the lisbon treaty , which is designed to streamline decision-making in the expanding bloc , was thrown into limbo after irish voters rejected it in a referendum on june 12 . leaders of the 27-nation bloc are grappling with how to salvage the treaty after the irish " no " vote , since it has to be ratified by all member states to come into force . britain 's parliament passed the treaty on june 18 , and it was given royal assent the next day , despite fierce opposition by the main opposition conservative party and other euroskeptic critics . sarkozy uproar the ratification comes as french president nicolas sarkozy , prepares for a visit to ireland next week , where he will like meet opposition to a proposal he made for ireland to hold another vote on the lisbon treaty , media reports have said . irish foreign affairs minister micheal martin said sarkozy would be in a " listening mode " during his brief trip on monday , and would not be imposing any solutions . " we 're not entertaining any prospect or any bullying from anybody .
we 'll be looking at it from an irish perspective and what 's in the best interests of ireland , " martin said in a radio interview wednesday . french and dutch voters torpedoed the eu constitution by voting against it in popular votes in 2005 .
the lisbon treaty replaced it , but critics say it is basically the same document with a different name . dpa news agency -lrb- jam -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

but the changes do n't go far enough , says deutsche welle 's sabine kinkartz . imagine that you 're highly qualified .
you 've completed your studies and gotten the best grades , you 've been working for a couple of years as an engineer , a process technician or an it specialist , you 've done additional training , fine-tuned your skills and are earning good money . maybe you ’ ve started a family and found friends .
in short - you 're feeling good and have found your place in life , wherever it may be .
what could bring you to give up all this , immigrate to germany and work here ?
ca n't think of anything ?
i can understand . but germany 's federal government does n't .
it still hopes that it can lure highly skilled people with a university degree to germany in large numbers .
it 's an old hope that 's been disappointed so far : in 2006 , only 456 highly qualified people received permanent residence status - 10 fewer than last year . minimum salary the minimum salary requirement is the biggest hurdle .
anyone who wants to come here without fulfilling any other requirements has to be able to prove that he or she is earning a hefty salary - in the future , it 'll still be twice the amount of an average german salary . but who earns that much and more ?
senior specialists and not young , highly qualified graduates at the beginning of their careers .
the latter , however , are the ones being sought by industry here , because they are still flexible . that 's why the new action program to secure the supply of specialists has business leaders shaking their heads . a system that does n't take into account the needs of the german labor market and an applicant 's ability to integrate can not work . in the it sector , every second company is saying that business is down because vacant positions can not be filled .
the association of german engineers says that there are 96,000 jobs available - twice as many as four years ago . politicians not listening the government hears what the business community is saying - but it does n't really want to listen .
the labor minister says that the lack of skilled workers ca n't be as bad as the industry is saying .
at the same time , he admits that he does n't really know what the situation is like .
why should he ?
in the end , he 's more concerned with protecting rather than opening the labor market .
germany has three million unemployed people - a long-time social democrat can not open borders under such circumstances ! other states do exactly that and are way ahead when it comes to competing for the world 's smartest heads .
the netherlands , for example , has adjusted the minimum salary requirements to be in line with those of skilled local professional beginners . plenty of choices the german labor market on the other hand is only opening up for those who do n't have to work in germany .
it 's opening up for people so highly qualified that they can decide whether they want to stay in their own countries or - if they 're from india , china or south america - would n't rather go to english-speaking countries such as australia , britain , canada or the us , where the will have to worry less about resentment . the new immigration measures taken by the federal government are a step in the right direction .

but the changes do n't go far enough , says deutsche welle 's sabine kinkartz . imagine that you 're highly qualified .
you 've completed your studies and gotten the best grades , you 've been working for a couple of years as an engineer , a process technician or an it specialist , you 've done additional training , fine-tuned your skills and are earning good money . maybe you ’ ve started a family and found friends .
in short - you 're feeling good and have found your place in life , wherever it may be .
what could bring you to give up all this , immigrate to germany and work here ?
ca n't think of anything ?
i can understand . but germany 's federal government does n't .
it still hopes that it can lure highly skilled people with a university degree to germany in large numbers .
it 's an old hope that 's been disappointed so far : in 2006 , only 456 highly qualified people received permanent residence status - 10 fewer than last year . minimum salary the minimum salary requirement is the biggest hurdle .
anyone who wants to come here without fulfilling any other requirements has to be able to prove that he or she is earning a hefty salary - in the future , it 'll still be twice the amount of an average german salary . but who earns that much and more ?
senior specialists and not young , highly qualified graduates at the beginning of their careers .
the latter , however , are the ones being sought by industry here , because they are still flexible . that 's why the new action program to secure the supply of specialists has business leaders shaking their heads . a system that does n't take into account the needs of the german labor market and an applicant 's ability to integrate can not work . in the it sector , every second company is saying that business is down because vacant positions can not be filled .
the association of german engineers says that there are 96,000 jobs available - twice as many as four years ago . politicians not listening the government hears what the business community is saying - but it does n't really want to listen .
the labor minister says that the lack of skilled workers ca n't be as bad as the industry is saying .
at the same time , he admits that he does n't really know what the situation is like .
why should he ?
in the end , he 's more concerned with protecting rather than opening the labor market .
germany has three million unemployed people - a long-time social democrat can not open borders under such circumstances ! other states do exactly that and are way ahead when it comes to competing for the world 's smartest heads .
the netherlands , for example , has adjusted the minimum salary requirements to be in line with those of skilled local professional beginners . plenty of choices the german labor market on the other hand is only opening up for those who do n't have to work in germany .
it 's opening up for people so highly qualified that they can decide whether they want to stay in their own countries or - if they 're from india , china or south america - would n't rather go to english-speaking countries such as australia , britain , canada or the us , where the will have to worry less about resentment . the new immigration measures taken by the federal government are a step in the right direction .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de energy -pipe- 17.07.2008 german expert predicts us solar energy boom großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : this might soon be a common sight in the us , according to some the us might still lag behind in promoting alternative energies , but at least one german expert is convinced that this is bound to change in the very near future . there 's something incongruous about experts from normally cloudy germany coming to california , the land of eternal sunshine , to teach the locals about how to harness solar power . but that 's was happening this week in san francisco , where organizers of the world 's largest solar exhibition , germany 's intersolar , launched an american version of their confab amid predictions of a massive solar boom in the ailing us economy . conference chairman professor eicke weber , director of the fraunhofer institute for solar energy systems , insists that it makes perfect sense for germans to bring their solar accumen to the golden state . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : americans are already beginning to cut back on their driving habits as soaring fuel costs combine with rapidly changing public perceptions about the dangers of climate change , the us embrace of solar power is at a tipping point , he predicts .
soon , the us will follow the massive investments already made in europe in renewable energy , where thanks to strong government support the solar industry is years ahead of its american counterpart . " before , our only argument was the environment , but now with oil at $ 140 -lrb- 88 euros -rrb- a barrel , i think the much stronger argument will be the pocketbook , " he said .
" that 's why i think solar energy will have a great future in the united states . " no backing from bush one indication of the gulf that separates the two continents is the size of their solar exhibitions .
the german intersolar has been growing at some 30 percent a year .
the recent munich expo attracted more than 1,000 exhibitors and 50,000 attendees from 140 countries . in contrast , the san francisco intersolar has only 200 exhibitors and 12,000 attendees . the major reason for the difference is the scope of government support , or the lack of it in the united states .
under president george w. bush , a former oil company executive , the federal government until recently denied the science of climate change .
vice president dick cheney famously dismissed conservation as a meaningless personal virtue . though the us does offer homeowners a one-time , $ 2,000 federal tax credit for the installation of photo-voltaic systems that convert solar energy into electricity , weber argued that it needed a so-called feed-in tariff to really allow the sector to take off .
such a tariff offers energy producers a guaranteed price for energy that they feed into the grid from renewable sources , and was the key stimulus in boosting the european solar sector . but there are many other factors in play . the next big thing ? for instance , it 's no coincidence that the conference is taking place in san francisco .
the city is the northern anchor of silicon valley , where an ever-increasing pool of venture capital and a growing number of start-ups are chasing the solar dream . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : sunpower corp. ceo thomas warner next to the solar panels on the roof of the sunpower building in san jose many are already predicting a solar boom , akin to the dot-com boom that accompanied the rise of the internet .
some start-ups like nanosolar and solyndra are already valued at more than $ 1 billion before they 've ever made a profit , reflecting the huge growth potential that wall street sees in the solar field . the comparisons to california 's tech industry do not end there .
solar-cell production is a close cousin to the production of computer chips , and there is a constant exchange of personnel , techniques and equipment between the two sectors . " each time we double the volume of production , the cost goes down by 20 percent , " weber said .
" at the end of the day , it will be the least expensive energy of all .
we just need a little help to ignite the revolution . " dan martin , who heads semicon west , a trade association of semiconductor manufacturers , believes the same dynamic - that dramatically reduced the price of computer chips while simultaneously increasing their power - will also characterize the solar voltaics sector . " we are going to change the world , " he said .

" that 's why i think solar energy will have a great future in the united states . " no backing from bush one indication of the gulf that separates the two continents is the size of their solar exhibitions .
the german intersolar has been growing at some 30 percent a year .
the recent munich expo attracted more than 1,000 exhibitors and 50,000 attendees from 140 countries . in contrast , the san francisco intersolar has only 200 exhibitors and 12,000 attendees . the major reason for the difference is the scope of government support , or the lack of it in the united states .
under president george w. bush , a former oil company executive , the federal government until recently denied the science of climate change .
vice president dick cheney famously dismissed conservation as a meaningless personal virtue . though the us does offer homeowners a one-time , $ 2,000 federal tax credit for the installation of photo-voltaic systems that convert solar energy into electricity , weber argued that it needed a so-called feed-in tariff to really allow the sector to take off .
such a tariff offers energy producers a guaranteed price for energy that they feed into the grid from renewable sources , and was the key stimulus in boosting the european solar sector . but there are many other factors in play . the next big thing ? for instance , it 's no coincidence that the conference is taking place in san francisco .
the city is the northern anchor of silicon valley , where an ever-increasing pool of venture capital and a growing number of start-ups are chasing the solar dream . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : sunpower corp. ceo thomas warner next to the solar panels on the roof of the sunpower building in san jose many are already predicting a solar boom , akin to the dot-com boom that accompanied the rise of the internet .
some start-ups like nanosolar and solyndra are already valued at more than $ 1 billion before they 've ever made a profit , reflecting the huge growth potential that wall street sees in the solar field . the comparisons to california 's tech industry do not end there .
solar-cell production is a close cousin to the production of computer chips , and there is a constant exchange of personnel , techniques and equipment between the two sectors . " each time we double the volume of production , the cost goes down by 20 percent , " weber said .
" at the end of the day , it will be the least expensive energy of all .
we just need a little help to ignite the revolution . " dan martin , who heads semicon west , a trade association of semiconductor manufacturers , believes the same dynamic - that dramatically reduced the price of computer chips while simultaneously increasing their power - will also characterize the solar voltaics sector . " we are going to change the world , " he said .
" i 've seen it happen before , and it will happen again . " dpa news agency -lrb- win -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de energy -pipe- 17.07.2008 german expert predicts us solar energy boom großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : this might soon be a common sight in the us , according to some the us might still lag behind in promoting alternative energies , but at least one german expert is convinced that this is bound to change in the very near future . there 's something incongruous about experts from normally cloudy germany coming to california , the land of eternal sunshine , to teach the locals about how to harness solar power . but that 's was happening this week in san francisco , where organizers of the world 's largest solar exhibition , germany 's intersolar , launched an american version of their confab amid predictions of a massive solar boom in the ailing us economy . conference chairman professor eicke weber , director of the fraunhofer institute for solar energy systems , insists that it makes perfect sense for germans to bring their solar accumen to the golden state . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : americans are already beginning to cut back on their driving habits as soaring fuel costs combine with rapidly changing public perceptions about the dangers of climate change , the us embrace of solar power is at a tipping point , he predicts .
soon , the us will follow the massive investments already made in europe in renewable energy , where thanks to strong government support the solar industry is years ahead of its american counterpart . " before , our only argument was the environment , but now with oil at $ 140 -lrb- 88 euros -rrb- a barrel , i think the much stronger argument will be the pocketbook , " he said .
" that 's why i think solar energy will have a great future in the united states . " no backing from bush one indication of the gulf that separates the two continents is the size of their solar exhibitions .
the german intersolar has been growing at some 30 percent a year .
the recent munich expo attracted more than 1,000 exhibitors and 50,000 attendees from 140 countries . in contrast , the san francisco intersolar has only 200 exhibitors and 12,000 attendees . the major reason for the difference is the scope of government support , or the lack of it in the united states .
under president george w. bush , a former oil company executive , the federal government until recently denied the science of climate change .
vice president dick cheney famously dismissed conservation as a meaningless personal virtue . though the us does offer homeowners a one-time , $ 2,000 federal tax credit for the installation of photo-voltaic systems that convert solar energy into electricity , weber argued that it needed a so-called feed-in tariff to really allow the sector to take off .
such a tariff offers energy producers a guaranteed price for energy that they feed into the grid from renewable sources , and was the key stimulus in boosting the european solar sector . but there are many other factors in play . the next big thing ? for instance , it 's no coincidence that the conference is taking place in san francisco .
the city is the northern anchor of silicon valley , where an ever-increasing pool of venture capital and a growing number of start-ups are chasing the solar dream . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : sunpower corp. ceo thomas warner next to the solar panels on the roof of the sunpower building in san jose many are already predicting a solar boom , akin to the dot-com boom that accompanied the rise of the internet .
some start-ups like nanosolar and solyndra are already valued at more than $ 1 billion before they 've ever made a profit , reflecting the huge growth potential that wall street sees in the solar field . the comparisons to california 's tech industry do not end there .
solar-cell production is a close cousin to the production of computer chips , and there is a constant exchange of personnel , techniques and equipment between the two sectors . " each time we double the volume of production , the cost goes down by 20 percent , " weber said .
" at the end of the day , it will be the least expensive energy of all .
we just need a little help to ignite the revolution . " dan martin , who heads semicon west , a trade association of semiconductor manufacturers , believes the same dynamic - that dramatically reduced the price of computer chips while simultaneously increasing their power - will also characterize the solar voltaics sector .

soon , the us will follow the massive investments already made in europe in renewable energy , where thanks to strong government support the solar industry is years ahead of its american counterpart . " before , our only argument was the environment , but now with oil at $ 140 -lrb- 88 euros -rrb- a barrel , i think the much stronger argument will be the pocketbook , " he said .
" that 's why i think solar energy will have a great future in the united states . " no backing from bush one indication of the gulf that separates the two continents is the size of their solar exhibitions .
the german intersolar has been growing at some 30 percent a year .
the recent munich expo attracted more than 1,000 exhibitors and 50,000 attendees from 140 countries . in contrast , the san francisco intersolar has only 200 exhibitors and 12,000 attendees . the major reason for the difference is the scope of government support , or the lack of it in the united states .
under president george w. bush , a former oil company executive , the federal government until recently denied the science of climate change .
vice president dick cheney famously dismissed conservation as a meaningless personal virtue . though the us does offer homeowners a one-time , $ 2,000 federal tax credit for the installation of photo-voltaic systems that convert solar energy into electricity , weber argued that it needed a so-called feed-in tariff to really allow the sector to take off .
such a tariff offers energy producers a guaranteed price for energy that they feed into the grid from renewable sources , and was the key stimulus in boosting the european solar sector . but there are many other factors in play . the next big thing ? for instance , it 's no coincidence that the conference is taking place in san francisco .
the city is the northern anchor of silicon valley , where an ever-increasing pool of venture capital and a growing number of start-ups are chasing the solar dream . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : sunpower corp. ceo thomas warner next to the solar panels on the roof of the sunpower building in san jose many are already predicting a solar boom , akin to the dot-com boom that accompanied the rise of the internet .
some start-ups like nanosolar and solyndra are already valued at more than $ 1 billion before they 've ever made a profit , reflecting the huge growth potential that wall street sees in the solar field . the comparisons to california 's tech industry do not end there .
solar-cell production is a close cousin to the production of computer chips , and there is a constant exchange of personnel , techniques and equipment between the two sectors . " each time we double the volume of production , the cost goes down by 20 percent , " weber said .
" at the end of the day , it will be the least expensive energy of all .
we just need a little help to ignite the revolution . " dan martin , who heads semicon west , a trade association of semiconductor manufacturers , believes the same dynamic - that dramatically reduced the price of computer chips while simultaneously increasing their power - will also characterize the solar voltaics sector .

hitler probably realized that himself . after the army had advanced 2,000 kilometers -lrb- 1,200 miles -rrb- east of german soil , nazi germany 's war of aggression morphed into failure during late 1941 and early 1942 when the wehrmacht -lrb- the official german army , navy and air force -rrb- could not achieve any knock-out blow . yet it took nearly three more years to end the war .
the wehrmacht did not capitulate until after the fuehrer had committed suicide in his berlin bunker in april 1945 . decades of research part 10 of the war history , which has just come out in two volumes , examines the collapse of the third reich in 1945 .
the entire history , " das deutsche reich und der zweite weltkrieg " -lrb- the german reich and the second world war -rrb- , was researched by the german military history unit mgfa , which is now based in potsdam near berlin .
the project began in 1978 . the part on 1945 has chapters on naval warfare , the allied air onslaught on germany , the operations of the red army on german soil , german industry and the transition to post-war reconstruction , the fate of prisoners of war and ethnic " cleansing " as the war ended . part 8 several years ago foreshadowed the answer to the question of why the nazis did not give up . to the very end , the nazi regime required germans to recite their belief in " ultimate victory . "

the wehrmacht did not capitulate until after the fuehrer had committed suicide in his berlin bunker in april 1945 . decades of research part 10 of the war history , which has just come out in two volumes , examines the collapse of the third reich in 1945 .
the entire history , " das deutsche reich und der zweite weltkrieg " -lrb- the german reich and the second world war -rrb- , was researched by the german military history unit mgfa , which is now based in potsdam near berlin .

" this is my appeal to break out of the spiral of violence .
a lack of dialogue is not an option for the future , " he said after meeting with his georgian counterpart eka tkeshelashvili .
steinmeier , who chairs the so-called group of friends of the united nations ' secretary on georgia , is proposing a three-phase peace plan based on a mutual declaration of non-violence and repatriation of about 25,000 ethnic georgians expelled from abkhazia in the 1990s .

" this is my appeal to break out of the spiral of violence .
a lack of dialogue is not an option for the future , " he said after meeting with his georgian counterpart eka tkeshelashvili .
steinmeier , who chairs the so-called group of friends of the united nations ' secretary on georgia , is proposing a three-phase peace plan based on a mutual declaration of non-violence and repatriation of about 25,000 ethnic georgians expelled from abkhazia in the 1990s .
negotiations over the status of the two rebel regions , which have enjoyed de facto autonomy since the end of a civil war in 1994 , was reserved for the final phase of negotiations .

" we think that signing a treaty on the non-use of force without any preconditions is an absolutely unavoidable first step , " he added .
experts see little hope for steinmeier 's plan analysts do not expect anything conclusive from steinmeier 's trip , pointing to intransigence on the part of the abkhaz president sergei bagapsh , who said he would " not consider the plan . "
" we are not going to discuss abkhazia 's status with anyone .
we are building an independent , democratic state , " bagapsh was quoted by georgian news agencies as saying .

the german delegation would meet with the de-facto president of the breakaway region , sergei bagapsh , in sukhumi , which is a port city on the black sea .
" the goal of the trip is to find with all the affected parties ways out of the logic of escalation , out of this spiral of constantly escalating incidents .
it is about building trust and creating the specific conditions for a solution that will be acceptable for all , " said peschke .
steinmeier would try to build trust and explore a solution acceptable to all parties .
in tbilisi , he would meet with president mikheil saakashvili and the georgian opposition .
" we 've been in close and regular contact with all parties , " said the spokesman .
russia and georgia are at odds over two regions which separated from georgia in the early 1990s .
bombings and fly-overs up the ante bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : fly-overs by russian jets have increased tensions tensions mounted this month with a series of bombings in abkhazia , the arrest by another separatist republic , south ossetia , of four georgian soldiers and flights over south ossetia by russia 's air force , which moscow says are needed to prevent " bloodshed . "
tbilisi has protested the presence of russian forces in the territories and offers of russian citizenship to their residents as a de facto annexation of its territory .
peschke said berlin had a special responsibility in the conflict .
since 2003 , germany has been coordinator of a panel known as the friends of the united nations secretary general for georgia .
the other members are britain , russia , the united states and france .
german road map dismissed by abkhazia bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : steinmeier 's plan has already been dismissed steinmeier is expected to advocate a three-stage german road-map for peace that has already received a cool reception from the abkhazians . it proposes a year of confidence-building measures , including an end to violence and a return of georgian refugees to abkhazia , with a reconstruction phase to follow .
the third stage would be to resolve the legal status of abkhazia .
the plan to settle the conflict between georgia and abkhazia was rejected out of hand by abkhaz leader sergei bagapsh monday , according to russian media .
steinmeier met with visiting un chief ban ki-moon tuesday and called lavrov and us secretary of state condoleezza rice this week to discuss abkhazia .
lavrov told him that moscow wanted " both sides to accept obligations not to use force , " and for georgian troops to pull out of the strategic kodori gorge in abkhazia , the russian foreign ministry said .
" the russian side stressed that to de-escalate the situation in the conflict zone it is necessary to have the sides accept obligations not to use force , " the ministry said in a statement .
georgia for its part accuses russia of tacit support for the rebels and stoking tensions in both regions .
russia says nato plans increase threat bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : steinmeier and lavrov will hold further talks on georgia lavrov last week held talks in moscow with the separatist leader of abkhazia , sergei bagapsh , and warned afterwards that a plan to bring georgia closer to joining nato would scuttle any peace efforts .
" this could sink a possible resolution " of the crisis , lavrov was quoted as saying by the interfax news agency after meeting bagapsh .
he was referring to us assertions that giving georgia a so-called membership action plan -lrb- map -rrb- for nato membership could help resolve its " frozen conflicts " in abkhazia and south ossetia .
at its latest summit in april , nato shied away from formally granting a map to georgia and another ex-soviet republic near russia , ukraine , amid opposition from germany , france and some other european states .
georgia boosts military spending lawmakers in georgia on tuesday increased army numbers and boosted defense spending in response to " aggressive actions " from russia and as part of a bid to join the nato alliance .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : saakashvili says georgia faces its biggest threat " threat assessment has shown that threats have increased and reached a critical level after russia 's aggressive actions , " givi targamadze , a member of president mikhail saakashvili 's ruling party , said in broadcast comments .
" georgia faces the highest level of threat since independence , " he said .
the 15-percent boost in army numbers from 32,000 to 37,000 " will strengthen our defenses and build an army compatible with the nato criteria , " nicoloz rurua , also from the united national movement party , said earlier .
the parliament , which is dominated by saakashvili 's party , also approved a government proposal to increase defense spending this year by $ 209 million -lrb- 131 million euros -rrb- to around $ 989 million . dw staff -lrb- nda -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

berlin 's fashion week kicks off on thursday , july 17 .
the young and hip , and established designers , will be showing their clothes all around the capital .
berlin hopes it 'll attract attention in the wider fashion world . berlin is known around the world for its creative scene , be it music , art or performance .
it 's also trying to make a name for itself in the fashion world , although it 's proving to be an uphill road . proponents of berlin as a emerging fashion metropolis say it 's beginning to come into its own , and in addition to the small , one-room fashion start-ups run by young people in their 20s , well-known designers are also coming to the german capital to present their collections , even if it 's usually their secondary lines . vivienne westwood will show her number two line " anglomania " this week and bigger german labels " hugo , " " joop jeans " and " strenesse blue " are showing their 2009 spring and summer collections . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : from the fall / winter 2008/2009 collection of the label strenesse blue " we think berlin will gain importance as a fashion city , just because of the location , " mercedes-benz fashion week spokeswoman nora rochlitzer told the koelner stadt-anzeiger daily .
" berlin is in the center of europe and from here we can conquer anything , even eastern europe . " the capital will be dotted with smaller venues which will show off work from younger designers , such as the 120 who have been invited to a series of small storefronts in berlin 's largely immigrant wedding district . " we do n't want to withdraw and drink champagne , but celebrate with our neighbors , " said christoph steinweg , the organizer of " wedding dress 3 . " larger stores , like the galeries lafayette department store in downtown berlin , are showing off the collections of 13 well known berlin labels , such as c.neeon , von wedel & tiedeken and pulver . lots of creativity , little commerce but while germany is strong when it comes to creative potential , with its lively arts and fashion scene , it 's the business aspect of things that is lacking , experts say . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : berlin 's got the creative spirit , but fashion business is still done in duesseldorf " berlin does n't have any commercial dimension , " said thomas rasch , director of the german fashion association germany fashion .
" business is done in duesseldorf . " rochlitzer defends berlin as a fashion capital , saying people love to talk it down , but they should give it a chance .
she points out that the fashion week in new york , one of today 's undisputed capitals of couture , was not a great success when it began . but perhaps most telling , and perhaps discouraging for fashionistas in berlin , was a recent interview in the tagesspiegel daily with suzy menkes , one of the world 's top fashion journalists . when asked if she thought berlin 's fashion week was important , she responded , " oh , i have to admit , i did n't really know that a fashion week was taking place in berlin .

berlin 's fashion week kicks off on thursday , july 17 .
the young and hip , and established designers , will be showing their clothes all around the capital .
berlin hopes it 'll attract attention in the wider fashion world . berlin is known around the world for its creative scene , be it music , art or performance .
it 's also trying to make a name for itself in the fashion world , although it 's proving to be an uphill road . proponents of berlin as a emerging fashion metropolis say it 's beginning to come into its own , and in addition to the small , one-room fashion start-ups run by young people in their 20s , well-known designers are also coming to the german capital to present their collections , even if it 's usually their secondary lines . vivienne westwood will show her number two line " anglomania " this week and bigger german labels " hugo , " " joop jeans " and " strenesse blue " are showing their 2009 spring and summer collections . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : from the fall / winter 2008/2009 collection of the label strenesse blue " we think berlin will gain importance as a fashion city , just because of the location , " mercedes-benz fashion week spokeswoman nora rochlitzer told the koelner stadt-anzeiger daily .
" berlin is in the center of europe and from here we can conquer anything , even eastern europe . " the capital will be dotted with smaller venues which will show off work from younger designers , such as the 120 who have been invited to a series of small storefronts in berlin 's largely immigrant wedding district .

it creates a fund of 4.6 million euros -lrb- $ 2.9 million -rrb- from which the compensation payments will be made . beneficiaries are to be those survivors from the alsace-lorraine region who were forced to work for the nazi german wartime authorities during the second world war .
the fund will be financed in equal shares by the french state and the foundation . the compensation would amount to about 800 euros per surviving victim .
most of the survivors today are women over the age of 80 . " we had to wait many years until we finally gained the recognition we demanded , " said germaine rohrbach , 82 , spokeswoman for the former forced-labor victims . too little , too late ? the final compensation , however , is " much too low in relation to the fate we suffered , " she added . originally the alsace-lorraine group had been hoping for the same amount of compensation - some 1,300 euros - which more than 86,000 people from the alsace-lorraine region who had once been forced into service of the german wehrmacht had received in the 1980s . that compensation came from a fund jointly established in 1981 by former french president valery giscard d 'estaing and then-west german chancellor helmut schmidt . stalled process thursday 's accord came after many years in which france had balked at recognizing the alsace-lorraine forced laborers as actual victims of the nazis .
it was finally last year , that president nicolas sarkozy gave the green light to resolve the issue quickly . the alsace-lorraine region straddles part of the border between france and germany , with a unique mix of the two countries ' languages and cultures . last year , german wound up its compensation payments to all surviving nazi regime forced-laborers , paying some 4.4 billion euros to 1.7 million victims in more than 100 countries . dpa news agency -lrb- win -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

" the whole of germany is looking forward to the 2018 winter games in munich , " said german interior minister wolfgang schaeuble when the official bid committee was inaugurated on this week in the city 's town hall . " it has been quite a while since we successfully bid for the olympic games .
we will do everything to succeed , " he said . the 1972 summer games in munich were the last olympics in the country - with berlin and garmisch-partenkirchen hosting the summer and winter editions , respectively , in 1936 . berchtesgaden flopped for the 1992 winter games , while berlin and leipzig came nowhere close to international olympic committee confidence in their bids for the 2000 and 2012 summer games . " munich plus two " garmisch is in the frame again as part of munich 's bid , set to stage the snow events .
sliding competition is to take place on the existing track in koeniggssee while all other ice events are set for the host city of munich . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the last german olympic games were in munich in 1972 - and marked by tragedy the campaign is suitably named " munich plus two " as other famous bavarian wintersport venues such as inzell -lrb- speed-skating -rrb- and ruhpolding -lrb- biathlon -rrb- were dropped in favor of a bid as compact as possible . munich mayor christian ude did not hide the city 's determination to make history as the first host of summer and winter games - preferably with the first attempt like in 1972 . " munich has a tradition to get the nod on the first attempt .
it is a fantastic perspective for munich 's future to become the first city in the world to stage the wwinter games after the summer games , " said ude . german olympic supremo thomas bach said there was no plan b should munich fail in the 2011 ioc vote . wilfried spronk , the experienced former head of munich 's olympiapark -lrb- the main area of the 1972 games -rrb- company , has been hired as managing director . spronk 's first task is to raise the 30 million euros -lrb- $ 47.8 million -rrb- munich needs for the bid procedure .
the money is to come from sponsors and not tax payers . geography to play a role while munich fits the seemingly preferred ioc requirement for a winter games host , a relatively large city close to mountains , its fate could also depend on the next olympic elections for 2016 . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the winter olympics in 2014 will take place in sochi , russia with the 2012 summer games and 2014 winter olympics in london and sochi , respectively , munich 's chances may look grim if the 2016 summer edition is awarded to europe again .
madrid is bidding against chicago , tokyo and rio de janeiro . in addition , munich will face big rivals on its own .
the narrow 2010 and 2014 loser pyeongchang of south korea is expected to make another bid , along with tromso -lrb- norway -rrb- , grenoble -lrb- france -rrb- , geneva -lrb- switzerland -rrb- and a possible us candidate . however , the ioc vice-president bach urged munich not to look at the other bidders , but at its own strength instead . " the message of the 2018 bid is combining a great winter sports tradition with culture , innovative technology and a legacy , " bach said . dpa news agency -lrb- jam -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

but the changes do n't go far enough , says deutsche welle 's sabine kinkartz . imagine that you 're highly qualified .
you 've completed your studies and gotten the best grades , you 've been working for a couple of years as an engineer , a process technician or an it specialist , you 've done additional training , fine-tuned your skills and are earning good money . maybe you ’ ve started a family and found friends .
in short - you 're feeling good and have found your place in life , wherever it may be .
what could bring you to give up all this , immigrate to germany and work here ?
ca n't think of anything ?
i can understand . but germany 's federal government does n't .
it still hopes that it can lure highly skilled people with a university degree to germany in large numbers .
it 's an old hope that 's been disappointed so far : in 2006 , only 456 highly qualified people received permanent residence status - 10 fewer than last year . minimum salary the minimum salary requirement is the biggest hurdle .
anyone who wants to come here without fulfilling any other requirements has to be able to prove that he or she is earning a hefty salary - in the future , it 'll still be twice the amount of an average german salary . but who earns that much and more ?
senior specialists and not young , highly qualified graduates at the beginning of their careers .
the latter , however , are the ones being sought by industry here , because they are still flexible . that 's why the new action program to secure the supply of specialists has business leaders shaking their heads . a system that does n't take into account the needs of the german labor market and an applicant 's ability to integrate can not work . in the it sector , every second company is saying that business is down because vacant positions can not be filled .
the association of german engineers says that there are 96,000 jobs available - twice as many as four years ago . politicians not listening the government hears what the business community is saying - but it does n't really want to listen .
the labor minister says that the lack of skilled workers ca n't be as bad as the industry is saying .
at the same time , he admits that he does n't really know what the situation is like .
why should he ?
in the end , he 's more concerned with protecting rather than opening the labor market .
germany has three million unemployed people - a long-time social democrat can not open borders under such circumstances ! other states do exactly that and are way ahead when it comes to competing for the world 's smartest heads .
the netherlands , for example , has adjusted the minimum salary requirements to be in line with those of skilled local professional beginners . plenty of choices the german labor market on the other hand is only opening up for those who do n't have to work in germany .
it 's opening up for people so highly qualified that they can decide whether they want to stay in their own countries or - if they 're from india , china or south america - would n't rather go to english-speaking countries such as australia , britain , canada or the us , where the will have to worry less about resentment . the new immigration measures taken by the federal government are a step in the right direction .

but the changes do n't go far enough , says deutsche welle 's sabine kinkartz . imagine that you 're highly qualified .
you 've completed your studies and gotten the best grades , you 've been working for a couple of years as an engineer , a process technician or an it specialist , you 've done additional training , fine-tuned your skills and are earning good money . maybe you ’ ve started a family and found friends .
in short - you 're feeling good and have found your place in life , wherever it may be .
what could bring you to give up all this , immigrate to germany and work here ?
ca n't think of anything ?
i can understand . but germany 's federal government does n't .
it still hopes that it can lure highly skilled people with a university degree to germany in large numbers .
it 's an old hope that 's been disappointed so far : in 2006 , only 456 highly qualified people received permanent residence status - 10 fewer than last year . minimum salary the minimum salary requirement is the biggest hurdle .
anyone who wants to come here without fulfilling any other requirements has to be able to prove that he or she is earning a hefty salary - in the future , it 'll still be twice the amount of an average german salary . but who earns that much and more ?
senior specialists and not young , highly qualified graduates at the beginning of their careers .
the latter , however , are the ones being sought by industry here , because they are still flexible . that 's why the new action program to secure the supply of specialists has business leaders shaking their heads . a system that does n't take into account the needs of the german labor market and an applicant 's ability to integrate can not work . in the it sector , every second company is saying that business is down because vacant positions can not be filled .
the association of german engineers says that there are 96,000 jobs available - twice as many as four years ago . politicians not listening the government hears what the business community is saying - but it does n't really want to listen .
the labor minister says that the lack of skilled workers ca n't be as bad as the industry is saying .
at the same time , he admits that he does n't really know what the situation is like .
why should he ?
in the end , he 's more concerned with protecting rather than opening the labor market .
germany has three million unemployed people - a long-time social democrat can not open borders under such circumstances ! other states do exactly that and are way ahead when it comes to competing for the world 's smartest heads .
the netherlands , for example , has adjusted the minimum salary requirements to be in line with those of skilled local professional beginners . plenty of choices the german labor market on the other hand is only opening up for those who do n't have to work in germany .
it 's opening up for people so highly qualified that they can decide whether they want to stay in their own countries or - if they 're from india , china or south america - would n't rather go to english-speaking countries such as australia , britain , canada or the us , where the will have to worry less about resentment . the new immigration measures taken by the federal government are a step in the right direction .

many apple addicts are likely to have to wait quite a while before being able to satisfy their need for the company 's latest gadget . spokespeople for german cell phone service provider t-mobile said that all of their stores were completely sold out and even secondary resellers of t-mobile contracts had only a few phones left . t-mobile is the exclusive cell phone provider chosen by apple to sell its phone .
company officials said they had no clue when they 'd be getting new deliveries .
they added that several thousand people had already pre-ordered the phone . the new iphone 3g , which first went on sale in germany on july 11 , updates the previous iphone with much faster connection speeds and built-in gps , but many analysts believe the most significant update is the new software that allows users access to thousands of applications developed by third parties and available through apple 's online store . t-mobile and authorized resellers sold more than 15,000 phones on the first day - 5,000 more than with the first version of the phone .

hitler probably realized that himself . after the army had advanced 2,000 kilometers -lrb- 1,200 miles -rrb- east of german soil , nazi germany 's war of aggression morphed into failure during late 1941 and early 1942 when the wehrmacht -lrb- the official german army , navy and air force -rrb- could not achieve any knock-out blow . yet it took nearly three more years to end the war .
the wehrmacht did not capitulate until after the fuehrer had committed suicide in his berlin bunker in april 1945 . decades of research part 10 of the war history , which has just come out in two volumes , examines the collapse of the third reich in 1945 .
the entire history , " das deutsche reich und der zweite weltkrieg " -lrb- the german reich and the second world war -rrb- , was researched by the german military history unit mgfa , which is now based in potsdam near berlin .
the project began in 1978 . the part on 1945 has chapters on naval warfare , the allied air onslaught on germany , the operations of the red army on german soil , german industry and the transition to post-war reconstruction , the fate of prisoners of war and ethnic " cleansing " as the war ended . part 8 several years ago foreshadowed the answer to the question of why the nazis did not give up . to the very end , the nazi regime required germans to recite their belief in " ultimate victory . "
but in the final years of the war , part 8 suggested , hitler 's mind gradually focused on staging a vain but heroic last stand . part 10 explores various explanations , including a " suicidal urge " in the dictator 's personality . suicide mission hitler 's all-or-nothing approach has been described by his biographers as a key to his rise , and an exiled german writer , sebastian haffner , suggested as early as 1940 that the method was also the mark of a " potential self-killer . " with all dissent punished , the changing attitudes of the german public and the soldiers is more difficult to establish , particularly in the closing months of the war , when the documentary record of a germany sinking into chaos and defeat is sparse . the history emphasizes that german fanaticism was not monolithic and that german attitudes in any case were contradictory . while other types of history explore the moral failure that led the germans to ravage europe and unleash the holocaust , a military history takes a more technical look at what the military did , how it nursed its resources and what its political masters aimed for . tired germans rolf-dieter mueller , editor of part 10 and leader of its 11 authors , writes in an analytic summary that by 1943 , after four exhausting years of war , a majority of germans probably would have accepted a surrender if it had not been for hitler 's determination to fight on regardless . the volume 's account of the war on the western front in 1944 and 1945 describes the german military fighting on towards self-destruction under mottoes such as " for honor " and " for the fatherland , " believing they were " doing their duty . " " that was their common denominator with a majority of the germans , who had been simply sticking to what they were doing , or had not sought any alternative , or had not been able to visualize any other way , " the book says . the chapter on the army 's last stand describes the fanatical refusal to surrender that made germany 's own military the greatest danger to germany 's own people , but it also refers to the many cases of officers and men who indirectly saved fellow germans ' lives . on their own responsibility and often risking execution for treason , some of the german military openly disobeyed orders or subtly wasted time so that the allied invasion of germany could proceed quickly without even more loss of lives and property . no alternative ? the epilogue to the work states , " hitler waged his personal war for six years , supported by sentiment in germany that remained broadly favorable even after a series of defeats and never turned to public resentment , despite growing apathy and war weariness . " to the germans , no alternative appeared feasible , other than the unconditional surrender demanded by the enemy , " the book adds . most of the rest of the world was needed to defeat the most efficient fighting machine of its generation , which had battled on despite hitler 's strategic blunders . its commanders refused to sue for peace when it became the militarily rational thing to do , and remained loyal to the dictator because of their own collaboration with his criminal objectives . explaining modern germany 's reluctance to fight the taliban and its focus on collective defense , the last part says the war taught post-war germans an abiding lesson and they deliberately renounced any capacity to wage a war of their own ever again . germany 's submission to nato has meant that the second world war was the " last war of the germans " in history . dpa news agency -lrb- win -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

hitler probably realized that himself . after the army had advanced 2,000 kilometers -lrb- 1,200 miles -rrb- east of german soil , nazi germany 's war of aggression morphed into failure during late 1941 and early 1942 when the wehrmacht -lrb- the official german army , navy and air force -rrb- could not achieve any knock-out blow . yet it took nearly three more years to end the war .
the wehrmacht did not capitulate until after the fuehrer had committed suicide in his berlin bunker in april 1945 . decades of research part 10 of the war history , which has just come out in two volumes , examines the collapse of the third reich in 1945 .
the entire history , " das deutsche reich und der zweite weltkrieg " -lrb- the german reich and the second world war -rrb- , was researched by the german military history unit mgfa , which is now based in potsdam near berlin .

" this is my appeal to break out of the spiral of violence .
a lack of dialogue is not an option for the future , " he said after meeting with his georgian counterpart eka tkeshelashvili .
steinmeier , who chairs the so-called group of friends of the united nations ' secretary on georgia , is proposing a three-phase peace plan based on a mutual declaration of non-violence and repatriation of about 25,000 ethnic georgians expelled from abkhazia in the 1990s .
negotiations over the status of the two rebel regions , which have enjoyed de facto autonomy since the end of a civil war in 1994 , was reserved for the final phase of negotiations .
tkeshelashvili said , " the plan has great potential for success , " but added that the most difficult thing would be to convince russia .
peace talks remain distant the threat of armed conflict in the region last month has given urgency to international pressure for renewed peace talks , but tbilisi , moscow and the russian-backed regions remain far apart on the basic premises for restarting peace talks .

russia 's foreign minister sergei lavrov was skeptical of peace efforts thursday .
" signing of a treaty on the return of georgian refugees to abkhazia is unreal now , because such a return requires a calm situation , " lavrov was quoted as saying by news agency ria-novosti .
" we think that signing a treaty on the non-use of force without any preconditions is an absolutely unavoidable first step , " he added .
experts see little hope for steinmeier 's plan analysts do not expect anything conclusive from steinmeier 's trip , pointing to intransigence on the part of the abkhaz president sergei bagapsh , who said he would " not consider the plan . "
" we are not going to discuss abkhazia 's status with anyone .
we are building an independent , democratic state , " bagapsh was quoted by georgian news agencies as saying .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the presence of russian troops in abkhazia has aggravated tensions with georgia speaking to journalists ahead of the meetings thursday , steinmeier admitted : " we do n't have any illusions about simple answers , but we can not stand by without acting on this conflict .
that would be irresponsible . "
from tbilisi , the german minister is to travel to the black sea city of batumi for talks with georgian president mikhail saakashvili and then to abkhazia on friday before ending his three-day tour in moscow .
most citizens of the breakaway republics have been issued russian passports and over 2,500 russian peacekeeping troops patrol the region under a un ceasefire agreement .

" we think that signing a treaty on the non-use of force without any preconditions is an absolutely unavoidable first step , " he added .
experts see little hope for steinmeier 's plan analysts do not expect anything conclusive from steinmeier 's trip , pointing to intransigence on the part of the abkhaz president sergei bagapsh , who said he would " not consider the plan . "
" we are not going to discuss abkhazia 's status with anyone .
we are building an independent , democratic state , " bagapsh was quoted by georgian news agencies as saying .

that would be irresponsible . "
from tbilisi , the german minister is to travel to the black sea city of batumi for talks with georgian president mikhail saakashvili and then to abkhazia on friday before ending his three-day tour in moscow .
most citizens of the breakaway republics have been issued russian passports and over 2,500 russian peacekeeping troops patrol the region under a un ceasefire agreement .
in opposition to georgia 's bid to join the north atlantic treaty organization , russia moved to strengthen diplomatic ties with the breakaway regions sharply aggravating tensions with the georgian leadership in recent months . dw staff -lrb- nda -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

it creates a fund of 4.6 million euros -lrb- $ 2.9 million -rrb- from which the compensation payments will be made . beneficiaries are to be those survivors from the alsace-lorraine region who were forced to work for the nazi german wartime authorities during the second world war .
the fund will be financed in equal shares by the french state and the foundation . the compensation would amount to about 800 euros per surviving victim .
most of the survivors today are women over the age of 80 . " we had to wait many years until we finally gained the recognition we demanded , " said germaine rohrbach , 82 , spokeswoman for the former forced-labor victims . too little , too late ? the final compensation , however , is " much too low in relation to the fate we suffered , " she added . originally the alsace-lorraine group had been hoping for the same amount of compensation - some 1,300 euros - which more than 86,000 people from the alsace-lorraine region who had once been forced into service of the german wehrmacht had received in the 1980s . that compensation came from a fund jointly established in 1981 by former french president valery giscard d 'estaing and then-west german chancellor helmut schmidt . stalled process thursday 's accord came after many years in which france had balked at recognizing the alsace-lorraine forced laborers as actual victims of the nazis .
it was finally last year , that president nicolas sarkozy gave the green light to resolve the issue quickly . the alsace-lorraine region straddles part of the border between france and germany , with a unique mix of the two countries ' languages and cultures . last year , german wound up its compensation payments to all surviving nazi regime forced-laborers , paying some 4.4 billion euros to 1.7 million victims in more than 100 countries . dpa news agency -lrb- win -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

hitler probably realized that himself . after the army had advanced 2,000 kilometers -lrb- 1,200 miles -rrb- east of german soil , nazi germany 's war of aggression morphed into failure during late 1941 and early 1942 when the wehrmacht -lrb- the official german army , navy and air force -rrb- could not achieve any knock-out blow . yet it took nearly three more years to end the war .
the wehrmacht did not capitulate until after the fuehrer had committed suicide in his berlin bunker in april 1945 . decades of research part 10 of the war history , which has just come out in two volumes , examines the collapse of the third reich in 1945 .
the entire history , " das deutsche reich und der zweite weltkrieg " -lrb- the german reich and the second world war -rrb- , was researched by the german military history unit mgfa , which is now based in potsdam near berlin .

soon , the us will follow the massive investments already made in europe in renewable energy , where thanks to strong government support the solar industry is years ahead of its american counterpart . " before , our only argument was the environment , but now with oil at $ 140 -lrb- 88 euros -rrb- a barrel , i think the much stronger argument will be the pocketbook , " he said .
" that 's why i think solar energy will have a great future in the united states . " no backing from bush one indication of the gulf that separates the two continents is the size of their solar exhibitions .
the german intersolar has been growing at some 30 percent a year .
the recent munich expo attracted more than 1,000 exhibitors and 50,000 attendees from 140 countries . in contrast , the san francisco intersolar has only 200 exhibitors and 12,000 attendees . the major reason for the difference is the scope of government support , or the lack of it in the united states .
under president george w. bush , a former oil company executive , the federal government until recently denied the science of climate change .
vice president dick cheney famously dismissed conservation as a meaningless personal virtue . though the us does offer homeowners a one-time , $ 2,000 federal tax credit for the installation of photo-voltaic systems that convert solar energy into electricity , weber argued that it needed a so-called feed-in tariff to really allow the sector to take off .
such a tariff offers energy producers a guaranteed price for energy that they feed into the grid from renewable sources , and was the key stimulus in boosting the european solar sector . but there are many other factors in play . the next big thing ? for instance , it 's no coincidence that the conference is taking place in san francisco .
the city is the northern anchor of silicon valley , where an ever-increasing pool of venture capital and a growing number of start-ups are chasing the solar dream . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : sunpower corp. ceo thomas warner next to the solar panels on the roof of the sunpower building in san jose many are already predicting a solar boom , akin to the dot-com boom that accompanied the rise of the internet .
some start-ups like nanosolar and solyndra are already valued at more than $ 1 billion before they 've ever made a profit , reflecting the huge growth potential that wall street sees in the solar field . the comparisons to california 's tech industry do not end there .
solar-cell production is a close cousin to the production of computer chips , and there is a constant exchange of personnel , techniques and equipment between the two sectors . " each time we double the volume of production , the cost goes down by 20 percent , " weber said .
" at the end of the day , it will be the least expensive energy of all .
we just need a little help to ignite the revolution . " dan martin , who heads semicon west , a trade association of semiconductor manufacturers , believes the same dynamic - that dramatically reduced the price of computer chips while simultaneously increasing their power - will also characterize the solar voltaics sector . " we are going to change the world , " he said .

soon , the us will follow the massive investments already made in europe in renewable energy , where thanks to strong government support the solar industry is years ahead of its american counterpart . " before , our only argument was the environment , but now with oil at $ 140 -lrb- 88 euros -rrb- a barrel , i think the much stronger argument will be the pocketbook , " he said .

" the whole of germany is looking forward to the 2018 winter games in munich , " said german interior minister wolfgang schaeuble when the official bid committee was inaugurated on this week in the city 's town hall . " it has been quite a while since we successfully bid for the olympic games .
we will do everything to succeed , " he said . the 1972 summer games in munich were the last olympics in the country - with berlin and garmisch-partenkirchen hosting the summer and winter editions , respectively , in 1936 . berchtesgaden flopped for the 1992 winter games , while berlin and leipzig came nowhere close to international olympic committee confidence in their bids for the 2000 and 2012 summer games . " munich plus two " garmisch is in the frame again as part of munich 's bid , set to stage the snow events .
sliding competition is to take place on the existing track in koeniggssee while all other ice events are set for the host city of munich . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the last german olympic games were in munich in 1972 - and marked by tragedy the campaign is suitably named " munich plus two " as other famous bavarian wintersport venues such as inzell -lrb- speed-skating -rrb- and ruhpolding -lrb- biathlon -rrb- were dropped in favor of a bid as compact as possible . munich mayor christian ude did not hide the city 's determination to make history as the first host of summer and winter games - preferably with the first attempt like in 1972 . " munich has a tradition to get the nod on the first attempt .
it is a fantastic perspective for munich 's future to become the first city in the world to stage the wwinter games after the summer games , " said ude . german olympic supremo thomas bach said there was no plan b should munich fail in the 2011 ioc vote . wilfried spronk , the experienced former head of munich 's olympiapark -lrb- the main area of the 1972 games -rrb- company , has been hired as managing director . spronk 's first task is to raise the 30 million euros -lrb- $ 47.8 million -rrb- munich needs for the bid procedure .
the money is to come from sponsors and not tax payers . geography to play a role while munich fits the seemingly preferred ioc requirement for a winter games host , a relatively large city close to mountains , its fate could also depend on the next olympic elections for 2016 . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the winter olympics in 2014 will take place in sochi , russia with the 2012 summer games and 2014 winter olympics in london and sochi , respectively , munich 's chances may look grim if the 2016 summer edition is awarded to europe again .
madrid is bidding against chicago , tokyo and rio de janeiro . in addition , munich will face big rivals on its own .
the narrow 2010 and 2014 loser pyeongchang of south korea is expected to make another bid , along with tromso -lrb- norway -rrb- , grenoble -lrb- france -rrb- , geneva -lrb- switzerland -rrb- and a possible us candidate . however , the ioc vice-president bach urged munich not to look at the other bidders , but at its own strength instead . " the message of the 2018 bid is combining a great winter sports tradition with culture , innovative technology and a legacy , " bach said . dpa news agency -lrb- jam -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de energy -pipe- 17.07.2008 german expert predicts us solar energy boom großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : this might soon be a common sight in the us , according to some the us might still lag behind in promoting alternative energies , but at least one german expert is convinced that this is bound to change in the very near future . there 's something incongruous about experts from normally cloudy germany coming to california , the land of eternal sunshine , to teach the locals about how to harness solar power . but that 's was happening this week in san francisco , where organizers of the world 's largest solar exhibition , germany 's intersolar , launched an american version of their confab amid predictions of a massive solar boom in the ailing us economy . conference chairman professor eicke weber , director of the fraunhofer institute for solar energy systems , insists that it makes perfect sense for germans to bring their solar accumen to the golden state . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : americans are already beginning to cut back on their driving habits as soaring fuel costs combine with rapidly changing public perceptions about the dangers of climate change , the us embrace of solar power is at a tipping point , he predicts .
soon , the us will follow the massive investments already made in europe in renewable energy , where thanks to strong government support the solar industry is years ahead of its american counterpart . " before , our only argument was the environment , but now with oil at $ 140 -lrb- 88 euros -rrb- a barrel , i think the much stronger argument will be the pocketbook , " he said .
" that 's why i think solar energy will have a great future in the united states . " no backing from bush one indication of the gulf that separates the two continents is the size of their solar exhibitions .
the german intersolar has been growing at some 30 percent a year .
the recent munich expo attracted more than 1,000 exhibitors and 50,000 attendees from 140 countries . in contrast , the san francisco intersolar has only 200 exhibitors and 12,000 attendees . the major reason for the difference is the scope of government support , or the lack of it in the united states .
under president george w. bush , a former oil company executive , the federal government until recently denied the science of climate change .
vice president dick cheney famously dismissed conservation as a meaningless personal virtue . though the us does offer homeowners a one-time , $ 2,000 federal tax credit for the installation of photo-voltaic systems that convert solar energy into electricity , weber argued that it needed a so-called feed-in tariff to really allow the sector to take off .
such a tariff offers energy producers a guaranteed price for energy that they feed into the grid from renewable sources , and was the key stimulus in boosting the european solar sector . but there are many other factors in play . the next big thing ? for instance , it 's no coincidence that the conference is taking place in san francisco .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de energy -pipe- 17.07.2008 german expert predicts us solar energy boom großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : this might soon be a common sight in the us , according to some the us might still lag behind in promoting alternative energies , but at least one german expert is convinced that this is bound to change in the very near future . there 's something incongruous about experts from normally cloudy germany coming to california , the land of eternal sunshine , to teach the locals about how to harness solar power . but that 's was happening this week in san francisco , where organizers of the world 's largest solar exhibition , germany 's intersolar , launched an american version of their confab amid predictions of a massive solar boom in the ailing us economy . conference chairman professor eicke weber , director of the fraunhofer institute for solar energy systems , insists that it makes perfect sense for germans to bring their solar accumen to the golden state . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : americans are already beginning to cut back on their driving habits as soaring fuel costs combine with rapidly changing public perceptions about the dangers of climate change , the us embrace of solar power is at a tipping point , he predicts .
soon , the us will follow the massive investments already made in europe in renewable energy , where thanks to strong government support the solar industry is years ahead of its american counterpart . " before , our only argument was the environment , but now with oil at $ 140 -lrb- 88 euros -rrb- a barrel , i think the much stronger argument will be the pocketbook , " he said .
" that 's why i think solar energy will have a great future in the united states . " no backing from bush one indication of the gulf that separates the two continents is the size of their solar exhibitions .
the german intersolar has been growing at some 30 percent a year .
the recent munich expo attracted more than 1,000 exhibitors and 50,000 attendees from 140 countries . in contrast , the san francisco intersolar has only 200 exhibitors and 12,000 attendees . the major reason for the difference is the scope of government support , or the lack of it in the united states .
under president george w. bush , a former oil company executive , the federal government until recently denied the science of climate change .
vice president dick cheney famously dismissed conservation as a meaningless personal virtue . though the us does offer homeowners a one-time , $ 2,000 federal tax credit for the installation of photo-voltaic systems that convert solar energy into electricity , weber argued that it needed a so-called feed-in tariff to really allow the sector to take off .
such a tariff offers energy producers a guaranteed price for energy that they feed into the grid from renewable sources , and was the key stimulus in boosting the european solar sector . but there are many other factors in play . the next big thing ? for instance , it 's no coincidence that the conference is taking place in san francisco .
the city is the northern anchor of silicon valley , where an ever-increasing pool of venture capital and a growing number of start-ups are chasing the solar dream . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : sunpower corp. ceo thomas warner next to the solar panels on the roof of the sunpower building in san jose many are already predicting a solar boom , akin to the dot-com boom that accompanied the rise of the internet .

another spaniard acquitted at the original trial was convicted at the latest hearing and jailed for four years .
the court also confirmed the acquittal of rabei osman el-sayed ahmed , known as mohammed the egyptian , who was suspected of masterminding the march 11 , 2004 , attacks on four commuter trains .
the 36-year-old was acquitted of belonging to a terrorist organization because he had already been sentenced for the same crime in italy .
many victims were shocked by the sentences , which in many cases were much lower than the state attorney had requested , and angry at the acquittals .
at the original trial , 17 arabs and four spaniards were found guilty and sentenced to prison terms ranging from three years to 40,000 years .

" rome should provide a signal that crimes such as genocide , crimes against humanity , war crimes and crimes of aggression will in the future no longer go unpunished , " said the head of the german delegation in rome , gerd westdickenberg . the fundamental idea that emerged from the rome conference was that every country should pass laws that would require even high-ranking politicians and military officials to answer charges of human rights abuses before a court . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : luis moreno ocampo the icc , which was launched in 2002 , is based on the theory that such people could be extradited to a standing international court if a country 's own justice system was not capable of prosecuting them .

" we 're not a supreme court of the world . " several countries have since passed laws that allow war crimes , even genocide , to be prosecuted in national courts .

" and that 's very troubling to me .
we 'll try to work out the impasse at the united nations but one thing we 're not going to do is sign on to the international criminal court . " bush has shown no interest in following germany 's example and passing laws that would make war crimes a punishable offense .
instead , he has tried to weaken the icc by establishing non-extradition agreements with individual nations regarding american citizens . those are linked with threats to withhold military aid for the land if such deals are not made .
he has had some success with this strategy . growing credibility bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : judges of the international criminal court at the start of a hearing in the meantime , the row over the icc between critics of the rome statute , such as washington , and its biggest proponents , who are mostly in europe , has gotten quieter .

while originally supporting the idea , the city 's mayor is now not so certain any more that the winning design is the best one to build . the city is home to the oldest jewish community north of the alps and still has significant remains of the old jewish quarter , including the ruins of a mikwe , or ritual bath , just in front of cologne 's city hall . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the mikwe in front of city hall can be seen through a glass pyramid that 's why this particular spot was also chosen as the location of a future museum .
a design by saarbruecken-based architectural firm wandel hoefer lorch was overwhelmingly chosen by an expert jury . it all happened so quickly that members of the private foundation planning to pay for the construction said that it had n't collected any of the 20 million euros -lrb- $ 31.7 million -rrb- needed . they might not have to hurry . while cologne 's conservative mayor fritz schramma had originally voiced enthusiastic support for the plan , he 's since backed away from it . too massive ? bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : schramma supports the museum idea in general schramma says that he 's concerned that the new building would be too massive for the square in front of city hall .
the mayor now wants to give residents a chance to review all of the designs that were entered in the competition and then vote on them . while not accusing the mayor of anti-semitism , jewish leaders criticized schramma for giving in to concerns by others , including a neighboring arts museum . " there are rumors that the wallraf richartz museum is n't happy with the design , " salomon korn , a vice president of the central council of jews in germany , who sat on the selection jury , told german public radio deutschlandradio . an authentic place bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : korn thinks the square at city hall would be the best place korn , who is an architect himself , said that the winning design is far from massive and would actually return the space closer to its original state before buildings there were destroyed during world war ii . he also said that it made little sense to move the museum elsewhere , since the location in front of city hall was the historic site of germany 's jewish community and could therefore become a " crystallization core for remembrance .

berlin 's fashion week kicks off on thursday , july 17 .
the young and hip , and established designers , will be showing their clothes all around the capital .
berlin hopes it 'll attract attention in the wider fashion world . berlin is known around the world for its creative scene , be it music , art or performance .
it 's also trying to make a name for itself in the fashion world , although it 's proving to be an uphill road . proponents of berlin as a emerging fashion metropolis say it 's beginning to come into its own , and in addition to the small , one-room fashion start-ups run by young people in their 20s , well-known designers are also coming to the german capital to present their collections , even if it 's usually their secondary lines . vivienne westwood will show her number two line " anglomania " this week and bigger german labels " hugo , " " joop jeans " and " strenesse blue " are showing their 2009 spring and summer collections . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : from the fall / winter 2008/2009 collection of the label strenesse blue " we think berlin will gain importance as a fashion city , just because of the location , " mercedes-benz fashion week spokeswoman nora rochlitzer told the koelner stadt-anzeiger daily .
" berlin is in the center of europe and from here we can conquer anything , even eastern europe .

berlin 's fashion week kicks off on thursday , july 17 .
the young and hip , and established designers , will be showing their clothes all around the capital .
berlin hopes it 'll attract attention in the wider fashion world . berlin is known around the world for its creative scene , be it music , art or performance .
it 's also trying to make a name for itself in the fashion world , although it 's proving to be an uphill road . proponents of berlin as a emerging fashion metropolis say it 's beginning to come into its own , and in addition to the small , one-room fashion start-ups run by young people in their 20s , well-known designers are also coming to the german capital to present their collections , even if it 's usually their secondary lines . vivienne westwood will show her number two line " anglomania " this week and bigger german labels " hugo , " " joop jeans " and " strenesse blue " are showing their 2009 spring and summer collections . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : from the fall / winter 2008/2009 collection of the label strenesse blue " we think berlin will gain importance as a fashion city , just because of the location , " mercedes-benz fashion week spokeswoman nora rochlitzer told the koelner stadt-anzeiger daily .
" berlin is in the center of europe and from here we can conquer anything , even eastern europe . " the capital will be dotted with smaller venues which will show off work from younger designers , such as the 120 who have been invited to a series of small storefronts in berlin 's largely immigrant wedding district . " we do n't want to withdraw and drink champagne , but celebrate with our neighbors , " said christoph steinweg , the organizer of " wedding dress 3 .

the german delegation would meet with the de-facto president of the breakaway region , sergei bagapsh , in sukhumi , which is a port city on the black sea .
" the goal of the trip is to find with all the affected parties ways out of the logic of escalation , out of this spiral of constantly escalating incidents .

steinmeier would try to build trust and explore a solution acceptable to all parties .
in tbilisi , he would meet with president mikheil saakashvili and the georgian opposition .

russia and georgia are at odds over two regions which separated from georgia in the early 1990s .

"
tbilisi has protested the presence of russian forces in the territories and offers of russian citizenship to their residents as a de facto annexation of its territory .
peschke said berlin had a special responsibility in the conflict .

the third stage would be to resolve the legal status of abkhazia .
the plan to settle the conflict between georgia and abkhazia was rejected out of hand by abkhaz leader sergei bagapsh monday , according to russian media .
steinmeier met with visiting un chief ban ki-moon tuesday and called lavrov and us secretary of state condoleezza rice this week to discuss abkhazia .
lavrov told him that moscow wanted " both sides to accept obligations not to use force , " and for georgian troops to pull out of the strategic kodori gorge in abkhazia , the russian foreign ministry said .
" the russian side stressed that to de-escalate the situation in the conflict zone it is necessary to have the sides accept obligations not to use force , " the ministry said in a statement .

he was referring to us assertions that giving georgia a so-called membership action plan -lrb- map -rrb- for nato membership could help resolve its " frozen conflicts " in abkhazia and south ossetia .
at its latest summit in april , nato shied away from formally granting a map to georgia and another ex-soviet republic near russia , ukraine , amid opposition from germany , france and some other european states .

the german delegation would meet with the de-facto president of the breakaway region , sergei bagapsh , in sukhumi , which is a port city on the black sea .
" the goal of the trip is to find with all the affected parties ways out of the logic of escalation , out of this spiral of constantly escalating incidents .
it is about building trust and creating the specific conditions for a solution that will be acceptable for all , " said peschke .
steinmeier would try to build trust and explore a solution acceptable to all parties .
in tbilisi , he would meet with president mikheil saakashvili and the georgian opposition .
" we 've been in close and regular contact with all parties , " said the spokesman .
russia and georgia are at odds over two regions which separated from georgia in the early 1990s .
bombings and fly-overs up the ante bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : fly-overs by russian jets have increased tensions tensions mounted this month with a series of bombings in abkhazia , the arrest by another separatist republic , south ossetia , of four georgian soldiers and flights over south ossetia by russia 's air force , which moscow says are needed to prevent " bloodshed . "
tbilisi has protested the presence of russian forces in the territories and offers of russian citizenship to their residents as a de facto annexation of its territory .
peschke said berlin had a special responsibility in the conflict .
since 2003 , germany has been coordinator of a panel known as the friends of the united nations secretary general for georgia .
the other members are britain , russia , the united states and france .
german road map dismissed by abkhazia bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : steinmeier 's plan has already been dismissed steinmeier is expected to advocate a three-stage german road-map for peace that has already received a cool reception from the abkhazians . it proposes a year of confidence-building measures , including an end to violence and a return of georgian refugees to abkhazia , with a reconstruction phase to follow .
the third stage would be to resolve the legal status of abkhazia .
the plan to settle the conflict between georgia and abkhazia was rejected out of hand by abkhaz leader sergei bagapsh monday , according to russian media .
steinmeier met with visiting un chief ban ki-moon tuesday and called lavrov and us secretary of state condoleezza rice this week to discuss abkhazia .
lavrov told him that moscow wanted " both sides to accept obligations not to use force , " and for georgian troops to pull out of the strategic kodori gorge in abkhazia , the russian foreign ministry said .
" the russian side stressed that to de-escalate the situation in the conflict zone it is necessary to have the sides accept obligations not to use force , " the ministry said in a statement .
georgia for its part accuses russia of tacit support for the rebels and stoking tensions in both regions .
russia says nato plans increase threat bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : steinmeier and lavrov will hold further talks on georgia lavrov last week held talks in moscow with the separatist leader of abkhazia , sergei bagapsh , and warned afterwards that a plan to bring georgia closer to joining nato would scuttle any peace efforts .
" this could sink a possible resolution " of the crisis , lavrov was quoted as saying by the interfax news agency after meeting bagapsh .
he was referring to us assertions that giving georgia a so-called membership action plan -lrb- map -rrb- for nato membership could help resolve its " frozen conflicts " in abkhazia and south ossetia .

the german delegation would meet with the de-facto president of the breakaway region , sergei bagapsh , in sukhumi , which is a port city on the black sea .
" the goal of the trip is to find with all the affected parties ways out of the logic of escalation , out of this spiral of constantly escalating incidents .
it is about building trust and creating the specific conditions for a solution that will be acceptable for all , " said peschke .
steinmeier would try to build trust and explore a solution acceptable to all parties .
in tbilisi , he would meet with president mikheil saakashvili and the georgian opposition .
" we 've been in close and regular contact with all parties , " said the spokesman .
russia and georgia are at odds over two regions which separated from georgia in the early 1990s .
bombings and fly-overs up the ante bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : fly-overs by russian jets have increased tensions tensions mounted this month with a series of bombings in abkhazia , the arrest by another separatist republic , south ossetia , of four georgian soldiers and flights over south ossetia by russia 's air force , which moscow says are needed to prevent " bloodshed . "
tbilisi has protested the presence of russian forces in the territories and offers of russian citizenship to their residents as a de facto annexation of its territory .
peschke said berlin had a special responsibility in the conflict .
since 2003 , germany has been coordinator of a panel known as the friends of the united nations secretary general for georgia .
the other members are britain , russia , the united states and france .
german road map dismissed by abkhazia bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : steinmeier 's plan has already been dismissed steinmeier is expected to advocate a three-stage german road-map for peace that has already received a cool reception from the abkhazians . it proposes a year of confidence-building measures , including an end to violence and a return of georgian refugees to abkhazia , with a reconstruction phase to follow .
the third stage would be to resolve the legal status of abkhazia .
the plan to settle the conflict between georgia and abkhazia was rejected out of hand by abkhaz leader sergei bagapsh monday , according to russian media .
steinmeier met with visiting un chief ban ki-moon tuesday and called lavrov and us secretary of state condoleezza rice this week to discuss abkhazia .
lavrov told him that moscow wanted " both sides to accept obligations not to use force , " and for georgian troops to pull out of the strategic kodori gorge in abkhazia , the russian foreign ministry said .
" the russian side stressed that to de-escalate the situation in the conflict zone it is necessary to have the sides accept obligations not to use force , " the ministry said in a statement .
georgia for its part accuses russia of tacit support for the rebels and stoking tensions in both regions .
russia says nato plans increase threat bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : steinmeier and lavrov will hold further talks on georgia lavrov last week held talks in moscow with the separatist leader of abkhazia , sergei bagapsh , and warned afterwards that a plan to bring georgia closer to joining nato would scuttle any peace efforts .
" this could sink a possible resolution " of the crisis , lavrov was quoted as saying by the interfax news agency after meeting bagapsh .
he was referring to us assertions that giving georgia a so-called membership action plan -lrb- map -rrb- for nato membership could help resolve its " frozen conflicts " in abkhazia and south ossetia .
at its latest summit in april , nato shied away from formally granting a map to georgia and another ex-soviet republic near russia , ukraine , amid opposition from germany , france and some other european states .
georgia boosts military spending lawmakers in georgia on tuesday increased army numbers and boosted defense spending in response to " aggressive actions " from russia and as part of a bid to join the nato alliance .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : saakashvili says georgia faces its biggest threat " threat assessment has shown that threats have increased and reached a critical level after russia 's aggressive actions , " givi targamadze , a member of president mikhail saakashvili 's ruling party , said in broadcast comments .
" georgia faces the highest level of threat since independence , " he said .
the 15-percent boost in army numbers from 32,000 to 37,000 " will strengthen our defenses and build an army compatible with the nato criteria , " nicoloz rurua , also from the united national movement party , said earlier .
the parliament , which is dominated by saakashvili 's party , also approved a government proposal to increase defense spending this year by $ 209 million -lrb- 131 million euros -rrb- to around $ 989 million . dw staff -lrb- nda -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

hitler probably realized that himself . after the army had advanced 2,000 kilometers -lrb- 1,200 miles -rrb- east of german soil , nazi germany 's war of aggression morphed into failure during late 1941 and early 1942 when the wehrmacht -lrb- the official german army , navy and air force -rrb- could not achieve any knock-out blow . yet it took nearly three more years to end the war .
the wehrmacht did not capitulate until after the fuehrer had committed suicide in his berlin bunker in april 1945 . decades of research part 10 of the war history , which has just come out in two volumes , examines the collapse of the third reich in 1945 .
the entire history , " das deutsche reich und der zweite weltkrieg " -lrb- the german reich and the second world war -rrb- , was researched by the german military history unit mgfa , which is now based in potsdam near berlin .
the project began in 1978 . the part on 1945 has chapters on naval warfare , the allied air onslaught on germany , the operations of the red army on german soil , german industry and the transition to post-war reconstruction , the fate of prisoners of war and ethnic " cleansing " as the war ended . part 8 several years ago foreshadowed the answer to the question of why the nazis did not give up . to the very end , the nazi regime required germans to recite their belief in " ultimate victory . "
but in the final years of the war , part 8 suggested , hitler 's mind gradually focused on staging a vain but heroic last stand . part 10 explores various explanations , including a " suicidal urge " in the dictator 's personality . suicide mission hitler 's all-or-nothing approach has been described by his biographers as a key to his rise , and an exiled german writer , sebastian haffner , suggested as early as 1940 that the method was also the mark of a " potential self-killer . " with all dissent punished , the changing attitudes of the german public and the soldiers is more difficult to establish , particularly in the closing months of the war , when the documentary record of a germany sinking into chaos and defeat is sparse . the history emphasizes that german fanaticism was not monolithic and that german attitudes in any case were contradictory . while other types of history explore the moral failure that led the germans to ravage europe and unleash the holocaust , a military history takes a more technical look at what the military did , how it nursed its resources and what its political masters aimed for . tired germans rolf-dieter mueller , editor of part 10 and leader of its 11 authors , writes in an analytic summary that by 1943 , after four exhausting years of war , a majority of germans probably would have accepted a surrender if it had not been for hitler 's determination to fight on regardless . the volume 's account of the war on the western front in 1944 and 1945 describes the german military fighting on towards self-destruction under mottoes such as " for honor " and " for the fatherland , " believing they were " doing their duty . " " that was their common denominator with a majority of the germans , who had been simply sticking to what they were doing , or had not sought any alternative , or had not been able to visualize any other way , " the book says . the chapter on the army 's last stand describes the fanatical refusal to surrender that made germany 's own military the greatest danger to germany 's own people , but it also refers to the many cases of officers and men who indirectly saved fellow germans ' lives . on their own responsibility and often risking execution for treason , some of the german military openly disobeyed orders or subtly wasted time so that the allied invasion of germany could proceed quickly without even more loss of lives and property . no alternative ? the epilogue to the work states , " hitler waged his personal war for six years , supported by sentiment in germany that remained broadly favorable even after a series of defeats and never turned to public resentment , despite growing apathy and war weariness . " to the germans , no alternative appeared feasible , other than the unconditional surrender demanded by the enemy , " the book adds . most of the rest of the world was needed to defeat the most efficient fighting machine of its generation , which had battled on despite hitler 's strategic blunders . its commanders refused to sue for peace when it became the militarily rational thing to do , and remained loyal to the dictator because of their own collaboration with his criminal objectives . explaining modern germany 's reluctance to fight the taliban and its focus on collective defense , the last part says the war taught post-war germans an abiding lesson and they deliberately renounced any capacity to wage a war of their own ever again . germany 's submission to nato has meant that the second world war was the " last war of the germans " in history . dpa news agency -lrb- win -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

such a tariff offers energy producers a guaranteed price for energy that they feed into the grid from renewable sources , and was the key stimulus in boosting the european solar sector . but there are many other factors in play . the next big thing ? for instance , it 's no coincidence that the conference is taking place in san francisco .

but the changes do n't go far enough , says deutsche welle 's sabine kinkartz . imagine that you 're highly qualified .
you 've completed your studies and gotten the best grades , you 've been working for a couple of years as an engineer , a process technician or an it specialist , you 've done additional training , fine-tuned your skills and are earning good money . maybe you ’ ve started a family and found friends .
in short - you 're feeling good and have found your place in life , wherever it may be .
what could bring you to give up all this , immigrate to germany and work here ?
ca n't think of anything ?
i can understand . but germany 's federal government does n't .
it still hopes that it can lure highly skilled people with a university degree to germany in large numbers .
it 's an old hope that 's been disappointed so far : in 2006 , only 456 highly qualified people received permanent residence status - 10 fewer than last year . minimum salary the minimum salary requirement is the biggest hurdle .
anyone who wants to come here without fulfilling any other requirements has to be able to prove that he or she is earning a hefty salary - in the future , it 'll still be twice the amount of an average german salary . but who earns that much and more ?
senior specialists and not young , highly qualified graduates at the beginning of their careers .
the latter , however , are the ones being sought by industry here , because they are still flexible . that 's why the new action program to secure the supply of specialists has business leaders shaking their heads . a system that does n't take into account the needs of the german labor market and an applicant 's ability to integrate can not work . in the it sector , every second company is saying that business is down because vacant positions can not be filled .
the association of german engineers says that there are 96,000 jobs available - twice as many as four years ago . politicians not listening the government hears what the business community is saying - but it does n't really want to listen .
the labor minister says that the lack of skilled workers ca n't be as bad as the industry is saying .
at the same time , he admits that he does n't really know what the situation is like .
why should he ?
in the end , he 's more concerned with protecting rather than opening the labor market .
germany has three million unemployed people - a long-time social democrat can not open borders under such circumstances ! other states do exactly that and are way ahead when it comes to competing for the world 's smartest heads .
the netherlands , for example , has adjusted the minimum salary requirements to be in line with those of skilled local professional beginners . plenty of choices the german labor market on the other hand is only opening up for those who do n't have to work in germany .
it 's opening up for people so highly qualified that they can decide whether they want to stay in their own countries or - if they 're from india , china or south america - would n't rather go to english-speaking countries such as australia , britain , canada or the us , where the will have to worry less about resentment . the new immigration measures taken by the federal government are a step in the right direction .
but they 're miles away from reaching the target . sabine kinkartz is dw-radio 's business correspondent in berlin . -lrb- win -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

it still hopes that it can lure highly skilled people with a university degree to germany in large numbers .
it 's an old hope that 's been disappointed so far : in 2006 , only 456 highly qualified people received permanent residence status - 10 fewer than last year . minimum salary the minimum salary requirement is the biggest hurdle .
anyone who wants to come here without fulfilling any other requirements has to be able to prove that he or she is earning a hefty salary - in the future , it 'll still be twice the amount of an average german salary . but who earns that much and more ?
senior specialists and not young , highly qualified graduates at the beginning of their careers .
the latter , however , are the ones being sought by industry here , because they are still flexible . that 's why the new action program to secure the supply of specialists has business leaders shaking their heads . a system that does n't take into account the needs of the german labor market and an applicant 's ability to integrate can not work . in the it sector , every second company is saying that business is down because vacant positions can not be filled .
the association of german engineers says that there are 96,000 jobs available - twice as many as four years ago . politicians not listening the government hears what the business community is saying - but it does n't really want to listen .
the labor minister says that the lack of skilled workers ca n't be as bad as the industry is saying .
at the same time , he admits that he does n't really know what the situation is like .
why should he ?
in the end , he 's more concerned with protecting rather than opening the labor market .
germany has three million unemployed people - a long-time social democrat can not open borders under such circumstances ! other states do exactly that and are way ahead when it comes to competing for the world 's smartest heads .
the netherlands , for example , has adjusted the minimum salary requirements to be in line with those of skilled local professional beginners . plenty of choices the german labor market on the other hand is only opening up for those who do n't have to work in germany .
it 's opening up for people so highly qualified that they can decide whether they want to stay in their own countries or - if they 're from india , china or south america - would n't rather go to english-speaking countries such as australia , britain , canada or the us , where the will have to worry less about resentment . the new immigration measures taken by the federal government are a step in the right direction .

" rome should provide a signal that crimes such as genocide , crimes against humanity , war crimes and crimes of aggression will in the future no longer go unpunished , " said the head of the german delegation in rome , gerd westdickenberg . the fundamental idea that emerged from the rome conference was that every country should pass laws that would require even high-ranking politicians and military officials to answer charges of human rights abuses before a court . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : luis moreno ocampo the icc , which was launched in 2002 , is based on the theory that such people could be extradited to a standing international court if a country 's own justice system was not capable of prosecuting them . " we 're a backup system , " said the icc 's lead prosecutor luis moreno-ocampo .
" we 're not a supreme court of the world . " several countries have since passed laws that allow war crimes , even genocide , to be prosecuted in national courts .
germany passed its own legislation in 2002 that regulated crimes against public international law to bring its own laws into accordance with the rome statue .
indirectly , it prevents german citizens from being taken in front of the icc . refusing to sign but those who support an international court which steps in when national courts can not , or will not , are distressed by the refusal of those countries that refused to sign the treaty . these are not a few small nations run by dictators , but major world players such as the united states and india .
china and russia have also withheld their signatures . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : sudan and the situation in darfur is now a concern of the icc even today , us president george w. bush has shown no sign of reconsidering his refusal to sign the rome statute and in a move almost unique in legal history , even withdrew american support after it had been given . the administration of previous president bill clinton had signed the treaty in its last days in office so that it could take part in consultations on details of the court . but in 2002 , washington " unsigned " the treaty , arguing that the court could create havoc for the united states , exposing american soldiers and officials overseas to capricious and mischievous prosecutions . " as the united states works to bring peace around the whole world , our diplomats and our soldiers could be dragged into this court , " bush said .
" and that 's very troubling to me .
we 'll try to work out the impasse at the united nations but one thing we 're not going to do is sign on to the international criminal court . " bush has shown no interest in following germany 's example and passing laws that would make war crimes a punishable offense .
instead , he has tried to weaken the icc by establishing non-extradition agreements with individual nations regarding american citizens . those are linked with threats to withhold military aid for the land if such deals are not made .
he has had some success with this strategy . growing credibility bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : judges of the international criminal court at the start of a hearing in the meantime , the row over the icc between critics of the rome statute , such as washington , and its biggest proponents , who are mostly in europe , has gotten quieter .
that has something to do with the fact that the court is busy for now with cases in the democratic republic of congo , uganda , the central african republic and darfur . " i had to choose the cases according to gravity .
and the gravest cases happened in africa , " said prosecutor moreno-ocampo . but as the icc continues its work to bring those who commit grave human rights abuses to justice , new york-based political analyst jeff laurenti believes it is gaining credibility around the globe , despite the vocal critics . " the court will be proving itself despite the bush administration 's knee-jerk hostility , " he said .
" that creates the opportunity to demonstrate that the paranoia about the icc that has been propagated by the right wing is unjustified and misplaced . " a change in washington 's attitude could be developing .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de energy -pipe- 17.07.2008 german expert predicts us solar energy boom großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : this might soon be a common sight in the us , according to some the us might still lag behind in promoting alternative energies , but at least one german expert is convinced that this is bound to change in the very near future . there 's something incongruous about experts from normally cloudy germany coming to california , the land of eternal sunshine , to teach the locals about how to harness solar power . but that 's was happening this week in san francisco , where organizers of the world 's largest solar exhibition , germany 's intersolar , launched an american version of their confab amid predictions of a massive solar boom in the ailing us economy . conference chairman professor eicke weber , director of the fraunhofer institute for solar energy systems , insists that it makes perfect sense for germans to bring their solar accumen to the golden state . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : americans are already beginning to cut back on their driving habits as soaring fuel costs combine with rapidly changing public perceptions about the dangers of climate change , the us embrace of solar power is at a tipping point , he predicts .
soon , the us will follow the massive investments already made in europe in renewable energy , where thanks to strong government support the solar industry is years ahead of its american counterpart . " before , our only argument was the environment , but now with oil at $ 140 -lrb- 88 euros -rrb- a barrel , i think the much stronger argument will be the pocketbook , " he said .
" that 's why i think solar energy will have a great future in the united states . " no backing from bush one indication of the gulf that separates the two continents is the size of their solar exhibitions .
the german intersolar has been growing at some 30 percent a year .
the recent munich expo attracted more than 1,000 exhibitors and 50,000 attendees from 140 countries . in contrast , the san francisco intersolar has only 200 exhibitors and 12,000 attendees . the major reason for the difference is the scope of government support , or the lack of it in the united states .
under president george w. bush , a former oil company executive , the federal government until recently denied the science of climate change .
vice president dick cheney famously dismissed conservation as a meaningless personal virtue . though the us does offer homeowners a one-time , $ 2,000 federal tax credit for the installation of photo-voltaic systems that convert solar energy into electricity , weber argued that it needed a so-called feed-in tariff to really allow the sector to take off .
such a tariff offers energy producers a guaranteed price for energy that they feed into the grid from renewable sources , and was the key stimulus in boosting the european solar sector . but there are many other factors in play . the next big thing ? for instance , it 's no coincidence that the conference is taking place in san francisco .
the city is the northern anchor of silicon valley , where an ever-increasing pool of venture capital and a growing number of start-ups are chasing the solar dream . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : sunpower corp. ceo thomas warner next to the solar panels on the roof of the sunpower building in san jose many are already predicting a solar boom , akin to the dot-com boom that accompanied the rise of the internet .
some start-ups like nanosolar and solyndra are already valued at more than $ 1 billion before they 've ever made a profit , reflecting the huge growth potential that wall street sees in the solar field . the comparisons to california 's tech industry do not end there .
solar-cell production is a close cousin to the production of computer chips , and there is a constant exchange of personnel , techniques and equipment between the two sectors . " each time we double the volume of production , the cost goes down by 20 percent , " weber said .
" at the end of the day , it will be the least expensive energy of all .
we just need a little help to ignite the revolution . " dan martin , who heads semicon west , a trade association of semiconductor manufacturers , believes the same dynamic - that dramatically reduced the price of computer chips while simultaneously increasing their power - will also characterize the solar voltaics sector . " we are going to change the world , " he said .

" rome should provide a signal that crimes such as genocide , crimes against humanity , war crimes and crimes of aggression will in the future no longer go unpunished , " said the head of the german delegation in rome , gerd westdickenberg . the fundamental idea that emerged from the rome conference was that every country should pass laws that would require even high-ranking politicians and military officials to answer charges of human rights abuses before a court . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : luis moreno ocampo the icc , which was launched in 2002 , is based on the theory that such people could be extradited to a standing international court if a country 's own justice system was not capable of prosecuting them . " we 're a backup system , " said the icc 's lead prosecutor luis moreno-ocampo .
" we 're not a supreme court of the world . " several countries have since passed laws that allow war crimes , even genocide , to be prosecuted in national courts .
germany passed its own legislation in 2002 that regulated crimes against public international law to bring its own laws into accordance with the rome statue .
indirectly , it prevents german citizens from being taken in front of the icc . refusing to sign but those who support an international court which steps in when national courts can not , or will not , are distressed by the refusal of those countries that refused to sign the treaty . these are not a few small nations run by dictators , but major world players such as the united states and india .
china and russia have also withheld their signatures . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : sudan and the situation in darfur is now a concern of the icc even today , us president george w. bush has shown no sign of reconsidering his refusal to sign the rome statute and in a move almost unique in legal history , even withdrew american support after it had been given . the administration of previous president bill clinton had signed the treaty in its last days in office so that it could take part in consultations on details of the court . but in 2002 , washington " unsigned " the treaty , arguing that the court could create havoc for the united states , exposing american soldiers and officials overseas to capricious and mischievous prosecutions . " as the united states works to bring peace around the whole world , our diplomats and our soldiers could be dragged into this court , " bush said .
" and that 's very troubling to me .
we 'll try to work out the impasse at the united nations but one thing we 're not going to do is sign on to the international criminal court . " bush has shown no interest in following germany 's example and passing laws that would make war crimes a punishable offense .
instead , he has tried to weaken the icc by establishing non-extradition agreements with individual nations regarding american citizens . those are linked with threats to withhold military aid for the land if such deals are not made .
he has had some success with this strategy . growing credibility bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : judges of the international criminal court at the start of a hearing in the meantime , the row over the icc between critics of the rome statute , such as washington , and its biggest proponents , who are mostly in europe , has gotten quieter .
that has something to do with the fact that the court is busy for now with cases in the democratic republic of congo , uganda , the central african republic and darfur . " i had to choose the cases according to gravity .
and the gravest cases happened in africa , " said prosecutor moreno-ocampo . but as the icc continues its work to bring those who commit grave human rights abuses to justice , new york-based political analyst jeff laurenti believes it is gaining credibility around the globe , despite the vocal critics . " the court will be proving itself despite the bush administration 's knee-jerk hostility , " he said .
" that creates the opportunity to demonstrate that the paranoia about the icc that has been propagated by the right wing is unjustified and misplaced . " a change in washington 's attitude could be developing .
when the un security council referred the case of darfur and sudanese president omar hassan al-bashir to the hague , the us could have vetoed the move , but did n't .

while originally supporting the idea , the city 's mayor is now not so certain any more that the winning design is the best one to build . the city is home to the oldest jewish community north of the alps and still has significant remains of the old jewish quarter , including the ruins of a mikwe , or ritual bath , just in front of cologne 's city hall . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the mikwe in front of city hall can be seen through a glass pyramid that 's why this particular spot was also chosen as the location of a future museum .
a design by saarbruecken-based architectural firm wandel hoefer lorch was overwhelmingly chosen by an expert jury . it all happened so quickly that members of the private foundation planning to pay for the construction said that it had n't collected any of the 20 million euros -lrb- $ 31.7 million -rrb- needed . they might not have to hurry . while cologne 's conservative mayor fritz schramma had originally voiced enthusiastic support for the plan , he 's since backed away from it . too massive ? bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : schramma supports the museum idea in general schramma says that he 's concerned that the new building would be too massive for the square in front of city hall .
the mayor now wants to give residents a chance to review all of the designs that were entered in the competition and then vote on them . while not accusing the mayor of anti-semitism , jewish leaders criticized schramma for giving in to concerns by others , including a neighboring arts museum . " there are rumors that the wallraf richartz museum is n't happy with the design , " salomon korn , a vice president of the central council of jews in germany , who sat on the selection jury , told german public radio deutschlandradio . an authentic place bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : korn thinks the square at city hall would be the best place korn , who is an architect himself , said that the winning design is far from massive and would actually return the space closer to its original state before buildings there were destroyed during world war ii . he also said that it made little sense to move the museum elsewhere , since the location in front of city hall was the historic site of germany 's jewish community and could therefore become a " crystallization core for remembrance . " " there 's only one authentic place " for the museum , korn said . dw staff -lrb- win -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

she points out that the fashion week in new york , one of today 's undisputed capitals of couture , was not a great success when it began . but perhaps most telling , and perhaps discouraging for fashionistas in berlin , was a recent interview in the tagesspiegel daily with suzy menkes , one of the world 's top fashion journalists . when asked if she thought berlin 's fashion week was important , she responded , " oh , i have to admit , i did n't really know that a fashion week was taking place in berlin .

while originally supporting the idea , the city 's mayor is now not so certain any more that the winning design is the best one to build . the city is home to the oldest jewish community north of the alps and still has significant remains of the old jewish quarter , including the ruins of a mikwe , or ritual bath , just in front of cologne 's city hall . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the mikwe in front of city hall can be seen through a glass pyramid that 's why this particular spot was also chosen as the location of a future museum .
a design by saarbruecken-based architectural firm wandel hoefer lorch was overwhelmingly chosen by an expert jury . it all happened so quickly that members of the private foundation planning to pay for the construction said that it had n't collected any of the 20 million euros -lrb- $ 31.7 million -rrb- needed . they might not have to hurry . while cologne 's conservative mayor fritz schramma had originally voiced enthusiastic support for the plan , he 's since backed away from it . too massive ? bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : schramma supports the museum idea in general schramma says that he 's concerned that the new building would be too massive for the square in front of city hall .
the mayor now wants to give residents a chance to review all of the designs that were entered in the competition and then vote on them . while not accusing the mayor of anti-semitism , jewish leaders criticized schramma for giving in to concerns by others , including a neighboring arts museum . " there are rumors that the wallraf richartz museum is n't happy with the design , " salomon korn , a vice president of the central council of jews in germany , who sat on the selection jury , told german public radio deutschlandradio . an authentic place bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : korn thinks the square at city hall would be the best place korn , who is an architect himself , said that the winning design is far from massive and would actually return the space closer to its original state before buildings there were destroyed during world war ii . he also said that it made little sense to move the museum elsewhere , since the location in front of city hall was the historic site of germany 's jewish community and could therefore become a " crystallization core for remembrance .

" rome should provide a signal that crimes such as genocide , crimes against humanity , war crimes and crimes of aggression will in the future no longer go unpunished , " said the head of the german delegation in rome , gerd westdickenberg . the fundamental idea that emerged from the rome conference was that every country should pass laws that would require even high-ranking politicians and military officials to answer charges of human rights abuses before a court . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : luis moreno ocampo the icc , which was launched in 2002 , is based on the theory that such people could be extradited to a standing international court if a country 's own justice system was not capable of prosecuting them . " we 're a backup system , " said the icc 's lead prosecutor luis moreno-ocampo .
" we 're not a supreme court of the world . " several countries have since passed laws that allow war crimes , even genocide , to be prosecuted in national courts .
germany passed its own legislation in 2002 that regulated crimes against public international law to bring its own laws into accordance with the rome statue .
indirectly , it prevents german citizens from being taken in front of the icc . refusing to sign but those who support an international court which steps in when national courts can not , or will not , are distressed by the refusal of those countries that refused to sign the treaty . these are not a few small nations run by dictators , but major world players such as the united states and india .
china and russia have also withheld their signatures . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : sudan and the situation in darfur is now a concern of the icc even today , us president george w. bush has shown no sign of reconsidering his refusal to sign the rome statute and in a move almost unique in legal history , even withdrew american support after it had been given . the administration of previous president bill clinton had signed the treaty in its last days in office so that it could take part in consultations on details of the court . but in 2002 , washington " unsigned " the treaty , arguing that the court could create havoc for the united states , exposing american soldiers and officials overseas to capricious and mischievous prosecutions . " as the united states works to bring peace around the whole world , our diplomats and our soldiers could be dragged into this court , " bush said .
" and that 's very troubling to me .
we 'll try to work out the impasse at the united nations but one thing we 're not going to do is sign on to the international criminal court . " bush has shown no interest in following germany 's example and passing laws that would make war crimes a punishable offense .
instead , he has tried to weaken the icc by establishing non-extradition agreements with individual nations regarding american citizens . those are linked with threats to withhold military aid for the land if such deals are not made .
he has had some success with this strategy . growing credibility bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : judges of the international criminal court at the start of a hearing in the meantime , the row over the icc between critics of the rome statute , such as washington , and its biggest proponents , who are mostly in europe , has gotten quieter .
that has something to do with the fact that the court is busy for now with cases in the democratic republic of congo , uganda , the central african republic and darfur . " i had to choose the cases according to gravity .
and the gravest cases happened in africa , " said prosecutor moreno-ocampo . but as the icc continues its work to bring those who commit grave human rights abuses to justice , new york-based political analyst jeff laurenti believes it is gaining credibility around the globe , despite the vocal critics . " the court will be proving itself despite the bush administration 's knee-jerk hostility , " he said .
" that creates the opportunity to demonstrate that the paranoia about the icc that has been propagated by the right wing is unjustified and misplaced . " a change in washington 's attitude could be developing .
when the un security council referred the case of darfur and sudanese president omar hassan al-bashir to the hague , the us could have vetoed the move , but did n't .

while originally supporting the idea , the city 's mayor is now not so certain any more that the winning design is the best one to build . the city is home to the oldest jewish community north of the alps and still has significant remains of the old jewish quarter , including the ruins of a mikwe , or ritual bath , just in front of cologne 's city hall . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the mikwe in front of city hall can be seen through a glass pyramid that 's why this particular spot was also chosen as the location of a future museum .
a design by saarbruecken-based architectural firm wandel hoefer lorch was overwhelmingly chosen by an expert jury . it all happened so quickly that members of the private foundation planning to pay for the construction said that it had n't collected any of the 20 million euros -lrb- $ 31.7 million -rrb- needed . they might not have to hurry . while cologne 's conservative mayor fritz schramma had originally voiced enthusiastic support for the plan , he 's since backed away from it . too massive ? bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : schramma supports the museum idea in general schramma says that he 's concerned that the new building would be too massive for the square in front of city hall .
the mayor now wants to give residents a chance to review all of the designs that were entered in the competition and then vote on them . while not accusing the mayor of anti-semitism , jewish leaders criticized schramma for giving in to concerns by others , including a neighboring arts museum . " there are rumors that the wallraf richartz museum is n't happy with the design , " salomon korn , a vice president of the central council of jews in germany , who sat on the selection jury , told german public radio deutschlandradio . an authentic place bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : korn thinks the square at city hall would be the best place korn , who is an architect himself , said that the winning design is far from massive and would actually return the space closer to its original state before buildings there were destroyed during world war ii . he also said that it made little sense to move the museum elsewhere , since the location in front of city hall was the historic site of germany 's jewish community and could therefore become a " crystallization core for remembrance .

" this is my appeal to break out of the spiral of violence .
a lack of dialogue is not an option for the future , " he said after meeting with his georgian counterpart eka tkeshelashvili .
steinmeier , who chairs the so-called group of friends of the united nations ' secretary on georgia , is proposing a three-phase peace plan based on a mutual declaration of non-violence and repatriation of about 25,000 ethnic georgians expelled from abkhazia in the 1990s .
negotiations over the status of the two rebel regions , which have enjoyed de facto autonomy since the end of a civil war in 1994 , was reserved for the final phase of negotiations .
tkeshelashvili said , " the plan has great potential for success , " but added that the most difficult thing would be to convince russia .
peace talks remain distant the threat of armed conflict in the region last month has given urgency to international pressure for renewed peace talks , but tbilisi , moscow and the russian-backed regions remain far apart on the basic premises for restarting peace talks .

russia 's foreign minister sergei lavrov was skeptical of peace efforts thursday .
" signing of a treaty on the return of georgian refugees to abkhazia is unreal now , because such a return requires a calm situation , " lavrov was quoted as saying by news agency ria-novosti .
" we think that signing a treaty on the non-use of force without any preconditions is an absolutely unavoidable first step , " he added .
experts see little hope for steinmeier 's plan analysts do not expect anything conclusive from steinmeier 's trip , pointing to intransigence on the part of the abkhaz president sergei bagapsh , who said he would " not consider the plan . "
" we are not going to discuss abkhazia 's status with anyone .
we are building an independent , democratic state , " bagapsh was quoted by georgian news agencies as saying .

we are building an independent , democratic state , " bagapsh was quoted by georgian news agencies as saying .

berlin 's fashion week kicks off on thursday , july 17 .
the young and hip , and established designers , will be showing their clothes all around the capital .
berlin hopes it 'll attract attention in the wider fashion world . berlin is known around the world for its creative scene , be it music , art or performance .
it 's also trying to make a name for itself in the fashion world , although it 's proving to be an uphill road . proponents of berlin as a emerging fashion metropolis say it 's beginning to come into its own , and in addition to the small , one-room fashion start-ups run by young people in their 20s , well-known designers are also coming to the german capital to present their collections , even if it 's usually their secondary lines . vivienne westwood will show her number two line " anglomania " this week and bigger german labels " hugo , " " joop jeans " and " strenesse blue " are showing their 2009 spring and summer collections . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : from the fall / winter 2008/2009 collection of the label strenesse blue " we think berlin will gain importance as a fashion city , just because of the location , " mercedes-benz fashion week spokeswoman nora rochlitzer told the koelner stadt-anzeiger daily .
" berlin is in the center of europe and from here we can conquer anything , even eastern europe . " the capital will be dotted with smaller venues which will show off work from younger designers , such as the 120 who have been invited to a series of small storefronts in berlin 's largely immigrant wedding district . " we do n't want to withdraw and drink champagne , but celebrate with our neighbors , " said christoph steinweg , the organizer of " wedding dress 3 . " larger stores , like the galeries lafayette department store in downtown berlin , are showing off the collections of 13 well known berlin labels , such as c.neeon , von wedel & tiedeken and pulver . lots of creativity , little commerce but while germany is strong when it comes to creative potential , with its lively arts and fashion scene , it 's the business aspect of things that is lacking , experts say . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : berlin 's got the creative spirit , but fashion business is still done in duesseldorf " berlin does n't have any commercial dimension , " said thomas rasch , director of the german fashion association germany fashion .
" business is done in duesseldorf . " rochlitzer defends berlin as a fashion capital , saying people love to talk it down , but they should give it a chance .
she points out that the fashion week in new york , one of today 's undisputed capitals of couture , was not a great success when it began . but perhaps most telling , and perhaps discouraging for fashionistas in berlin , was a recent interview in the tagesspiegel daily with suzy menkes , one of the world 's top fashion journalists . when asked if she thought berlin 's fashion week was important , she responded , " oh , i have to admit , i did n't really know that a fashion week was taking place in berlin .

" the whole of germany is looking forward to the 2018 winter games in munich , " said german interior minister wolfgang schaeuble when the official bid committee was inaugurated on this week in the city 's town hall . " it has been quite a while since we successfully bid for the olympic games .
we will do everything to succeed , " he said . the 1972 summer games in munich were the last olympics in the country - with berlin and garmisch-partenkirchen hosting the summer and winter editions , respectively , in 1936 . berchtesgaden flopped for the 1992 winter games , while berlin and leipzig came nowhere close to international olympic committee confidence in their bids for the 2000 and 2012 summer games . " munich plus two " garmisch is in the frame again as part of munich 's bid , set to stage the snow events .
sliding competition is to take place on the existing track in koeniggssee while all other ice events are set for the host city of munich . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the last german olympic games were in munich in 1972 - and marked by tragedy the campaign is suitably named " munich plus two " as other famous bavarian wintersport venues such as inzell -lrb- speed-skating -rrb- and ruhpolding -lrb- biathlon -rrb- were dropped in favor of a bid as compact as possible . munich mayor christian ude did not hide the city 's determination to make history as the first host of summer and winter games - preferably with the first attempt like in 1972 . " munich has a tradition to get the nod on the first attempt .
it is a fantastic perspective for munich 's future to become the first city in the world to stage the wwinter games after the summer games , " said ude . german olympic supremo thomas bach said there was no plan b should munich fail in the 2011 ioc vote . wilfried spronk , the experienced former head of munich 's olympiapark -lrb- the main area of the 1972 games -rrb- company , has been hired as managing director . spronk 's first task is to raise the 30 million euros -lrb- $ 47.8 million -rrb- munich needs for the bid procedure .
the money is to come from sponsors and not tax payers . geography to play a role while munich fits the seemingly preferred ioc requirement for a winter games host , a relatively large city close to mountains , its fate could also depend on the next olympic elections for 2016 . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the winter olympics in 2014 will take place in sochi , russia with the 2012 summer games and 2014 winter olympics in london and sochi , respectively , munich 's chances may look grim if the 2016 summer edition is awarded to europe again .
madrid is bidding against chicago , tokyo and rio de janeiro . in addition , munich will face big rivals on its own .
the narrow 2010 and 2014 loser pyeongchang of south korea is expected to make another bid , along with tromso -lrb- norway -rrb- , grenoble -lrb- france -rrb- , geneva -lrb- switzerland -rrb- and a possible us candidate . however , the ioc vice-president bach urged munich not to look at the other bidders , but at its own strength instead .

the move comes after a long campaign by forces charity the royal british legion , and some families have felt the need to go to them for help .
among them is jane , whose husband is a non-commissioned officer in the army .
she told the bbc that her husband developed asthma as a result of the mould and damp in their mod-provided married quarters , and that those in charge of that accommodation were slow to act despite repeated complaints .
" we were left to live in house with damp and mould , and i was really annoyed , knowing that they would n't live in those conditions , " she said .
" the walls were black , things were dripping down the walls , the bathroom , the bedroom , the kitchen were all black with mould .
" all our kit got ruined , and in the end my husband and i had to move into the spare room , which was n't as bad because in our room it was dreadful .
so we slept in the box-room . "
the family only received new accommodation when they were posted elsewhere .
jane hopes that the government paper will ensure better treatment for families living in service accommodation .
' very hard ' karen has a similar story .
she and her husband have lived in married quarters for several years , but a flood in 2004 brought down the ceiling and ruined most of their possessions . "
if you complain , then the husband is told ' get your wife back in line , or your career will suffer " ' " karen " better support for forces on way send us your comments " the people in charge of maintenance told me it was n't an emergency , and they 'd come out in a few hours , " she said .
" in the end , i had to threaten legal action to get anything done . "
the house , which they still live in , continues to have plumbing problems , with leaking radiators regularly flooding the floors .
karen says that maintenance contractors employed by the mod have simply replastered their home and painted over the cracks , though the initial problems remain .
" the problem is that they do n't really care about families if you 're not an officer 's wife .
" if you want to be anything other than a wife who stays at home to look after the kids , to have a career , while married to someone in the armed forces , it 's very hard .
" and if you complain , then the husband is told ' get your wife back in line , or your career will suffer ' . "
' much expected ' in a recent mod survey , a third of respondents cited being away from family and friends for long periods while on operation as one reason they had thought about leaving the armed forces .
karen says the current pressures on military families , especially spouses , are huge .
" we almost divorced because of those pressures .
" i was very depressed when our last posting meant leaving a job i loved , uprooting ourselves and leaving my friends .
" i grieved for my old life .
so much is expected of forces ' families . "
the mod has said it was committed to high-quality military housing , with £ 8bn being spent in the next 10 years .
on accommodation , the chief of the defence staff , sir jock stirrup , admitted housing was a well-known problem that the mod was trying to deal with .
" this is the result of decades of underinvestment - decades , " he said .
" and it 's a massive problem .
remember we have , in terms of single living accommodation alone , over 160,000 bed spaces across 16 countries . "
better treatment some in the forces also feel that they are disadvantaged when it comes to receiving nhs medical care .
when being posted to a new base , forces families often lose their place on the waiting list and have to start again from scratch .
some of those who should receive priority treatment as serving or former members of the forces say they can not always get it .
the command paper is expected to guarantee improved access to specially-adapted accommodation for seriously injured troops , more streamlined access to healthcare and dental care for service people and their families - with guarantees of keeping their place on nhs waiting lists even if they move there is also set to be free university education for servicemen and women leaving after at least six years of service , as well as better access to school places for service children .

the move comes after a long campaign by forces charity the royal british legion , and some families have felt the need to go to them for help .
among them is jane , whose husband is a non-commissioned officer in the army .
she told the bbc that her husband developed asthma as a result of the mould and damp in their mod-provided married quarters , and that those in charge of that accommodation were slow to act despite repeated complaints .
" we were left to live in house with damp and mould , and i was really annoyed , knowing that they would n't live in those conditions , " she said .
" the walls were black , things were dripping down the walls , the bathroom , the bedroom , the kitchen were all black with mould .
" all our kit got ruined , and in the end my husband and i had to move into the spare room , which was n't as bad because in our room it was dreadful .
so we slept in the box-room . "
the family only received new accommodation when they were posted elsewhere .
jane hopes that the government paper will ensure better treatment for families living in service accommodation .
' very hard ' karen has a similar story .
she and her husband have lived in married quarters for several years , but a flood in 2004 brought down the ceiling and ruined most of their possessions .

" in the end , i had to threaten legal action to get anything done . "
the house , which they still live in , continues to have plumbing problems , with leaking radiators regularly flooding the floors .
karen says that maintenance contractors employed by the mod have simply replastered their home and painted over the cracks , though the initial problems remain .
" the problem is that they do n't really care about families if you 're not an officer 's wife .
" if you want to be anything other than a wife who stays at home to look after the kids , to have a career , while married to someone in the armed forces , it 's very hard .
" and if you complain , then the husband is told ' get your wife back in line , or your career will suffer ' . "
' much expected ' in a recent mod survey , a third of respondents cited being away from family and friends for long periods while on operation as one reason they had thought about leaving the armed forces .
karen says the current pressures on military families , especially spouses , are huge .
" we almost divorced because of those pressures .
" i was very depressed when our last posting meant leaving a job i loved , uprooting ourselves and leaving my friends .
" i grieved for my old life .
so much is expected of forces ' families . "
the mod has said it was committed to high-quality military housing , with £ 8bn being spent in the next 10 years .
on accommodation , the chief of the defence staff , sir jock stirrup , admitted housing was a well-known problem that the mod was trying to deal with .

the move comes after a long campaign by forces charity the royal british legion , and some families have felt the need to go to them for help .
among them is jane , whose husband is a non-commissioned officer in the army .
she told the bbc that her husband developed asthma as a result of the mould and damp in their mod-provided married quarters , and that those in charge of that accommodation were slow to act despite repeated complaints .
" we were left to live in house with damp and mould , and i was really annoyed , knowing that they would n't live in those conditions , " she said .
" the walls were black , things were dripping down the walls , the bathroom , the bedroom , the kitchen were all black with mould .
" all our kit got ruined , and in the end my husband and i had to move into the spare room , which was n't as bad because in our room it was dreadful .
so we slept in the box-room . "
the family only received new accommodation when they were posted elsewhere .
jane hopes that the government paper will ensure better treatment for families living in service accommodation .
' very hard ' karen has a similar story .
she and her husband have lived in married quarters for several years , but a flood in 2004 brought down the ceiling and ruined most of their possessions .
if you complain , then the husband is told ' get your wife back in line , or your career will suffer ' " karen " better support for forces on way send us your comments " the people in charge of maintenance told me it was n't an emergency , and they 'd come out in a few hours , " she said .
" in the end , i had to threaten legal action to get anything done . "
the house , which they still live in , continues to have plumbing problems , with leaking radiators regularly flooding the floors .
karen says that maintenance contractors employed by the mod have simply replastered their home and painted over the cracks , though the initial problems remain .
" the problem is that they do n't really care about families if you 're not an officer 's wife .
" if you want to be anything other than a wife who stays at home to look after the kids , to have a career , while married to someone in the armed forces , it 's very hard .
" and if you complain , then the husband is told ' get your wife back in line , or your career will suffer ' . "
' much expected ' in a recent mod survey , a third of respondents cited being away from family and friends for long periods while on operation as one reason they had thought about leaving the armed forces .
karen says the current pressures on military families , especially spouses , are huge .
" we almost divorced because of those pressures .
" i was very depressed when our last posting meant leaving a job i loved , uprooting ourselves and leaving my friends .
" i grieved for my old life .
so much is expected of forces ' families . "
the mod has said it was committed to high-quality military housing , with £ 8bn being spent in the next 10 years .
on accommodation , the chief of the defence staff , sir jock stirrup , admitted housing was a well-known problem that the mod was trying to deal with .
" this is the result of decades of underinvestment - decades , " he said .
" and it 's a massive problem .

when being posted to a new base , forces families often lose their place on the waiting list and have to start again from scratch .
some of those who should receive priority treatment as serving or former members of the forces say they can not always get it .
the command paper is expected to guarantee improved access to specially-adapted accommodation for seriously injured troops , more streamlined access to healthcare and dental care for service people and their families - with guarantees of keeping their place on nhs waiting lists even if they move there is also set to be free university education for servicemen and women leaving after at least six years of service , as well as better access to school places for service children .

among the examples over a three year period , patient details from an entire children 's ward in wrexham were found on a piece of paper in a puddle .
in another revealed by bbc wales after freedom of information -lrb- foi -rrb- requests , a highly confidential child protection file was sent to the wrong address .
health minister edwina hart said she was " quite horrified " by the findings .
carol jones , of the board of community health councils in wales , says people will be angry .
she said staff losing such data should be disciplined .
the cases were revealed in responses to bbc wales to foi requests to the trusts , which provide services through hospitals , health centres and clinics .
the north east nhs trust reported the highest number of patients ' files lost or stolen - more than 50 - but this could be explained by better reporting or a more open approach to foi .
its other cases included a senior nurse finding a sheet of paper lying in a puddle that had " confidential and sensitive information " , including the names and diagnosis of every patient in the children 's ward at wrexham maelor hospital in march 2006 .
i was quite horrified at some of the information you showed me concerning patients and particularly children edwina hart , health minister the trust also reported five break-ins in one year at two premises in which computer equipment was stolen each time .
other trusts had several examples of computer thefts and confidential patient 's information being breached .
cardiff and vale had six computers - mainly laptops - stolen between december 2005 and november 2007 .
it said the computers were password protected but it was considering using encryption software for extra security .
conwy and denighshire also had a laptop stolen but it contained no personal data and was encrypted .

we 're actually taking money home with us this time , which we do n't normally do , " says marie quinn from consett in county durham .
mrs quinn , 44 , is here in the black sea resort of zlatni pyasatsi , which means golden sands , with her husband and two teenage children .
" it 's very nice .
the weather 's great , the food 's been fine , " she adds .
tour operators say the credit crunch and the exchange rate between sterling and the euro is tempting more brits seeking some sunshine to head for eastern europe .
" demand is definitely shifting , " says dermot halpin , from the travel website expedia .
" destinations outside the eurozone which are mid-haul rather than long haul , such as bulgaria and turkey , are on the up . "
there are 20,000 hotel beds here at golden sands - and with the thermometer touching 30c it 's any match for spain or france when it comes to the sun .
tourists wander along the seafront , some heading for the wide , sandy beach , others for a dip in the black sea .
i 've travelled here from the south of france - a traditional hotspot for british tourists in the summer .
but it 's much easier to find brits here than on the cote d 'azur .
perched on a bench with her friends and family , rebecca sheridan , 29 , from london , glances in the direction of the ministry of cocktails bar which stands between the sea and a model of the eiffel tower , which tourists stroll under on the way back to some of the hotels .
" a lot of my friends do n't really know where bulgaria is - but now it is up and coming more people are hearing about it and want to come over here , " she says .
" i really like it .
it 's hot , it 's friendly , they try to speak english and it 's cheap . "
price is a big factor for people here .
with the economy at home heading downhill , and the cost of the euro climbing , many tourists have opted to head out of the eurozone , and out of their comfort zone .
and most are n't disappointed .
a few days ago in st tropez in france , some visitors told me the resort had failed the " choc ice test " - the ice cream cost them the equivalent of £ 2.50 each .
here you can have one for just over £ 1 .
and if home comforts are what you 're after , they are not hard to find .
i head for a drink in the vectis tavern , which claims to be the only english-owned restaurant anywhere on the black sea coast .
named after a pub on the isle of wight , it sells 200 steak and ale pies every day , 200 cottage pies and 165 english breakfasts .
and customers can wash it all down with a mug of pg tips .
" we 're three or four times cheaper than spain , and the food is very nice ! " says joint manager gerry georgiev , 32 .
but , in this frontier land for western tourists , there are those who say the place simply is not good enough .
les and janet ward from manchester travel abroad regularly , and are not impressed .
" it 's very basic .
the buildings are tired , and the infrastructure is old-fashioned , " says mr ward , 69 .
" it 's not what you 're used to when you 've been to spain .
we do n't even have a fridge in our room .
we expected more . "
mrs ward , who 's also 69 , agrees .
" it 's like going back 30 or 40 years - and we do n't like it . "

we 're actually taking money home with us this time , which we do n't normally do , " says marie quinn from consett in county durham .
mrs quinn , 44 , is here in the black sea resort of zlatni pyasatsi , which means golden sands , with her husband and two teenage children .
" it 's very nice .
the weather 's great , the food 's been fine , " she adds .
the golden sands even has its own eiffel tower tour operators say the credit crunch and the exchange rate between sterling and the euro is tempting more brits seeking some sunshine to head for eastern europe .
" demand is definitely shifting , " says dermot halpin , from the travel website expedia .
" destinations outside the eurozone which are mid-haul rather than long haul , such as bulgaria and turkey , are on the up . "
there are 20,000 hotel beds here at golden sands - and with the thermometer touching 30c it 's any match for spain or france when it comes to the sun .
tourists wander along the seafront , some heading for the wide , sandy beach , others for a dip in the black sea .
i 've travelled here from the south of france - a traditional hotspot for british tourists in the summer .
but it 's much easier to find brits here than on the cote d 'azur .
rebecca sheridan and her family and friends are enjoying bulgaria perched on a bench with her friends and family , rebecca sheridan , 29 , from london , glances in the direction of the ministry of cocktails bar which stands between the sea and a model of the eiffel tower , which tourists stroll under on the way back to some of the hotels .
" a lot of my friends do n't really know where bulgaria is - but now it is up and coming more people are hearing about it and want to come over here , " she says .
" i really like it .
it 's hot , it 's friendly , they try to speak english and it 's cheap . "
price is a big factor for people here .
with the economy at home heading downhill , and the cost of the euro climbing , many tourists have opted to head out of the eurozone , and out of their comfort zone .
and most are n't disappointed .
a few days ago in st tropez in france , some visitors told me the resort had failed the " choc ice test " - the ice cream cost them the equivalent of £ 2.50 each .
here you can have one for just over £ 1 .
and if home comforts are what you 're after , they are not hard to find .
i head for a drink in the vectis tavern , which claims to be the only english-owned restaurant anywhere on the black sea coast .
familiar fare is on offer in the cafes and restaurants named after a pub on the isle of wight , it sells 200 steak and ale pies every day , 200 cottage pies and 165 english breakfasts .
and customers can wash it all down with a mug of pg tips .
" we 're three or four times cheaper than spain , and the food is very nice ! " says joint manager gerry georgiev , 32 .
but , in this frontier land for western tourists , there are those who say the place simply is not good enough .
les and janet ward from manchester travel abroad regularly , and are not impressed .
" it 's very basic .
the buildings are tired , and the infrastructure is old-fashioned , " says mr ward , 69 .
" it 's not what you 're used to when you 've been to spain .
we do n't even have a fridge in our room .
we expected more . "
mrs ward , who 's also 69 , agrees .

we 're actually taking money home with us this time , which we do n't normally do , " says marie quinn from consett in county durham .
mrs quinn , 44 , is here in the black sea resort of zlatni pyasatsi , which means golden sands , with her husband and two teenage children .
" it 's very nice .
the weather 's great , the food 's been fine , " she adds .
the golden sands even has its own eiffel tower tour operators say the credit crunch and the exchange rate between sterling and the euro is tempting more brits seeking some sunshine to head for eastern europe .
" demand is definitely shifting , " says dermot halpin , from the travel website expedia .
" destinations outside the eurozone which are mid-haul rather than long haul , such as bulgaria and turkey , are on the up . "
there are 20,000 hotel beds here at golden sands - and with the thermometer touching 30c it 's any match for spain or france when it comes to the sun .
tourists wander along the seafront , some heading for the wide , sandy beach , others for a dip in the black sea .

we 're actually taking money home with us this time , which we do n't normally do , " says marie quinn from consett in county durham .
mrs quinn , 44 , is here in the black sea resort of zlatni pyasatsi , which means golden sands , with her husband and two teenage children .
" it 's very nice .
the weather 's great , the food 's been fine , " she adds .
the golden sands even has its own eiffel tower tour operators say the credit crunch and the exchange rate between sterling and the euro is tempting more brits seeking some sunshine to head for eastern europe .
" demand is definitely shifting , " says dermot halpin , from the travel website expedia .
" destinations outside the eurozone which are mid-haul rather than long haul , such as bulgaria and turkey , are on the up . "
there are 20,000 hotel beds here at golden sands - and with the thermometer touching 30c it 's any match for spain or france when it comes to the sun .
tourists wander along the seafront , some heading for the wide , sandy beach , others for a dip in the black sea .
i 've travelled here from the south of france - a traditional hotspot for british tourists in the summer .
but it 's much easier to find brits here than on the cote d 'azur .
rebecca sheridan and her family and friends are enjoying bulgaria perched on a bench with her friends and family , rebecca sheridan , 29 , from london , glances in the direction of the ministry of cocktails bar which stands between the sea and a model of the eiffel tower , which tourists stroll under on the way back to some of the hotels .
" a lot of my friends do n't really know where bulgaria is - but now it is up and coming more people are hearing about it and want to come over here , " she says .
" i really like it .
it 's hot , it 's friendly , they try to speak english and it 's cheap . "
price is a big factor for people here .
with the economy at home heading downhill , and the cost of the euro climbing , many tourists have opted to head out of the eurozone , and out of their comfort zone .
and most are n't disappointed .
a few days ago in st tropez in france , some visitors told me the resort had failed the " choc ice test " - the ice cream cost them the equivalent of £ 2.50 each .
here you can have one for just over £ 1 .
and if home comforts are what you 're after , they are not hard to find .
i head for a drink in the vectis tavern , which claims to be the only english-owned restaurant anywhere on the black sea coast .
familiar fare is on offer in the cafes and restaurants named after a pub on the isle of wight , it sells 200 steak and ale pies every day , 200 cottage pies and 165 english breakfasts .
and customers can wash it all down with a mug of pg tips .
" we 're three or four times cheaper than spain , and the food is very nice ! " says joint manager gerry georgiev , 32 .
but , in this frontier land for western tourists , there are those who say the place simply is not good enough .
les and janet ward from manchester travel abroad regularly , and are not impressed .
" it 's very basic .
the buildings are tired , and the infrastructure is old-fashioned , " says mr ward , 69 .
" it 's not what you 're used to when you 've been to spain .
we do n't even have a fridge in our room .
we expected more . "
mrs ward , who 's also 69 , agrees .
" it 's like going back 30 or 40 years - and we do n't like it . "
it is a sentiment rochelle turner , head of research at which ?

" anecdotally , there is the same quality available in eastern europe as western europe , but you have to really look for it - you have to search harder and you have to search for longer .
it is there - but there 's not as much of it as in the west . "

the national bureau of statistics said the economy grew at an annual rate of 10.1 % in the three months to june , down from 10.6 % over the previous quarter .
if it keeps growing at a double-digit pace , then china may overtake germany as the world 's third-largest economy .

consumer price inflation also cooled to an annual rate of 7.1 % in june - a decline from 7.7 % in may .
but with producer prices rising to an annual rate of 8.8 % in june - the fastest pace of growth since the mid-1990s - the expectation is that the government will go further to make sure that these costs are not passed on to consumers .
" while inflation has been easing , it is still at a fairly high level , " said li xiaochao , the statistics bureau 's spokesman .
" if prices stay high for a long period , it 's not good for the stable development of the economy and will affect people 's lives , especially those with low incomes .
" so we have to continue with price controls to control inflation , " he added .
analysts considered that the growth figures were in line with expectations and despite signs that the economy has peaked , double-digit growth is still expected for the full year .

the national bureau of statistics said the economy grew at an annual rate of 10.1 % in the three months to june , down from 10.6 % over the previous quarter .
if it keeps growing at a double-digit pace , then china may overtake germany as the world 's third-largest economy .
beijing has been trying to curb rising food costs amid fears of social unrest .
consumer price inflation also cooled to an annual rate of 7.1 % in june - a decline from 7.7 % in may .
but with producer prices rising to an annual rate of 8.8 % in june - the fastest pace of growth since the mid-1990s - the expectation is that the government will go further to make sure that these costs are not passed on to consumers .
" while inflation has been easing , it is still at a fairly high level , " said li xiaochao , the statistics bureau 's spokesman .
" if prices stay high for a long period , it 's not good for the stable development of the economy and will affect people 's lives , especially those with low incomes .
" so we have to continue with price controls to control inflation , " he added .
analysts considered that the growth figures were in line with expectations and despite signs that the economy has peaked , double-digit growth is still expected for the full year .
