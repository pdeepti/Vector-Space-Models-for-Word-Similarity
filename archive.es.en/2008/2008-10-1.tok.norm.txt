program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de defense -pipe- 01.10.2008 france presses eu to revamp defense structures großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the eufor mission in kosovo has shown the eu can work together militarily eu defense ministers have kicked off a two-day meeting in france .
the french would like to see member states overhaul the way they cooperate militarily .
but is anyone lining up to salute ? as the defense ministers gathered in the french resort of deauville , french president nicolas sarkozy , who also holds the european union 's revolving presidency , set the tone for what he hopes will be a historical summit .
" how can europe be a political power that speaks with a strong voice if it is n't in a position to defend itself or take the appropriate measures to enact its defense policies , " sarkozy asked rhetorically .
the main aim of the summit , which runs until thursday , oct .
2 , is to create a rapid reaction force of 50-60,000 soldiers that could be deployed in the interests of eu security .
eu foreign policy chief javier solana also thinks the time has come for radical changes .
" one of the most important things the european union has to do is to act in real time , " solana said ahead of the summit .
" if you have a crisis or a political problem in the world and you do n't deal with it rapidly , you waste time , money and the lives , probably , of people . "
france would also like to see the creation of a general chief of staff office in brussels to oversee the force .
but as history shows , eu nations will have to show a lot of political will for member states to come together in the way paris and brussels would like .
a european army ?
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : communication and coordination remain key issues the european union , like nato , has no army of its own and instead depends upon member states to provide soldiers and material .
as a result , the bloc encounters difficulties coordinating its resources when trying to intervene militarily .
this was illustrated this week , when the eu was forced to ask russia to provide helicopters for its peacekeeping mission in chad - even though brussels and moscow were in a clinch over russian 's military incursions into georgia .
nonetheless , the maastricht treaty stipulates that the bloc have a common defense and security policy , and european military missions have proved successful in recent years .
most notably , a 1,800-person eufor force has successfully taken over responsibility for maintaining peace in kosovo from its un predecessor .
backers of reform hope that could help overcome resistance by some member states , particularly britain , to further integrating the eu 's military capabilities .
back to nato bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : charles de gaulle partially severed france 's ties with nato reform backers stress that a european force would be a supplement to , and not a replacement for , nato .
and nato may be france 's best card for pushing through changes .
france partially withdrew from the trans-atlantic alliance in 1966 and even today refuses to participate in the full range of nato activities .
paris has signaled that that could change , if it gets its way on european defense reforms .
" we will fully participate in nato , if nato fully realizes that the eu has a role , too , " an unnamed french official told reuters news agency .
but most likely the summit will produce a compromise , in which both sides of the issue get some , but not all of what they want . dw staff -lrb- jc -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

now , she ’ s won something bigger - the right livelihood award , or alternative nobel prize . back in 1992 , monika hauser read newspaper accounts of rape committed on a mass scale in bosnia .
rape had become a war tactic , and that thought sickened her . " i was angry too that the press was reporting on it so graphically - through-the-keyhole sorts of accounts , " she said .
" they couldn ’ t get enough .
i thought , these women were being used twice , so to speak , and i said to myself i ’ d like to do something about it . ” the swiss-born gynaecologist knew from her own practice in cologne that rape victims needed support and care , not just publicity , and so in 1993 she left for bosnia .
hauser , along with 20 local women , set up a trauma therapy center for rape victims in the bosnian city of zenica . hauser deplores " double standards " the project was a success , and hauser quickly gained fame in germany for her humanitarian efforts . german public television network ard ’ s news department awarded her its ‘ woman of the year ’ prize in 1993 .
the social democratic party honored her with a similar prize a year later . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : bosnian muslim women , victims of wartime rape , protesting outside the un in sarajevo earlier this year the accolades were helpful in raising publicity and funds for the clinic in zenica , and for the women ’ s foundation hauser founded , medica mondiale . since then hauser ’ s foundation has helped women in kosovo , albania , afghanistan , congo , iraq and uganda . but despite the laurels , hauser said , in the past decade politicians from germany and other eu countries have not really shown an increased interest in helping female victims of war crimes . a particular problem , she said , is that even as european troops participate in peacekeeping missions abroad , in part to protect women from crimes like rape , many of the soldiers themselves visit local brothels . the military leadership seems unbothered by the fact that many of these establishments frequented by the troops employ women who are underage or are working against their will . the double standard is frustrating , hauser said , adding she 'd learned to live with it . " you ’ ve got to have a high frustration threshold when you ’ re involved in feminist projects , " she said . " a big honor " in an interview with deutsche welle , hauser expressed surprise at winning the alternative nobel wednesday , saying she would “ accept it happily . ” in the past , hauser has been choosy about accepting prizes .
in 1996 , the german government wanted to award her its highest honor , the federal cross of merit -lrb- bundesverdienstkreuz -rrb- , but hauser turned them down .
she was unhappy that the state had threatened to deport thousands of bosnian refugees living in germany . the alternative nobel , however , she said , “ is really about recognizing social alternatives and honoring movements that have made an impact in changing the world . ” she added that “ it ’ s a big honor ” to be thought of in that way . the award is n't just a honor but also comes with a $ 50,000-euro purse .
hauser said she would split the money between her first project , the women ’ s therapy center in zenica , bosnia , and her latest one , in the eastern part of the democratic republic of congo . there , medica mondiale works to train women recruited by the local group pais to care for and counsel victims of rape . dw staff -lrb- mrh -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

the assembly is to vote on the matter oct .
8 .
the european union and germany are " still working out how to vote , " german chancellor angela merkel said wednesday at a news conference with serbian president boris tadic , who was visiting berlin as part of efforts to develop closer ties between his country and the european union .
serbia ’ s pursuit of the icj ’ s legal opinion has been met with scepticism among some european nations who say the legal process , which could take as long as three years to deliver a response on kosovo ’ s legality , would effectively and damagingly halt the international integration of the former serbian province .
diplomats and un officials have forecast that a raft of countries would abstain from the nearing assembly vote .
while quickly recognized by leading western nations , the promotion kosovo had hoped for in the united nations and snowballing international recognition were blocked by serbia 's powerful ally russia .
partition a no-go : tadic bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : tadic has denied floating the partition idea earlier this week emerging from the talks with tadic , chancellor angela merkel also rejected proposals for an ethnic division of kosovo .
reports from belgrade the previous day suggested that tadic himself had suggested division as a compromise , but in berlin he said that he had been misunderstood .
" partition is being discussed in serbia and the international community and it has been one of the options during all these years , " tadic had told an evening press conference tuesday , sept .
30 .
" that option i can consider only when all other options are spent . "
but tadic told reporters wednesday the interpretation of what he said had been " politically wrong . "
the serb leader said belgrade would never recognize kosovo ’ s independence , but was making an effort to shift the kosovo issue " from a political corner to the legal corner " by seeking the opinion of the icj .
" i will reiterate the position and policy of serbia regarding kosovo , " he said .
" serbia does not and will never recognize kosovo 's independence . "
as serbian president , tadic has limited formal authority , but as the leader of the pro-european ruling coalition , in power since may elections , he is the actual speaker for serbia .
serbia 's icj request futile , pristina says the government in pristina , dominated by albanians and boycotted by minority serbs , meanwhile declared the issue closed and is seeking support from more countries than the 47 that have recognized it so far .
" our message to all those who profess partitioning kosovo is that they 've lost kosovo forever , " the kosovo parliament speaker jakup krasniqi told dpa news agency in pristina .
" kosovo now has internationally recognized , defined borders and any attempt to change them would open new problems in the balkans , " he warned .
" we do n't believe that the balkans and europe are interested in creating the problem of redrawing regional borders . " dpa news agency -lrb- kjb -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

the csu had elected the two men to their positions only a year ago .
the resignations came after the csu 's worst election showing in half a century .
beckstein said at a brief news conference on wednesday , oct 1 he would not be available to lead the planned coalition government in the state because he lacked the " necessary degree of support " within the party .
" after the painful defeat , i notice that my support within the party ... is not sufficient to successfully take on the difficult duties that lie ahead for the state premier , " beckstein said .
beckstein had refused monday to shoulder the blame for the election disaster , insisting bavarians still wanted a csu-led government , but that they no longer wanted the conservatives to govern alone .
both huber and beckstein were blamed for a series of policy blunders over issues such as education , a much-loathed smoking ban and the scrapping of a multi-billion-euro maglev train link to munich airport .

the csu had elected the two men to their positions only a year ago .
the resignations came after the csu 's worst election showing in half a century .
beckstein said at a brief news conference on wednesday , oct 1 he would not be available to lead the planned coalition government in the state because he lacked the " necessary degree of support " within the party .
" after the painful defeat , i notice that my support within the party ... is not sufficient to successfully take on the difficult duties that lie ahead for the state premier , " beckstein said .
beckstein had refused monday to shoulder the blame for the election disaster , insisting bavarians still wanted a csu-led government , but that they no longer wanted the conservatives to govern alone .
both huber and beckstein were blamed for a series of policy blunders over issues such as education , a much-loathed smoking ban and the scrapping of a multi-billion-euro maglev train link to munich airport .

" the commission was able to decide within 24 hours that the state aid measures comply with eu rules on rescue aid , " the eu executive said in a statement .
" uk authorities have committed to submit a restructuring and / or liquidation plan within six months , which will be examined by the commission under its rules on restructuring aid . "
meanwhile , the eu commission has decided to further its examination into the reconfiguration of german state bank westlb .
however , in a statement released wednesday , the eu executive said it was confident of reaching an agreement with german authorities .
" an in-depth investigation provides a good opportunity for discussing the plan submitted in august in greater detail and finding a solution to ensure the long-term viability of westlb , " eu competition commissioner neelie kroes said . dw staff -lrb- dm -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de defense -pipe- 01.10.2008 france presses eu to revamp defense structures großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the eufor mission in kosovo has shown the eu can work together militarily eu defense ministers have kicked off a two-day meeting in france .
the french would like to see member states overhaul the way they cooperate militarily .
but is anyone lining up to salute ? as the defense ministers gathered in the french resort of deauville , french president nicolas sarkozy , who also holds the european union 's revolving presidency , set the tone for what he hopes will be a historical summit .
" how can europe be a political power that speaks with a strong voice if it is n't in a position to defend itself or take the appropriate measures to enact its defense policies , " sarkozy asked rhetorically .
the main aim of the summit , which runs until thursday , oct .
2 , is to create a rapid reaction force of 50-60,000 soldiers that could be deployed in the interests of eu security .
eu foreign policy chief javier solana also thinks the time has come for radical changes .
" one of the most important things the european union has to do is to act in real time , " solana said ahead of the summit .
" if you have a crisis or a political problem in the world and you do n't deal with it rapidly , you waste time , money and the lives , probably , of people . "
france would also like to see the creation of a general chief of staff office in brussels to oversee the force .
but as history shows , eu nations will have to show a lot of political will for member states to come together in the way paris and brussels would like .
a european army ?
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : communication and coordination remain key issues the european union , like nato , has no army of its own and instead depends upon member states to provide soldiers and material .
as a result , the bloc encounters difficulties coordinating its resources when trying to intervene militarily .
this was illustrated this week , when the eu was forced to ask russia to provide helicopters for its peacekeeping mission in chad - even though brussels and moscow were in a clinch over russian 's military incursions into georgia .
nonetheless , the maastricht treaty stipulates that the bloc have a common defense and security policy , and european military missions have proved successful in recent years .
most notably , a 1,800-person eufor force has successfully taken over responsibility for maintaining peace in kosovo from its un predecessor .
backers of reform hope that could help overcome resistance by some member states , particularly britain , to further integrating the eu 's military capabilities .
back to nato bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : charles de gaulle partially severed france 's ties with nato reform backers stress that a european force would be a supplement to , and not a replacement for , nato .
and nato may be france 's best card for pushing through changes .
france partially withdrew from the trans-atlantic alliance in 1966 and even today refuses to participate in the full range of nato activities .
paris has signaled that that could change , if it gets its way on european defense reforms .
" we will fully participate in nato , if nato fully realizes that the eu has a role , too , " an unnamed french official told reuters news agency .
but most likely the summit will produce a compromise , in which both sides of the issue get some , but not all of what they want . dw staff -lrb- jc -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

" the commission was able to decide within 24 hours that the state aid measures comply with eu rules on rescue aid , " the eu executive said in a statement .
" uk authorities have committed to submit a restructuring and / or liquidation plan within six months , which will be examined by the commission under its rules on restructuring aid . "
meanwhile , the eu commission has decided to further its examination into the reconfiguration of german state bank westlb .
however , in a statement released wednesday , the eu executive said it was confident of reaching an agreement with german authorities .
" an in-depth investigation provides a good opportunity for discussing the plan submitted in august in greater detail and finding a solution to ensure the long-term viability of westlb , " eu competition commissioner neelie kroes said . dw staff -lrb- dm -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

the assembly is to vote on the matter oct .
8 .
the european union and germany are " still working out how to vote , " german chancellor angela merkel said wednesday at a news conference with serbian president boris tadic , who was visiting berlin as part of efforts to develop closer ties between his country and the european union .
serbia ’ s pursuit of the icj ’ s legal opinion has been met with scepticism among some european nations who say the legal process , which could take as long as three years to deliver a response on kosovo ’ s legality , would effectively and damagingly halt the international integration of the former serbian province .
diplomats and un officials have forecast that a raft of countries would abstain from the nearing assembly vote .
while quickly recognized by leading western nations , the promotion kosovo had hoped for in the united nations and snowballing international recognition were blocked by serbia 's powerful ally russia .
partition a no-go : tadic bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : tadic has denied floating the partition idea earlier this week emerging from the talks with tadic , chancellor angela merkel also rejected proposals for an ethnic division of kosovo .
reports from belgrade the previous day suggested that tadic himself had suggested division as a compromise , but in berlin he said that he had been misunderstood .
" partition is being discussed in serbia and the international community and it has been one of the options during all these years , " tadic had told an evening press conference tuesday , sept .
30 .
" that option i can consider only when all other options are spent . "
but tadic told reporters wednesday the interpretation of what he said had been " politically wrong . "
the serb leader said belgrade would never recognize kosovo ’ s independence , but was making an effort to shift the kosovo issue " from a political corner to the legal corner " by seeking the opinion of the icj .
" i will reiterate the position and policy of serbia regarding kosovo , " he said .
" serbia does not and will never recognize kosovo 's independence . "
as serbian president , tadic has limited formal authority , but as the leader of the pro-european ruling coalition , in power since may elections , he is the actual speaker for serbia .
serbia 's icj request futile , pristina says the government in pristina , dominated by albanians and boycotted by minority serbs , meanwhile declared the issue closed and is seeking support from more countries than the 47 that have recognized it so far .
" our message to all those who profess partitioning kosovo is that they 've lost kosovo forever , " the kosovo parliament speaker jakup krasniqi told dpa news agency in pristina .
" kosovo now has internationally recognized , defined borders and any attempt to change them would open new problems in the balkans , " he warned .

authorities in the netherlands and belgium also say they have also detected traces of the chemical in cookies imported from china . british company cadbury 's also recalled one of its chocolate varieties earlier this week for the same reason . melamine is normally used in making plastic , but can make watered-down milk look richer in protein than is actually the case . the european union recently banned all imports on chinese milk-related products for children such as biscuits and chocolate on top of a long-standing embargo on chinese dairy products like milk and yoghurt . dw staff -lrb- sp -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

unfortunately , no one 's really having any last laughs . george bush won the last presidential election by stressing the importance of faith and values .
but as he 's finding out right now , people 's faith in the financial system and the values of national stock markets have more to do with an administration 's popularity than religious homilies .
it 's impossible to deny the irony that this president , one of the greatest believers in the unfettered free market in us history , is practically begging congress to intervene in the economy .
for most of his term in office , bush has treated democracy in general and the legislative branch in particular as obstacles to be overcome .
now he 's forced to turn to the latter in an effort to avoid being remembered as the chief executive who presided over the devastation of the american economy .
at some point , john mccain piously intoned during last week 's presidential debate , greed took over the financial sector .
exactly , i found myself thinking when i heard the line .
that point was january 22 , 2001 - the first day of the first bush administration .
nearly eight years on , bush is now forced to ask the know-it-alls in a democratic congress to think up a solution to a mess caused by a misguided faith that private profits are inevitably good .
what a humbling experience that must be .
and congress is n't the only former foe upon whose help bush must rely .
by freeing up billions of dollars in short-term loan options , the european central bank is playing a major role in keeping the credit crunch from doing even more damage .
the ecb , of course , is run in part by people from germany and france , countries that the bush administration mocked and whose advice he ignored when he decided to launch an invasion of iraq .
" old europe " was , i believe , the derisive phrase used at the time .
now , the us is getting help from its " wayward " european allies , help that will likely contribute to some ordinary americans being able to keep their jobs and their homes .
the iraq war and the current threat to the global financial system are very different , but related problems .
according to nobel prize winning economist joseph stiglitz , the american experiment in bringing democracy to the middle east by force has cost the us treasury $ 845 billion .
that sum would easily cover the rescue package congress is being asked to pass , and ordinary americans are being asked to pay for .
there would even be plenty of money left over to try to find a cure for aids or pursue other projects that would restore the world 's faith in the benevolence of american motives .
lest anyone accuse me of anti-americanism , i would point out that not only am i an american , i write this as an american - as an adherent of the great american ideal that through rational self-governance , we can make the world a better place for ourselves and others .
for the past eight years , the bush administration has encouraged the american public to substitute blind faith for reason and argument .
i would hope that as the current government limps into its final days , americans reflect on the folly of that attitude .
i would also hope that those segments of the us populace that tend to dismiss europe as hostile , old-fashioned and anti-american will remember the assistance europeans are now offering .
most of all , i would hope that , with the financial crisis , a wrong-headed president and those who helped him to power are getting their final , ironic comeuppance .
i fear , though , that this may not be the last , nasty surprise of the bush presidency .
and that is definitely no laughing matter . jefferson chase send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

but as he 's finding out right now , people 's faith in the financial system and the values of national stock markets have more to do with an administration 's popularity than religious homilies .
it 's impossible to deny the irony that this president , one of the greatest believers in the unfettered free market in us history , is practically begging congress to intervene in the economy .
for most of his term in office , bush has treated democracy in general and the legislative branch in particular as obstacles to be overcome .
now he 's forced to turn to the latter in an effort to avoid being remembered as the chief executive who presided over the devastation of the american economy .
at some point , john mccain piously intoned during last week 's presidential debate , greed took over the financial sector .
exactly , i found myself thinking when i heard the line .
that point was january 22 , 2001 - the first day of the first bush administration .
nearly eight years on , bush is now forced to ask the know-it-alls in a democratic congress to think up a solution to a mess caused by a misguided faith that private profits are inevitably good .
what a humbling experience that must be .
and congress is n't the only former foe upon whose help bush must rely .
by freeing up billions of dollars in short-term loan options , the european central bank is playing a major role in keeping the credit crunch from doing even more damage .
the ecb , of course , is run in part by people from germany and france , countries that the bush administration mocked and whose advice he ignored when he decided to launch an invasion of iraq .
" old europe " was , i believe , the derisive phrase used at the time .
now , the us is getting help from its " wayward " european allies , help that will likely contribute to some ordinary americans being able to keep their jobs and their homes .
the iraq war and the current threat to the global financial system are very different , but related problems .
according to nobel prize winning economist joseph stiglitz , the american experiment in bringing democracy to the middle east by force has cost the us treasury $ 845 billion .
that sum would easily cover the rescue package congress is being asked to pass , and ordinary americans are being asked to pay for .
there would even be plenty of money left over to try to find a cure for aids or pursue other projects that would restore the world 's faith in the benevolence of american motives .
lest anyone accuse me of anti-americanism , i would point out that not only am i an american , i write this as an american - as an adherent of the great american ideal that through rational self-governance , we can make the world a better place for ourselves and others .
for the past eight years , the bush administration has encouraged the american public to substitute blind faith for reason and argument .
i would hope that as the current government limps into its final days , americans reflect on the folly of that attitude .
i would also hope that those segments of the us populace that tend to dismiss europe as hostile , old-fashioned and anti-american will remember the assistance europeans are now offering .
most of all , i would hope that , with the financial crisis , a wrong-headed president and those who helped him to power are getting their final , ironic comeuppance .
i fear , though , that this may not be the last , nasty surprise of the bush presidency .

unfortunately , no one 's really having any last laughs . george bush won the last presidential election by stressing the importance of faith and values .
but as he 's finding out right now , people 's faith in the financial system and the values of national stock markets have more to do with an administration 's popularity than religious homilies .
it 's impossible to deny the irony that this president , one of the greatest believers in the unfettered free market in us history , is practically begging congress to intervene in the economy .
for most of his term in office , bush has treated democracy in general and the legislative branch in particular as obstacles to be overcome .
now he 's forced to turn to the latter in an effort to avoid being remembered as the chief executive who presided over the devastation of the american economy .
at some point , john mccain piously intoned during last week 's presidential debate , greed took over the financial sector .
exactly , i found myself thinking when i heard the line .
that point was january 22 , 2001 - the first day of the first bush administration .
nearly eight years on , bush is now forced to ask the know-it-alls in a democratic congress to think up a solution to a mess caused by a misguided faith that private profits are inevitably good .
what a humbling experience that must be .
and congress is n't the only former foe upon whose help bush must rely .
by freeing up billions of dollars in short-term loan options , the european central bank is playing a major role in keeping the credit crunch from doing even more damage .
the ecb , of course , is run in part by people from germany and france , countries that the bush administration mocked and whose advice he ignored when he decided to launch an invasion of iraq .
" old europe " was , i believe , the derisive phrase used at the time .
now , the us is getting help from its " wayward " european allies , help that will likely contribute to some ordinary americans being able to keep their jobs and their homes .
the iraq war and the current threat to the global financial system are very different , but related problems .
according to nobel prize winning economist joseph stiglitz , the american experiment in bringing democracy to the middle east by force has cost the us treasury $ 845 billion .
that sum would easily cover the rescue package congress is being asked to pass , and ordinary americans are being asked to pay for .
there would even be plenty of money left over to try to find a cure for aids or pursue other projects that would restore the world 's faith in the benevolence of american motives .
lest anyone accuse me of anti-americanism , i would point out that not only am i an american , i write this as an american - as an adherent of the great american ideal that through rational self-governance , we can make the world a better place for ourselves and others .
for the past eight years , the bush administration has encouraged the american public to substitute blind faith for reason and argument .
i would hope that as the current government limps into its final days , americans reflect on the folly of that attitude .
i would also hope that those segments of the us populace that tend to dismiss europe as hostile , old-fashioned and anti-american will remember the assistance europeans are now offering .
most of all , i would hope that , with the financial crisis , a wrong-headed president and those who helped him to power are getting their final , ironic comeuppance .
i fear , though , that this may not be the last , nasty surprise of the bush presidency .
and that is definitely no laughing matter . jefferson chase send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

the most important point is the withdrawal of russian troops from two " security zones " deep inside georgian territory , which russia occupied in august .
the eu had hoped to get moscow 's forces to withdraw from the breakaway regions of abkhazia and south ossetia as well , but russian president dmitry medvedev categorically ruled that out .
european leaders were forced to accept less than they wanted .
" this is all really very incomplete , as i and everyone else know , " french foreign minister bernard kouchner said in late september .

the mission is made up of a large contingent of french gendarmes , as well as human rights and legal experts .

the mission is directed by germany 's former ambassador to lebanon , hansjoerg haber , who has been in georgia since sept .

" it 's operating in an area that 's been marked by violence , looting and every kind of disturbance .
i think the people are ready for someone who does not carry arms and is n't grim-looking , but who waves and smiles and is really just an observer . "
haber added that , thus far , his russian counterparts have been cooperating .

the most important point is the withdrawal of russian troops from two " security zones " deep inside georgian territory , which russia occupied in august .
the eu had hoped to get moscow 's forces to withdraw from the breakaway regions of abkhazia and south ossetia as well , but russian president dmitry medvedev categorically ruled that out .
european leaders were forced to accept less than they wanted .
" this is all really very incomplete , as i and everyone else know , " french foreign minister bernard kouchner said in late september .

i think the people are ready for someone who does not carry arms and is n't grim-looking , but who waves and smiles and is really just an observer . "

the assembly is to vote on the matter oct .
8 .
the european union and germany are " still working out how to vote , " german chancellor angela merkel said wednesday at a news conference with serbian president boris tadic , who was visiting berlin as part of efforts to develop closer ties between his country and the european union .
serbia ’ s pursuit of the icj ’ s legal opinion has been met with scepticism among some european nations who say the legal process , which could take as long as three years to deliver a response on kosovo ’ s legality , would effectively and damagingly halt the international integration of the former serbian province .
diplomats and un officials have forecast that a raft of countries would abstain from the nearing assembly vote .
while quickly recognized by leading western nations , the promotion kosovo had hoped for in the united nations and snowballing international recognition were blocked by serbia 's powerful ally russia .
partition a no-go : tadic bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : tadic has denied floating the partition idea earlier this week emerging from the talks with tadic , chancellor angela merkel also rejected proposals for an ethnic division of kosovo .
reports from belgrade the previous day suggested that tadic himself had suggested division as a compromise , but in berlin he said that he had been misunderstood .
" partition is being discussed in serbia and the international community and it has been one of the options during all these years , " tadic had told an evening press conference tuesday , sept .
30 .
" that option i can consider only when all other options are spent . "
but tadic told reporters wednesday the interpretation of what he said had been " politically wrong . "
the serb leader said belgrade would never recognize kosovo ’ s independence , but was making an effort to shift the kosovo issue " from a political corner to the legal corner " by seeking the opinion of the icj .
" i will reiterate the position and policy of serbia regarding kosovo , " he said .
" serbia does not and will never recognize kosovo 's independence . "
as serbian president , tadic has limited formal authority , but as the leader of the pro-european ruling coalition , in power since may elections , he is the actual speaker for serbia .
serbia 's icj request futile , pristina says the government in pristina , dominated by albanians and boycotted by minority serbs , meanwhile declared the issue closed and is seeking support from more countries than the 47 that have recognized it so far .
" our message to all those who profess partitioning kosovo is that they 've lost kosovo forever , " the kosovo parliament speaker jakup krasniqi told dpa news agency in pristina .
" kosovo now has internationally recognized , defined borders and any attempt to change them would open new problems in the balkans , " he warned .
" we do n't believe that the balkans and europe are interested in creating the problem of redrawing regional borders . " dpa news agency -lrb- kjb -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

the european union and germany are " still working out how to vote , " german chancellor angela merkel said wednesday at a news conference with serbian president boris tadic , who was visiting berlin as part of efforts to develop closer ties between his country and the european union .
serbia ’ s pursuit of the icj ’ s legal opinion has been met with scepticism among some european nations who say the legal process , which could take as long as three years to deliver a response on kosovo ’ s legality , would effectively and damagingly halt the international integration of the former serbian province .
diplomats and un officials have forecast that a raft of countries would abstain from the nearing assembly vote .
while quickly recognized by leading western nations , the promotion kosovo had hoped for in the united nations and snowballing international recognition were blocked by serbia 's powerful ally russia .
partition a no-go : tadic bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : tadic has denied floating the partition idea earlier this week emerging from the talks with tadic , chancellor angela merkel also rejected proposals for an ethnic division of kosovo .

" partition is being discussed in serbia and the international community and it has been one of the options during all these years , " tadic had told an evening press conference tuesday , sept .
30 .
" that option i can consider only when all other options are spent . "
but tadic told reporters wednesday the interpretation of what he said had been " politically wrong . "
the serb leader said belgrade would never recognize kosovo ’ s independence , but was making an effort to shift the kosovo issue " from a political corner to the legal corner " by seeking the opinion of the icj .
" i will reiterate the position and policy of serbia regarding kosovo , " he said .
" serbia does not and will never recognize kosovo 's independence . "
as serbian president , tadic has limited formal authority , but as the leader of the pro-european ruling coalition , in power since may elections , he is the actual speaker for serbia .
serbia 's icj request futile , pristina says the government in pristina , dominated by albanians and boycotted by minority serbs , meanwhile declared the issue closed and is seeking support from more countries than the 47 that have recognized it so far .
" our message to all those who profess partitioning kosovo is that they 've lost kosovo forever , " the kosovo parliament speaker jakup krasniqi told dpa news agency in pristina .

so who 's right ? european stock markets were holding steady in early-morning trading on wednesday , oct .
1 , as investors seemed assured that the us congress would indeed pass a major financial rescue package this week .
but some experts say that the worst may be yet to come .
" a recession is no longer avoidable for the old world , that is , the us , europe and japan , " the chief economist at deutsche bank norbert walter told the stuttgarter nachrichten newspaper .
others , however , warned against being too gloomy .
" we should n't call a crisis into existence , " the head of the german chambers of industry and commerce , martin wansleben , said on a morning magazine program on german state television .
" i would n't be so quick to talk about a recession . "
wansleben said he expected the german economy to grow by two percent this year , although he acknowledged that orders placed with german businesses were currently declining .
last week , ireland became the first eu member state to officially enter recession , and fears are rife that the rest of the bloc , dragged down by the us financial crisis , could follow suit .
emergency plan ?
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the ecb in frankfurt is doing its part by making credit available how hard europe gets hit by the aftermath of the credit crunch will be determined in part by actions yet to be taken .
european political and economic leaders repeated their calls on wednesday for the us congress to pass emergency aid legislation .
but they were also discussing what europe could do to shore up its own economy and financial sector .
french president nicolas sarkozy , who also holds the eu 's rotating presidency , has called for an emergency summit of world leaders to lay the groundwork for a new global financial system .
and the european commission is set to unveil plans to improve regulation over the financial sector .
meanwhile , the european central bank has said it will continue to provide $ 50 billion in extra liquidity to ensure that banks in need of short-term loans will be able to get them .
but the ecb is no longer expected to lower prime interest rates , as some had hoped , when it meets on thursday .
imf : get organized !
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : strauss-kahn says europe needs to act as one the head of the international monetary fund , dominique strauss-kahn , has said individual european countries need to better integrate their policies to deal with all the possible outcomes of the crisis .
" they have to organize themselves , " strauss-kahn told reuters news agency .
" it 's urgently necessary … the eu 's rules make it harder to act than in the us . "
and strauss-kahn stressed that the first step would have to be taken by the us congress .
bildunterschrift : the senate will be focus of attention on wednesday evening " an incomplete plan is better than no plan , " he said .
the us senate is scheduled to vote on the rescue package on wednesday evening .
if the senators approve it , the plan could be put to the house of representatives the following day . dw staff -lrb- jc -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

the csu had elected the two men to their positions only a year ago .
the resignations came after the csu 's worst election showing in half a century .
beckstein said at a brief news conference on wednesday , oct 1 he would not be available to lead the planned coalition government in the state because he lacked the " necessary degree of support " within the party .
" after the painful defeat , i notice that my support within the party ... is not sufficient to successfully take on the difficult duties that lie ahead for the state premier , " beckstein said .
beckstein had refused monday to shoulder the blame for the election disaster , insisting bavarians still wanted a csu-led government , but that they no longer wanted the conservatives to govern alone .
both huber and beckstein were blamed for a series of policy blunders over issues such as education , a much-loathed smoking ban and the scrapping of a multi-billion-euro maglev train link to munich airport .
four-member race to replace beckstein bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : csu vice chairman horst seehofer , right , is tipped to be csu party leader while horst seehofer , agriculture and consumer affairs minister in chancellor angela merkel 's cabinet in berlin , is widely expected to become csu leader , there will be a contest for the state premiership . alongside seehofer , bavarian interior minister joachim herrmann , state science minister thomas goppel and head of the csu 's parliamentary party georg schmid have expressed an interest in taking over the premiership , according to csu deputies .
seehofer , who is also csu vice-chairman , is the only one who is known nationally .
the 59-year-old lost support among conservative quarters last year after it emerged that his mistress had given birth to his child .
" we will make it clear to people that we have understood sunday 's election result , " seehofer told reporters tuesday , adding that an upcoming party conference was about " stabilizing the party " and making it " fresh and modern . "
ruinous election result bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : bavarians turned their backs on the csu in large numbers and turned towards bavaria 's smaller parties the csu , which had single-handedly ruled the german state for more than four decades and is a key party in merkel 's federal coalition , lost nearly one third of its voter support sunday .
left with only 43.4 percent , the csu - bavaria 's sister party to merkel 's christian democratic union - fell short of a majority and will be forced to form a coalition government , all factors which have led to the downfall of beckstein and huber .
analysts have said that the bavaria outcome could hurt merkel 's chances of retaining power in federal elections scheduled for sept .
2009 .
csu secretary general christine haderthauer , who herself resigned tuesday in the wake of the weekend 's poll , said the disastrous result was a black day for the party .
in the last state elections in 2003 , the csu polled 60.7 percent of the vote in the strongly catholic state , where some of germany 's leading companies have their headquarters , including siemens and bmw .
the party 's stated intent had been to retain its absolute majority in the 180-seat parliament in munich .

the csu had elected the two men to their positions only a year ago .
the resignations came after the csu 's worst election showing in half a century .
beckstein said at a brief news conference on wednesday , oct 1 he would not be available to lead the planned coalition government in the state because he lacked the " necessary degree of support " within the party .
" after the painful defeat , i notice that my support within the party ... is not sufficient to successfully take on the difficult duties that lie ahead for the state premier , " beckstein said .
beckstein had refused monday to shoulder the blame for the election disaster , insisting bavarians still wanted a csu-led government , but that they no longer wanted the conservatives to govern alone .
both huber and beckstein were blamed for a series of policy blunders over issues such as education , a much-loathed smoking ban and the scrapping of a multi-billion-euro maglev train link to munich airport .

the 59-year-old lost support among conservative quarters last year after it emerged that his mistress had given birth to his child .

so who 's right ? european stock markets were holding steady in early-morning trading on wednesday , oct .
1 , as investors seemed assured that the us congress would indeed pass a major financial rescue package this week .
but some experts say that the worst may be yet to come .
" a recession is no longer avoidable for the old world , that is , the us , europe and japan , " the chief economist at deutsche bank norbert walter told the stuttgarter nachrichten newspaper .
others , however , warned against being too gloomy .
" we should n't call a crisis into existence , " the head of the german chambers of industry and commerce , martin wansleben , said on a morning magazine program on german state television .
" i would n't be so quick to talk about a recession . "
wansleben said he expected the german economy to grow by two percent this year , although he acknowledged that orders placed with german businesses were currently declining .
last week , ireland became the first eu member state to officially enter recession , and fears are rife that the rest of the bloc , dragged down by the us financial crisis , could follow suit .
emergency plan ?
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the ecb in frankfurt is doing its part by making credit available how hard europe gets hit by the aftermath of the credit crunch will be determined in part by actions yet to be taken .
european political and economic leaders repeated their calls on wednesday for the us congress to pass emergency aid legislation .
but they were also discussing what europe could do to shore up its own economy and financial sector .
french president nicolas sarkozy , who also holds the eu 's rotating presidency , has called for an emergency summit of world leaders to lay the groundwork for a new global financial system .
and the european commission is set to unveil plans to improve regulation over the financial sector .
meanwhile , the european central bank has said it will continue to provide $ 50 billion in extra liquidity to ensure that banks in need of short-term loans will be able to get them .
but the ecb is no longer expected to lower prime interest rates , as some had hoped , when it meets on thursday .
imf : get organized !
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : strauss-kahn says europe needs to act as one the head of the international monetary fund , dominique strauss-kahn , has said individual european countries need to better integrate their policies to deal with all the possible outcomes of the crisis .
" they have to organize themselves , " strauss-kahn told reuters news agency .
" it 's urgently necessary … the eu 's rules make it harder to act than in the us . "
and strauss-kahn stressed that the first step would have to be taken by the us congress .
bildunterschrift : the senate will be focus of attention on wednesday evening " an incomplete plan is better than no plan , " he said .
the us senate is scheduled to vote on the rescue package on wednesday evening .
if the senators approve it , the plan could be put to the house of representatives the following day . dw staff -lrb- jc -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

the csu had elected the two men to their positions only a year ago .
the resignations came after the csu 's worst election showing in half a century .
beckstein said at a brief news conference on wednesday , oct 1 he would not be available to lead the planned coalition government in the state because he lacked the " necessary degree of support " within the party .
" after the painful defeat , i notice that my support within the party ... is not sufficient to successfully take on the difficult duties that lie ahead for the state premier , " beckstein said .
beckstein had refused monday to shoulder the blame for the election disaster , insisting bavarians still wanted a csu-led government , but that they no longer wanted the conservatives to govern alone .
both huber and beckstein were blamed for a series of policy blunders over issues such as education , a much-loathed smoking ban and the scrapping of a multi-billion-euro maglev train link to munich airport .
four-member race to replace beckstein bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : csu vice chairman horst seehofer , right , is tipped to be csu party leader while horst seehofer , agriculture and consumer affairs minister in chancellor angela merkel 's cabinet in berlin , is widely expected to become csu leader , there will be a contest for the state premiership . alongside seehofer , bavarian interior minister joachim herrmann , state science minister thomas goppel and head of the csu 's parliamentary party georg schmid have expressed an interest in taking over the premiership , according to csu deputies .
seehofer , who is also csu vice-chairman , is the only one who is known nationally .
the 59-year-old lost support among conservative quarters last year after it emerged that his mistress had given birth to his child .
" we will make it clear to people that we have understood sunday 's election result , " seehofer told reporters tuesday , adding that an upcoming party conference was about " stabilizing the party " and making it " fresh and modern . "
ruinous election result bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : bavarians turned their backs on the csu in large numbers and turned towards bavaria 's smaller parties the csu , which had single-handedly ruled the german state for more than four decades and is a key party in merkel 's federal coalition , lost nearly one third of its voter support sunday .
left with only 43.4 percent , the csu - bavaria 's sister party to merkel 's christian democratic union - fell short of a majority and will be forced to form a coalition government , all factors which have led to the downfall of beckstein and huber .
analysts have said that the bavaria outcome could hurt merkel 's chances of retaining power in federal elections scheduled for sept .
2009 .
csu secretary general christine haderthauer , who herself resigned tuesday in the wake of the weekend 's poll , said the disastrous result was a black day for the party .
in the last state elections in 2003 , the csu polled 60.7 percent of the vote in the strongly catholic state , where some of germany 's leading companies have their headquarters , including siemens and bmw .
the party 's stated intent had been to retain its absolute majority in the 180-seat parliament in munich .
" we have clearly failed to achieve our goal , " haderthauer said . dw staff -lrb- dm -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

the french would like to see member states overhaul the way they cooperate militarily .
but is anyone lining up to salute ? as the defense ministers gathered in the french resort of deauville , french president nicolas sarkozy , who also holds the european union 's revolving presidency , set the tone for what he hopes will be a historical summit .
" how can europe be a political power that speaks with a strong voice if it is n't in a position to defend itself or take the appropriate measures to enact its defense policies , " sarkozy asked rhetorically .
the main aim of the summit , which runs until thursday , oct .
2 , is to create a rapid reaction force of 50-60,000 soldiers that could be deployed in the interests of eu security .
eu foreign policy chief javier solana also thinks the time has come for radical changes .
" one of the most important things the european union has to do is to act in real time , " solana said ahead of the summit .
" if you have a crisis or a political problem in the world and you do n't deal with it rapidly , you waste time , money and the lives , probably , of people . "
france would also like to see the creation of a general chief of staff office in brussels to oversee the force .
but as history shows , eu nations will have to show a lot of political will for member states to come together in the way paris and brussels would like .
a european army ?
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : communication and coordination remain key issues the european union , like nato , has no army of its own and instead depends upon member states to provide soldiers and material .
as a result , the bloc encounters difficulties coordinating its resources when trying to intervene militarily .
this was illustrated this week , when the eu was forced to ask russia to provide helicopters for its peacekeeping mission in chad - even though brussels and moscow were in a clinch over russian 's military incursions into georgia .
nonetheless , the maastricht treaty stipulates that the bloc have a common defense and security policy , and european military missions have proved successful in recent years .
most notably , a 1,800-person eufor force has successfully taken over responsibility for maintaining peace in kosovo from its un predecessor .
backers of reform hope that could help overcome resistance by some member states , particularly britain , to further integrating the eu 's military capabilities .
back to nato bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : charles de gaulle partially severed france 's ties with nato reform backers stress that a european force would be a supplement to , and not a replacement for , nato .
and nato may be france 's best card for pushing through changes .
france partially withdrew from the trans-atlantic alliance in 1966 and even today refuses to participate in the full range of nato activities .
paris has signaled that that could change , if it gets its way on european defense reforms .
" we will fully participate in nato , if nato fully realizes that the eu has a role , too , " an unnamed french official told reuters news agency .
but most likely the summit will produce a compromise , in which both sides of the issue get some , but not all of what they want . dw staff -lrb- jc -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de defense -pipe- 01.10.2008 france presses eu to revamp defense structures großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the eufor mission in kosovo has shown the eu can work together militarily eu defense ministers have kicked off a two-day meeting in france .
the french would like to see member states overhaul the way they cooperate militarily .
but is anyone lining up to salute ? as the defense ministers gathered in the french resort of deauville , french president nicolas sarkozy , who also holds the european union 's revolving presidency , set the tone for what he hopes will be a historical summit .
" how can europe be a political power that speaks with a strong voice if it is n't in a position to defend itself or take the appropriate measures to enact its defense policies , " sarkozy asked rhetorically .
the main aim of the summit , which runs until thursday , oct .
2 , is to create a rapid reaction force of 50-60,000 soldiers that could be deployed in the interests of eu security .
eu foreign policy chief javier solana also thinks the time has come for radical changes .
" one of the most important things the european union has to do is to act in real time , " solana said ahead of the summit .
" if you have a crisis or a political problem in the world and you do n't deal with it rapidly , you waste time , money and the lives , probably , of people . "
france would also like to see the creation of a general chief of staff office in brussels to oversee the force .
but as history shows , eu nations will have to show a lot of political will for member states to come together in the way paris and brussels would like .
a european army ?
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : communication and coordination remain key issues the european union , like nato , has no army of its own and instead depends upon member states to provide soldiers and material .
as a result , the bloc encounters difficulties coordinating its resources when trying to intervene militarily .
this was illustrated this week , when the eu was forced to ask russia to provide helicopters for its peacekeeping mission in chad - even though brussels and moscow were in a clinch over russian 's military incursions into georgia .
nonetheless , the maastricht treaty stipulates that the bloc have a common defense and security policy , and european military missions have proved successful in recent years .
most notably , a 1,800-person eufor force has successfully taken over responsibility for maintaining peace in kosovo from its un predecessor .
backers of reform hope that could help overcome resistance by some member states , particularly britain , to further integrating the eu 's military capabilities .
back to nato bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : charles de gaulle partially severed france 's ties with nato reform backers stress that a european force would be a supplement to , and not a replacement for , nato .
and nato may be france 's best card for pushing through changes .
france partially withdrew from the trans-atlantic alliance in 1966 and even today refuses to participate in the full range of nato activities .
paris has signaled that that could change , if it gets its way on european defense reforms .
" we will fully participate in nato , if nato fully realizes that the eu has a role , too , " an unnamed french official told reuters news agency .
but most likely the summit will produce a compromise , in which both sides of the issue get some , but not all of what they want . dw staff -lrb- jc -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

authorities in the netherlands and belgium also say they have also detected traces of the chemical in cookies imported from china . british company cadbury 's also recalled one of its chocolate varieties earlier this week for the same reason . melamine is normally used in making plastic , but can make watered-down milk look richer in protein than is actually the case . the european union recently banned all imports on chinese milk-related products for children such as biscuits and chocolate on top of a long-standing embargo on chinese dairy products like milk and yoghurt . dw staff -lrb- sp -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

unfortunately , no one 's really having any last laughs . george bush won the last presidential election by stressing the importance of faith and values .
but as he 's finding out right now , people 's faith in the financial system and the values of national stock markets have more to do with an administration 's popularity than religious homilies .
it 's impossible to deny the irony that this president , one of the greatest believers in the unfettered free market in us history , is practically begging congress to intervene in the economy .
for most of his term in office , bush has treated democracy in general and the legislative branch in particular as obstacles to be overcome .
now he 's forced to turn to the latter in an effort to avoid being remembered as the chief executive who presided over the devastation of the american economy .
at some point , john mccain piously intoned during last week 's presidential debate , greed took over the financial sector .
exactly , i found myself thinking when i heard the line .
that point was january 22 , 2001 - the first day of the first bush administration .
nearly eight years on , bush is now forced to ask the know-it-alls in a democratic congress to think up a solution to a mess caused by a misguided faith that private profits are inevitably good .
what a humbling experience that must be .
and congress is n't the only former foe upon whose help bush must rely .
by freeing up billions of dollars in short-term loan options , the european central bank is playing a major role in keeping the credit crunch from doing even more damage .
the ecb , of course , is run in part by people from germany and france , countries that the bush administration mocked and whose advice he ignored when he decided to launch an invasion of iraq .
" old europe " was , i believe , the derisive phrase used at the time .
now , the us is getting help from its " wayward " european allies , help that will likely contribute to some ordinary americans being able to keep their jobs and their homes .
the iraq war and the current threat to the global financial system are very different , but related problems .
according to nobel prize winning economist joseph stiglitz , the american experiment in bringing democracy to the middle east by force has cost the us treasury $ 845 billion .
that sum would easily cover the rescue package congress is being asked to pass , and ordinary americans are being asked to pay for .
there would even be plenty of money left over to try to find a cure for aids or pursue other projects that would restore the world 's faith in the benevolence of american motives .
lest anyone accuse me of anti-americanism , i would point out that not only am i an american , i write this as an american - as an adherent of the great american ideal that through rational self-governance , we can make the world a better place for ourselves and others .
for the past eight years , the bush administration has encouraged the american public to substitute blind faith for reason and argument .
i would hope that as the current government limps into its final days , americans reflect on the folly of that attitude .
i would also hope that those segments of the us populace that tend to dismiss europe as hostile , old-fashioned and anti-american will remember the assistance europeans are now offering .
most of all , i would hope that , with the financial crisis , a wrong-headed president and those who helped him to power are getting their final , ironic comeuppance .
i fear , though , that this may not be the last , nasty surprise of the bush presidency .

unfortunately , no one 's really having any last laughs . george bush won the last presidential election by stressing the importance of faith and values .
but as he 's finding out right now , people 's faith in the financial system and the values of national stock markets have more to do with an administration 's popularity than religious homilies .
it 's impossible to deny the irony that this president , one of the greatest believers in the unfettered free market in us history , is practically begging congress to intervene in the economy .
for most of his term in office , bush has treated democracy in general and the legislative branch in particular as obstacles to be overcome .
now he 's forced to turn to the latter in an effort to avoid being remembered as the chief executive who presided over the devastation of the american economy .
at some point , john mccain piously intoned during last week 's presidential debate , greed took over the financial sector .
exactly , i found myself thinking when i heard the line .
that point was january 22 , 2001 - the first day of the first bush administration .
nearly eight years on , bush is now forced to ask the know-it-alls in a democratic congress to think up a solution to a mess caused by a misguided faith that private profits are inevitably good .
what a humbling experience that must be .
and congress is n't the only former foe upon whose help bush must rely .
by freeing up billions of dollars in short-term loan options , the european central bank is playing a major role in keeping the credit crunch from doing even more damage .
the ecb , of course , is run in part by people from germany and france , countries that the bush administration mocked and whose advice he ignored when he decided to launch an invasion of iraq .
" old europe " was , i believe , the derisive phrase used at the time .
now , the us is getting help from its " wayward " european allies , help that will likely contribute to some ordinary americans being able to keep their jobs and their homes .
the iraq war and the current threat to the global financial system are very different , but related problems .
according to nobel prize winning economist joseph stiglitz , the american experiment in bringing democracy to the middle east by force has cost the us treasury $ 845 billion .
that sum would easily cover the rescue package congress is being asked to pass , and ordinary americans are being asked to pay for .
there would even be plenty of money left over to try to find a cure for aids or pursue other projects that would restore the world 's faith in the benevolence of american motives .
lest anyone accuse me of anti-americanism , i would point out that not only am i an american , i write this as an american - as an adherent of the great american ideal that through rational self-governance , we can make the world a better place for ourselves and others .
for the past eight years , the bush administration has encouraged the american public to substitute blind faith for reason and argument .
i would hope that as the current government limps into its final days , americans reflect on the folly of that attitude .
i would also hope that those segments of the us populace that tend to dismiss europe as hostile , old-fashioned and anti-american will remember the assistance europeans are now offering .
most of all , i would hope that , with the financial crisis , a wrong-headed president and those who helped him to power are getting their final , ironic comeuppance .
i fear , though , that this may not be the last , nasty surprise of the bush presidency .

now , she ’ s won something bigger - the right livelihood award , or alternative nobel prize . back in 1992 , monika hauser read newspaper accounts of rape committed on a mass scale in bosnia .
rape had become a war tactic , and that thought sickened her . " i was angry too that the press was reporting on it so graphically - through-the-keyhole sorts of accounts , " she said .
" they couldn ’ t get enough .
i thought , these women were being used twice , so to speak , and i said to myself i ’ d like to do something about it . ” the swiss-born gynaecologist knew from her own practice in cologne that rape victims needed support and care , not just publicity , and so in 1993 she left for bosnia .
hauser , along with 20 local women , set up a trauma therapy center for rape victims in the bosnian city of zenica . hauser deplores " double standards " the project was a success , and hauser quickly gained fame in germany for her humanitarian efforts . german public television network ard ’ s news department awarded her its ‘ woman of the year ’ prize in 1993 .
the social democratic party honored her with a similar prize a year later . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : bosnian muslim women , victims of wartime rape , protesting outside the un in sarajevo earlier this year the accolades were helpful in raising publicity and funds for the clinic in zenica , and for the women ’ s foundation hauser founded , medica mondiale . since then hauser ’ s foundation has helped women in kosovo , albania , afghanistan , congo , iraq and uganda . but despite the laurels , hauser said , in the past decade politicians from germany and other eu countries have not really shown an increased interest in helping female victims of war crimes . a particular problem , she said , is that even as european troops participate in peacekeeping missions abroad , in part to protect women from crimes like rape , many of the soldiers themselves visit local brothels . the military leadership seems unbothered by the fact that many of these establishments frequented by the troops employ women who are underage or are working against their will . the double standard is frustrating , hauser said , adding she 'd learned to live with it . " you ’ ve got to have a high frustration threshold when you ’ re involved in feminist projects , " she said . " a big honor " in an interview with deutsche welle , hauser expressed surprise at winning the alternative nobel wednesday , saying she would “ accept it happily . ” in the past , hauser has been choosy about accepting prizes .
in 1996 , the german government wanted to award her its highest honor , the federal cross of merit -lrb- bundesverdienstkreuz -rrb- , but hauser turned them down .
she was unhappy that the state had threatened to deport thousands of bosnian refugees living in germany . the alternative nobel , however , she said , “ is really about recognizing social alternatives and honoring movements that have made an impact in changing the world . ” she added that “ it ’ s a big honor ” to be thought of in that way . the award is n't just a honor but also comes with a $ 50,000-euro purse .
hauser said she would split the money between her first project , the women ’ s therapy center in zenica , bosnia , and her latest one , in the eastern part of the democratic republic of congo . there , medica mondiale works to train women recruited by the local group pais to care for and counsel victims of rape . dw staff -lrb- mrh -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

serbia ’ s pursuit of the icj ’ s legal opinion has been met with scepticism among some european nations who say the legal process , which could take as long as three years to deliver a response on kosovo ’ s legality , would effectively and damagingly halt the international integration of the former serbian province .
diplomats and un officials have forecast that a raft of countries would abstain from the nearing assembly vote .
while quickly recognized by leading western nations , the promotion kosovo had hoped for in the united nations and snowballing international recognition were blocked by serbia 's powerful ally russia .
partition a no-go : tadic bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : tadic has denied floating the partition idea earlier this week emerging from the talks with tadic , chancellor angela merkel also rejected proposals for an ethnic division of kosovo .
reports from belgrade the previous day suggested that tadic himself had suggested division as a compromise , but in berlin he said that he had been misunderstood .
" partition is being discussed in serbia and the international community and it has been one of the options during all these years , " tadic had told an evening press conference tuesday , sept .
30 .
" that option i can consider only when all other options are spent . "
but tadic told reporters wednesday the interpretation of what he said had been " politically wrong . "
the serb leader said belgrade would never recognize kosovo ’ s independence , but was making an effort to shift the kosovo issue " from a political corner to the legal corner " by seeking the opinion of the icj .
" i will reiterate the position and policy of serbia regarding kosovo , " he said .
" serbia does not and will never recognize kosovo 's independence . "
as serbian president , tadic has limited formal authority , but as the leader of the pro-european ruling coalition , in power since may elections , he is the actual speaker for serbia .
serbia 's icj request futile , pristina says the government in pristina , dominated by albanians and boycotted by minority serbs , meanwhile declared the issue closed and is seeking support from more countries than the 47 that have recognized it so far .
" our message to all those who profess partitioning kosovo is that they 've lost kosovo forever , " the kosovo parliament speaker jakup krasniqi told dpa news agency in pristina .
" kosovo now has internationally recognized , defined borders and any attempt to change them would open new problems in the balkans , " he warned .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de society -pipe- 01.10.2008 cologne gynaecologist wins " alternative nobel prize " großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : hauser 's work to help female victims of war has earned her international fame for more than a decade , monika hauser 's work to rehabilitate victims of wartime sexual abuse has earned her a raft of awards .
now , she ’ s won something bigger - the right livelihood award , or alternative nobel prize . back in 1992 , monika hauser read newspaper accounts of rape committed on a mass scale in bosnia .
rape had become a war tactic , and that thought sickened her . " i was angry too that the press was reporting on it so graphically - through-the-keyhole sorts of accounts , " she said .
" they couldn ’ t get enough .
i thought , these women were being used twice , so to speak , and i said to myself i ’ d like to do something about it . ” the swiss-born gynaecologist knew from her own practice in cologne that rape victims needed support and care , not just publicity , and so in 1993 she left for bosnia .
hauser , along with 20 local women , set up a trauma therapy center for rape victims in the bosnian city of zenica . hauser deplores " double standards " the project was a success , and hauser quickly gained fame in germany for her humanitarian efforts . german public television network ard ’ s news department awarded her its ‘ woman of the year ’ prize in 1993 .
the social democratic party honored her with a similar prize a year later . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : bosnian muslim women , victims of wartime rape , protesting outside the un in sarajevo earlier this year the accolades were helpful in raising publicity and funds for the clinic in zenica , and for the women ’ s foundation hauser founded , medica mondiale . since then hauser ’ s foundation has helped women in kosovo , albania , afghanistan , congo , iraq and uganda . but despite the laurels , hauser said , in the past decade politicians from germany and other eu countries have not really shown an increased interest in helping female victims of war crimes . a particular problem , she said , is that even as european troops participate in peacekeeping missions abroad , in part to protect women from crimes like rape , many of the soldiers themselves visit local brothels . the military leadership seems unbothered by the fact that many of these establishments frequented by the troops employ women who are underage or are working against their will . the double standard is frustrating , hauser said , adding she 'd learned to live with it . " you ’ ve got to have a high frustration threshold when you ’ re involved in feminist projects , " she said . " a big honor " in an interview with deutsche welle , hauser expressed surprise at winning the alternative nobel wednesday , saying she would “ accept it happily . ” in the past , hauser has been choosy about accepting prizes .
in 1996 , the german government wanted to award her its highest honor , the federal cross of merit -lrb- bundesverdienstkreuz -rrb- , but hauser turned them down .
she was unhappy that the state had threatened to deport thousands of bosnian refugees living in germany . the alternative nobel , however , she said , “ is really about recognizing social alternatives and honoring movements that have made an impact in changing the world . ” she added that “ it ’ s a big honor ” to be thought of in that way . the award is n't just a honor but also comes with a $ 50,000-euro purse .
hauser said she would split the money between her first project , the women ’ s therapy center in zenica , bosnia , and her latest one , in the eastern part of the democratic republic of congo . there , medica mondiale works to train women recruited by the local group pais to care for and counsel victims of rape . dw staff -lrb- mrh -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

the most important point is the withdrawal of russian troops from two " security zones " deep inside georgian territory , which russia occupied in august .
the eu had hoped to get moscow 's forces to withdraw from the breakaway regions of abkhazia and south ossetia as well , but russian president dmitry medvedev categorically ruled that out .
european leaders were forced to accept less than they wanted .
" this is all really very incomplete , as i and everyone else know , " french foreign minister bernard kouchner said in late september .
" but in the first instance it was for us a matter of getting a date for a russian withdrawal from the parts of georgia that border with abkhazia and south ossetia . "

the mission is directed by germany 's former ambassador to lebanon , hansjoerg haber , who has been in georgia since sept .

" this mission is purely civilian and that 's our big challenge , " haber said .
" it 's operating in an area that 's been marked by violence , looting and every kind of disturbance .
i think the people are ready for someone who does not carry arms and is n't grim-looking , but who waves and smiles and is really just an observer . "
haber added that , thus far , his russian counterparts have been cooperating .
" they seem business-like , and we 've established contact with them , " haber said .

the most important point is the withdrawal of russian troops from two " security zones " deep inside georgian territory , which russia occupied in august .
the eu had hoped to get moscow 's forces to withdraw from the breakaway regions of abkhazia and south ossetia as well , but russian president dmitry medvedev categorically ruled that out .
european leaders were forced to accept less than they wanted .
" this is all really very incomplete , as i and everyone else know , " french foreign minister bernard kouchner said in late september .
" but in the first instance it was for us a matter of getting a date for a russian withdrawal from the parts of georgia that border with abkhazia and south ossetia . "
" purely civilian " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : haber will be overseeing the overseers the eu observer mission consists of some 200 unarmed police officers and civilian experts .
they will not be given military escort , although they will be transported in armored suvs .
the mission is made up of a large contingent of french gendarmes , as well as human rights and legal experts .
germany has sent 40 observers , most of them police officers .
the mission is directed by germany 's former ambassador to lebanon , hansjoerg haber , who has been in georgia since sept .
20 .
" this mission is purely civilian and that 's our big challenge , " haber said .
" it 's operating in an area that 's been marked by violence , looting and every kind of disturbance .
i think the people are ready for someone who does not carry arms and is n't grim-looking , but who waves and smiles and is really just an observer . "
haber added that , thus far , his russian counterparts have been cooperating .
" they seem business-like , and we 've established contact with them , " haber said .
" i 'm sure we 'll have an orderly handover with them . "
monitoring the ceasefire bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : russian troops have already moved out of towns like gori despite earlier objections from the russian military , eu monitors have entered the russian-controlled " buffer zone " around south ossetia .
reuters news agency reported that an eu patrol was stopped at a russian military checkpoint marking the edge of the zone , but was waved through shortly afterwards .
on a visit to tbilisi on tuesday , eu foreign policy chief javier solana said the bloc expects russia to respect the peace plan and pull its troops by an oct .
10 deadline .
" the objective of the mission is to allow russian forces to withdraw , " solana said .
" i am optimistic that all the parties will comply , as we have done , to the terms of the agreement , " he said . dw staff -lrb- jc -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

i thought , these women were being used twice , so to speak , and i said to myself i ’ d like to do something about it . ” the swiss-born gynaecologist knew from her own practice in cologne that rape victims needed support and care , not just publicity , and so in 1993 she left for bosnia .
hauser , along with 20 local women , set up a trauma therapy center for rape victims in the bosnian city of zenica . hauser deplores " double standards " the project was a success , and hauser quickly gained fame in germany for her humanitarian efforts . german public television network ard ’ s news department awarded her its ‘ woman of the year ’ prize in 1993 .
the social democratic party honored her with a similar prize a year later . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : bosnian muslim women , victims of wartime rape , protesting outside the un in sarajevo earlier this year the accolades were helpful in raising publicity and funds for the clinic in zenica , and for the women ’ s foundation hauser founded , medica mondiale . since then hauser ’ s foundation has helped women in kosovo , albania , afghanistan , congo , iraq and uganda . but despite the laurels , hauser said , in the past decade politicians from germany and other eu countries have not really shown an increased interest in helping female victims of war crimes . a particular problem , she said , is that even as european troops participate in peacekeeping missions abroad , in part to protect women from crimes like rape , many of the soldiers themselves visit local brothels . the military leadership seems unbothered by the fact that many of these establishments frequented by the troops employ women who are underage or are working against their will . the double standard is frustrating , hauser said , adding she 'd learned to live with it . " you ’ ve got to have a high frustration threshold when you ’ re involved in feminist projects , " she said . " a big honor " in an interview with deutsche welle , hauser expressed surprise at winning the alternative nobel wednesday , saying she would “ accept it happily . ” in the past , hauser has been choosy about accepting prizes .
in 1996 , the german government wanted to award her its highest honor , the federal cross of merit -lrb- bundesverdienstkreuz -rrb- , but hauser turned them down .
she was unhappy that the state had threatened to deport thousands of bosnian refugees living in germany . the alternative nobel , however , she said , “ is really about recognizing social alternatives and honoring movements that have made an impact in changing the world . ” she added that “ it ’ s a big honor ” to be thought of in that way . the award is n't just a honor but also comes with a $ 50,000-euro purse .
hauser said she would split the money between her first project , the women ’ s therapy center in zenica , bosnia , and her latest one , in the eastern part of the democratic republic of congo . there , medica mondiale works to train women recruited by the local group pais to care for and counsel victims of rape . dw staff -lrb- mrh -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

the assembly is to vote on the matter oct .
8 .
the european union and germany are " still working out how to vote , " german chancellor angela merkel said wednesday at a news conference with serbian president boris tadic , who was visiting berlin as part of efforts to develop closer ties between his country and the european union .
serbia ’ s pursuit of the icj ’ s legal opinion has been met with scepticism among some european nations who say the legal process , which could take as long as three years to deliver a response on kosovo ’ s legality , would effectively and damagingly halt the international integration of the former serbian province .
diplomats and un officials have forecast that a raft of countries would abstain from the nearing assembly vote .
while quickly recognized by leading western nations , the promotion kosovo had hoped for in the united nations and snowballing international recognition were blocked by serbia 's powerful ally russia .
partition a no-go : tadic bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : tadic has denied floating the partition idea earlier this week emerging from the talks with tadic , chancellor angela merkel also rejected proposals for an ethnic division of kosovo .
reports from belgrade the previous day suggested that tadic himself had suggested division as a compromise , but in berlin he said that he had been misunderstood .
" partition is being discussed in serbia and the international community and it has been one of the options during all these years , " tadic had told an evening press conference tuesday , sept .
30 .
" that option i can consider only when all other options are spent . "
but tadic told reporters wednesday the interpretation of what he said had been " politically wrong . "
the serb leader said belgrade would never recognize kosovo ’ s independence , but was making an effort to shift the kosovo issue " from a political corner to the legal corner " by seeking the opinion of the icj .
" i will reiterate the position and policy of serbia regarding kosovo , " he said .
" serbia does not and will never recognize kosovo 's independence . "
as serbian president , tadic has limited formal authority , but as the leader of the pro-european ruling coalition , in power since may elections , he is the actual speaker for serbia .
serbia 's icj request futile , pristina says the government in pristina , dominated by albanians and boycotted by minority serbs , meanwhile declared the issue closed and is seeking support from more countries than the 47 that have recognized it so far .
" our message to all those who profess partitioning kosovo is that they 've lost kosovo forever , " the kosovo parliament speaker jakup krasniqi told dpa news agency in pristina .
" kosovo now has internationally recognized , defined borders and any attempt to change them would open new problems in the balkans , " he warned .

the csu had elected the two men to their positions only a year ago .
the resignations came after the csu 's worst election showing in half a century .
beckstein said at a brief news conference on wednesday , oct 1 he would not be available to lead the planned coalition government in the state because he lacked the " necessary degree of support " within the party .
" after the painful defeat , i notice that my support within the party ... is not sufficient to successfully take on the difficult duties that lie ahead for the state premier , " beckstein said .
beckstein had refused monday to shoulder the blame for the election disaster , insisting bavarians still wanted a csu-led government , but that they no longer wanted the conservatives to govern alone .
both huber and beckstein were blamed for a series of policy blunders over issues such as education , a much-loathed smoking ban and the scrapping of a multi-billion-euro maglev train link to munich airport .
four-member race to replace beckstein bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : csu vice chairman horst seehofer , right , is tipped to be csu party leader while horst seehofer , agriculture and consumer affairs minister in chancellor angela merkel 's cabinet in berlin , is widely expected to become csu leader , there will be a contest for the state premiership . alongside seehofer , bavarian interior minister joachim herrmann , state science minister thomas goppel and head of the csu 's parliamentary party georg schmid have expressed an interest in taking over the premiership , according to csu deputies .
seehofer , who is also csu vice-chairman , is the only one who is known nationally .
the 59-year-old lost support among conservative quarters last year after it emerged that his mistress had given birth to his child .
" we will make it clear to people that we have understood sunday 's election result , " seehofer told reporters tuesday , adding that an upcoming party conference was about " stabilizing the party " and making it " fresh and modern . "
ruinous election result bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : bavarians turned their backs on the csu in large numbers and turned towards bavaria 's smaller parties the csu , which had single-handedly ruled the german state for more than four decades and is a key party in merkel 's federal coalition , lost nearly one third of its voter support sunday .
left with only 43.4 percent , the csu - bavaria 's sister party to merkel 's christian democratic union - fell short of a majority and will be forced to form a coalition government , all factors which have led to the downfall of beckstein and huber .
analysts have said that the bavaria outcome could hurt merkel 's chances of retaining power in federal elections scheduled for sept .

csu secretary general christine haderthauer , who herself resigned tuesday in the wake of the weekend 's poll , said the disastrous result was a black day for the party .
in the last state elections in 2003 , the csu polled 60.7 percent of the vote in the strongly catholic state , where some of germany 's leading companies have their headquarters , including siemens and bmw .
the party 's stated intent had been to retain its absolute majority in the 180-seat parliament in munich .

beckstein had refused monday to shoulder the blame for the election disaster , insisting bavarians still wanted a csu-led government , but that they no longer wanted the conservatives to govern alone .
both huber and beckstein were blamed for a series of policy blunders over issues such as education , a much-loathed smoking ban and the scrapping of a multi-billion-euro maglev train link to munich airport .

left with only 43.4 percent , the csu - bavaria 's sister party to merkel 's christian democratic union - fell short of a majority and will be forced to form a coalition government , all factors which have led to the downfall of beckstein and huber .

rape had become a war tactic , and that thought sickened her . " i was angry too that the press was reporting on it so graphically - through-the-keyhole sorts of accounts , " she said .

i thought , these women were being used twice , so to speak , and i said to myself i ’ d like to do something about it . ” the swiss-born gynaecologist knew from her own practice in cologne that rape victims needed support and care , not just publicity , and so in 1993 she left for bosnia .

the assembly is to vote on the matter oct .
8 .
the european union and germany are " still working out how to vote , " german chancellor angela merkel said wednesday at a news conference with serbian president boris tadic , who was visiting berlin as part of efforts to develop closer ties between his country and the european union .
serbia ’ s pursuit of the icj ’ s legal opinion has been met with scepticism among some european nations who say the legal process , which could take as long as three years to deliver a response on kosovo ’ s legality , would effectively and damagingly halt the international integration of the former serbian province .
diplomats and un officials have forecast that a raft of countries would abstain from the nearing assembly vote .
while quickly recognized by leading western nations , the promotion kosovo had hoped for in the united nations and snowballing international recognition were blocked by serbia 's powerful ally russia .
partition a no-go : tadic bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : tadic has denied floating the partition idea earlier this week emerging from the talks with tadic , chancellor angela merkel also rejected proposals for an ethnic division of kosovo .
reports from belgrade the previous day suggested that tadic himself had suggested division as a compromise , but in berlin he said that he had been misunderstood .
" partition is being discussed in serbia and the international community and it has been one of the options during all these years , " tadic had told an evening press conference tuesday , sept .
30 .
" that option i can consider only when all other options are spent . "
but tadic told reporters wednesday the interpretation of what he said had been " politically wrong . "
the serb leader said belgrade would never recognize kosovo ’ s independence , but was making an effort to shift the kosovo issue " from a political corner to the legal corner " by seeking the opinion of the icj .
" i will reiterate the position and policy of serbia regarding kosovo , " he said .
" serbia does not and will never recognize kosovo 's independence . "
as serbian president , tadic has limited formal authority , but as the leader of the pro-european ruling coalition , in power since may elections , he is the actual speaker for serbia .
serbia 's icj request futile , pristina says the government in pristina , dominated by albanians and boycotted by minority serbs , meanwhile declared the issue closed and is seeking support from more countries than the 47 that have recognized it so far .
" our message to all those who profess partitioning kosovo is that they 've lost kosovo forever , " the kosovo parliament speaker jakup krasniqi told dpa news agency in pristina .
" kosovo now has internationally recognized , defined borders and any attempt to change them would open new problems in the balkans , " he warned .

but as he 's finding out right now , people 's faith in the financial system and the values of national stock markets have more to do with an administration 's popularity than religious homilies .
it 's impossible to deny the irony that this president , one of the greatest believers in the unfettered free market in us history , is practically begging congress to intervene in the economy .
for most of his term in office , bush has treated democracy in general and the legislative branch in particular as obstacles to be overcome .
now he 's forced to turn to the latter in an effort to avoid being remembered as the chief executive who presided over the devastation of the american economy .
at some point , john mccain piously intoned during last week 's presidential debate , greed took over the financial sector .
exactly , i found myself thinking when i heard the line .
that point was january 22 , 2001 - the first day of the first bush administration .
nearly eight years on , bush is now forced to ask the know-it-alls in a democratic congress to think up a solution to a mess caused by a misguided faith that private profits are inevitably good .
what a humbling experience that must be .
and congress is n't the only former foe upon whose help bush must rely .
by freeing up billions of dollars in short-term loan options , the european central bank is playing a major role in keeping the credit crunch from doing even more damage .
the ecb , of course , is run in part by people from germany and france , countries that the bush administration mocked and whose advice he ignored when he decided to launch an invasion of iraq .
" old europe " was , i believe , the derisive phrase used at the time .
now , the us is getting help from its " wayward " european allies , help that will likely contribute to some ordinary americans being able to keep their jobs and their homes .
the iraq war and the current threat to the global financial system are very different , but related problems .
according to nobel prize winning economist joseph stiglitz , the american experiment in bringing democracy to the middle east by force has cost the us treasury $ 845 billion .
that sum would easily cover the rescue package congress is being asked to pass , and ordinary americans are being asked to pay for .
there would even be plenty of money left over to try to find a cure for aids or pursue other projects that would restore the world 's faith in the benevolence of american motives .
lest anyone accuse me of anti-americanism , i would point out that not only am i an american , i write this as an american - as an adherent of the great american ideal that through rational self-governance , we can make the world a better place for ourselves and others .
for the past eight years , the bush administration has encouraged the american public to substitute blind faith for reason and argument .
i would hope that as the current government limps into its final days , americans reflect on the folly of that attitude .
i would also hope that those segments of the us populace that tend to dismiss europe as hostile , old-fashioned and anti-american will remember the assistance europeans are now offering .
most of all , i would hope that , with the financial crisis , a wrong-headed president and those who helped him to power are getting their final , ironic comeuppance .
i fear , though , that this may not be the last , nasty surprise of the bush presidency .
and that is definitely no laughing matter . jefferson chase send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

the french would like to see member states overhaul the way they cooperate militarily .
but is anyone lining up to salute ? as the defense ministers gathered in the french resort of deauville , french president nicolas sarkozy , who also holds the european union 's revolving presidency , set the tone for what he hopes will be a historical summit .
" how can europe be a political power that speaks with a strong voice if it is n't in a position to defend itself or take the appropriate measures to enact its defense policies , " sarkozy asked rhetorically .
the main aim of the summit , which runs until thursday , oct .
2 , is to create a rapid reaction force of 50-60,000 soldiers that could be deployed in the interests of eu security .
eu foreign policy chief javier solana also thinks the time has come for radical changes .
" one of the most important things the european union has to do is to act in real time , " solana said ahead of the summit .
" if you have a crisis or a political problem in the world and you do n't deal with it rapidly , you waste time , money and the lives , probably , of people . "
france would also like to see the creation of a general chief of staff office in brussels to oversee the force .
but as history shows , eu nations will have to show a lot of political will for member states to come together in the way paris and brussels would like .
a european army ?
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : communication and coordination remain key issues the european union , like nato , has no army of its own and instead depends upon member states to provide soldiers and material .
as a result , the bloc encounters difficulties coordinating its resources when trying to intervene militarily .
this was illustrated this week , when the eu was forced to ask russia to provide helicopters for its peacekeeping mission in chad - even though brussels and moscow were in a clinch over russian 's military incursions into georgia .
nonetheless , the maastricht treaty stipulates that the bloc have a common defense and security policy , and european military missions have proved successful in recent years .
most notably , a 1,800-person eufor force has successfully taken over responsibility for maintaining peace in kosovo from its un predecessor .
backers of reform hope that could help overcome resistance by some member states , particularly britain , to further integrating the eu 's military capabilities .
back to nato bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : charles de gaulle partially severed france 's ties with nato reform backers stress that a european force would be a supplement to , and not a replacement for , nato .
and nato may be france 's best card for pushing through changes .
france partially withdrew from the trans-atlantic alliance in 1966 and even today refuses to participate in the full range of nato activities .
paris has signaled that that could change , if it gets its way on european defense reforms .
" we will fully participate in nato , if nato fully realizes that the eu has a role , too , " an unnamed french official told reuters news agency .

the french would like to see member states overhaul the way they cooperate militarily .
but is anyone lining up to salute ? as the defense ministers gathered in the french resort of deauville , french president nicolas sarkozy , who also holds the european union 's revolving presidency , set the tone for what he hopes will be a historical summit .
" how can europe be a political power that speaks with a strong voice if it is n't in a position to defend itself or take the appropriate measures to enact its defense policies , " sarkozy asked rhetorically .
the main aim of the summit , which runs until thursday , oct .
2 , is to create a rapid reaction force of 50-60,000 soldiers that could be deployed in the interests of eu security .
eu foreign policy chief javier solana also thinks the time has come for radical changes .
" one of the most important things the european union has to do is to act in real time , " solana said ahead of the summit .
" if you have a crisis or a political problem in the world and you do n't deal with it rapidly , you waste time , money and the lives , probably , of people . "
france would also like to see the creation of a general chief of staff office in brussels to oversee the force .
but as history shows , eu nations will have to show a lot of political will for member states to come together in the way paris and brussels would like .
a european army ?
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : communication and coordination remain key issues the european union , like nato , has no army of its own and instead depends upon member states to provide soldiers and material .
as a result , the bloc encounters difficulties coordinating its resources when trying to intervene militarily .
this was illustrated this week , when the eu was forced to ask russia to provide helicopters for its peacekeeping mission in chad - even though brussels and moscow were in a clinch over russian 's military incursions into georgia .
nonetheless , the maastricht treaty stipulates that the bloc have a common defense and security policy , and european military missions have proved successful in recent years .
most notably , a 1,800-person eufor force has successfully taken over responsibility for maintaining peace in kosovo from its un predecessor .
backers of reform hope that could help overcome resistance by some member states , particularly britain , to further integrating the eu 's military capabilities .
back to nato bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : charles de gaulle partially severed france 's ties with nato reform backers stress that a european force would be a supplement to , and not a replacement for , nato .
and nato may be france 's best card for pushing through changes .
france partially withdrew from the trans-atlantic alliance in 1966 and even today refuses to participate in the full range of nato activities .
paris has signaled that that could change , if it gets its way on european defense reforms .
" we will fully participate in nato , if nato fully realizes that the eu has a role , too , " an unnamed french official told reuters news agency .
but most likely the summit will produce a compromise , in which both sides of the issue get some , but not all of what they want . dw staff -lrb- jc -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

the european union and germany are " still working out how to vote , " german chancellor angela merkel said wednesday at a news conference with serbian president boris tadic , who was visiting berlin as part of efforts to develop closer ties between his country and the european union .
serbia ’ s pursuit of the icj ’ s legal opinion has been met with scepticism among some european nations who say the legal process , which could take as long as three years to deliver a response on kosovo ’ s legality , would effectively and damagingly halt the international integration of the former serbian province .

" i will reiterate the position and policy of serbia regarding kosovo , " he said .
" serbia does not and will never recognize kosovo 's independence . "
as serbian president , tadic has limited formal authority , but as the leader of the pro-european ruling coalition , in power since may elections , he is the actual speaker for serbia .

the assembly is to vote on the matter oct .
8 .
the european union and germany are " still working out how to vote , " german chancellor angela merkel said wednesday at a news conference with serbian president boris tadic , who was visiting berlin as part of efforts to develop closer ties between his country and the european union .
serbia ’ s pursuit of the icj ’ s legal opinion has been met with scepticism among some european nations who say the legal process , which could take as long as three years to deliver a response on kosovo ’ s legality , would effectively and damagingly halt the international integration of the former serbian province .
diplomats and un officials have forecast that a raft of countries would abstain from the nearing assembly vote .
while quickly recognized by leading western nations , the promotion kosovo had hoped for in the united nations and snowballing international recognition were blocked by serbia 's powerful ally russia .
partition a no-go : tadic bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : tadic has denied floating the partition idea earlier this week emerging from the talks with tadic , chancellor angela merkel also rejected proposals for an ethnic division of kosovo .
reports from belgrade the previous day suggested that tadic himself had suggested division as a compromise , but in berlin he said that he had been misunderstood .
" partition is being discussed in serbia and the international community and it has been one of the options during all these years , " tadic had told an evening press conference tuesday , sept .
30 .
" that option i can consider only when all other options are spent . "
but tadic told reporters wednesday the interpretation of what he said had been " politically wrong . "
the serb leader said belgrade would never recognize kosovo ’ s independence , but was making an effort to shift the kosovo issue " from a political corner to the legal corner " by seeking the opinion of the icj .
" i will reiterate the position and policy of serbia regarding kosovo , " he said .
" serbia does not and will never recognize kosovo 's independence . "
as serbian president , tadic has limited formal authority , but as the leader of the pro-european ruling coalition , in power since may elections , he is the actual speaker for serbia .
serbia 's icj request futile , pristina says the government in pristina , dominated by albanians and boycotted by minority serbs , meanwhile declared the issue closed and is seeking support from more countries than the 47 that have recognized it so far .
" our message to all those who profess partitioning kosovo is that they 've lost kosovo forever , " the kosovo parliament speaker jakup krasniqi told dpa news agency in pristina .
" kosovo now has internationally recognized , defined borders and any attempt to change them would open new problems in the balkans , " he warned .
" we do n't believe that the balkans and europe are interested in creating the problem of redrawing regional borders . " dpa news agency -lrb- kjb -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

the european union and germany are " still working out how to vote , " german chancellor angela merkel said wednesday at a news conference with serbian president boris tadic , who was visiting berlin as part of efforts to develop closer ties between his country and the european union .
serbia ’ s pursuit of the icj ’ s legal opinion has been met with scepticism among some european nations who say the legal process , which could take as long as three years to deliver a response on kosovo ’ s legality , would effectively and damagingly halt the international integration of the former serbian province .
diplomats and un officials have forecast that a raft of countries would abstain from the nearing assembly vote .
while quickly recognized by leading western nations , the promotion kosovo had hoped for in the united nations and snowballing international recognition were blocked by serbia 's powerful ally russia .
partition a no-go : tadic bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : tadic has denied floating the partition idea earlier this week emerging from the talks with tadic , chancellor angela merkel also rejected proposals for an ethnic division of kosovo .
reports from belgrade the previous day suggested that tadic himself had suggested division as a compromise , but in berlin he said that he had been misunderstood .
" partition is being discussed in serbia and the international community and it has been one of the options during all these years , " tadic had told an evening press conference tuesday , sept .
30 .
" that option i can consider only when all other options are spent . "
but tadic told reporters wednesday the interpretation of what he said had been " politically wrong . "
the serb leader said belgrade would never recognize kosovo ’ s independence , but was making an effort to shift the kosovo issue " from a political corner to the legal corner " by seeking the opinion of the icj .
" i will reiterate the position and policy of serbia regarding kosovo , " he said .
" serbia does not and will never recognize kosovo 's independence . "
as serbian president , tadic has limited formal authority , but as the leader of the pro-european ruling coalition , in power since may elections , he is the actual speaker for serbia .
serbia 's icj request futile , pristina says the government in pristina , dominated by albanians and boycotted by minority serbs , meanwhile declared the issue closed and is seeking support from more countries than the 47 that have recognized it so far .
" our message to all those who profess partitioning kosovo is that they 've lost kosovo forever , " the kosovo parliament speaker jakup krasniqi told dpa news agency in pristina .
" kosovo now has internationally recognized , defined borders and any attempt to change them would open new problems in the balkans , " he warned .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de finance -pipe- 01.10.2008 opinion : bush forced to rely on help from old foes in crisis großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : if people 's homes and livelihoods were n't on the line , says jefferson chase , the bush administration 's latest predicament would be funny .
unfortunately , no one 's really having any last laughs . george bush won the last presidential election by stressing the importance of faith and values .
but as he 's finding out right now , people 's faith in the financial system and the values of national stock markets have more to do with an administration 's popularity than religious homilies .
it 's impossible to deny the irony that this president , one of the greatest believers in the unfettered free market in us history , is practically begging congress to intervene in the economy .
for most of his term in office , bush has treated democracy in general and the legislative branch in particular as obstacles to be overcome .
now he 's forced to turn to the latter in an effort to avoid being remembered as the chief executive who presided over the devastation of the american economy .
at some point , john mccain piously intoned during last week 's presidential debate , greed took over the financial sector .
exactly , i found myself thinking when i heard the line .
that point was january 22 , 2001 - the first day of the first bush administration .
nearly eight years on , bush is now forced to ask the know-it-alls in a democratic congress to think up a solution to a mess caused by a misguided faith that private profits are inevitably good .
what a humbling experience that must be .
and congress is n't the only former foe upon whose help bush must rely .
by freeing up billions of dollars in short-term loan options , the european central bank is playing a major role in keeping the credit crunch from doing even more damage .
the ecb , of course , is run in part by people from germany and france , countries that the bush administration mocked and whose advice he ignored when he decided to launch an invasion of iraq .
" old europe " was , i believe , the derisive phrase used at the time .
now , the us is getting help from its " wayward " european allies , help that will likely contribute to some ordinary americans being able to keep their jobs and their homes .
the iraq war and the current threat to the global financial system are very different , but related problems .
according to nobel prize winning economist joseph stiglitz , the american experiment in bringing democracy to the middle east by force has cost the us treasury $ 845 billion .
that sum would easily cover the rescue package congress is being asked to pass , and ordinary americans are being asked to pay for .
there would even be plenty of money left over to try to find a cure for aids or pursue other projects that would restore the world 's faith in the benevolence of american motives .
lest anyone accuse me of anti-americanism , i would point out that not only am i an american , i write this as an american - as an adherent of the great american ideal that through rational self-governance , we can make the world a better place for ourselves and others .
for the past eight years , the bush administration has encouraged the american public to substitute blind faith for reason and argument .
i would hope that as the current government limps into its final days , americans reflect on the folly of that attitude .
i would also hope that those segments of the us populace that tend to dismiss europe as hostile , old-fashioned and anti-american will remember the assistance europeans are now offering .
most of all , i would hope that , with the financial crisis , a wrong-headed president and those who helped him to power are getting their final , ironic comeuppance .
i fear , though , that this may not be the last , nasty surprise of the bush presidency .
and that is definitely no laughing matter . jefferson chase send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

so who 's right ? european stock markets were holding steady in early-morning trading on wednesday , oct .
1 , as investors seemed assured that the us congress would indeed pass a major financial rescue package this week .

" a recession is no longer avoidable for the old world , that is , the us , europe and japan , " the chief economist at deutsche bank norbert walter told the stuttgarter nachrichten newspaper .
others , however , warned against being too gloomy .
" we should n't call a crisis into existence , " the head of the german chambers of industry and commerce , martin wansleben , said on a morning magazine program on german state television .

wansleben said he expected the german economy to grow by two percent this year , although he acknowledged that orders placed with german businesses were currently declining .

and the european commission is set to unveil plans to improve regulation over the financial sector .
meanwhile , the european central bank has said it will continue to provide $ 50 billion in extra liquidity to ensure that banks in need of short-term loans will be able to get them .
but the ecb is no longer expected to lower prime interest rates , as some had hoped , when it meets on thursday .

the csu had elected the two men to their positions only a year ago .
the resignations came after the csu 's worst election showing in half a century .
beckstein said at a brief news conference on wednesday , oct 1 he would not be available to lead the planned coalition government in the state because he lacked the " necessary degree of support " within the party .
" after the painful defeat , i notice that my support within the party ... is not sufficient to successfully take on the difficult duties that lie ahead for the state premier , " beckstein said .
beckstein had refused monday to shoulder the blame for the election disaster , insisting bavarians still wanted a csu-led government , but that they no longer wanted the conservatives to govern alone .
both huber and beckstein were blamed for a series of policy blunders over issues such as education , a much-loathed smoking ban and the scrapping of a multi-billion-euro maglev train link to munich airport .
four-member race to replace beckstein bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : csu vice chairman horst seehofer , right , is tipped to be csu party leader while horst seehofer , agriculture and consumer affairs minister in chancellor angela merkel 's cabinet in berlin , is widely expected to become csu leader , there will be a contest for the state premiership . alongside seehofer , bavarian interior minister joachim herrmann , state science minister thomas goppel and head of the csu 's parliamentary party georg schmid have expressed an interest in taking over the premiership , according to csu deputies .
seehofer , who is also csu vice-chairman , is the only one who is known nationally .
the 59-year-old lost support among conservative quarters last year after it emerged that his mistress had given birth to his child .
" we will make it clear to people that we have understood sunday 's election result , " seehofer told reporters tuesday , adding that an upcoming party conference was about " stabilizing the party " and making it " fresh and modern . "
ruinous election result bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : bavarians turned their backs on the csu in large numbers and turned towards bavaria 's smaller parties the csu , which had single-handedly ruled the german state for more than four decades and is a key party in merkel 's federal coalition , lost nearly one third of its voter support sunday .
left with only 43.4 percent , the csu - bavaria 's sister party to merkel 's christian democratic union - fell short of a majority and will be forced to form a coalition government , all factors which have led to the downfall of beckstein and huber .
analysts have said that the bavaria outcome could hurt merkel 's chances of retaining power in federal elections scheduled for sept .

csu secretary general christine haderthauer , who herself resigned tuesday in the wake of the weekend 's poll , said the disastrous result was a black day for the party .
in the last state elections in 2003 , the csu polled 60.7 percent of the vote in the strongly catholic state , where some of germany 's leading companies have their headquarters , including siemens and bmw .
the party 's stated intent had been to retain its absolute majority in the 180-seat parliament in munich .

the assembly is to vote on the matter oct .
8 .
the european union and germany are " still working out how to vote , " german chancellor angela merkel said wednesday at a news conference with serbian president boris tadic , who was visiting berlin as part of efforts to develop closer ties between his country and the european union .
serbia ’ s pursuit of the icj ’ s legal opinion has been met with scepticism among some european nations who say the legal process , which could take as long as three years to deliver a response on kosovo ’ s legality , would effectively and damagingly halt the international integration of the former serbian province .
diplomats and un officials have forecast that a raft of countries would abstain from the nearing assembly vote .
while quickly recognized by leading western nations , the promotion kosovo had hoped for in the united nations and snowballing international recognition were blocked by serbia 's powerful ally russia .
partition a no-go : tadic bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : tadic has denied floating the partition idea earlier this week emerging from the talks with tadic , chancellor angela merkel also rejected proposals for an ethnic division of kosovo .
reports from belgrade the previous day suggested that tadic himself had suggested division as a compromise , but in berlin he said that he had been misunderstood .
" partition is being discussed in serbia and the international community and it has been one of the options during all these years , " tadic had told an evening press conference tuesday , sept .
30 .
" that option i can consider only when all other options are spent . "
but tadic told reporters wednesday the interpretation of what he said had been " politically wrong . "
the serb leader said belgrade would never recognize kosovo ’ s independence , but was making an effort to shift the kosovo issue " from a political corner to the legal corner " by seeking the opinion of the icj .
" i will reiterate the position and policy of serbia regarding kosovo , " he said .
" serbia does not and will never recognize kosovo 's independence . "
as serbian president , tadic has limited formal authority , but as the leader of the pro-european ruling coalition , in power since may elections , he is the actual speaker for serbia .
serbia 's icj request futile , pristina says the government in pristina , dominated by albanians and boycotted by minority serbs , meanwhile declared the issue closed and is seeking support from more countries than the 47 that have recognized it so far .
" our message to all those who profess partitioning kosovo is that they 've lost kosovo forever , " the kosovo parliament speaker jakup krasniqi told dpa news agency in pristina .
" kosovo now has internationally recognized , defined borders and any attempt to change them would open new problems in the balkans , " he warned .
" we do n't believe that the balkans and europe are interested in creating the problem of redrawing regional borders . " dpa news agency -lrb- kjb -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

the european union and germany are " still working out how to vote , " german chancellor angela merkel said wednesday at a news conference with serbian president boris tadic , who was visiting berlin as part of efforts to develop closer ties between his country and the european union .
serbia ’ s pursuit of the icj ’ s legal opinion has been met with scepticism among some european nations who say the legal process , which could take as long as three years to deliver a response on kosovo ’ s legality , would effectively and damagingly halt the international integration of the former serbian province .
diplomats and un officials have forecast that a raft of countries would abstain from the nearing assembly vote .
while quickly recognized by leading western nations , the promotion kosovo had hoped for in the united nations and snowballing international recognition were blocked by serbia 's powerful ally russia .

" partition is being discussed in serbia and the international community and it has been one of the options during all these years , " tadic had told an evening press conference tuesday , sept .

" that option i can consider only when all other options are spent . "
but tadic told reporters wednesday the interpretation of what he said had been " politically wrong . "
the serb leader said belgrade would never recognize kosovo ’ s independence , but was making an effort to shift the kosovo issue " from a political corner to the legal corner " by seeking the opinion of the icj .
" i will reiterate the position and policy of serbia regarding kosovo , " he said .
" serbia does not and will never recognize kosovo 's independence . "
as serbian president , tadic has limited formal authority , but as the leader of the pro-european ruling coalition , in power since may elections , he is the actual speaker for serbia .

the assembly is to vote on the matter oct .
8 .
the european union and germany are " still working out how to vote , " german chancellor angela merkel said wednesday at a news conference with serbian president boris tadic , who was visiting berlin as part of efforts to develop closer ties between his country and the european union .
serbia ’ s pursuit of the icj ’ s legal opinion has been met with scepticism among some european nations who say the legal process , which could take as long as three years to deliver a response on kosovo ’ s legality , would effectively and damagingly halt the international integration of the former serbian province .
diplomats and un officials have forecast that a raft of countries would abstain from the nearing assembly vote .
while quickly recognized by leading western nations , the promotion kosovo had hoped for in the united nations and snowballing international recognition were blocked by serbia 's powerful ally russia .
partition a no-go : tadic bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : tadic has denied floating the partition idea earlier this week emerging from the talks with tadic , chancellor angela merkel also rejected proposals for an ethnic division of kosovo .
reports from belgrade the previous day suggested that tadic himself had suggested division as a compromise , but in berlin he said that he had been misunderstood .
" partition is being discussed in serbia and the international community and it has been one of the options during all these years , " tadic had told an evening press conference tuesday , sept .
30 .
" that option i can consider only when all other options are spent . "
but tadic told reporters wednesday the interpretation of what he said had been " politically wrong . "
the serb leader said belgrade would never recognize kosovo ’ s independence , but was making an effort to shift the kosovo issue " from a political corner to the legal corner " by seeking the opinion of the icj .
" i will reiterate the position and policy of serbia regarding kosovo , " he said .
" serbia does not and will never recognize kosovo 's independence . "
as serbian president , tadic has limited formal authority , but as the leader of the pro-european ruling coalition , in power since may elections , he is the actual speaker for serbia .
serbia 's icj request futile , pristina says the government in pristina , dominated by albanians and boycotted by minority serbs , meanwhile declared the issue closed and is seeking support from more countries than the 47 that have recognized it so far .
" our message to all those who profess partitioning kosovo is that they 've lost kosovo forever , " the kosovo parliament speaker jakup krasniqi told dpa news agency in pristina .
" kosovo now has internationally recognized , defined borders and any attempt to change them would open new problems in the balkans , " he warned .

the most important point is the withdrawal of russian troops from two " security zones " deep inside georgian territory , which russia occupied in august .
the eu had hoped to get moscow 's forces to withdraw from the breakaway regions of abkhazia and south ossetia as well , but russian president dmitry medvedev categorically ruled that out .
european leaders were forced to accept less than they wanted .
" this is all really very incomplete , as i and everyone else know , " french foreign minister bernard kouchner said in late september .
" but in the first instance it was for us a matter of getting a date for a russian withdrawal from the parts of georgia that border with abkhazia and south ossetia . "
" purely civilian " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : haber will be overseeing the overseers the eu observer mission consists of some 200 unarmed police officers and civilian experts .
they will not be given military escort , although they will be transported in armored suvs .
the mission is made up of a large contingent of french gendarmes , as well as human rights and legal experts .
germany has sent 40 observers , most of them police officers .
the mission is directed by germany 's former ambassador to lebanon , hansjoerg haber , who has been in georgia since sept .
20 .
" this mission is purely civilian and that 's our big challenge , " haber said .
" it 's operating in an area that 's been marked by violence , looting and every kind of disturbance .
i think the people are ready for someone who does not carry arms and is n't grim-looking , but who waves and smiles and is really just an observer . "
haber added that , thus far , his russian counterparts have been cooperating .
" they seem business-like , and we 've established contact with them , " haber said .
" i 'm sure we 'll have an orderly handover with them . "
monitoring the ceasefire bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : russian troops have already moved out of towns like gori despite earlier objections from the russian military , eu monitors have entered the russian-controlled " buffer zone " around south ossetia .
reuters news agency reported that an eu patrol was stopped at a russian military checkpoint marking the edge of the zone , but was waved through shortly afterwards .
on a visit to tbilisi on tuesday , eu foreign policy chief javier solana said the bloc expects russia to respect the peace plan and pull its troops by an oct .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de society -pipe- 01.10.2008 cologne gynaecologist wins " alternative nobel prize " großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : hauser 's work to help female victims of war has earned her international fame for more than a decade , monika hauser 's work to rehabilitate victims of wartime sexual abuse has earned her a raft of awards .
now , she ’ s won something bigger - the right livelihood award , or alternative nobel prize . back in 1992 , monika hauser read newspaper accounts of rape committed on a mass scale in bosnia .
rape had become a war tactic , and that thought sickened her . " i was angry too that the press was reporting on it so graphically - through-the-keyhole sorts of accounts , " she said .
" they couldn ’ t get enough .
i thought , these women were being used twice , so to speak , and i said to myself i ’ d like to do something about it . ” the swiss-born gynaecologist knew from her own practice in cologne that rape victims needed support and care , not just publicity , and so in 1993 she left for bosnia .
hauser , along with 20 local women , set up a trauma therapy center for rape victims in the bosnian city of zenica . hauser deplores " double standards " the project was a success , and hauser quickly gained fame in germany for her humanitarian efforts . german public television network ard ’ s news department awarded her its ‘ woman of the year ’ prize in 1993 .
the social democratic party honored her with a similar prize a year later . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : bosnian muslim women , victims of wartime rape , protesting outside the un in sarajevo earlier this year the accolades were helpful in raising publicity and funds for the clinic in zenica , and for the women ’ s foundation hauser founded , medica mondiale . since then hauser ’ s foundation has helped women in kosovo , albania , afghanistan , congo , iraq and uganda . but despite the laurels , hauser said , in the past decade politicians from germany and other eu countries have not really shown an increased interest in helping female victims of war crimes . a particular problem , she said , is that even as european troops participate in peacekeeping missions abroad , in part to protect women from crimes like rape , many of the soldiers themselves visit local brothels . the military leadership seems unbothered by the fact that many of these establishments frequented by the troops employ women who are underage or are working against their will . the double standard is frustrating , hauser said , adding she 'd learned to live with it . " you ’ ve got to have a high frustration threshold when you ’ re involved in feminist projects , " she said . " a big honor " in an interview with deutsche welle , hauser expressed surprise at winning the alternative nobel wednesday , saying she would “ accept it happily . ” in the past , hauser has been choosy about accepting prizes .
in 1996 , the german government wanted to award her its highest honor , the federal cross of merit -lrb- bundesverdienstkreuz -rrb- , but hauser turned them down .
she was unhappy that the state had threatened to deport thousands of bosnian refugees living in germany . the alternative nobel , however , she said , “ is really about recognizing social alternatives and honoring movements that have made an impact in changing the world . ” she added that “ it ’ s a big honor ” to be thought of in that way . the award is n't just a honor but also comes with a $ 50,000-euro purse .
hauser said she would split the money between her first project , the women ’ s therapy center in zenica , bosnia , and her latest one , in the eastern part of the democratic republic of congo . there , medica mondiale works to train women recruited by the local group pais to care for and counsel victims of rape . dw staff -lrb- mrh -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

the french would like to see member states overhaul the way they cooperate militarily .
but is anyone lining up to salute ? as the defense ministers gathered in the french resort of deauville , french president nicolas sarkozy , who also holds the european union 's revolving presidency , set the tone for what he hopes will be a historical summit .
" how can europe be a political power that speaks with a strong voice if it is n't in a position to defend itself or take the appropriate measures to enact its defense policies , " sarkozy asked rhetorically .
the main aim of the summit , which runs until thursday , oct .
2 , is to create a rapid reaction force of 50-60,000 soldiers that could be deployed in the interests of eu security .
eu foreign policy chief javier solana also thinks the time has come for radical changes .
" one of the most important things the european union has to do is to act in real time , " solana said ahead of the summit .
" if you have a crisis or a political problem in the world and you do n't deal with it rapidly , you waste time , money and the lives , probably , of people . "
france would also like to see the creation of a general chief of staff office in brussels to oversee the force .
but as history shows , eu nations will have to show a lot of political will for member states to come together in the way paris and brussels would like .
a european army ?
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : communication and coordination remain key issues the european union , like nato , has no army of its own and instead depends upon member states to provide soldiers and material .
as a result , the bloc encounters difficulties coordinating its resources when trying to intervene militarily .
this was illustrated this week , when the eu was forced to ask russia to provide helicopters for its peacekeeping mission in chad - even though brussels and moscow were in a clinch over russian 's military incursions into georgia .
nonetheless , the maastricht treaty stipulates that the bloc have a common defense and security policy , and european military missions have proved successful in recent years .
most notably , a 1,800-person eufor force has successfully taken over responsibility for maintaining peace in kosovo from its un predecessor .
backers of reform hope that could help overcome resistance by some member states , particularly britain , to further integrating the eu 's military capabilities .
back to nato bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : charles de gaulle partially severed france 's ties with nato reform backers stress that a european force would be a supplement to , and not a replacement for , nato .
and nato may be france 's best card for pushing through changes .
france partially withdrew from the trans-atlantic alliance in 1966 and even today refuses to participate in the full range of nato activities .
paris has signaled that that could change , if it gets its way on european defense reforms .
" we will fully participate in nato , if nato fully realizes that the eu has a role , too , " an unnamed french official told reuters news agency .
but most likely the summit will produce a compromise , in which both sides of the issue get some , but not all of what they want . dw staff -lrb- jc -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de georgia -pipe- 01.10.2008 eu observers launch georgia peace mission großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : russian troops are withdrawing , but not as far as the eu would like some 200 european union observers took up work in georgia on wednesday to monitor a ceasefire and oversee russian troop withdrawal following the august war in the caucasus state . the mission is intended to help ensure the implementation of the six-point plan , negotiated by eu president nicolas sarkozy with the russian and georgian governments in september .
the most important point is the withdrawal of russian troops from two " security zones " deep inside georgian territory , which russia occupied in august .
the eu had hoped to get moscow 's forces to withdraw from the breakaway regions of abkhazia and south ossetia as well , but russian president dmitry medvedev categorically ruled that out .
european leaders were forced to accept less than they wanted .
" this is all really very incomplete , as i and everyone else know , " french foreign minister bernard kouchner said in late september .
" but in the first instance it was for us a matter of getting a date for a russian withdrawal from the parts of georgia that border with abkhazia and south ossetia . "
" purely civilian " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : haber will be overseeing the overseers the eu observer mission consists of some 200 unarmed police officers and civilian experts .
they will not be given military escort , although they will be transported in armored suvs .
the mission is made up of a large contingent of french gendarmes , as well as human rights and legal experts .
germany has sent 40 observers , most of them police officers .
the mission is directed by germany 's former ambassador to lebanon , hansjoerg haber , who has been in georgia since sept .
20 .
" this mission is purely civilian and that 's our big challenge , " haber said .
" it 's operating in an area that 's been marked by violence , looting and every kind of disturbance .
i think the people are ready for someone who does not carry arms and is n't grim-looking , but who waves and smiles and is really just an observer . "
haber added that , thus far , his russian counterparts have been cooperating .
" they seem business-like , and we 've established contact with them , " haber said .
" i 'm sure we 'll have an orderly handover with them . "
monitoring the ceasefire bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : russian troops have already moved out of towns like gori despite earlier objections from the russian military , eu monitors have entered the russian-controlled " buffer zone " around south ossetia .
reuters news agency reported that an eu patrol was stopped at a russian military checkpoint marking the edge of the zone , but was waved through shortly afterwards .
on a visit to tbilisi on tuesday , eu foreign policy chief javier solana said the bloc expects russia to respect the peace plan and pull its troops by an oct .
10 deadline .
" the objective of the mission is to allow russian forces to withdraw , " solana said .
" i am optimistic that all the parties will comply , as we have done , to the terms of the agreement , " he said . dw staff -lrb- jc -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

the most important point is the withdrawal of russian troops from two " security zones " deep inside georgian territory , which russia occupied in august .
the eu had hoped to get moscow 's forces to withdraw from the breakaway regions of abkhazia and south ossetia as well , but russian president dmitry medvedev categorically ruled that out .
european leaders were forced to accept less than they wanted .
" this is all really very incomplete , as i and everyone else know , " french foreign minister bernard kouchner said in late september .
" but in the first instance it was for us a matter of getting a date for a russian withdrawal from the parts of georgia that border with abkhazia and south ossetia . "
" purely civilian " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : haber will be overseeing the overseers the eu observer mission consists of some 200 unarmed police officers and civilian experts .
they will not be given military escort , although they will be transported in armored suvs .
the mission is made up of a large contingent of french gendarmes , as well as human rights and legal experts .
germany has sent 40 observers , most of them police officers .
the mission is directed by germany 's former ambassador to lebanon , hansjoerg haber , who has been in georgia since sept .
20 .
" this mission is purely civilian and that 's our big challenge , " haber said .
" it 's operating in an area that 's been marked by violence , looting and every kind of disturbance .
i think the people are ready for someone who does not carry arms and is n't grim-looking , but who waves and smiles and is really just an observer . "
haber added that , thus far , his russian counterparts have been cooperating .
" they seem business-like , and we 've established contact with them , " haber said .
" i 'm sure we 'll have an orderly handover with them . "
monitoring the ceasefire bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : russian troops have already moved out of towns like gori despite earlier objections from the russian military , eu monitors have entered the russian-controlled " buffer zone " around south ossetia .
reuters news agency reported that an eu patrol was stopped at a russian military checkpoint marking the edge of the zone , but was waved through shortly afterwards .
on a visit to tbilisi on tuesday , eu foreign policy chief javier solana said the bloc expects russia to respect the peace plan and pull its troops by an oct .
10 deadline .
" the objective of the mission is to allow russian forces to withdraw , " solana said .
" i am optimistic that all the parties will comply , as we have done , to the terms of the agreement , " he said . dw staff -lrb- jc -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

the csu had elected the two men to their positions only a year ago .
the resignations came after the csu 's worst election showing in half a century .
beckstein said at a brief news conference on wednesday , oct 1 he would not be available to lead the planned coalition government in the state because he lacked the " necessary degree of support " within the party .
" after the painful defeat , i notice that my support within the party ... is not sufficient to successfully take on the difficult duties that lie ahead for the state premier , " beckstein said .
beckstein had refused monday to shoulder the blame for the election disaster , insisting bavarians still wanted a csu-led government , but that they no longer wanted the conservatives to govern alone .
both huber and beckstein were blamed for a series of policy blunders over issues such as education , a much-loathed smoking ban and the scrapping of a multi-billion-euro maglev train link to munich airport .
four-member race to replace beckstein bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : csu vice chairman horst seehofer , right , is tipped to be csu party leader while horst seehofer , agriculture and consumer affairs minister in chancellor angela merkel 's cabinet in berlin , is widely expected to become csu leader , there will be a contest for the state premiership . alongside seehofer , bavarian interior minister joachim herrmann , state science minister thomas goppel and head of the csu 's parliamentary party georg schmid have expressed an interest in taking over the premiership , according to csu deputies .
seehofer , who is also csu vice-chairman , is the only one who is known nationally .
the 59-year-old lost support among conservative quarters last year after it emerged that his mistress had given birth to his child .
" we will make it clear to people that we have understood sunday 's election result , " seehofer told reporters tuesday , adding that an upcoming party conference was about " stabilizing the party " and making it " fresh and modern . "
ruinous election result bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : bavarians turned their backs on the csu in large numbers and turned towards bavaria 's smaller parties the csu , which had single-handedly ruled the german state for more than four decades and is a key party in merkel 's federal coalition , lost nearly one third of its voter support sunday .
left with only 43.4 percent , the csu - bavaria 's sister party to merkel 's christian democratic union - fell short of a majority and will be forced to form a coalition government , all factors which have led to the downfall of beckstein and huber .
analysts have said that the bavaria outcome could hurt merkel 's chances of retaining power in federal elections scheduled for sept .
2009 .
csu secretary general christine haderthauer , who herself resigned tuesday in the wake of the weekend 's poll , said the disastrous result was a black day for the party .

the csu had elected the two men to their positions only a year ago .
the resignations came after the csu 's worst election showing in half a century .
beckstein said at a brief news conference on wednesday , oct 1 he would not be available to lead the planned coalition government in the state because he lacked the " necessary degree of support " within the party .
" after the painful defeat , i notice that my support within the party ... is not sufficient to successfully take on the difficult duties that lie ahead for the state premier , " beckstein said .
beckstein had refused monday to shoulder the blame for the election disaster , insisting bavarians still wanted a csu-led government , but that they no longer wanted the conservatives to govern alone .
both huber and beckstein were blamed for a series of policy blunders over issues such as education , a much-loathed smoking ban and the scrapping of a multi-billion-euro maglev train link to munich airport .

seehofer , who is also csu vice-chairman , is the only one who is known nationally .
the 59-year-old lost support among conservative quarters last year after it emerged that his mistress had given birth to his child .
" we will make it clear to people that we have understood sunday 's election result , " seehofer told reporters tuesday , adding that an upcoming party conference was about " stabilizing the party " and making it " fresh and modern . "
ruinous election result bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : bavarians turned their backs on the csu in large numbers and turned towards bavaria 's smaller parties the csu , which had single-handedly ruled the german state for more than four decades and is a key party in merkel 's federal coalition , lost nearly one third of its voter support sunday .
left with only 43.4 percent , the csu - bavaria 's sister party to merkel 's christian democratic union - fell short of a majority and will be forced to form a coalition government , all factors which have led to the downfall of beckstein and huber .
analysts have said that the bavaria outcome could hurt merkel 's chances of retaining power in federal elections scheduled for sept .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de defense -pipe- 01.10.2008 france presses eu to revamp defense structures großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the eufor mission in kosovo has shown the eu can work together militarily eu defense ministers have kicked off a two-day meeting in france .
the french would like to see member states overhaul the way they cooperate militarily .
but is anyone lining up to salute ? as the defense ministers gathered in the french resort of deauville , french president nicolas sarkozy , who also holds the european union 's revolving presidency , set the tone for what he hopes will be a historical summit .
" how can europe be a political power that speaks with a strong voice if it is n't in a position to defend itself or take the appropriate measures to enact its defense policies , " sarkozy asked rhetorically .
the main aim of the summit , which runs until thursday , oct .
2 , is to create a rapid reaction force of 50-60,000 soldiers that could be deployed in the interests of eu security .
eu foreign policy chief javier solana also thinks the time has come for radical changes .
" one of the most important things the european union has to do is to act in real time , " solana said ahead of the summit .
" if you have a crisis or a political problem in the world and you do n't deal with it rapidly , you waste time , money and the lives , probably , of people . "
france would also like to see the creation of a general chief of staff office in brussels to oversee the force .
but as history shows , eu nations will have to show a lot of political will for member states to come together in the way paris and brussels would like .
a european army ?
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : communication and coordination remain key issues the european union , like nato , has no army of its own and instead depends upon member states to provide soldiers and material .
as a result , the bloc encounters difficulties coordinating its resources when trying to intervene militarily .
this was illustrated this week , when the eu was forced to ask russia to provide helicopters for its peacekeeping mission in chad - even though brussels and moscow were in a clinch over russian 's military incursions into georgia .
nonetheless , the maastricht treaty stipulates that the bloc have a common defense and security policy , and european military missions have proved successful in recent years .
most notably , a 1,800-person eufor force has successfully taken over responsibility for maintaining peace in kosovo from its un predecessor .
backers of reform hope that could help overcome resistance by some member states , particularly britain , to further integrating the eu 's military capabilities .
back to nato bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : charles de gaulle partially severed france 's ties with nato reform backers stress that a european force would be a supplement to , and not a replacement for , nato .
and nato may be france 's best card for pushing through changes .
france partially withdrew from the trans-atlantic alliance in 1966 and even today refuses to participate in the full range of nato activities .
paris has signaled that that could change , if it gets its way on european defense reforms .
" we will fully participate in nato , if nato fully realizes that the eu has a role , too , " an unnamed french official told reuters news agency .
but most likely the summit will produce a compromise , in which both sides of the issue get some , but not all of what they want . dw staff -lrb- jc -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

unfortunately , no one 's really having any last laughs . george bush won the last presidential election by stressing the importance of faith and values .
but as he 's finding out right now , people 's faith in the financial system and the values of national stock markets have more to do with an administration 's popularity than religious homilies .
it 's impossible to deny the irony that this president , one of the greatest believers in the unfettered free market in us history , is practically begging congress to intervene in the economy .
for most of his term in office , bush has treated democracy in general and the legislative branch in particular as obstacles to be overcome .
now he 's forced to turn to the latter in an effort to avoid being remembered as the chief executive who presided over the devastation of the american economy .
at some point , john mccain piously intoned during last week 's presidential debate , greed took over the financial sector .
exactly , i found myself thinking when i heard the line .
that point was january 22 , 2001 - the first day of the first bush administration .
nearly eight years on , bush is now forced to ask the know-it-alls in a democratic congress to think up a solution to a mess caused by a misguided faith that private profits are inevitably good .
what a humbling experience that must be .
and congress is n't the only former foe upon whose help bush must rely .
by freeing up billions of dollars in short-term loan options , the european central bank is playing a major role in keeping the credit crunch from doing even more damage .
the ecb , of course , is run in part by people from germany and france , countries that the bush administration mocked and whose advice he ignored when he decided to launch an invasion of iraq .
" old europe " was , i believe , the derisive phrase used at the time .
now , the us is getting help from its " wayward " european allies , help that will likely contribute to some ordinary americans being able to keep their jobs and their homes .
the iraq war and the current threat to the global financial system are very different , but related problems .
according to nobel prize winning economist joseph stiglitz , the american experiment in bringing democracy to the middle east by force has cost the us treasury $ 845 billion .
that sum would easily cover the rescue package congress is being asked to pass , and ordinary americans are being asked to pay for .
there would even be plenty of money left over to try to find a cure for aids or pursue other projects that would restore the world 's faith in the benevolence of american motives .
lest anyone accuse me of anti-americanism , i would point out that not only am i an american , i write this as an american - as an adherent of the great american ideal that through rational self-governance , we can make the world a better place for ourselves and others .
for the past eight years , the bush administration has encouraged the american public to substitute blind faith for reason and argument .
i would hope that as the current government limps into its final days , americans reflect on the folly of that attitude .
i would also hope that those segments of the us populace that tend to dismiss europe as hostile , old-fashioned and anti-american will remember the assistance europeans are now offering .
most of all , i would hope that , with the financial crisis , a wrong-headed president and those who helped him to power are getting their final , ironic comeuppance .
i fear , though , that this may not be the last , nasty surprise of the bush presidency .
and that is definitely no laughing matter . jefferson chase send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

unfortunately , no one 's really having any last laughs . george bush won the last presidential election by stressing the importance of faith and values .
but as he 's finding out right now , people 's faith in the financial system and the values of national stock markets have more to do with an administration 's popularity than religious homilies .
it 's impossible to deny the irony that this president , one of the greatest believers in the unfettered free market in us history , is practically begging congress to intervene in the economy .
for most of his term in office , bush has treated democracy in general and the legislative branch in particular as obstacles to be overcome .
now he 's forced to turn to the latter in an effort to avoid being remembered as the chief executive who presided over the devastation of the american economy .
at some point , john mccain piously intoned during last week 's presidential debate , greed took over the financial sector .
exactly , i found myself thinking when i heard the line .
that point was january 22 , 2001 - the first day of the first bush administration .
nearly eight years on , bush is now forced to ask the know-it-alls in a democratic congress to think up a solution to a mess caused by a misguided faith that private profits are inevitably good .
what a humbling experience that must be .
and congress is n't the only former foe upon whose help bush must rely .
by freeing up billions of dollars in short-term loan options , the european central bank is playing a major role in keeping the credit crunch from doing even more damage .
the ecb , of course , is run in part by people from germany and france , countries that the bush administration mocked and whose advice he ignored when he decided to launch an invasion of iraq .

the social democratic party honored her with a similar prize a year later . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : bosnian muslim women , victims of wartime rape , protesting outside the un in sarajevo earlier this year the accolades were helpful in raising publicity and funds for the clinic in zenica , and for the women ’ s foundation hauser founded , medica mondiale . since then hauser ’ s foundation has helped women in kosovo , albania , afghanistan , congo , iraq and uganda . but despite the laurels , hauser said , in the past decade politicians from germany and other eu countries have not really shown an increased interest in helping female victims of war crimes . a particular problem , she said , is that even as european troops participate in peacekeeping missions abroad , in part to protect women from crimes like rape , many of the soldiers themselves visit local brothels . the military leadership seems unbothered by the fact that many of these establishments frequented by the troops employ women who are underage or are working against their will . the double standard is frustrating , hauser said , adding she 'd learned to live with it . " you ’ ve got to have a high frustration threshold when you ’ re involved in feminist projects , " she said . " a big honor " in an interview with deutsche welle , hauser expressed surprise at winning the alternative nobel wednesday , saying she would “ accept it happily . ” in the past , hauser has been choosy about accepting prizes .
in 1996 , the german government wanted to award her its highest honor , the federal cross of merit -lrb- bundesverdienstkreuz -rrb- , but hauser turned them down .
she was unhappy that the state had threatened to deport thousands of bosnian refugees living in germany . the alternative nobel , however , she said , “ is really about recognizing social alternatives and honoring movements that have made an impact in changing the world . ” she added that “ it ’ s a big honor ” to be thought of in that way . the award is n't just a honor but also comes with a $ 50,000-euro purse .
hauser said she would split the money between her first project , the women ’ s therapy center in zenica , bosnia , and her latest one , in the eastern part of the democratic republic of congo . there , medica mondiale works to train women recruited by the local group pais to care for and counsel victims of rape . dw staff -lrb- mrh -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

unfortunately , no one 's really having any last laughs . george bush won the last presidential election by stressing the importance of faith and values .
but as he 's finding out right now , people 's faith in the financial system and the values of national stock markets have more to do with an administration 's popularity than religious homilies .
it 's impossible to deny the irony that this president , one of the greatest believers in the unfettered free market in us history , is practically begging congress to intervene in the economy .
for most of his term in office , bush has treated democracy in general and the legislative branch in particular as obstacles to be overcome .
now he 's forced to turn to the latter in an effort to avoid being remembered as the chief executive who presided over the devastation of the american economy .
at some point , john mccain piously intoned during last week 's presidential debate , greed took over the financial sector .
exactly , i found myself thinking when i heard the line .
that point was january 22 , 2001 - the first day of the first bush administration .
nearly eight years on , bush is now forced to ask the know-it-alls in a democratic congress to think up a solution to a mess caused by a misguided faith that private profits are inevitably good .
what a humbling experience that must be .
and congress is n't the only former foe upon whose help bush must rely .
by freeing up billions of dollars in short-term loan options , the european central bank is playing a major role in keeping the credit crunch from doing even more damage .
the ecb , of course , is run in part by people from germany and france , countries that the bush administration mocked and whose advice he ignored when he decided to launch an invasion of iraq .
" old europe " was , i believe , the derisive phrase used at the time .
now , the us is getting help from its " wayward " european allies , help that will likely contribute to some ordinary americans being able to keep their jobs and their homes .
the iraq war and the current threat to the global financial system are very different , but related problems .
according to nobel prize winning economist joseph stiglitz , the american experiment in bringing democracy to the middle east by force has cost the us treasury $ 845 billion .
that sum would easily cover the rescue package congress is being asked to pass , and ordinary americans are being asked to pay for .
there would even be plenty of money left over to try to find a cure for aids or pursue other projects that would restore the world 's faith in the benevolence of american motives .
lest anyone accuse me of anti-americanism , i would point out that not only am i an american , i write this as an american - as an adherent of the great american ideal that through rational self-governance , we can make the world a better place for ourselves and others .
for the past eight years , the bush administration has encouraged the american public to substitute blind faith for reason and argument .
i would hope that as the current government limps into its final days , americans reflect on the folly of that attitude .
i would also hope that those segments of the us populace that tend to dismiss europe as hostile , old-fashioned and anti-american will remember the assistance europeans are now offering .
most of all , i would hope that , with the financial crisis , a wrong-headed president and those who helped him to power are getting their final , ironic comeuppance .
i fear , though , that this may not be the last , nasty surprise of the bush presidency .
and that is definitely no laughing matter . jefferson chase send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de defense -pipe- 01.10.2008 france presses eu to revamp defense structures großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the eufor mission in kosovo has shown the eu can work together militarily eu defense ministers have kicked off a two-day meeting in france .
the french would like to see member states overhaul the way they cooperate militarily .
but is anyone lining up to salute ? as the defense ministers gathered in the french resort of deauville , french president nicolas sarkozy , who also holds the european union 's revolving presidency , set the tone for what he hopes will be a historical summit .
" how can europe be a political power that speaks with a strong voice if it is n't in a position to defend itself or take the appropriate measures to enact its defense policies , " sarkozy asked rhetorically .
the main aim of the summit , which runs until thursday , oct .
2 , is to create a rapid reaction force of 50-60,000 soldiers that could be deployed in the interests of eu security .
eu foreign policy chief javier solana also thinks the time has come for radical changes .
" one of the most important things the european union has to do is to act in real time , " solana said ahead of the summit .
" if you have a crisis or a political problem in the world and you do n't deal with it rapidly , you waste time , money and the lives , probably , of people . "
france would also like to see the creation of a general chief of staff office in brussels to oversee the force .
but as history shows , eu nations will have to show a lot of political will for member states to come together in the way paris and brussels would like .
a european army ?
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : communication and coordination remain key issues the european union , like nato , has no army of its own and instead depends upon member states to provide soldiers and material .
as a result , the bloc encounters difficulties coordinating its resources when trying to intervene militarily .
this was illustrated this week , when the eu was forced to ask russia to provide helicopters for its peacekeeping mission in chad - even though brussels and moscow were in a clinch over russian 's military incursions into georgia .
nonetheless , the maastricht treaty stipulates that the bloc have a common defense and security policy , and european military missions have proved successful in recent years .
most notably , a 1,800-person eufor force has successfully taken over responsibility for maintaining peace in kosovo from its un predecessor .
backers of reform hope that could help overcome resistance by some member states , particularly britain , to further integrating the eu 's military capabilities .
back to nato bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : charles de gaulle partially severed france 's ties with nato reform backers stress that a european force would be a supplement to , and not a replacement for , nato .
and nato may be france 's best card for pushing through changes .
france partially withdrew from the trans-atlantic alliance in 1966 and even today refuses to participate in the full range of nato activities .
paris has signaled that that could change , if it gets its way on european defense reforms .
" we will fully participate in nato , if nato fully realizes that the eu has a role , too , " an unnamed french official told reuters news agency .
but most likely the summit will produce a compromise , in which both sides of the issue get some , but not all of what they want . dw staff -lrb- jc -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

the european union and germany are " still working out how to vote , " german chancellor angela merkel said wednesday at a news conference with serbian president boris tadic , who was visiting berlin as part of efforts to develop closer ties between his country and the european union .
serbia ’ s pursuit of the icj ’ s legal opinion has been met with scepticism among some european nations who say the legal process , which could take as long as three years to deliver a response on kosovo ’ s legality , would effectively and damagingly halt the international integration of the former serbian province .
diplomats and un officials have forecast that a raft of countries would abstain from the nearing assembly vote .
while quickly recognized by leading western nations , the promotion kosovo had hoped for in the united nations and snowballing international recognition were blocked by serbia 's powerful ally russia .
partition a no-go : tadic bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : tadic has denied floating the partition idea earlier this week emerging from the talks with tadic , chancellor angela merkel also rejected proposals for an ethnic division of kosovo .
reports from belgrade the previous day suggested that tadic himself had suggested division as a compromise , but in berlin he said that he had been misunderstood .
" partition is being discussed in serbia and the international community and it has been one of the options during all these years , " tadic had told an evening press conference tuesday , sept .
30 .
" that option i can consider only when all other options are spent . "
but tadic told reporters wednesday the interpretation of what he said had been " politically wrong . "
the serb leader said belgrade would never recognize kosovo ’ s independence , but was making an effort to shift the kosovo issue " from a political corner to the legal corner " by seeking the opinion of the icj .
" i will reiterate the position and policy of serbia regarding kosovo , " he said .
" serbia does not and will never recognize kosovo 's independence . "
as serbian president , tadic has limited formal authority , but as the leader of the pro-european ruling coalition , in power since may elections , he is the actual speaker for serbia .
serbia 's icj request futile , pristina says the government in pristina , dominated by albanians and boycotted by minority serbs , meanwhile declared the issue closed and is seeking support from more countries than the 47 that have recognized it so far .
" our message to all those who profess partitioning kosovo is that they 've lost kosovo forever , " the kosovo parliament speaker jakup krasniqi told dpa news agency in pristina .
" kosovo now has internationally recognized , defined borders and any attempt to change them would open new problems in the balkans , " he warned .

the assembly is to vote on the matter oct .
8 .
the european union and germany are " still working out how to vote , " german chancellor angela merkel said wednesday at a news conference with serbian president boris tadic , who was visiting berlin as part of efforts to develop closer ties between his country and the european union .
serbia ’ s pursuit of the icj ’ s legal opinion has been met with scepticism among some european nations who say the legal process , which could take as long as three years to deliver a response on kosovo ’ s legality , would effectively and damagingly halt the international integration of the former serbian province .
diplomats and un officials have forecast that a raft of countries would abstain from the nearing assembly vote .
while quickly recognized by leading western nations , the promotion kosovo had hoped for in the united nations and snowballing international recognition were blocked by serbia 's powerful ally russia .
partition a no-go : tadic bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : tadic has denied floating the partition idea earlier this week emerging from the talks with tadic , chancellor angela merkel also rejected proposals for an ethnic division of kosovo .
reports from belgrade the previous day suggested that tadic himself had suggested division as a compromise , but in berlin he said that he had been misunderstood .
" partition is being discussed in serbia and the international community and it has been one of the options during all these years , " tadic had told an evening press conference tuesday , sept .
30 .
" that option i can consider only when all other options are spent . "
but tadic told reporters wednesday the interpretation of what he said had been " politically wrong . "
the serb leader said belgrade would never recognize kosovo ’ s independence , but was making an effort to shift the kosovo issue " from a political corner to the legal corner " by seeking the opinion of the icj .
" i will reiterate the position and policy of serbia regarding kosovo , " he said .
" serbia does not and will never recognize kosovo 's independence . "
as serbian president , tadic has limited formal authority , but as the leader of the pro-european ruling coalition , in power since may elections , he is the actual speaker for serbia .
serbia 's icj request futile , pristina says the government in pristina , dominated by albanians and boycotted by minority serbs , meanwhile declared the issue closed and is seeking support from more countries than the 47 that have recognized it so far .
" our message to all those who profess partitioning kosovo is that they 've lost kosovo forever , " the kosovo parliament speaker jakup krasniqi told dpa news agency in pristina .
" kosovo now has internationally recognized , defined borders and any attempt to change them would open new problems in the balkans , " he warned .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de finance -pipe- 01.10.2008 opinion : bush forced to rely on help from old foes in crisis großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : if people 's homes and livelihoods were n't on the line , says jefferson chase , the bush administration 's latest predicament would be funny .
unfortunately , no one 's really having any last laughs . george bush won the last presidential election by stressing the importance of faith and values .
but as he 's finding out right now , people 's faith in the financial system and the values of national stock markets have more to do with an administration 's popularity than religious homilies .
it 's impossible to deny the irony that this president , one of the greatest believers in the unfettered free market in us history , is practically begging congress to intervene in the economy .
for most of his term in office , bush has treated democracy in general and the legislative branch in particular as obstacles to be overcome .
now he 's forced to turn to the latter in an effort to avoid being remembered as the chief executive who presided over the devastation of the american economy .
at some point , john mccain piously intoned during last week 's presidential debate , greed took over the financial sector .
exactly , i found myself thinking when i heard the line .
that point was january 22 , 2001 - the first day of the first bush administration .
nearly eight years on , bush is now forced to ask the know-it-alls in a democratic congress to think up a solution to a mess caused by a misguided faith that private profits are inevitably good .
what a humbling experience that must be .
and congress is n't the only former foe upon whose help bush must rely .
by freeing up billions of dollars in short-term loan options , the european central bank is playing a major role in keeping the credit crunch from doing even more damage .
the ecb , of course , is run in part by people from germany and france , countries that the bush administration mocked and whose advice he ignored when he decided to launch an invasion of iraq .
" old europe " was , i believe , the derisive phrase used at the time .
now , the us is getting help from its " wayward " european allies , help that will likely contribute to some ordinary americans being able to keep their jobs and their homes .
the iraq war and the current threat to the global financial system are very different , but related problems .
according to nobel prize winning economist joseph stiglitz , the american experiment in bringing democracy to the middle east by force has cost the us treasury $ 845 billion .
that sum would easily cover the rescue package congress is being asked to pass , and ordinary americans are being asked to pay for .
there would even be plenty of money left over to try to find a cure for aids or pursue other projects that would restore the world 's faith in the benevolence of american motives .
lest anyone accuse me of anti-americanism , i would point out that not only am i an american , i write this as an american - as an adherent of the great american ideal that through rational self-governance , we can make the world a better place for ourselves and others .
for the past eight years , the bush administration has encouraged the american public to substitute blind faith for reason and argument .
i would hope that as the current government limps into its final days , americans reflect on the folly of that attitude .
i would also hope that those segments of the us populace that tend to dismiss europe as hostile , old-fashioned and anti-american will remember the assistance europeans are now offering .
most of all , i would hope that , with the financial crisis , a wrong-headed president and those who helped him to power are getting their final , ironic comeuppance .
i fear , though , that this may not be the last , nasty surprise of the bush presidency .
and that is definitely no laughing matter . jefferson chase send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

unfortunately , no one 's really having any last laughs . george bush won the last presidential election by stressing the importance of faith and values .
but as he 's finding out right now , people 's faith in the financial system and the values of national stock markets have more to do with an administration 's popularity than religious homilies .
it 's impossible to deny the irony that this president , one of the greatest believers in the unfettered free market in us history , is practically begging congress to intervene in the economy .
for most of his term in office , bush has treated democracy in general and the legislative branch in particular as obstacles to be overcome .
now he 's forced to turn to the latter in an effort to avoid being remembered as the chief executive who presided over the devastation of the american economy .
at some point , john mccain piously intoned during last week 's presidential debate , greed took over the financial sector .
exactly , i found myself thinking when i heard the line .
that point was january 22 , 2001 - the first day of the first bush administration .
nearly eight years on , bush is now forced to ask the know-it-alls in a democratic congress to think up a solution to a mess caused by a misguided faith that private profits are inevitably good .
what a humbling experience that must be .
and congress is n't the only former foe upon whose help bush must rely .
by freeing up billions of dollars in short-term loan options , the european central bank is playing a major role in keeping the credit crunch from doing even more damage .
the ecb , of course , is run in part by people from germany and france , countries that the bush administration mocked and whose advice he ignored when he decided to launch an invasion of iraq .
" old europe " was , i believe , the derisive phrase used at the time .
now , the us is getting help from its " wayward " european allies , help that will likely contribute to some ordinary americans being able to keep their jobs and their homes .
the iraq war and the current threat to the global financial system are very different , but related problems .
according to nobel prize winning economist joseph stiglitz , the american experiment in bringing democracy to the middle east by force has cost the us treasury $ 845 billion .
that sum would easily cover the rescue package congress is being asked to pass , and ordinary americans are being asked to pay for .
there would even be plenty of money left over to try to find a cure for aids or pursue other projects that would restore the world 's faith in the benevolence of american motives .
lest anyone accuse me of anti-americanism , i would point out that not only am i an american , i write this as an american - as an adherent of the great american ideal that through rational self-governance , we can make the world a better place for ourselves and others .
for the past eight years , the bush administration has encouraged the american public to substitute blind faith for reason and argument .
i would hope that as the current government limps into its final days , americans reflect on the folly of that attitude .
i would also hope that those segments of the us populace that tend to dismiss europe as hostile , old-fashioned and anti-american will remember the assistance europeans are now offering .
most of all , i would hope that , with the financial crisis , a wrong-headed president and those who helped him to power are getting their final , ironic comeuppance .
i fear , though , that this may not be the last , nasty surprise of the bush presidency .
and that is definitely no laughing matter . jefferson chase send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

the csu had elected the two men to their positions only a year ago .
the resignations came after the csu 's worst election showing in half a century .
beckstein said at a brief news conference on wednesday , oct 1 he would not be available to lead the planned coalition government in the state because he lacked the " necessary degree of support " within the party .
" after the painful defeat , i notice that my support within the party ... is not sufficient to successfully take on the difficult duties that lie ahead for the state premier , " beckstein said .
beckstein had refused monday to shoulder the blame for the election disaster , insisting bavarians still wanted a csu-led government , but that they no longer wanted the conservatives to govern alone .
both huber and beckstein were blamed for a series of policy blunders over issues such as education , a much-loathed smoking ban and the scrapping of a multi-billion-euro maglev train link to munich airport .
four-member race to replace beckstein bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : csu vice chairman horst seehofer , right , is tipped to be csu party leader while horst seehofer , agriculture and consumer affairs minister in chancellor angela merkel 's cabinet in berlin , is widely expected to become csu leader , there will be a contest for the state premiership . alongside seehofer , bavarian interior minister joachim herrmann , state science minister thomas goppel and head of the csu 's parliamentary party georg schmid have expressed an interest in taking over the premiership , according to csu deputies .
seehofer , who is also csu vice-chairman , is the only one who is known nationally .
the 59-year-old lost support among conservative quarters last year after it emerged that his mistress had given birth to his child .
" we will make it clear to people that we have understood sunday 's election result , " seehofer told reporters tuesday , adding that an upcoming party conference was about " stabilizing the party " and making it " fresh and modern . "
ruinous election result bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : bavarians turned their backs on the csu in large numbers and turned towards bavaria 's smaller parties the csu , which had single-handedly ruled the german state for more than four decades and is a key party in merkel 's federal coalition , lost nearly one third of its voter support sunday .
left with only 43.4 percent , the csu - bavaria 's sister party to merkel 's christian democratic union - fell short of a majority and will be forced to form a coalition government , all factors which have led to the downfall of beckstein and huber .
analysts have said that the bavaria outcome could hurt merkel 's chances of retaining power in federal elections scheduled for sept .
2009 .
csu secretary general christine haderthauer , who herself resigned tuesday in the wake of the weekend 's poll , said the disastrous result was a black day for the party .
in the last state elections in 2003 , the csu polled 60.7 percent of the vote in the strongly catholic state , where some of germany 's leading companies have their headquarters , including siemens and bmw .
the party 's stated intent had been to retain its absolute majority in the 180-seat parliament in munich .

the french would like to see member states overhaul the way they cooperate militarily .
but is anyone lining up to salute ? as the defense ministers gathered in the french resort of deauville , french president nicolas sarkozy , who also holds the european union 's revolving presidency , set the tone for what he hopes will be a historical summit .
" how can europe be a political power that speaks with a strong voice if it is n't in a position to defend itself or take the appropriate measures to enact its defense policies , " sarkozy asked rhetorically .
the main aim of the summit , which runs until thursday , oct .
2 , is to create a rapid reaction force of 50-60,000 soldiers that could be deployed in the interests of eu security .
eu foreign policy chief javier solana also thinks the time has come for radical changes .
" one of the most important things the european union has to do is to act in real time , " solana said ahead of the summit .
" if you have a crisis or a political problem in the world and you do n't deal with it rapidly , you waste time , money and the lives , probably , of people . "
france would also like to see the creation of a general chief of staff office in brussels to oversee the force .
but as history shows , eu nations will have to show a lot of political will for member states to come together in the way paris and brussels would like .
a european army ?
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : communication and coordination remain key issues the european union , like nato , has no army of its own and instead depends upon member states to provide soldiers and material .
as a result , the bloc encounters difficulties coordinating its resources when trying to intervene militarily .
this was illustrated this week , when the eu was forced to ask russia to provide helicopters for its peacekeeping mission in chad - even though brussels and moscow were in a clinch over russian 's military incursions into georgia .
nonetheless , the maastricht treaty stipulates that the bloc have a common defense and security policy , and european military missions have proved successful in recent years .
most notably , a 1,800-person eufor force has successfully taken over responsibility for maintaining peace in kosovo from its un predecessor .
backers of reform hope that could help overcome resistance by some member states , particularly britain , to further integrating the eu 's military capabilities .
back to nato bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : charles de gaulle partially severed france 's ties with nato reform backers stress that a european force would be a supplement to , and not a replacement for , nato .
and nato may be france 's best card for pushing through changes .
france partially withdrew from the trans-atlantic alliance in 1966 and even today refuses to participate in the full range of nato activities .
paris has signaled that that could change , if it gets its way on european defense reforms .
" we will fully participate in nato , if nato fully realizes that the eu has a role , too , " an unnamed french official told reuters news agency .

the french would like to see member states overhaul the way they cooperate militarily .
but is anyone lining up to salute ? as the defense ministers gathered in the french resort of deauville , french president nicolas sarkozy , who also holds the european union 's revolving presidency , set the tone for what he hopes will be a historical summit .
" how can europe be a political power that speaks with a strong voice if it is n't in a position to defend itself or take the appropriate measures to enact its defense policies , " sarkozy asked rhetorically .
the main aim of the summit , which runs until thursday , oct .
2 , is to create a rapid reaction force of 50-60,000 soldiers that could be deployed in the interests of eu security .
eu foreign policy chief javier solana also thinks the time has come for radical changes .
" one of the most important things the european union has to do is to act in real time , " solana said ahead of the summit .
" if you have a crisis or a political problem in the world and you do n't deal with it rapidly , you waste time , money and the lives , probably , of people . "
france would also like to see the creation of a general chief of staff office in brussels to oversee the force .
but as history shows , eu nations will have to show a lot of political will for member states to come together in the way paris and brussels would like .
a european army ?
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : communication and coordination remain key issues the european union , like nato , has no army of its own and instead depends upon member states to provide soldiers and material .
as a result , the bloc encounters difficulties coordinating its resources when trying to intervene militarily .
this was illustrated this week , when the eu was forced to ask russia to provide helicopters for its peacekeeping mission in chad - even though brussels and moscow were in a clinch over russian 's military incursions into georgia .
nonetheless , the maastricht treaty stipulates that the bloc have a common defense and security policy , and european military missions have proved successful in recent years .
most notably , a 1,800-person eufor force has successfully taken over responsibility for maintaining peace in kosovo from its un predecessor .
backers of reform hope that could help overcome resistance by some member states , particularly britain , to further integrating the eu 's military capabilities .
back to nato bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : charles de gaulle partially severed france 's ties with nato reform backers stress that a european force would be a supplement to , and not a replacement for , nato .
and nato may be france 's best card for pushing through changes .
france partially withdrew from the trans-atlantic alliance in 1966 and even today refuses to participate in the full range of nato activities .
paris has signaled that that could change , if it gets its way on european defense reforms .
" we will fully participate in nato , if nato fully realizes that the eu has a role , too , " an unnamed french official told reuters news agency .
but most likely the summit will produce a compromise , in which both sides of the issue get some , but not all of what they want . dw staff -lrb- jc -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

the most important point is the withdrawal of russian troops from two " security zones " deep inside georgian territory , which russia occupied in august .
the eu had hoped to get moscow 's forces to withdraw from the breakaway regions of abkhazia and south ossetia as well , but russian president dmitry medvedev categorically ruled that out .
european leaders were forced to accept less than they wanted .
" this is all really very incomplete , as i and everyone else know , " french foreign minister bernard kouchner said in late september .
" but in the first instance it was for us a matter of getting a date for a russian withdrawal from the parts of georgia that border with abkhazia and south ossetia . "

germany has sent 40 observers , most of them police officers .
the mission is directed by germany 's former ambassador to lebanon , hansjoerg haber , who has been in georgia since sept .

" this mission is purely civilian and that 's our big challenge , " haber said .
" it 's operating in an area that 's been marked by violence , looting and every kind of disturbance .
i think the people are ready for someone who does not carry arms and is n't grim-looking , but who waves and smiles and is really just an observer . "
haber added that , thus far , his russian counterparts have been cooperating .
" they seem business-like , and we 've established contact with them , " haber said .
" i 'm sure we 'll have an orderly handover with them . "

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de finance -pipe- 01.10.2008 opinion : bush forced to rely on help from old foes in crisis großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : if people 's homes and livelihoods were n't on the line , says jefferson chase , the bush administration 's latest predicament would be funny .
unfortunately , no one 's really having any last laughs . george bush won the last presidential election by stressing the importance of faith and values .
but as he 's finding out right now , people 's faith in the financial system and the values of national stock markets have more to do with an administration 's popularity than religious homilies .
it 's impossible to deny the irony that this president , one of the greatest believers in the unfettered free market in us history , is practically begging congress to intervene in the economy .
for most of his term in office , bush has treated democracy in general and the legislative branch in particular as obstacles to be overcome .
now he 's forced to turn to the latter in an effort to avoid being remembered as the chief executive who presided over the devastation of the american economy .
at some point , john mccain piously intoned during last week 's presidential debate , greed took over the financial sector .
exactly , i found myself thinking when i heard the line .
that point was january 22 , 2001 - the first day of the first bush administration .
nearly eight years on , bush is now forced to ask the know-it-alls in a democratic congress to think up a solution to a mess caused by a misguided faith that private profits are inevitably good .
what a humbling experience that must be .
and congress is n't the only former foe upon whose help bush must rely .
by freeing up billions of dollars in short-term loan options , the european central bank is playing a major role in keeping the credit crunch from doing even more damage .
the ecb , of course , is run in part by people from germany and france , countries that the bush administration mocked and whose advice he ignored when he decided to launch an invasion of iraq .
" old europe " was , i believe , the derisive phrase used at the time .
now , the us is getting help from its " wayward " european allies , help that will likely contribute to some ordinary americans being able to keep their jobs and their homes .
the iraq war and the current threat to the global financial system are very different , but related problems .
according to nobel prize winning economist joseph stiglitz , the american experiment in bringing democracy to the middle east by force has cost the us treasury $ 845 billion .
that sum would easily cover the rescue package congress is being asked to pass , and ordinary americans are being asked to pay for .
there would even be plenty of money left over to try to find a cure for aids or pursue other projects that would restore the world 's faith in the benevolence of american motives .
lest anyone accuse me of anti-americanism , i would point out that not only am i an american , i write this as an american - as an adherent of the great american ideal that through rational self-governance , we can make the world a better place for ourselves and others .
for the past eight years , the bush administration has encouraged the american public to substitute blind faith for reason and argument .
i would hope that as the current government limps into its final days , americans reflect on the folly of that attitude .
i would also hope that those segments of the us populace that tend to dismiss europe as hostile , old-fashioned and anti-american will remember the assistance europeans are now offering .
most of all , i would hope that , with the financial crisis , a wrong-headed president and those who helped him to power are getting their final , ironic comeuppance .
i fear , though , that this may not be the last , nasty surprise of the bush presidency .
and that is definitely no laughing matter . jefferson chase send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

unfortunately , no one 's really having any last laughs . george bush won the last presidential election by stressing the importance of faith and values .
but as he 's finding out right now , people 's faith in the financial system and the values of national stock markets have more to do with an administration 's popularity than religious homilies .
it 's impossible to deny the irony that this president , one of the greatest believers in the unfettered free market in us history , is practically begging congress to intervene in the economy .
for most of his term in office , bush has treated democracy in general and the legislative branch in particular as obstacles to be overcome .
now he 's forced to turn to the latter in an effort to avoid being remembered as the chief executive who presided over the devastation of the american economy .
at some point , john mccain piously intoned during last week 's presidential debate , greed took over the financial sector .
exactly , i found myself thinking when i heard the line .
that point was january 22 , 2001 - the first day of the first bush administration .
nearly eight years on , bush is now forced to ask the know-it-alls in a democratic congress to think up a solution to a mess caused by a misguided faith that private profits are inevitably good .
what a humbling experience that must be .
and congress is n't the only former foe upon whose help bush must rely .
by freeing up billions of dollars in short-term loan options , the european central bank is playing a major role in keeping the credit crunch from doing even more damage .
the ecb , of course , is run in part by people from germany and france , countries that the bush administration mocked and whose advice he ignored when he decided to launch an invasion of iraq .
" old europe " was , i believe , the derisive phrase used at the time .
now , the us is getting help from its " wayward " european allies , help that will likely contribute to some ordinary americans being able to keep their jobs and their homes .
the iraq war and the current threat to the global financial system are very different , but related problems .
according to nobel prize winning economist joseph stiglitz , the american experiment in bringing democracy to the middle east by force has cost the us treasury $ 845 billion .
that sum would easily cover the rescue package congress is being asked to pass , and ordinary americans are being asked to pay for .
there would even be plenty of money left over to try to find a cure for aids or pursue other projects that would restore the world 's faith in the benevolence of american motives .
lest anyone accuse me of anti-americanism , i would point out that not only am i an american , i write this as an american - as an adherent of the great american ideal that through rational self-governance , we can make the world a better place for ourselves and others .
for the past eight years , the bush administration has encouraged the american public to substitute blind faith for reason and argument .
i would hope that as the current government limps into its final days , americans reflect on the folly of that attitude .
i would also hope that those segments of the us populace that tend to dismiss europe as hostile , old-fashioned and anti-american will remember the assistance europeans are now offering .
most of all , i would hope that , with the financial crisis , a wrong-headed president and those who helped him to power are getting their final , ironic comeuppance .
i fear , though , that this may not be the last , nasty surprise of the bush presidency .
and that is definitely no laughing matter . jefferson chase send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

for the past eight years , the bush administration has encouraged the american public to substitute blind faith for reason and argument .
i would hope that as the current government limps into its final days , americans reflect on the folly of that attitude .
i would also hope that those segments of the us populace that tend to dismiss europe as hostile , old-fashioned and anti-american will remember the assistance europeans are now offering .
most of all , i would hope that , with the financial crisis , a wrong-headed president and those who helped him to power are getting their final , ironic comeuppance .
i fear , though , that this may not be the last , nasty surprise of the bush presidency .
and that is definitely no laughing matter . jefferson chase send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de society -pipe- 01.10.2008 cologne gynaecologist wins " alternative nobel prize " großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : hauser 's work to help female victims of war has earned her international fame for more than a decade , monika hauser 's work to rehabilitate victims of wartime sexual abuse has earned her a raft of awards .
now , she ’ s won something bigger - the right livelihood award , or alternative nobel prize . back in 1992 , monika hauser read newspaper accounts of rape committed on a mass scale in bosnia .
rape had become a war tactic , and that thought sickened her . " i was angry too that the press was reporting on it so graphically - through-the-keyhole sorts of accounts , " she said .
" they couldn ’ t get enough .
i thought , these women were being used twice , so to speak , and i said to myself i ’ d like to do something about it . ” the swiss-born gynaecologist knew from her own practice in cologne that rape victims needed support and care , not just publicity , and so in 1993 she left for bosnia .
hauser , along with 20 local women , set up a trauma therapy center for rape victims in the bosnian city of zenica . hauser deplores " double standards " the project was a success , and hauser quickly gained fame in germany for her humanitarian efforts . german public television network ard ’ s news department awarded her its ‘ woman of the year ’ prize in 1993 .
the social democratic party honored her with a similar prize a year later . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : bosnian muslim women , victims of wartime rape , protesting outside the un in sarajevo earlier this year the accolades were helpful in raising publicity and funds for the clinic in zenica , and for the women ’ s foundation hauser founded , medica mondiale . since then hauser ’ s foundation has helped women in kosovo , albania , afghanistan , congo , iraq and uganda . but despite the laurels , hauser said , in the past decade politicians from germany and other eu countries have not really shown an increased interest in helping female victims of war crimes . a particular problem , she said , is that even as european troops participate in peacekeeping missions abroad , in part to protect women from crimes like rape , many of the soldiers themselves visit local brothels . the military leadership seems unbothered by the fact that many of these establishments frequented by the troops employ women who are underage or are working against their will . the double standard is frustrating , hauser said , adding she 'd learned to live with it . " you ’ ve got to have a high frustration threshold when you ’ re involved in feminist projects , " she said . " a big honor " in an interview with deutsche welle , hauser expressed surprise at winning the alternative nobel wednesday , saying she would “ accept it happily . ” in the past , hauser has been choosy about accepting prizes .
in 1996 , the german government wanted to award her its highest honor , the federal cross of merit -lrb- bundesverdienstkreuz -rrb- , but hauser turned them down .
she was unhappy that the state had threatened to deport thousands of bosnian refugees living in germany . the alternative nobel , however , she said , “ is really about recognizing social alternatives and honoring movements that have made an impact in changing the world . ” she added that “ it ’ s a big honor ” to be thought of in that way . the award is n't just a honor but also comes with a $ 50,000-euro purse .
hauser said she would split the money between her first project , the women ’ s therapy center in zenica , bosnia , and her latest one , in the eastern part of the democratic republic of congo . there , medica mondiale works to train women recruited by the local group pais to care for and counsel victims of rape . dw staff -lrb- mrh -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

hauser , along with 20 local women , set up a trauma therapy center for rape victims in the bosnian city of zenica . hauser deplores " double standards " the project was a success , and hauser quickly gained fame in germany for her humanitarian efforts . german public television network ard ’ s news department awarded her its ‘ woman of the year ’ prize in 1993 .
the social democratic party honored her with a similar prize a year later . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : bosnian muslim women , victims of wartime rape , protesting outside the un in sarajevo earlier this year the accolades were helpful in raising publicity and funds for the clinic in zenica , and for the women ’ s foundation hauser founded , medica mondiale . since then hauser ’ s foundation has helped women in kosovo , albania , afghanistan , congo , iraq and uganda . but despite the laurels , hauser said , in the past decade politicians from germany and other eu countries have not really shown an increased interest in helping female victims of war crimes . a particular problem , she said , is that even as european troops participate in peacekeeping missions abroad , in part to protect women from crimes like rape , many of the soldiers themselves visit local brothels . the military leadership seems unbothered by the fact that many of these establishments frequented by the troops employ women who are underage or are working against their will . the double standard is frustrating , hauser said , adding she 'd learned to live with it . " you ’ ve got to have a high frustration threshold when you ’ re involved in feminist projects , " she said . " a big honor " in an interview with deutsche welle , hauser expressed surprise at winning the alternative nobel wednesday , saying she would “ accept it happily . ” in the past , hauser has been choosy about accepting prizes .
in 1996 , the german government wanted to award her its highest honor , the federal cross of merit -lrb- bundesverdienstkreuz -rrb- , but hauser turned them down .
she was unhappy that the state had threatened to deport thousands of bosnian refugees living in germany . the alternative nobel , however , she said , “ is really about recognizing social alternatives and honoring movements that have made an impact in changing the world . ” she added that “ it ’ s a big honor ” to be thought of in that way . the award is n't just a honor but also comes with a $ 50,000-euro purse .
hauser said she would split the money between her first project , the women ’ s therapy center in zenica , bosnia , and her latest one , in the eastern part of the democratic republic of congo . there , medica mondiale works to train women recruited by the local group pais to care for and counsel victims of rape . dw staff -lrb- mrh -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

the csu had elected the two men to their positions only a year ago .
the resignations came after the csu 's worst election showing in half a century .
beckstein said at a brief news conference on wednesday , oct 1 he would not be available to lead the planned coalition government in the state because he lacked the " necessary degree of support " within the party .
" after the painful defeat , i notice that my support within the party ... is not sufficient to successfully take on the difficult duties that lie ahead for the state premier , " beckstein said .
beckstein had refused monday to shoulder the blame for the election disaster , insisting bavarians still wanted a csu-led government , but that they no longer wanted the conservatives to govern alone .
both huber and beckstein were blamed for a series of policy blunders over issues such as education , a much-loathed smoking ban and the scrapping of a multi-billion-euro maglev train link to munich airport .
four-member race to replace beckstein bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : csu vice chairman horst seehofer , right , is tipped to be csu party leader while horst seehofer , agriculture and consumer affairs minister in chancellor angela merkel 's cabinet in berlin , is widely expected to become csu leader , there will be a contest for the state premiership . alongside seehofer , bavarian interior minister joachim herrmann , state science minister thomas goppel and head of the csu 's parliamentary party georg schmid have expressed an interest in taking over the premiership , according to csu deputies .
seehofer , who is also csu vice-chairman , is the only one who is known nationally .
the 59-year-old lost support among conservative quarters last year after it emerged that his mistress had given birth to his child .
" we will make it clear to people that we have understood sunday 's election result , " seehofer told reporters tuesday , adding that an upcoming party conference was about " stabilizing the party " and making it " fresh and modern . "
ruinous election result bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : bavarians turned their backs on the csu in large numbers and turned towards bavaria 's smaller parties the csu , which had single-handedly ruled the german state for more than four decades and is a key party in merkel 's federal coalition , lost nearly one third of its voter support sunday .
left with only 43.4 percent , the csu - bavaria 's sister party to merkel 's christian democratic union - fell short of a majority and will be forced to form a coalition government , all factors which have led to the downfall of beckstein and huber .
analysts have said that the bavaria outcome could hurt merkel 's chances of retaining power in federal elections scheduled for sept .
2009 .
csu secretary general christine haderthauer , who herself resigned tuesday in the wake of the weekend 's poll , said the disastrous result was a black day for the party .
in the last state elections in 2003 , the csu polled 60.7 percent of the vote in the strongly catholic state , where some of germany 's leading companies have their headquarters , including siemens and bmw .
the party 's stated intent had been to retain its absolute majority in the 180-seat parliament in munich .

the csu had elected the two men to their positions only a year ago .
the resignations came after the csu 's worst election showing in half a century .
beckstein said at a brief news conference on wednesday , oct 1 he would not be available to lead the planned coalition government in the state because he lacked the " necessary degree of support " within the party .
" after the painful defeat , i notice that my support within the party ... is not sufficient to successfully take on the difficult duties that lie ahead for the state premier , " beckstein said .
beckstein had refused monday to shoulder the blame for the election disaster , insisting bavarians still wanted a csu-led government , but that they no longer wanted the conservatives to govern alone .
both huber and beckstein were blamed for a series of policy blunders over issues such as education , a much-loathed smoking ban and the scrapping of a multi-billion-euro maglev train link to munich airport .
four-member race to replace beckstein bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : csu vice chairman horst seehofer , right , is tipped to be csu party leader while horst seehofer , agriculture and consumer affairs minister in chancellor angela merkel 's cabinet in berlin , is widely expected to become csu leader , there will be a contest for the state premiership . alongside seehofer , bavarian interior minister joachim herrmann , state science minister thomas goppel and head of the csu 's parliamentary party georg schmid have expressed an interest in taking over the premiership , according to csu deputies .
seehofer , who is also csu vice-chairman , is the only one who is known nationally .
the 59-year-old lost support among conservative quarters last year after it emerged that his mistress had given birth to his child .
" we will make it clear to people that we have understood sunday 's election result , " seehofer told reporters tuesday , adding that an upcoming party conference was about " stabilizing the party " and making it " fresh and modern . "
ruinous election result bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : bavarians turned their backs on the csu in large numbers and turned towards bavaria 's smaller parties the csu , which had single-handedly ruled the german state for more than four decades and is a key party in merkel 's federal coalition , lost nearly one third of its voter support sunday .
left with only 43.4 percent , the csu - bavaria 's sister party to merkel 's christian democratic union - fell short of a majority and will be forced to form a coalition government , all factors which have led to the downfall of beckstein and huber .
analysts have said that the bavaria outcome could hurt merkel 's chances of retaining power in federal elections scheduled for sept .
2009 .
csu secretary general christine haderthauer , who herself resigned tuesday in the wake of the weekend 's poll , said the disastrous result was a black day for the party .
in the last state elections in 2003 , the csu polled 60.7 percent of the vote in the strongly catholic state , where some of germany 's leading companies have their headquarters , including siemens and bmw .
the party 's stated intent had been to retain its absolute majority in the 180-seat parliament in munich .

the french would like to see member states overhaul the way they cooperate militarily .
but is anyone lining up to salute ? as the defense ministers gathered in the french resort of deauville , french president nicolas sarkozy , who also holds the european union 's revolving presidency , set the tone for what he hopes will be a historical summit .
" how can europe be a political power that speaks with a strong voice if it is n't in a position to defend itself or take the appropriate measures to enact its defense policies , " sarkozy asked rhetorically .
the main aim of the summit , which runs until thursday , oct .
2 , is to create a rapid reaction force of 50-60,000 soldiers that could be deployed in the interests of eu security .
eu foreign policy chief javier solana also thinks the time has come for radical changes .
" one of the most important things the european union has to do is to act in real time , " solana said ahead of the summit .
" if you have a crisis or a political problem in the world and you do n't deal with it rapidly , you waste time , money and the lives , probably , of people . "
france would also like to see the creation of a general chief of staff office in brussels to oversee the force .
but as history shows , eu nations will have to show a lot of political will for member states to come together in the way paris and brussels would like .
a european army ?
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : communication and coordination remain key issues the european union , like nato , has no army of its own and instead depends upon member states to provide soldiers and material .
as a result , the bloc encounters difficulties coordinating its resources when trying to intervene militarily .
this was illustrated this week , when the eu was forced to ask russia to provide helicopters for its peacekeeping mission in chad - even though brussels and moscow were in a clinch over russian 's military incursions into georgia .
nonetheless , the maastricht treaty stipulates that the bloc have a common defense and security policy , and european military missions have proved successful in recent years .
most notably , a 1,800-person eufor force has successfully taken over responsibility for maintaining peace in kosovo from its un predecessor .
backers of reform hope that could help overcome resistance by some member states , particularly britain , to further integrating the eu 's military capabilities .
back to nato bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : charles de gaulle partially severed france 's ties with nato reform backers stress that a european force would be a supplement to , and not a replacement for , nato .
and nato may be france 's best card for pushing through changes .
france partially withdrew from the trans-atlantic alliance in 1966 and even today refuses to participate in the full range of nato activities .
paris has signaled that that could change , if it gets its way on european defense reforms .
" we will fully participate in nato , if nato fully realizes that the eu has a role , too , " an unnamed french official told reuters news agency .

the french would like to see member states overhaul the way they cooperate militarily .
but is anyone lining up to salute ? as the defense ministers gathered in the french resort of deauville , french president nicolas sarkozy , who also holds the european union 's revolving presidency , set the tone for what he hopes will be a historical summit .
" how can europe be a political power that speaks with a strong voice if it is n't in a position to defend itself or take the appropriate measures to enact its defense policies , " sarkozy asked rhetorically .
the main aim of the summit , which runs until thursday , oct .
2 , is to create a rapid reaction force of 50-60,000 soldiers that could be deployed in the interests of eu security .
eu foreign policy chief javier solana also thinks the time has come for radical changes .
" one of the most important things the european union has to do is to act in real time , " solana said ahead of the summit .
" if you have a crisis or a political problem in the world and you do n't deal with it rapidly , you waste time , money and the lives , probably , of people . "
france would also like to see the creation of a general chief of staff office in brussels to oversee the force .
but as history shows , eu nations will have to show a lot of political will for member states to come together in the way paris and brussels would like .
a european army ?
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : communication and coordination remain key issues the european union , like nato , has no army of its own and instead depends upon member states to provide soldiers and material .
as a result , the bloc encounters difficulties coordinating its resources when trying to intervene militarily .
this was illustrated this week , when the eu was forced to ask russia to provide helicopters for its peacekeeping mission in chad - even though brussels and moscow were in a clinch over russian 's military incursions into georgia .
nonetheless , the maastricht treaty stipulates that the bloc have a common defense and security policy , and european military missions have proved successful in recent years .
most notably , a 1,800-person eufor force has successfully taken over responsibility for maintaining peace in kosovo from its un predecessor .
backers of reform hope that could help overcome resistance by some member states , particularly britain , to further integrating the eu 's military capabilities .
back to nato bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : charles de gaulle partially severed france 's ties with nato reform backers stress that a european force would be a supplement to , and not a replacement for , nato .
and nato may be france 's best card for pushing through changes .
france partially withdrew from the trans-atlantic alliance in 1966 and even today refuses to participate in the full range of nato activities .
paris has signaled that that could change , if it gets its way on european defense reforms .
" we will fully participate in nato , if nato fully realizes that the eu has a role , too , " an unnamed french official told reuters news agency .
but most likely the summit will produce a compromise , in which both sides of the issue get some , but not all of what they want . dw staff -lrb- jc -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

" the commission was able to decide within 24 hours that the state aid measures comply with eu rules on rescue aid , " the eu executive said in a statement .
" uk authorities have committed to submit a restructuring and / or liquidation plan within six months , which will be examined by the commission under its rules on restructuring aid . "

so who 's right ? european stock markets were holding steady in early-morning trading on wednesday , oct .
1 , as investors seemed assured that the us congress would indeed pass a major financial rescue package this week .
but some experts say that the worst may be yet to come .
" a recession is no longer avoidable for the old world , that is , the us , europe and japan , " the chief economist at deutsche bank norbert walter told the stuttgarter nachrichten newspaper .
others , however , warned against being too gloomy .
" we should n't call a crisis into existence , " the head of the german chambers of industry and commerce , martin wansleben , said on a morning magazine program on german state television .
" i would n't be so quick to talk about a recession . "
wansleben said he expected the german economy to grow by two percent this year , although he acknowledged that orders placed with german businesses were currently declining .

so who 's right ? european stock markets were holding steady in early-morning trading on wednesday , oct .
1 , as investors seemed assured that the us congress would indeed pass a major financial rescue package this week .
but some experts say that the worst may be yet to come .
" a recession is no longer avoidable for the old world , that is , the us , europe and japan , " the chief economist at deutsche bank norbert walter told the stuttgarter nachrichten newspaper .
others , however , warned against being too gloomy .
" we should n't call a crisis into existence , " the head of the german chambers of industry and commerce , martin wansleben , said on a morning magazine program on german state television .
" i would n't be so quick to talk about a recession . "
wansleben said he expected the german economy to grow by two percent this year , although he acknowledged that orders placed with german businesses were currently declining .
last week , ireland became the first eu member state to officially enter recession , and fears are rife that the rest of the bloc , dragged down by the us financial crisis , could follow suit .
emergency plan ?
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the ecb in frankfurt is doing its part by making credit available how hard europe gets hit by the aftermath of the credit crunch will be determined in part by actions yet to be taken .
european political and economic leaders repeated their calls on wednesday for the us congress to pass emergency aid legislation .
but they were also discussing what europe could do to shore up its own economy and financial sector .
french president nicolas sarkozy , who also holds the eu 's rotating presidency , has called for an emergency summit of world leaders to lay the groundwork for a new global financial system .
and the european commission is set to unveil plans to improve regulation over the financial sector .
meanwhile , the european central bank has said it will continue to provide $ 50 billion in extra liquidity to ensure that banks in need of short-term loans will be able to get them .
but the ecb is no longer expected to lower prime interest rates , as some had hoped , when it meets on thursday .
imf : get organized !
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : strauss-kahn says europe needs to act as one the head of the international monetary fund , dominique strauss-kahn , has said individual european countries need to better integrate their policies to deal with all the possible outcomes of the crisis .
" they have to organize themselves , " strauss-kahn told reuters news agency .
" it 's urgently necessary … the eu 's rules make it harder to act than in the us . "
and strauss-kahn stressed that the first step would have to be taken by the us congress .
bildunterschrift : the senate will be focus of attention on wednesday evening " an incomplete plan is better than no plan , " he said .
the us senate is scheduled to vote on the rescue package on wednesday evening .
if the senators approve it , the plan could be put to the house of representatives the following day . dw staff -lrb- jc -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

the european union and germany are " still working out how to vote , " german chancellor angela merkel said wednesday at a news conference with serbian president boris tadic , who was visiting berlin as part of efforts to develop closer ties between his country and the european union .
serbia ’ s pursuit of the icj ’ s legal opinion has been met with scepticism among some european nations who say the legal process , which could take as long as three years to deliver a response on kosovo ’ s legality , would effectively and damagingly halt the international integration of the former serbian province .
diplomats and un officials have forecast that a raft of countries would abstain from the nearing assembly vote .
while quickly recognized by leading western nations , the promotion kosovo had hoped for in the united nations and snowballing international recognition were blocked by serbia 's powerful ally russia .
partition a no-go : tadic bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : tadic has denied floating the partition idea earlier this week emerging from the talks with tadic , chancellor angela merkel also rejected proposals for an ethnic division of kosovo .
reports from belgrade the previous day suggested that tadic himself had suggested division as a compromise , but in berlin he said that he had been misunderstood .
" partition is being discussed in serbia and the international community and it has been one of the options during all these years , " tadic had told an evening press conference tuesday , sept .
30 .
" that option i can consider only when all other options are spent . "
but tadic told reporters wednesday the interpretation of what he said had been " politically wrong . "
the serb leader said belgrade would never recognize kosovo ’ s independence , but was making an effort to shift the kosovo issue " from a political corner to the legal corner " by seeking the opinion of the icj .
" i will reiterate the position and policy of serbia regarding kosovo , " he said .
" serbia does not and will never recognize kosovo 's independence . "
as serbian president , tadic has limited formal authority , but as the leader of the pro-european ruling coalition , in power since may elections , he is the actual speaker for serbia .
serbia 's icj request futile , pristina says the government in pristina , dominated by albanians and boycotted by minority serbs , meanwhile declared the issue closed and is seeking support from more countries than the 47 that have recognized it so far .
" our message to all those who profess partitioning kosovo is that they 've lost kosovo forever , " the kosovo parliament speaker jakup krasniqi told dpa news agency in pristina .

the european union and germany are " still working out how to vote , " german chancellor angela merkel said wednesday at a news conference with serbian president boris tadic , who was visiting berlin as part of efforts to develop closer ties between his country and the european union .
serbia ’ s pursuit of the icj ’ s legal opinion has been met with scepticism among some european nations who say the legal process , which could take as long as three years to deliver a response on kosovo ’ s legality , would effectively and damagingly halt the international integration of the former serbian province .
diplomats and un officials have forecast that a raft of countries would abstain from the nearing assembly vote .
while quickly recognized by leading western nations , the promotion kosovo had hoped for in the united nations and snowballing international recognition were blocked by serbia 's powerful ally russia .
partition a no-go : tadic bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : tadic has denied floating the partition idea earlier this week emerging from the talks with tadic , chancellor angela merkel also rejected proposals for an ethnic division of kosovo .
reports from belgrade the previous day suggested that tadic himself had suggested division as a compromise , but in berlin he said that he had been misunderstood .
" partition is being discussed in serbia and the international community and it has been one of the options during all these years , " tadic had told an evening press conference tuesday , sept .

" that option i can consider only when all other options are spent . "
but tadic told reporters wednesday the interpretation of what he said had been " politically wrong . "
the serb leader said belgrade would never recognize kosovo ’ s independence , but was making an effort to shift the kosovo issue " from a political corner to the legal corner " by seeking the opinion of the icj .
" i will reiterate the position and policy of serbia regarding kosovo , " he said .
" serbia does not and will never recognize kosovo 's independence . "
as serbian president , tadic has limited formal authority , but as the leader of the pro-european ruling coalition , in power since may elections , he is the actual speaker for serbia .
serbia 's icj request futile , pristina says the government in pristina , dominated by albanians and boycotted by minority serbs , meanwhile declared the issue closed and is seeking support from more countries than the 47 that have recognized it so far .
" our message to all those who profess partitioning kosovo is that they 've lost kosovo forever , " the kosovo parliament speaker jakup krasniqi told dpa news agency in pristina .

so who 's right ? european stock markets were holding steady in early-morning trading on wednesday , oct .
1 , as investors seemed assured that the us congress would indeed pass a major financial rescue package this week .
but some experts say that the worst may be yet to come .
" a recession is no longer avoidable for the old world , that is , the us , europe and japan , " the chief economist at deutsche bank norbert walter told the stuttgarter nachrichten newspaper .
others , however , warned against being too gloomy .
" we should n't call a crisis into existence , " the head of the german chambers of industry and commerce , martin wansleben , said on a morning magazine program on german state television .
" i would n't be so quick to talk about a recession . "
wansleben said he expected the german economy to grow by two percent this year , although he acknowledged that orders placed with german businesses were currently declining .
last week , ireland became the first eu member state to officially enter recession , and fears are rife that the rest of the bloc , dragged down by the us financial crisis , could follow suit .
emergency plan ?
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the ecb in frankfurt is doing its part by making credit available how hard europe gets hit by the aftermath of the credit crunch will be determined in part by actions yet to be taken .
european political and economic leaders repeated their calls on wednesday for the us congress to pass emergency aid legislation .
but they were also discussing what europe could do to shore up its own economy and financial sector .
french president nicolas sarkozy , who also holds the eu 's rotating presidency , has called for an emergency summit of world leaders to lay the groundwork for a new global financial system .
and the european commission is set to unveil plans to improve regulation over the financial sector .
meanwhile , the european central bank has said it will continue to provide $ 50 billion in extra liquidity to ensure that banks in need of short-term loans will be able to get them .
but the ecb is no longer expected to lower prime interest rates , as some had hoped , when it meets on thursday .
imf : get organized !
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : strauss-kahn says europe needs to act as one the head of the international monetary fund , dominique strauss-kahn , has said individual european countries need to better integrate their policies to deal with all the possible outcomes of the crisis .
" they have to organize themselves , " strauss-kahn told reuters news agency .
" it 's urgently necessary … the eu 's rules make it harder to act than in the us . "
and strauss-kahn stressed that the first step would have to be taken by the us congress .
bildunterschrift : the senate will be focus of attention on wednesday evening " an incomplete plan is better than no plan , " he said .
the us senate is scheduled to vote on the rescue package on wednesday evening .

the assembly is to vote on the matter oct .
8 .
the european union and germany are " still working out how to vote , " german chancellor angela merkel said wednesday at a news conference with serbian president boris tadic , who was visiting berlin as part of efforts to develop closer ties between his country and the european union .
serbia ’ s pursuit of the icj ’ s legal opinion has been met with scepticism among some european nations who say the legal process , which could take as long as three years to deliver a response on kosovo ’ s legality , would effectively and damagingly halt the international integration of the former serbian province .
diplomats and un officials have forecast that a raft of countries would abstain from the nearing assembly vote .
while quickly recognized by leading western nations , the promotion kosovo had hoped for in the united nations and snowballing international recognition were blocked by serbia 's powerful ally russia .
partition a no-go : tadic bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : tadic has denied floating the partition idea earlier this week emerging from the talks with tadic , chancellor angela merkel also rejected proposals for an ethnic division of kosovo .
reports from belgrade the previous day suggested that tadic himself had suggested division as a compromise , but in berlin he said that he had been misunderstood .
" partition is being discussed in serbia and the international community and it has been one of the options during all these years , " tadic had told an evening press conference tuesday , sept .
30 .
" that option i can consider only when all other options are spent . "
but tadic told reporters wednesday the interpretation of what he said had been " politically wrong . "
the serb leader said belgrade would never recognize kosovo ’ s independence , but was making an effort to shift the kosovo issue " from a political corner to the legal corner " by seeking the opinion of the icj .
" i will reiterate the position and policy of serbia regarding kosovo , " he said .
" serbia does not and will never recognize kosovo 's independence . "
as serbian president , tadic has limited formal authority , but as the leader of the pro-european ruling coalition , in power since may elections , he is the actual speaker for serbia .
serbia 's icj request futile , pristina says the government in pristina , dominated by albanians and boycotted by minority serbs , meanwhile declared the issue closed and is seeking support from more countries than the 47 that have recognized it so far .
" our message to all those who profess partitioning kosovo is that they 've lost kosovo forever , " the kosovo parliament speaker jakup krasniqi told dpa news agency in pristina .
" kosovo now has internationally recognized , defined borders and any attempt to change them would open new problems in the balkans , " he warned .

now , she ’ s won something bigger - the right livelihood award , or alternative nobel prize . back in 1992 , monika hauser read newspaper accounts of rape committed on a mass scale in bosnia .
rape had become a war tactic , and that thought sickened her . " i was angry too that the press was reporting on it so graphically - through-the-keyhole sorts of accounts , " she said .
" they couldn ’ t get enough .
i thought , these women were being used twice , so to speak , and i said to myself i ’ d like to do something about it . ” the swiss-born gynaecologist knew from her own practice in cologne that rape victims needed support and care , not just publicity , and so in 1993 she left for bosnia .
hauser , along with 20 local women , set up a trauma therapy center for rape victims in the bosnian city of zenica . hauser deplores " double standards " the project was a success , and hauser quickly gained fame in germany for her humanitarian efforts . german public television network ard ’ s news department awarded her its ‘ woman of the year ’ prize in 1993 .
the social democratic party honored her with a similar prize a year later . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : bosnian muslim women , victims of wartime rape , protesting outside the un in sarajevo earlier this year the accolades were helpful in raising publicity and funds for the clinic in zenica , and for the women ’ s foundation hauser founded , medica mondiale . since then hauser ’ s foundation has helped women in kosovo , albania , afghanistan , congo , iraq and uganda . but despite the laurels , hauser said , in the past decade politicians from germany and other eu countries have not really shown an increased interest in helping female victims of war crimes . a particular problem , she said , is that even as european troops participate in peacekeeping missions abroad , in part to protect women from crimes like rape , many of the soldiers themselves visit local brothels . the military leadership seems unbothered by the fact that many of these establishments frequented by the troops employ women who are underage or are working against their will . the double standard is frustrating , hauser said , adding she 'd learned to live with it . " you ’ ve got to have a high frustration threshold when you ’ re involved in feminist projects , " she said . " a big honor " in an interview with deutsche welle , hauser expressed surprise at winning the alternative nobel wednesday , saying she would “ accept it happily . ” in the past , hauser has been choosy about accepting prizes .
in 1996 , the german government wanted to award her its highest honor , the federal cross of merit -lrb- bundesverdienstkreuz -rrb- , but hauser turned them down .
she was unhappy that the state had threatened to deport thousands of bosnian refugees living in germany . the alternative nobel , however , she said , “ is really about recognizing social alternatives and honoring movements that have made an impact in changing the world . ” she added that “ it ’ s a big honor ” to be thought of in that way . the award is n't just a honor but also comes with a $ 50,000-euro purse .
hauser said she would split the money between her first project , the women ’ s therapy center in zenica , bosnia , and her latest one , in the eastern part of the democratic republic of congo . there , medica mondiale works to train women recruited by the local group pais to care for and counsel victims of rape . dw staff -lrb- mrh -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

the most important point is the withdrawal of russian troops from two " security zones " deep inside georgian territory , which russia occupied in august .
the eu had hoped to get moscow 's forces to withdraw from the breakaway regions of abkhazia and south ossetia as well , but russian president dmitry medvedev categorically ruled that out .
european leaders were forced to accept less than they wanted .
" this is all really very incomplete , as i and everyone else know , " french foreign minister bernard kouchner said in late september .
" but in the first instance it was for us a matter of getting a date for a russian withdrawal from the parts of georgia that border with abkhazia and south ossetia . "
" purely civilian " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : haber will be overseeing the overseers the eu observer mission consists of some 200 unarmed police officers and civilian experts .
they will not be given military escort , although they will be transported in armored suvs .
the mission is made up of a large contingent of french gendarmes , as well as human rights and legal experts .
germany has sent 40 observers , most of them police officers .
the mission is directed by germany 's former ambassador to lebanon , hansjoerg haber , who has been in georgia since sept .
20 .
" this mission is purely civilian and that 's our big challenge , " haber said .
" it 's operating in an area that 's been marked by violence , looting and every kind of disturbance .
i think the people are ready for someone who does not carry arms and is n't grim-looking , but who waves and smiles and is really just an observer . "
haber added that , thus far , his russian counterparts have been cooperating .
" they seem business-like , and we 've established contact with them , " haber said .
" i 'm sure we 'll have an orderly handover with them . "
monitoring the ceasefire bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : russian troops have already moved out of towns like gori despite earlier objections from the russian military , eu monitors have entered the russian-controlled " buffer zone " around south ossetia .
reuters news agency reported that an eu patrol was stopped at a russian military checkpoint marking the edge of the zone , but was waved through shortly afterwards .
on a visit to tbilisi on tuesday , eu foreign policy chief javier solana said the bloc expects russia to respect the peace plan and pull its troops by an oct .
10 deadline .
" the objective of the mission is to allow russian forces to withdraw , " solana said .

the assembly is to vote on the matter oct .
8 .
the european union and germany are " still working out how to vote , " german chancellor angela merkel said wednesday at a news conference with serbian president boris tadic , who was visiting berlin as part of efforts to develop closer ties between his country and the european union .
serbia ’ s pursuit of the icj ’ s legal opinion has been met with scepticism among some european nations who say the legal process , which could take as long as three years to deliver a response on kosovo ’ s legality , would effectively and damagingly halt the international integration of the former serbian province .
diplomats and un officials have forecast that a raft of countries would abstain from the nearing assembly vote .
while quickly recognized by leading western nations , the promotion kosovo had hoped for in the united nations and snowballing international recognition were blocked by serbia 's powerful ally russia .
partition a no-go : tadic bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : tadic has denied floating the partition idea earlier this week emerging from the talks with tadic , chancellor angela merkel also rejected proposals for an ethnic division of kosovo .
reports from belgrade the previous day suggested that tadic himself had suggested division as a compromise , but in berlin he said that he had been misunderstood .
" partition is being discussed in serbia and the international community and it has been one of the options during all these years , " tadic had told an evening press conference tuesday , sept .
30 .
" that option i can consider only when all other options are spent . "
but tadic told reporters wednesday the interpretation of what he said had been " politically wrong . "
the serb leader said belgrade would never recognize kosovo ’ s independence , but was making an effort to shift the kosovo issue " from a political corner to the legal corner " by seeking the opinion of the icj .
" i will reiterate the position and policy of serbia regarding kosovo , " he said .
" serbia does not and will never recognize kosovo 's independence . "
as serbian president , tadic has limited formal authority , but as the leader of the pro-european ruling coalition , in power since may elections , he is the actual speaker for serbia .
serbia 's icj request futile , pristina says the government in pristina , dominated by albanians and boycotted by minority serbs , meanwhile declared the issue closed and is seeking support from more countries than the 47 that have recognized it so far .
" our message to all those who profess partitioning kosovo is that they 've lost kosovo forever , " the kosovo parliament speaker jakup krasniqi told dpa news agency in pristina .
" kosovo now has internationally recognized , defined borders and any attempt to change them would open new problems in the balkans , " he warned .

this week alone , crofters have told of lambs being killed by white-tailed sea eagles and the cost and labour involved in electronically tagging animals .
three recently-released official documents highlight the decline and problems in the industry .
here the bbc scotland news website looks at the pressures and the warnings from experts and the industry .
scottish agricultural college the sac rural policy centre have published research called farming 's retreat from the hills .
its authors tony waterhouse , steven thomson and andrew midgley investigated growing concerns about fewer livestock in upland areas and the effect that has in social and environmental terms .
they found sheep numbers had " declined dramatically " since 1999 , most significantly in the north west .
some areas had seen a reduction of between 35 and 60 % .
reasons included down-sizing of farms and the numbers of farmers withdrawing from sheep production .
the royal society of edinburgh the educational charity looked at the importance of livestock grazing in its committee of inquiry into the future of scotland 's hills and islands .
it found sheep and cattle to be key for biodiversity and landscape management .
but it warned this was difficult to achieve if the decline in the numbers of both continued .
the society recommended the best way to reverse this situation was through support for grazing management and for experts in the field to give guidance on the appropriate levels of grazing for habitats .
nfu scotland in early september , the union launched its manifesto for the hills containing proposals to halt what it called an " exodus " of sheep and cattle .
it followed reports from its members across the country who were either selling up their stock or planning to in the face of rising feed , fuel and fertiliser costs .
nfu scotland also said the market price for livestock had " consistently failed " to reflect costs of production .
the manifesto said the industry had to help itself , but also required new policies from the scottish government .
in a press release issued at the launch , the union said there was no single policy solution to the current problems .
nfus president jim mclaren said at the time : " we are currently witnessing an exodus of livestock and people from our hills and uplands , unlike anything i have seen in my lifetime . "
farmers and crofters ravens have previously been blamed for preying on newborn lambs in inverness-shire and this week there have been growing calls for action in the wake of claims sea eagles are killing livestock .
meanwhile , a delegation of farmers are to call for concessions on plans by the european union to impose the fitting of electronic tags to all sheep .
speyside farmer robert macdonald said it would lead to an accelerated decline in the industry .
with each tag costing up to £ 1.50 , the aim of the scheme is to improve the tracking of animals from farms to where they end up in food production .
mr macdonald told bbc scotland : " it is happening already and it would just accelerate the drift away from sheep because of the time and the money involved .
" you would see huge tracts of our hills returned to scrub which is to no advantage to anybody , or the farming industry . "

based on the memoir of journalist toby young , pegg stars as sidney , a brash british journalist who lands the chance to write for an upmarket us magazine in new york .
also starring jeff bridges , gillian anderson and megan fox , the film follows sidney as he tries to make his way up the career ladder in spite of his obnoxiousness .
the actor talks about the new film , upcoming projects - and his most embarrassing moment .
what attracted you to this role ?
the script was really good - you can always tell within the first five pages of a script if it 's going to be enjoyable and i was really enjoying this one straightaway .
and also bob weide was attached - who directed curb your enthusiasm - which is a favourite programme of mine , so i was immediately drawn to it .
it was n't until i signed up that i realised the other people that were going to be in it as well , so that was a bonus .
are you anything like your character in the film ?
oh no , i 'm not as ruthlessly self-promoting as sidney or desperate to be part of that world .
i 'm much happier being away from it .
what 's the biggest gaffe you 've ever made ?
on set bob reminded gillian anderson of the scene in spaced where i talk about having fantasies about her which embarrassed me immensely .
but i do n't think i 've ever really made a faux pas like sidney - i 'm slightly more careful .
you 're best known for comedies - is that why you took a role in star trek to show you have a more serious side ?
i 'm not trying to prove anything to anybody - i do what i do because it makes me happy and if i read a script and i like it , or i get the chance to be in something as monumentally historic as star trek , then i 'm going to do it .
i do n't do it because i think ' what will people think of me ? ' .
i wish it did n't involve any of that .
it would be nice if you got to make your film and give it to your mum on dvd .
but the choices i make are about if i think i 'm going to enjoy it .
my favourite thing about this job is shooting and being on set and the three or four months it takes to make the film - the second part i could do without !
can you tell us any secrets from the enterprise ?
no .
is it all hush hush ?
yes , it 's very secret .
hot fuzz and shaun of the dead were recently named in empire magazine 's top 500 films - how does that feel ?
that 's lovely .
it 's wonderful that somebody should think that .
it 's probably not the opinion of the world , but its an opinion and one that 's very flattering so we 're thrilled to bits by that .
i think they 've done a special cover of shaun of the dead as well which they 've sent us posters of .
tell us about your new film , paul , with nick frost and when we can see it .
we 're shooting it next year so late 2009 or early 2010 , but we 've just got to finish off the script .
it 's being directed by greg mottola who did superbad and we 'll be shooting in new mexico .
it 's a road movie about two friends who are comic book aficionados who go to the san diego comic con and end up doing a road trip around america and get into all sorts of crazy scrapes .
and you 've got one more film to come with edgar wright have n't you ?
yes , the world ends .
that 's going to be the third one in the shaun of the dead / hot fuzz series of films .
edgar and myself have yet to write it , but he 's coming back from la next week and we 're going to sit down and start hashing it out .
you 're the godfather to chris martin and gwyneth paltrow 's daughter apple - how did that come about and do you have any cool godfatherly duties ?
you know what , they never talk about their private life so i 'm not going to .
i 'm just a godfather like anyone else .
are you a cool uncle ?
i do have two nieces and they think i 'm cool but i never see them .
and what do they think of your work ?
they like it - but they 're not allowed to watch most of it !
how to lose friends and alienate people is on general release in the uk on 3 october .
simon pegg was talking to bbc entertainment reporter genevieve hassan .

pegg stars as brash british journalist sidney young based on the memoir of journalist toby young , pegg stars as sidney , a brash british journalist who lands the chance to write for an upmarket us magazine in new york .
also starring jeff bridges , gillian anderson and megan fox , the film follows sidney as he tries to make his way up the career ladder in spite of his obnoxiousness .
the actor talks about the new film , upcoming projects - and his most embarrassing moment .
what attracted you to this role ?
the script was really good - you can always tell within the first five pages of a script if it 's going to be enjoyable and i was really enjoying this one straightaway .
and also bob weide was attached - who directed curb your enthusiasm - which is a favourite programme of mine , so i was immediately drawn to it .
it was n't until i signed up that i realised the other people that were going to be in it as well , so that was a bonus .
are you anything like your character in the film ?
oh no , i 'm not as ruthlessly self-promoting as sidney or desperate to be part of that world .
i 'm much happier being away from it .
what 's the biggest gaffe you 've ever made ?
on set bob reminded gillian anderson of the scene in spaced where i talk about having fantasies about her which embarrassed me immensely .
but i do n't think i 've ever really made a faux pas like sidney - i 'm slightly more careful .
megan fox -lrb- centre -rrb- and kirsten dunst -lrb- right -rrb- also star in the film .
you 're best known for comedies - is that why you took a role in star trek to show you have a more serious side ?
i 'm not trying to prove anything to anybody - i do what i do because it makes me happy and if i read a script and i like it , or i get the chance to be in something as monumentally historic as star trek , then i 'm going to do it .
i do n't do it because i think ' what will people think of me ? ' .
i wish it did n't involve any of that .
it would be nice if you got to make your film and give it to your mum on dvd .
but the choices i make are about if i think i 'm going to enjoy it .
my favourite thing about this job is shooting and being on set and the three or four months it takes to make the film - the second part i could do without !
can you tell us any secrets from the enterprise ?
no .
is it all hush hush ?
yes , it 's very secret .
hot fuzz and shaun of the dead were recently named in empire magazine 's top 500 films - how does that feel ?
that 's lovely .
it 's wonderful that somebody should think that .
it 's probably not the opinion of the world , but its an opinion and one that 's very flattering so we 're thrilled to bits by that .
i think they 've done a special cover of shaun of the dead as well which they 've sent us posters of .

pegg stars as brash british journalist sidney young based on the memoir of journalist toby young , pegg stars as sidney , a brash british journalist who lands the chance to write for an upmarket us magazine in new york .
also starring jeff bridges , gillian anderson and megan fox , the film follows sidney as he tries to make his way up the career ladder in spite of his obnoxiousness .
the actor talks about the new film , upcoming projects - and his most embarrassing moment .
what attracted you to this role ?
the script was really good - you can always tell within the first five pages of a script if it 's going to be enjoyable and i was really enjoying this one straightaway .
and also bob weide was attached - who directed curb your enthusiasm - which is a favourite programme of mine , so i was immediately drawn to it .
it was n't until i signed up that i realised the other people that were going to be in it as well , so that was a bonus .
are you anything like your character in the film ?
oh no , i 'm not as ruthlessly self-promoting as sidney or desperate to be part of that world .
i 'm much happier being away from it .
what 's the biggest gaffe you 've ever made ?
on set bob reminded gillian anderson of the scene in spaced where i talk about having fantasies about her which embarrassed me immensely .
but i do n't think i 've ever really made a faux pas like sidney - i 'm slightly more careful .
megan fox -lrb- centre -rrb- and kirsten dunst -lrb- right -rrb- also star in the film .
you 're best known for comedies - is that why you took a role in star trek to show you have a more serious side ?
i 'm not trying to prove anything to anybody - i do what i do because it makes me happy and if i read a script and i like it , or i get the chance to be in something as monumentally historic as star trek , then i 'm going to do it .
i do n't do it because i think ' what will people think of me ? ' .
i wish it did n't involve any of that .
it would be nice if you got to make your film and give it to your mum on dvd .
but the choices i make are about if i think i 'm going to enjoy it .
my favourite thing about this job is shooting and being on set and the three or four months it takes to make the film - the second part i could do without !
can you tell us any secrets from the enterprise ?
no .
is it all hush hush ?
yes , it 's very secret .
hot fuzz and shaun of the dead were recently named in empire magazine 's top 500 films - how does that feel ?
that 's lovely .
it 's wonderful that somebody should think that .
it 's probably not the opinion of the world , but its an opinion and one that 's very flattering so we 're thrilled to bits by that .
i think they 've done a special cover of shaun of the dead as well which they 've sent us posters of .
nick frost will star in paul with simon pegg tell us about your new film , paul , with nick frost and when we can see it .
we 're shooting it next year so late 2009 or early 2010 , but we 've just got to finish off the script .
it 's being directed by greg mottola who did superbad and we 'll be shooting in new mexico .
it 's a road movie about two friends who are comic book aficionados who go to the san diego comic con and end up doing a road trip around america and get into all sorts of crazy scrapes .
and you 've got one more film to come with edgar wright have n't you ?
yes , the world ends .
that 's going to be the third one in the shaun of the dead / hot fuzz series of films .
edgar and myself have yet to write it , but he 's coming back from la next week and we 're going to sit down and start hashing it out .
you 're the godfather to chris martin and gwyneth paltrow 's daughter apple - how did that come about and do you have any cool godfatherly duties ?
you know what , they never talk about their private life so i 'm not going to .
i 'm just a godfather like anyone else .
are you a cool uncle ?
i do have two nieces and they think i 'm cool but i never see them .
and what do they think of your work ?
they like it - but they 're not allowed to watch most of it !

a study on 114 younger children who had been exposed to road traffic accidents in the uk found one in 10 suffered continued anxiety after the event .
although this is similar to the rate seen in adults , most go unrecognised and untreated , say the king 's college london experts .
their work is published in the latest edition of the american journal of psychiatry .
undetected one reason for the lack of knowledge about young children is the difficulty in making psychiatric diagnoses in this age group , as they frequently lack the language ability to talk about their feelings and experiences . "
children are quite resilient and often parents and close relatives are the best therapy " professor david cottrell , of young minds and the tools used by doctors to spot and measure post-traumatic stress disorder -lrb- ptsd -rrb- were designed with adults in mind .
the researchers , from king 's and the medical research council 's cognition and brain science unit cambridge , used an age-appropriate technique for diagnosing ptsd in the young children that relied on parents ' reporting of how their offspring were coping .
all of the 114 children aged between two and 10 had visited a & e departments in london after a road traffic accident .
half had been passengers in a car , others were pedestrians or cyclists struck by a car , and all had relatively minor physical injuries .
at assessment in the month following the accident , and again six months later , more than 10 % of the children met conditions for a diagnosis of ptsd .
these children had nightmares and difficulty sleeping , displayed avoidance behaviours , such as not wanting to go out in the car or walk on busy roads , and were described by their parents as " jumpy " and " on edge " .
ptsd symptoms flashbacks and nightmares avoidance from stressful situations increased arousal and feelings of being under constant threat the symptoms are persistent and disturb everyday life lead researcher dr richard meiser-stedman , from king 's institute of psychiatry , said : " our findings indicate that the mental health needs of pre-school children caught up in terrifying events should be considered by parents and health services .
" this is especially important as young children are not able to access health services on their own and are at such a vulnerable point in their development .
" more research is needed into how ptsd in young children should be treated and how parents can best help their offspring in the aftermath of a trauma . "
professor david cottrell , of young minds and a child and adolescent psychiatrist at leeds university , said : " sadly , children experience a lot of traumatic events .
however , it is important to remember that the vast majority of children will not develop symptoms and will not need any intervention after a stressful event .
" children are quite resilient and often parents and close relatives are the best therapy . "

children are quite resilient and often parents and close relatives are the best therapy professor david cottrell , of young minds and the tools used by doctors to spot and measure post-traumatic stress disorder -lrb- ptsd -rrb- were designed with adults in mind .
the researchers , from king 's and the medical research council 's cognition and brain science unit cambridge , used an age-appropriate technique for diagnosing ptsd in the young children that relied on parents ' reporting of how their offspring were coping .
all of the 114 children aged between two and 10 had visited a & e departments in london after a road traffic accident .

" this is especially important as young children are not able to access health services on their own and are at such a vulnerable point in their development .
" more research is needed into how ptsd in young children should be treated and how parents can best help their offspring in the aftermath of a trauma . "
professor david cottrell , of young minds and a child and adolescent psychiatrist at leeds university , said : " sadly , children experience a lot of traumatic events .
