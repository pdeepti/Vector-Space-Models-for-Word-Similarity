instead , they 're appealing to individual athletes to make political statements during the games themselves . observers in europe have reacted with both cynicism and dismay as the olympic flame makes its way across the globe , and government authorities do their best to silence critical voices on tibet .
for many journalists , the fact that the summer games in beijing are virtually assured of going ahead as planned reflects what they see as the general hypocrisy of the sporting event and the leadership of international olympic committee chairman jacques rogge .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the olympic ideals do n't always reflect ...
" figures like rogge probably would n't have a problem with staging the next olympic games in sudan , north korea or saudi arabia , " wrote the conservative vienna newspaper die presse .
" the main thing is that organizers promise to improve the human rights situation .
no one takes them at their word anyway . "
but few are advocating a major boycott of the games , as happened in moscow in 1980 and los angeles in 1984 .
indeed , some see hypocrisy on both sides .
" it 's said that the lessons from the nazi dictatorship -lsb- which staged the 1936 summer games -rsb- should not be forgotten , but history is not repeating itself , " wrote berlin 's tageszeitung newspaper .
" the people 's republic of china is not the third reich , and the chinese communist party is not the nsdap .
moreover , tibet is a country that did n't interest anyone in 1959 , when an uprising against chinese occupation was brutally suppressed . "
" the chinese can legitimately ask with what right the former colonial powers great britain and france were allowed to stage the games , despite hardly treating the people they colonized with kid gloves , " wrote the left-wing budapest daily nepszava .
" if china was stripped of the olympics , it would only strengthen the communist-nationalist hardliners and paralyze the slow , but still perceptible democratization of the country . "
conscience as a guide bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : protestors were arrested at the flame-lighting ceremony on march 24 olympic functionaries often vacillate between claiming that sports and politics should not be mixed , and that the olympic games represent positive political ideals .
european pundits hold out little hope that the contradictions can be resolved by a threat from the world 's large sporting nations to boycott the beijing event .
but they are encouraging athletes to make critical statements about china 's policies toward tibet .
" it 's a simple matter of civic courage , and athletes and sports functionaries should show it just like anyone else , " wrote the online edition of the german weekly magazine focus .
" the statutes of the ioc may prohibit political statements during the games .
that places responsibly on older athletes who want to end their sporting careers after the games anyway .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de afghanistan -pipe- 25.03.2008 western aid failing to reach afghanistan , report says großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : afghanistan has been ravaged by war for years aid agencies said that up to $ 10 billion -lrb- 6.5 billion euros -rrb- , or 40 percent , of promised aid to afghanistan has not been delivered by the west .
germany and the eu , however , questioned the organizations ' calculations . aid agencies said that up to $ 10 billion -lrb- 6.5 billion euros -rrb- , or 40 percent , of promised aid to afghanistan has not been delivered by the west , and what does arrive bypasses the afghan government . western countries have failed to carry through on their pledges of aid to afghanistan , according to a report by the agency coordinating body for afghan relief -lrb- acbar -rrb- .
the umbrella group of non-governmental organizations which work in afghanistan said the international community had pledged $ 25 billion to afghanistan since 2001 , when the extremist taliban government was toppled , but that up to $ 10 billion had not reached the country . the us government - the biggest international donor to afghanistan - " has one of the biggest shortfalls , " providing only half of the $ 10.4 billion dollars of pledged money until 2008 , the report said . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : aid for development just a " fraction " of military expenditure the european commission and germany had delivered less than two-thirds of their respective $ 1.7 billion and $ 1.2 billion in commitments , acbar said . but a spokesperson for the german development ministry disputed that statement , saying that his country had paid up more than 90 percent of the money it had pledged between 2001 and 2006 . the european commission also rejected the allegations . " we are delivering - there is no delay , no backlog , no shortfall or lagging behind , " a spokeswoman for the european commission 's external-affairs chief in brussels said . exaggerated costs the report said the world bank had distributed just over half of its promised funds . furthermore , " just $ 15 billion in aid has so far been spent , of which it is estimated a staggering 40 percent has returned to donor countries in corporate profits and consultant salaries … vastly pushing up expenditures , " the report said .

germany and the eu , however , questioned the organizations ' calculations . aid agencies said that up to $ 10 billion -lrb- 6.5 billion euros -rrb- , or 40 percent , of promised aid to afghanistan has not been delivered by the west , and what does arrive bypasses the afghan government . western countries have failed to carry through on their pledges of aid to afghanistan , according to a report by the agency coordinating body for afghan relief -lrb- acbar -rrb- .
the umbrella group of non-governmental organizations which work in afghanistan said the international community had pledged $ 25 billion to afghanistan since 2001 , when the extremist taliban government was toppled , but that up to $ 10 billion had not reached the country . the us government - the biggest international donor to afghanistan - " has one of the biggest shortfalls , " providing only half of the $ 10.4 billion dollars of pledged money until 2008 , the report said . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : aid for development just a " fraction " of military expenditure the european commission and germany had delivered less than two-thirds of their respective $ 1.7 billion and $ 1.2 billion in commitments , acbar said . but a spokesperson for the german development ministry disputed that statement , saying that his country had paid up more than 90 percent of the money it had pledged between 2001 and 2006 . the european commission also rejected the allegations . " we are delivering - there is no delay , no backlog , no shortfall or lagging behind , " a spokeswoman for the european commission 's external-affairs chief in brussels said . exaggerated costs the report said the world bank had distributed just over half of its promised funds . furthermore , " just $ 15 billion in aid has so far been spent , of which it is estimated a staggering 40 percent has returned to donor countries in corporate profits and consultant salaries … vastly pushing up expenditures , " the report said . " for example , a road between the center of kabul and the international airport cost the united states more than $ 2.3 million per kilometer , at least four times the average cost of building a road in afghanistan . " many of the full-time expatriate consultants working for private companies in afghanistan receive $ 250,000 to $ 500,000 a year , including salary , allowances and other costs , the report said . a " fraction " spent on aid the report , entitled " falling short , " was written by the aid group oxfam for acbar .
acbar is made up of 94 agencies , including oxfam , christian aid , care , islamic relief and save the children . the group said that foreign money spent on aid , development and reconstruction is now just " a fraction " of military expenditures . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : afghanistan is the biggest producer of poppy-derived opium for heroin the us military alone spends some $ 100 million a day in fighting insurgents in afghanistan , but average spending on aid by all donors since 2001 has amounted to only $ 7 million daily . " given the links between development and security , the effectiveness of aid also has a major impact on peace and stability , " acbar said .
" yet thus far aid has been insufficient and in many cases wasteful and ineffective . " in addition , afghanistan received just $ 57 per capita in aid in the two years after international intervention in 2001 , compared to $ 679 a head in bosnia and $ 233 in east timor , acbar said . inefficiency and corruption are problematic some of the shortfalls , however , could be attributed to " challenging operating conditions , high levels of corruption and weak absorption capacities , " acbar noted . the group said this demonstrated the need for donors to solve such problems , adding that the weaknesses could be the reason that about two-thirds of foreign assistance bypassed the afghan government - undermining attempts to build effective state institutions . world bank country manager mariam sherman told afp news agency that its disbursal rate - estimated to be about 50 percent - was " actually very good . "
but she conceded that while the world bank channeled all its funds through the government budget , it was a problem that so much of it bypassed the administration . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : germany has more than 3,000 soldiers in afghanistan " to build a state and be accountable to its people , the government needs to have a say in resource allocation , " sherman told afp . extreme poverty prevails acbar stressed that despite the formation of the western-backed afghan government six years ago , the country still suffers from extreme poverty .
just 20 percent of the population has access to potable water ; only 5 percent has electricity . the group also drew attention to recent reports from the southern province of ghazni which said that residents in remote villages were eating grass to quell their hunger . acbar called on the international community to increase aid and ensure that it makes a lasting effect for the poorest afghans . " aid must address afghan needs , build local capacities and help afghans help themselves , " said matt waldman , afghanistan policy adviser at oxfam and the report 's author . dw staff -lrb- als -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de in focus : dossier : independence demonstrations turn violent in tibet olympic torch starts journey to beijing , despite disruptions germany calls on china to open up on tibet expert believes west can do little to sway china over tibet germany suspends aid talks with china over tibet violence press review -pipe- 25.03.2008 european press review : olympic protests , not boycott , needed großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : pro-tibet protests look set to continue as china continues to suppress pro-tibet protestors , journalists in europe say a boycott would be fruitless .
instead , they 're appealing to individual athletes to make political statements during the games themselves . observers in europe have reacted with both cynicism and dismay as the olympic flame makes its way across the globe , and government authorities do their best to silence critical voices on tibet .
for many journalists , the fact that the summer games in beijing are virtually assured of going ahead as planned reflects what they see as the general hypocrisy of the sporting event and the leadership of international olympic committee chairman jacques rogge .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the olympic ideals do n't always reflect ...
" figures like rogge probably would n't have a problem with staging the next olympic games in sudan , north korea or saudi arabia , " wrote the conservative vienna newspaper die presse .
" the main thing is that organizers promise to improve the human rights situation .
no one takes them at their word anyway . "
but few are advocating a major boycott of the games , as happened in moscow in 1980 and los angeles in 1984 .
indeed , some see hypocrisy on both sides .
" it 's said that the lessons from the nazi dictatorship -lsb- which staged the 1936 summer games -rsb- should not be forgotten , but history is not repeating itself , " wrote berlin 's tageszeitung newspaper .
" the people 's republic of china is not the third reich , and the chinese communist party is not the nsdap .
moreover , tibet is a country that did n't interest anyone in 1959 , when an uprising against chinese occupation was brutally suppressed . "
" the chinese can legitimately ask with what right the former colonial powers great britain and france were allowed to stage the games , despite hardly treating the people they colonized with kid gloves , " wrote the left-wing budapest daily nepszava .
" if china was stripped of the olympics , it would only strengthen the communist-nationalist hardliners and paralyze the slow , but still perceptible democratization of the country . "
conscience as a guide bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : protestors were arrested at the flame-lighting ceremony on march 24 olympic functionaries often vacillate between claiming that sports and politics should not be mixed , and that the olympic games represent positive political ideals .
european pundits hold out little hope that the contradictions can be resolved by a threat from the world 's large sporting nations to boycott the beijing event .
but they are encouraging athletes to make critical statements about china 's policies toward tibet .
" it 's a simple matter of civic courage , and athletes and sports functionaries should show it just like anyone else , " wrote the online edition of the german weekly magazine focus .
" the statutes of the ioc may prohibit political statements during the games .
that places responsibly on older athletes who want to end their sporting careers after the games anyway .
by taking courageous actions and accepting the subsequent bans from competition , they could crown their careers by doing something for a worthy cause . "
another commentator praised one olympic representative for having taken just such a political stand .
" there is already an exception , a woman chosen to carry the olympic torch , who has refused to participate in the lie of the political summer games , " wrote the vienna newspaper der standard .
" thailand 's narisa chakrabongse will not be receiving the olympic flame in bangkok in april .
it is her message to beijing . "
back to the roots ?
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : once again the games have been politicized some say that the only way to avoid the political controversies that seem to dog most olympic host cities would be to stage all future games in greece .
" only the establishment of a permanent facility for quadrennial use , built close to the original site in the peloponnese and paid for by sponsors and broadcasters , will avoid the kind of repellent situation we are seeing now , " wrote the guardian in britain .
given the amounts of money at play in one of the world 's highest-profile sporting events , that 's extremely unlikely to happen .
and it 's almost as far-fetched to believe that most countries would risk angering the leaders of the world 's most populous and fastest growing nation by boycotting the showcase games this summer in beijing . dw staff -lrb- jc -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

along with two colleagues , julliard was arrested on monday , march 24 at the official olympic torch-lighting ceremony in olympia , greece after unfurling a banner calling attention to the state of human rights in china . the three were arrested by greek police for holding banners featuring handcuffs in the shape of the olympic rings during a speech by liu qi , the president of the beijing olympics organizing committee . after being detained for 10 hours and charged with offending a national symbol , the three demonstrators were released on bail .
a trial is scheduled for may 29 .
julliard is now back in paris . dw-world.de : you were arrested yesterday for protesting at the olympic torch lighting ceremony .
what were you trying to bring attention to ? bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the olympic torch began its journey to china on monday jean-francois julliard : we did it because the situation of human rights and press freedom in china is getting worse .
chinese authorities made some promises when they were chosen to host the olympic games in 2001 and they have not respected any of them . there are more journalists and internet users detained now than there were in 2001 .
chinese authorities do not want to improve the situation of human rights before the olympic games . we have less than five months until the opening ceremony in beijing and we have to use this period to put pressure on chinese authorities and to raise the issue of human rights violations in china . does that mean your actions had nothing to do with the recent protests in tibet ? we planned this weeks ago .
so even if nothing had happened in tibet we would have still held the same demonstration .
the situation in tibet is just one more piece of evidence that chinese authorities are not ready to make any improvements , to let journalists walk freely in china or let the tibetan people demonstrate peacefully . you were arrested , charged and later released on bail by the greek authorities .
what were you were charged with ? bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : authorities said banners like this offend greek national symbols we were detained for 10 hours and then presented to a prosecutor .
we were charged with offending a national symbol because we used the olympic symbol on our flag .
this is why we have been charged according to greek penal code and we face one year prison terms and fines . of course , greece is a european union country so we can not imagine that we will be sentenced to prison terms because we demonstrated during the torch-lighting ceremony .
but there will be a trial late may .
we will go back to greece to attend the trial because we want to use it to once again raise the issue of the situation of human rights in china a few months before the olympics start . are you planning to attend the olympics ? we would like to very much but , no , we can not .
we tried to enter china in december .
we went to hong kong and asked for visas and we were denied .
so i think that we are blacklisted now in china . many people say that the olympics should be kept separate from politics .
what are your opinions on that issue ? bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : a boycott of the opening ceremony would send a strong signal to beijing it is a good thing that there is this debate and we think it is a positive step .

along with two colleagues , julliard was arrested on monday , march 24 at the official olympic torch-lighting ceremony in olympia , greece after unfurling a banner calling attention to the state of human rights in china . the three were arrested by greek police for holding banners featuring handcuffs in the shape of the olympic rings during a speech by liu qi , the president of the beijing olympics organizing committee . after being detained for 10 hours and charged with offending a national symbol , the three demonstrators were released on bail .
a trial is scheduled for may 29 .
julliard is now back in paris . dw-world.de : you were arrested yesterday for protesting at the olympic torch lighting ceremony .
what were you trying to bring attention to ? bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the olympic torch began its journey to china on monday jean-francois julliard : we did it because the situation of human rights and press freedom in china is getting worse .
chinese authorities made some promises when they were chosen to host the olympic games in 2001 and they have not respected any of them . there are more journalists and internet users detained now than there were in 2001 .
chinese authorities do not want to improve the situation of human rights before the olympic games . we have less than five months until the opening ceremony in beijing and we have to use this period to put pressure on chinese authorities and to raise the issue of human rights violations in china . does that mean your actions had nothing to do with the recent protests in tibet ? we planned this weeks ago .
so even if nothing had happened in tibet we would have still held the same demonstration .
the situation in tibet is just one more piece of evidence that chinese authorities are not ready to make any improvements , to let journalists walk freely in china or let the tibetan people demonstrate peacefully . you were arrested , charged and later released on bail by the greek authorities .
what were you were charged with ? bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : authorities said banners like this offend greek national symbols we were detained for 10 hours and then presented to a prosecutor .
we were charged with offending a national symbol because we used the olympic symbol on our flag .
this is why we have been charged according to greek penal code and we face one year prison terms and fines . of course , greece is a european union country so we can not imagine that we will be sentenced to prison terms because we demonstrated during the torch-lighting ceremony .
but there will be a trial late may .
we will go back to greece to attend the trial because we want to use it to once again raise the issue of the situation of human rights in china a few months before the olympics start . are you planning to attend the olympics ? we would like to very much but , no , we can not .
we tried to enter china in december .
we went to hong kong and asked for visas and we were denied .
so i think that we are blacklisted now in china . many people say that the olympics should be kept separate from politics .
what are your opinions on that issue ? bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : a boycott of the opening ceremony would send a strong signal to beijing it is a good thing that there is this debate and we think it is a positive step .
we think that the situation is going to change in the next few weeks .
the french president just said this morning -lsb- tuesday , march 25 -rsb- that every option is open .
so maybe he will agree to boycott the opening ceremony .
maybe he will just make a strong statement .
we do not know . you do not support a total boycott of the games but you do support a boycott of the opening ceremony ? we think that a total boycott would sanction the athletes and the competitors have no responsibility .
they are not the ones that decided to hold the olympic games in china so they should not be punished for that .
but we ask heads of state , heads of government , members of royal families not to attend the opening ceremony . it would be a very significant gesture to say to the chinese authorities that we are going to attend the olympic games , we are going to attend sport events , but we are not going to attend the political event which is the opening ceremony . do you think there is a danger this kind of political action will make china take an even harder line ? no , because the line can not get harder .
we waited for months before we did what we did .
we were patient .
we tried to have positive discussions with chinese authorities , but it was not successful , it was not useful at all .
so no , we could not wait any longer . are you planning any further protests ? i ca n't tell you now , but , of course , we plan to use the torch relay to do a lot .
the torch will cross through cities all over the world , and we hope there will be a lot of demonstrations .

or so one serious fare dodger seemed to think a man who just could n't stop himself from riding trains without buying a ticket will see the wrong side of a jail cell after fines and suspended sentences failed to put him on the straight and narrow . the 24-year-old will be celebrating his next birthday in the big house because of his predilection for hopping on german trains without paying his fare . his habit seemed to have gotten out of control .
from october 2006 to february 2007 , he was caught riding the train without a ticket102 times , often several times on the same day .
the court , fed up with imposing fines and suspended sentences , finally decided to get tough and gave him a 22-month holiday behind bars . throwing himself upon the mercy of the court was likely not an option this time .

germany and the eu , however , questioned the organizations ' calculations . aid agencies said that up to $ 10 billion -lrb- 6.5 billion euros -rrb- , or 40 percent , of promised aid to afghanistan has not been delivered by the west , and what does arrive bypasses the afghan government . western countries have failed to carry through on their pledges of aid to afghanistan , according to a report by the agency coordinating body for afghan relief -lrb- acbar -rrb- .
the umbrella group of non-governmental organizations which work in afghanistan said the international community had pledged $ 25 billion to afghanistan since 2001 , when the extremist taliban government was toppled , but that up to $ 10 billion had not reached the country . the us government - the biggest international donor to afghanistan - " has one of the biggest shortfalls , " providing only half of the $ 10.4 billion dollars of pledged money until 2008 , the report said . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : aid for development just a " fraction " of military expenditure the european commission and germany had delivered less than two-thirds of their respective $ 1.7 billion and $ 1.2 billion in commitments , acbar said . but a spokesperson for the german development ministry disputed that statement , saying that his country had paid up more than 90 percent of the money it had pledged between 2001 and 2006 . the european commission also rejected the allegations . " we are delivering - there is no delay , no backlog , no shortfall or lagging behind , " a spokeswoman for the european commission 's external-affairs chief in brussels said . exaggerated costs the report said the world bank had distributed just over half of its promised funds . furthermore , " just $ 15 billion in aid has so far been spent , of which it is estimated a staggering 40 percent has returned to donor countries in corporate profits and consultant salaries … vastly pushing up expenditures , " the report said . " for example , a road between the center of kabul and the international airport cost the united states more than $ 2.3 million per kilometer , at least four times the average cost of building a road in afghanistan . " many of the full-time expatriate consultants working for private companies in afghanistan receive $ 250,000 to $ 500,000 a year , including salary , allowances and other costs , the report said . a " fraction " spent on aid the report , entitled " falling short , " was written by the aid group oxfam for acbar .
acbar is made up of 94 agencies , including oxfam , christian aid , care , islamic relief and save the children . the group said that foreign money spent on aid , development and reconstruction is now just " a fraction " of military expenditures . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : afghanistan is the biggest producer of poppy-derived opium for heroin the us military alone spends some $ 100 million a day in fighting insurgents in afghanistan , but average spending on aid by all donors since 2001 has amounted to only $ 7 million daily . " given the links between development and security , the effectiveness of aid also has a major impact on peace and stability , " acbar said .
" yet thus far aid has been insufficient and in many cases wasteful and ineffective . " in addition , afghanistan received just $ 57 per capita in aid in the two years after international intervention in 2001 , compared to $ 679 a head in bosnia and $ 233 in east timor , acbar said . inefficiency and corruption are problematic some of the shortfalls , however , could be attributed to " challenging operating conditions , high levels of corruption and weak absorption capacities , " acbar noted . the group said this demonstrated the need for donors to solve such problems , adding that the weaknesses could be the reason that about two-thirds of foreign assistance bypassed the afghan government - undermining attempts to build effective state institutions . world bank country manager mariam sherman told afp news agency that its disbursal rate - estimated to be about 50 percent - was " actually very good . "
but she conceded that while the world bank channeled all its funds through the government budget , it was a problem that so much of it bypassed the administration . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : germany has more than 3,000 soldiers in afghanistan " to build a state and be accountable to its people , the government needs to have a say in resource allocation , " sherman told afp . extreme poverty prevails acbar stressed that despite the formation of the western-backed afghan government six years ago , the country still suffers from extreme poverty .
just 20 percent of the population has access to potable water ; only 5 percent has electricity . the group also drew attention to recent reports from the southern province of ghazni which said that residents in remote villages were eating grass to quell their hunger . acbar called on the international community to increase aid and ensure that it makes a lasting effect for the poorest afghans .

nuremberg has written a play book on how it 's done .
they 're teetering on the edge of the second division . last fall , no one expected nuremberg to be down at the bottom of table , battling it out with the likes of duisburg and cottbus .
the team , known as simply " the club " to german soccer fans , was coming off its 2007 victory in the german cup - its first major title in 39 years - and playing some of the most positive soccer in the bundesliga . fast forward to late march 2008 , and nuremberg find themselves in second-to-last in the standings and winless in their last nine matches .
the precipitous fall of one of last season 's overachievers is an object lesson in how not to build on success . lose focus on the league bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : coach von heesen has yet to record a win nuremberg 's german cup win not only meant a new addition to the club 's trophy case .
it also qualified them for the 2007-08 uefa cup . playing internationally is every team 's ultimate goal , but as so often is the case for smaller teams , the double burden of european and domestic contests has been anything but a blessing for nuremberg . the club performed quite well in the competition , reaching the knock-out round before losing a heartbreaking tie in late february to portuguese side , benfica lisbon , on two last-minute goals . but nuremberg 's relatively good uefa performances distracted players ' attention away from the fact that they had fallen into the relegation zone at home . " it started perhaps with a too-relaxed attitude at the start of the season , " nuremberg goalkeeper daniel klewer told dw 's bundesliga kick-off .
" we said to ourselves that we had the best team ever at nuremberg .
but hard work and constant concentration are part of the game , and we forgot that .

indeed , this seems the only plausible explanation for a decision that , from a soccer perspective , is like a slumping sprinter chopping off one of his legs . the 65-year-old meyer from the communist former east germany not only led the club to its biggest triumph in almost four decades .
he also saved the team from relegation in 2005-06 , after having previously achieved comparable feats for moenchengladbach and hertha berlin . the 46-year-old von heesen , by contrast , has a relatively brief bundesliga resume , his only other top-flight coaching experience coming at lowly bielefeld . whatever van heesen 's merits as a tactician , he 's gotten off to the worst start ever of any nuremberg coach and has n't shown any signs of solving the team 's main problem . buy players who do n't fit bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : nuremberg expended huge energy on the uefa cup nuremberg have only scored 26 times in the league despite being among the bundesliga 's best at creating goal chances .

nuremberg signed two solid scorers after their german cup triumph - reigning european champion angelos charisteas of greece and czech jan koller , who notched up 59 goals in five seasons with borussia dortmund . the problem is that neither of these classic big center forwards fits the successful style of play nuremberg showed in 2006-07 , which emphasized quick combinations rather than long balls into the box . moreover , nuremberg 's inefficiency up front is compounded by shakiness at the back .
neither klewer nor jaromir blazek has proved a completely satisfactory replacement for former keeper rafael schaefer , who departed for stuttgart in the off-season . the result is that nuremberg have conceded 18 goals in the final 30 minutes of games - second worst in the league .

nuremberg has written a play book on how it 's done .
they 're teetering on the edge of the second division . last fall , no one expected nuremberg to be down at the bottom of table , battling it out with the likes of duisburg and cottbus .
the team , known as simply " the club " to german soccer fans , was coming off its 2007 victory in the german cup - its first major title in 39 years - and playing some of the most positive soccer in the bundesliga . fast forward to late march 2008 , and nuremberg find themselves in second-to-last in the standings and winless in their last nine matches .
the precipitous fall of one of last season 's overachievers is an object lesson in how not to build on success . lose focus on the league bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : coach von heesen has yet to record a win nuremberg 's german cup win not only meant a new addition to the club 's trophy case .
it also qualified them for the 2007-08 uefa cup . playing internationally is every team 's ultimate goal , but as so often is the case for smaller teams , the double burden of european and domestic contests has been anything but a blessing for nuremberg . the club performed quite well in the competition , reaching the knock-out round before losing a heartbreaking tie in late february to portuguese side , benfica lisbon , on two last-minute goals . but nuremberg 's relatively good uefa performances distracted players ' attention away from the fact that they had fallen into the relegation zone at home . " it started perhaps with a too-relaxed attitude at the start of the season , " nuremberg goalkeeper daniel klewer told dw 's bundesliga kick-off .
" we said to ourselves that we had the best team ever at nuremberg .
but hard work and constant concentration are part of the game , and we forgot that .
and at some point you 're left standing there and nothing works .
that 's our situation now . " with only four league victories to date , no squad in the bundesliga has won less often this season . have a lot of personality clashes bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the club is now chasing the rest of the league to their credit , nuremberg 's management tried to address their precipitous slide earlier in february .
unfortunately for them , they chose exactly the wrong route , replacing veteran coach hans meyer with thomas von heesen . the popular meyer was reportedly given the ax because of personality conflicts with nuremberg 's front office , in particular sport director martin bader .
indeed , this seems the only plausible explanation for a decision that , from a soccer perspective , is like a slumping sprinter chopping off one of his legs . the 65-year-old meyer from the communist former east germany not only led the club to its biggest triumph in almost four decades .
he also saved the team from relegation in 2005-06 , after having previously achieved comparable feats for moenchengladbach and hertha berlin . the 46-year-old von heesen , by contrast , has a relatively brief bundesliga resume , his only other top-flight coaching experience coming at lowly bielefeld . whatever van heesen 's merits as a tactician , he 's gotten off to the worst start ever of any nuremberg coach and has n't shown any signs of solving the team 's main problem . buy players who do n't fit bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : nuremberg expended huge energy on the uefa cup nuremberg have only scored 26 times in the league despite being among the bundesliga 's best at creating goal chances .
that would suggest that the team 's strikers are most at fault for its demise . but that 's not the whole story .
nuremberg signed two solid scorers after their german cup triumph - reigning european champion angelos charisteas of greece and czech jan koller , who notched up 59 goals in five seasons with borussia dortmund . the problem is that neither of these classic big center forwards fits the successful style of play nuremberg showed in 2006-07 , which emphasized quick combinations rather than long balls into the box . moreover , nuremberg 's inefficiency up front is compounded by shakiness at the back .
neither klewer nor jaromir blazek has proved a completely satisfactory replacement for former keeper rafael schaefer , who departed for stuttgart in the off-season . the result is that nuremberg have conceded 18 goals in the final 30 minutes of games - second worst in the league .
that 's converted potential wins into draws , and draws into losses , costing the club some much-needed points . get yourself in must-win situations bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : ex-coach hans meyer could have the last laugh with five teams either in or near the drop zone , nuremberg 's fate is by no means sealed . whether the club can save itself from its fifth top-flight free-fall in 25 years will probably depend on how it fares in its upcoming matches against fellow relegation candidates bielefeld and duisburg . but as a team no one expected to be in such dire straits this late in the season , nuremberg will be under additional pressure to produce results . " the most important criterium is that the team believes in itself and performs , " von heesen told kick-off . " it 's a question of self-confidence , of what sort attitude one takes into matches - although i do n't want highlight a situation that puts lots of pressure on the players . " but is nuremberg fail to withstand the heat and end up in the second division again , they may find a quip by their loquacious ex-coach hans meyer ringing bitterly in their ears . " in soccer , people are very quick to erect a monument to you , " meyer once informed a curious journalist .
" but they 're just as quick to urinate on it . " the march 27 edition of bundesliga kick-off features an in-depth look at the problems in nuremberg . jefferson chase send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

or so one serious fare dodger seemed to think a man who just could n't stop himself from riding trains without buying a ticket will see the wrong side of a jail cell after fines and suspended sentences failed to put him on the straight and narrow . the 24-year-old will be celebrating his next birthday in the big house because of his predilection for hopping on german trains without paying his fare . his habit seemed to have gotten out of control .
from october 2006 to february 2007 , he was caught riding the train without a ticket102 times , often several times on the same day .
the court , fed up with imposing fines and suspended sentences , finally decided to get tough and gave him a 22-month holiday behind bars . throwing himself upon the mercy of the court was likely not an option this time .
it is not as if the man was riding ticketless due to a lack of financial means .
according to his own statement , he repeatedly dodged fares " pretty much out of boredom . " it 's likely he 'll learn the meaning of true boredom while doing time , when the highlight of his day will likely be marking another of his 669 days behind bars off his calendar . dw staff -lrb- jam -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

along with two colleagues , julliard was arrested on monday , march 24 at the official olympic torch-lighting ceremony in olympia , greece after unfurling a banner calling attention to the state of human rights in china . the three were arrested by greek police for holding banners featuring handcuffs in the shape of the olympic rings during a speech by liu qi , the president of the beijing olympics organizing committee . after being detained for 10 hours and charged with offending a national symbol , the three demonstrators were released on bail .
a trial is scheduled for may 29 .
julliard is now back in paris . dw-world.de : you were arrested yesterday for protesting at the olympic torch lighting ceremony .
what were you trying to bring attention to ? bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the olympic torch began its journey to china on monday jean-francois julliard : we did it because the situation of human rights and press freedom in china is getting worse .
chinese authorities made some promises when they were chosen to host the olympic games in 2001 and they have not respected any of them . there are more journalists and internet users detained now than there were in 2001 .
chinese authorities do not want to improve the situation of human rights before the olympic games . we have less than five months until the opening ceremony in beijing and we have to use this period to put pressure on chinese authorities and to raise the issue of human rights violations in china . does that mean your actions had nothing to do with the recent protests in tibet ? we planned this weeks ago .
so even if nothing had happened in tibet we would have still held the same demonstration .
the situation in tibet is just one more piece of evidence that chinese authorities are not ready to make any improvements , to let journalists walk freely in china or let the tibetan people demonstrate peacefully . you were arrested , charged and later released on bail by the greek authorities .
what were you were charged with ? bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : authorities said banners like this offend greek national symbols we were detained for 10 hours and then presented to a prosecutor .
we were charged with offending a national symbol because we used the olympic symbol on our flag .
this is why we have been charged according to greek penal code and we face one year prison terms and fines . of course , greece is a european union country so we can not imagine that we will be sentenced to prison terms because we demonstrated during the torch-lighting ceremony .
but there will be a trial late may .
we will go back to greece to attend the trial because we want to use it to once again raise the issue of the situation of human rights in china a few months before the olympics start . are you planning to attend the olympics ? we would like to very much but , no , we can not .
we tried to enter china in december .
we went to hong kong and asked for visas and we were denied .
so i think that we are blacklisted now in china . many people say that the olympics should be kept separate from politics .
what are your opinions on that issue ? bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : a boycott of the opening ceremony would send a strong signal to beijing it is a good thing that there is this debate and we think it is a positive step .
we think that the situation is going to change in the next few weeks .
the french president just said this morning -lsb- tuesday , march 25 -rsb- that every option is open .
so maybe he will agree to boycott the opening ceremony .
maybe he will just make a strong statement .
we do not know . you do not support a total boycott of the games but you do support a boycott of the opening ceremony ? we think that a total boycott would sanction the athletes and the competitors have no responsibility .
they are not the ones that decided to hold the olympic games in china so they should not be punished for that .
but we ask heads of state , heads of government , members of royal families not to attend the opening ceremony . it would be a very significant gesture to say to the chinese authorities that we are going to attend the olympic games , we are going to attend sport events , but we are not going to attend the political event which is the opening ceremony . do you think there is a danger this kind of political action will make china take an even harder line ? no , because the line can not get harder .
we waited for months before we did what we did .
we were patient .
we tried to have positive discussions with chinese authorities , but it was not successful , it was not useful at all .
so no , we could not wait any longer . are you planning any further protests ? i ca n't tell you now , but , of course , we plan to use the torch relay to do a lot .
the torch will cross through cities all over the world , and we hope there will be a lot of demonstrations .

along with two colleagues , julliard was arrested on monday , march 24 at the official olympic torch-lighting ceremony in olympia , greece after unfurling a banner calling attention to the state of human rights in china . the three were arrested by greek police for holding banners featuring handcuffs in the shape of the olympic rings during a speech by liu qi , the president of the beijing olympics organizing committee . after being detained for 10 hours and charged with offending a national symbol , the three demonstrators were released on bail .
a trial is scheduled for may 29 .
julliard is now back in paris . dw-world.de : you were arrested yesterday for protesting at the olympic torch lighting ceremony .
what were you trying to bring attention to ? bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the olympic torch began its journey to china on monday jean-francois julliard : we did it because the situation of human rights and press freedom in china is getting worse .
chinese authorities made some promises when they were chosen to host the olympic games in 2001 and they have not respected any of them . there are more journalists and internet users detained now than there were in 2001 .
chinese authorities do not want to improve the situation of human rights before the olympic games . we have less than five months until the opening ceremony in beijing and we have to use this period to put pressure on chinese authorities and to raise the issue of human rights violations in china . does that mean your actions had nothing to do with the recent protests in tibet ? we planned this weeks ago .
so even if nothing had happened in tibet we would have still held the same demonstration .
the situation in tibet is just one more piece of evidence that chinese authorities are not ready to make any improvements , to let journalists walk freely in china or let the tibetan people demonstrate peacefully . you were arrested , charged and later released on bail by the greek authorities .
what were you were charged with ? bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : authorities said banners like this offend greek national symbols we were detained for 10 hours and then presented to a prosecutor .
we were charged with offending a national symbol because we used the olympic symbol on our flag .
this is why we have been charged according to greek penal code and we face one year prison terms and fines . of course , greece is a european union country so we can not imagine that we will be sentenced to prison terms because we demonstrated during the torch-lighting ceremony .
but there will be a trial late may .
we will go back to greece to attend the trial because we want to use it to once again raise the issue of the situation of human rights in china a few months before the olympics start . are you planning to attend the olympics ? we would like to very much but , no , we can not .
we tried to enter china in december .
we went to hong kong and asked for visas and we were denied .
so i think that we are blacklisted now in china . many people say that the olympics should be kept separate from politics .
what are your opinions on that issue ? bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : a boycott of the opening ceremony would send a strong signal to beijing it is a good thing that there is this debate and we think it is a positive step .
we think that the situation is going to change in the next few weeks .

a trial is scheduled for may 29 .
julliard is now back in paris . dw-world.de : you were arrested yesterday for protesting at the olympic torch lighting ceremony .
what were you trying to bring attention to ? bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the olympic torch began its journey to china on monday jean-francois julliard : we did it because the situation of human rights and press freedom in china is getting worse .
chinese authorities made some promises when they were chosen to host the olympic games in 2001 and they have not respected any of them . there are more journalists and internet users detained now than there were in 2001 .
chinese authorities do not want to improve the situation of human rights before the olympic games . we have less than five months until the opening ceremony in beijing and we have to use this period to put pressure on chinese authorities and to raise the issue of human rights violations in china . does that mean your actions had nothing to do with the recent protests in tibet ? we planned this weeks ago .
so even if nothing had happened in tibet we would have still held the same demonstration .
the situation in tibet is just one more piece of evidence that chinese authorities are not ready to make any improvements , to let journalists walk freely in china or let the tibetan people demonstrate peacefully . you were arrested , charged and later released on bail by the greek authorities .
what were you were charged with ? bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : authorities said banners like this offend greek national symbols we were detained for 10 hours and then presented to a prosecutor .
we were charged with offending a national symbol because we used the olympic symbol on our flag .
this is why we have been charged according to greek penal code and we face one year prison terms and fines . of course , greece is a european union country so we can not imagine that we will be sentenced to prison terms because we demonstrated during the torch-lighting ceremony .
but there will be a trial late may .
we will go back to greece to attend the trial because we want to use it to once again raise the issue of the situation of human rights in china a few months before the olympics start . are you planning to attend the olympics ? we would like to very much but , no , we can not .
we tried to enter china in december .
we went to hong kong and asked for visas and we were denied .
so i think that we are blacklisted now in china . many people say that the olympics should be kept separate from politics .
what are your opinions on that issue ? bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : a boycott of the opening ceremony would send a strong signal to beijing it is a good thing that there is this debate and we think it is a positive step .
we think that the situation is going to change in the next few weeks .
the french president just said this morning -lsb- tuesday , march 25 -rsb- that every option is open .
so maybe he will agree to boycott the opening ceremony .
maybe he will just make a strong statement .
we do not know . you do not support a total boycott of the games but you do support a boycott of the opening ceremony ? we think that a total boycott would sanction the athletes and the competitors have no responsibility .
they are not the ones that decided to hold the olympic games in china so they should not be punished for that .
but we ask heads of state , heads of government , members of royal families not to attend the opening ceremony . it would be a very significant gesture to say to the chinese authorities that we are going to attend the olympic games , we are going to attend sport events , but we are not going to attend the political event which is the opening ceremony . do you think there is a danger this kind of political action will make china take an even harder line ? no , because the line can not get harder .
we waited for months before we did what we did .
we were patient .
we tried to have positive discussions with chinese authorities , but it was not successful , it was not useful at all .
so no , we could not wait any longer . are you planning any further protests ? i ca n't tell you now , but , of course , we plan to use the torch relay to do a lot .
the torch will cross through cities all over the world , and we hope there will be a lot of demonstrations .
the torch will be in london and paris over the next 10 days so maybe that will be our next step . interview : ole tangen jr . send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

nuremberg has written a play book on how it 's done .
they 're teetering on the edge of the second division . last fall , no one expected nuremberg to be down at the bottom of table , battling it out with the likes of duisburg and cottbus .
the team , known as simply " the club " to german soccer fans , was coming off its 2007 victory in the german cup - its first major title in 39 years - and playing some of the most positive soccer in the bundesliga . fast forward to late march 2008 , and nuremberg find themselves in second-to-last in the standings and winless in their last nine matches .

it also qualified them for the 2007-08 uefa cup . playing internationally is every team 's ultimate goal , but as so often is the case for smaller teams , the double burden of european and domestic contests has been anything but a blessing for nuremberg . the club performed quite well in the competition , reaching the knock-out round before losing a heartbreaking tie in late february to portuguese side , benfica lisbon , on two last-minute goals . but nuremberg 's relatively good uefa performances distracted players ' attention away from the fact that they had fallen into the relegation zone at home . " it started perhaps with a too-relaxed attitude at the start of the season , " nuremberg goalkeeper daniel klewer told dw 's bundesliga kick-off .

indeed , this seems the only plausible explanation for a decision that , from a soccer perspective , is like a slumping sprinter chopping off one of his legs . the 65-year-old meyer from the communist former east germany not only led the club to its biggest triumph in almost four decades .
he also saved the team from relegation in 2005-06 , after having previously achieved comparable feats for moenchengladbach and hertha berlin . the 46-year-old von heesen , by contrast , has a relatively brief bundesliga resume , his only other top-flight coaching experience coming at lowly bielefeld . whatever van heesen 's merits as a tactician , he 's gotten off to the worst start ever of any nuremberg coach and has n't shown any signs of solving the team 's main problem . buy players who do n't fit bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : nuremberg expended huge energy on the uefa cup nuremberg have only scored 26 times in the league despite being among the bundesliga 's best at creating goal chances .

nuremberg signed two solid scorers after their german cup triumph - reigning european champion angelos charisteas of greece and czech jan koller , who notched up 59 goals in five seasons with borussia dortmund . the problem is that neither of these classic big center forwards fits the successful style of play nuremberg showed in 2006-07 , which emphasized quick combinations rather than long balls into the box . moreover , nuremberg 's inefficiency up front is compounded by shakiness at the back .
neither klewer nor jaromir blazek has proved a completely satisfactory replacement for former keeper rafael schaefer , who departed for stuttgart in the off-season . the result is that nuremberg have conceded 18 goals in the final 30 minutes of games - second worst in the league .

nato mulls an eastward expansion ukraine hopes for bush 's support in nato bid abkhazia solution remains distant for europe , russia russia -pipe- 25.03.2008 incoming russian leader criticizes nato expansion großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : russia says new nato members at its border might endanger european security russia 's incoming president medvedev is " not happy " about possible nato membership for georgia and ukraine , according to comments published tuesday , march 25 .
he also said he was open to a thaw with britain . in a wide-ranging interview with britain 's financial times , dmitry medvedev said moscow did not approve of ex-soviet republics georgia and ukraine becoming nato members .
he also said he wanted to improve relations with britain and vowed to crack down on corruption and what he called russia 's " legal nihilism . " " we are not happy about the situation around georgia and ukraine , " he told the business daily ahead of a nato summit in the romanian capital bucharest next week .
" no state can be pleased about having representatives of a military bloc to which it does not belong coming close to its borders . " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : dmitry medvedev , russia 's president-elect medvedev , a 42-year-old former law professor , won a landslide victory in an election earlier this month as expected , and will succeed his political mentor , outgoing president vladimir putin , in may .
putin , however , will stay in the government as medvedev 's prime minister . at a nato summit next week , which putin will attend , georgia and ukraine are hoping to get approval from the western military alliance for its membership action plan -lrb- map -rrb- that would be seen as a signal that its application bid is on track . but the 26 nato members are split on whether to accept the two countries .
germany and france oppose the membership bids , fearful of increasing tensions with russia .
however , many of nato 's eastern european members are pushing for membership as soon as possible , saying it would increase security and reinforce democracy in both nations . us president george w. bush is due to travel to ukraine and croatia on the eve of the bucharest summit , according to the white house . russo-british thaw ? on relations with britain , which are at a post-cold war low after the murder of former russian spy alexander litvinenko in london in november 2006 , medvedev said , " we are open to the re-establishment of cooperation to the full extent . " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : alexander litvinenko london and moscow have traded sharp words since the litvinenko affair , expelled each others ' diplomats and cut back on cooperation between their intelligence services .
moscow refused to hand over a suspect of the 2006 murder . medvedev repeated accusations that the british council , a cultural body partly funded by the british foreign ministry , was engaged in spying in russia , the financial times said .
the council suspended work in two regional offices in january because of what it called harassment by the russian authorities . " we can restore the whole specter of full bilateral cooperation , of course , without preliminary conditions , understanding the independence of each others ' positions , " medvedev said in the interview . rule of law more generally medvedev vowed to crack down on corruption .
upholding the rule of law was a huge challenge because of russians ' general attitude to the law , he said . " it is a monumental task ... russia is a country where people do n't like to observe the law , " he said .

he also said he wanted to improve relations with britain and vowed to crack down on corruption and what he called russia 's " legal nihilism . " " we are not happy about the situation around georgia and ukraine , " he told the business daily ahead of a nato summit in the romanian capital bucharest next week .
" no state can be pleased about having representatives of a military bloc to which it does not belong coming close to its borders . " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : dmitry medvedev , russia 's president-elect medvedev , a 42-year-old former law professor , won a landslide victory in an election earlier this month as expected , and will succeed his political mentor , outgoing president vladimir putin , in may .
putin , however , will stay in the government as medvedev 's prime minister . at a nato summit next week , which putin will attend , georgia and ukraine are hoping to get approval from the western military alliance for its membership action plan -lrb- map -rrb- that would be seen as a signal that its application bid is on track . but the 26 nato members are split on whether to accept the two countries .
germany and france oppose the membership bids , fearful of increasing tensions with russia .
however , many of nato 's eastern european members are pushing for membership as soon as possible , saying it would increase security and reinforce democracy in both nations . us president george w. bush is due to travel to ukraine and croatia on the eve of the bucharest summit , according to the white house . russo-british thaw ? on relations with britain , which are at a post-cold war low after the murder of former russian spy alexander litvinenko in london in november 2006 , medvedev said , " we are open to the re-establishment of cooperation to the full extent . " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : alexander litvinenko london and moscow have traded sharp words since the litvinenko affair , expelled each others ' diplomats and cut back on cooperation between their intelligence services .
moscow refused to hand over a suspect of the 2006 murder . medvedev repeated accusations that the british council , a cultural body partly funded by the british foreign ministry , was engaged in spying in russia , the financial times said .
the council suspended work in two regional offices in january because of what it called harassment by the russian authorities . " we can restore the whole specter of full bilateral cooperation , of course , without preliminary conditions , understanding the independence of each others ' positions , " medvedev said in the interview . rule of law more generally medvedev vowed to crack down on corruption .
upholding the rule of law was a huge challenge because of russians ' general attitude to the law , he said . " it is a monumental task ... russia is a country where people do n't like to observe the law , " he said .
" it is , as they say , a country of legal nihilism . " he touched upon a number of other issues , such as inflation , which he called " a fairly serious problem for the russian economy . "
inflation in year-on-year terms is running at nearly 13 percent .
medvedev added , however , that russia would be able to ride out the turbulence on global markets . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : former yukos oil company ceo mikhail khodorkovsky seen behind bars at a courtroom questioned about mikhail khodorkovsky , the jailed former boss of oil group yukos , he said it was for the courts to decide whether he should remain imprisoned . " no one should interfere , neither a village elder nor the president of the country , " he said . asked whether putin was right when he said that medvedev would be no easier for the west to deal with , he said : " of course he is right " - with a slightly forced smile , according to the financial times . dw staff -lrb- jam -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

nuremberg has written a play book on how it 's done .

" the most important criterium is that the team believes in itself and performs , " von heesen told kick-off . " it 's a question of self-confidence , of what sort attitude one takes into matches - although i do n't want highlight a situation that puts lots of pressure on the players .

instead , they 're appealing to individual athletes to make political statements during the games themselves . observers in europe have reacted with both cynicism and dismay as the olympic flame makes its way across the globe , and government authorities do their best to silence critical voices on tibet .
for many journalists , the fact that the summer games in beijing are virtually assured of going ahead as planned reflects what they see as the general hypocrisy of the sporting event and the leadership of international olympic committee chairman jacques rogge .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the olympic ideals do n't always reflect ...
" figures like rogge probably would n't have a problem with staging the next olympic games in sudan , north korea or saudi arabia , " wrote the conservative vienna newspaper die presse .
" the main thing is that organizers promise to improve the human rights situation .
no one takes them at their word anyway . "
but few are advocating a major boycott of the games , as happened in moscow in 1980 and los angeles in 1984 .
indeed , some see hypocrisy on both sides .
" it 's said that the lessons from the nazi dictatorship -lsb- which staged the 1936 summer games -rsb- should not be forgotten , but history is not repeating itself , " wrote berlin 's tageszeitung newspaper .
" the people 's republic of china is not the third reich , and the chinese communist party is not the nsdap .
moreover , tibet is a country that did n't interest anyone in 1959 , when an uprising against chinese occupation was brutally suppressed . "
" the chinese can legitimately ask with what right the former colonial powers great britain and france were allowed to stage the games , despite hardly treating the people they colonized with kid gloves , " wrote the left-wing budapest daily nepszava .
" if china was stripped of the olympics , it would only strengthen the communist-nationalist hardliners and paralyze the slow , but still perceptible democratization of the country . "
conscience as a guide bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : protestors were arrested at the flame-lighting ceremony on march 24 olympic functionaries often vacillate between claiming that sports and politics should not be mixed , and that the olympic games represent positive political ideals .
european pundits hold out little hope that the contradictions can be resolved by a threat from the world 's large sporting nations to boycott the beijing event .
but they are encouraging athletes to make critical statements about china 's policies toward tibet .
" it 's a simple matter of civic courage , and athletes and sports functionaries should show it just like anyone else , " wrote the online edition of the german weekly magazine focus .
" the statutes of the ioc may prohibit political statements during the games .
that places responsibly on older athletes who want to end their sporting careers after the games anyway .
by taking courageous actions and accepting the subsequent bans from competition , they could crown their careers by doing something for a worthy cause . "
another commentator praised one olympic representative for having taken just such a political stand .
" there is already an exception , a woman chosen to carry the olympic torch , who has refused to participate in the lie of the political summer games , " wrote the vienna newspaper der standard .
" thailand 's narisa chakrabongse will not be receiving the olympic flame in bangkok in april .
it is her message to beijing . "
back to the roots ?
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : once again the games have been politicized some say that the only way to avoid the political controversies that seem to dog most olympic host cities would be to stage all future games in greece .
" only the establishment of a permanent facility for quadrennial use , built close to the original site in the peloponnese and paid for by sponsors and broadcasters , will avoid the kind of repellent situation we are seeing now , " wrote the guardian in britain .
given the amounts of money at play in one of the world 's highest-profile sporting events , that 's extremely unlikely to happen .
and it 's almost as far-fetched to believe that most countries would risk angering the leaders of the world 's most populous and fastest growing nation by boycotting the showcase games this summer in beijing . dw staff -lrb- jc -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

another commentator praised one olympic representative for having taken just such a political stand .
" there is already an exception , a woman chosen to carry the olympic torch , who has refused to participate in the lie of the political summer games , " wrote the vienna newspaper der standard .

bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : once again the games have been politicized some say that the only way to avoid the political controversies that seem to dog most olympic host cities would be to stage all future games in greece .
" only the establishment of a permanent facility for quadrennial use , built close to the original site in the peloponnese and paid for by sponsors and broadcasters , will avoid the kind of repellent situation we are seeing now , " wrote the guardian in britain .
given the amounts of money at play in one of the world 's highest-profile sporting events , that 's extremely unlikely to happen .
and it 's almost as far-fetched to believe that most countries would risk angering the leaders of the world 's most populous and fastest growing nation by boycotting the showcase games this summer in beijing . dw staff -lrb- jc -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

germany and the eu , however , questioned the organizations ' calculations . aid agencies said that up to $ 10 billion -lrb- 6.5 billion euros -rrb- , or 40 percent , of promised aid to afghanistan has not been delivered by the west , and what does arrive bypasses the afghan government . western countries have failed to carry through on their pledges of aid to afghanistan , according to a report by the agency coordinating body for afghan relief -lrb- acbar -rrb- .
the umbrella group of non-governmental organizations which work in afghanistan said the international community had pledged $ 25 billion to afghanistan since 2001 , when the extremist taliban government was toppled , but that up to $ 10 billion had not reached the country . the us government - the biggest international donor to afghanistan - " has one of the biggest shortfalls , " providing only half of the $ 10.4 billion dollars of pledged money until 2008 , the report said . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : aid for development just a " fraction " of military expenditure the european commission and germany had delivered less than two-thirds of their respective $ 1.7 billion and $ 1.2 billion in commitments , acbar said . but a spokesperson for the german development ministry disputed that statement , saying that his country had paid up more than 90 percent of the money it had pledged between 2001 and 2006 . the european commission also rejected the allegations . " we are delivering - there is no delay , no backlog , no shortfall or lagging behind , " a spokeswoman for the european commission 's external-affairs chief in brussels said . exaggerated costs the report said the world bank had distributed just over half of its promised funds . furthermore , " just $ 15 billion in aid has so far been spent , of which it is estimated a staggering 40 percent has returned to donor countries in corporate profits and consultant salaries … vastly pushing up expenditures , " the report said . " for example , a road between the center of kabul and the international airport cost the united states more than $ 2.3 million per kilometer , at least four times the average cost of building a road in afghanistan . " many of the full-time expatriate consultants working for private companies in afghanistan receive $ 250,000 to $ 500,000 a year , including salary , allowances and other costs , the report said . a " fraction " spent on aid the report , entitled " falling short , " was written by the aid group oxfam for acbar .
acbar is made up of 94 agencies , including oxfam , christian aid , care , islamic relief and save the children . the group said that foreign money spent on aid , development and reconstruction is now just " a fraction " of military expenditures . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : afghanistan is the biggest producer of poppy-derived opium for heroin the us military alone spends some $ 100 million a day in fighting insurgents in afghanistan , but average spending on aid by all donors since 2001 has amounted to only $ 7 million daily . " given the links between development and security , the effectiveness of aid also has a major impact on peace and stability , " acbar said .
" yet thus far aid has been insufficient and in many cases wasteful and ineffective . " in addition , afghanistan received just $ 57 per capita in aid in the two years after international intervention in 2001 , compared to $ 679 a head in bosnia and $ 233 in east timor , acbar said . inefficiency and corruption are problematic some of the shortfalls , however , could be attributed to " challenging operating conditions , high levels of corruption and weak absorption capacities , " acbar noted . the group said this demonstrated the need for donors to solve such problems , adding that the weaknesses could be the reason that about two-thirds of foreign assistance bypassed the afghan government - undermining attempts to build effective state institutions . world bank country manager mariam sherman told afp news agency that its disbursal rate - estimated to be about 50 percent - was " actually very good . "
but she conceded that while the world bank channeled all its funds through the government budget , it was a problem that so much of it bypassed the administration . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : germany has more than 3,000 soldiers in afghanistan " to build a state and be accountable to its people , the government needs to have a say in resource allocation , " sherman told afp . extreme poverty prevails acbar stressed that despite the formation of the western-backed afghan government six years ago , the country still suffers from extreme poverty .
just 20 percent of the population has access to potable water ; only 5 percent has electricity . the group also drew attention to recent reports from the southern province of ghazni which said that residents in remote villages were eating grass to quell their hunger . acbar called on the international community to increase aid and ensure that it makes a lasting effect for the poorest afghans .

germany and the eu , however , questioned the organizations ' calculations . aid agencies said that up to $ 10 billion -lrb- 6.5 billion euros -rrb- , or 40 percent , of promised aid to afghanistan has not been delivered by the west , and what does arrive bypasses the afghan government . western countries have failed to carry through on their pledges of aid to afghanistan , according to a report by the agency coordinating body for afghan relief -lrb- acbar -rrb- .
the umbrella group of non-governmental organizations which work in afghanistan said the international community had pledged $ 25 billion to afghanistan since 2001 , when the extremist taliban government was toppled , but that up to $ 10 billion had not reached the country . the us government - the biggest international donor to afghanistan - " has one of the biggest shortfalls , " providing only half of the $ 10.4 billion dollars of pledged money until 2008 , the report said . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : aid for development just a " fraction " of military expenditure the european commission and germany had delivered less than two-thirds of their respective $ 1.7 billion and $ 1.2 billion in commitments , acbar said . but a spokesperson for the german development ministry disputed that statement , saying that his country had paid up more than 90 percent of the money it had pledged between 2001 and 2006 . the european commission also rejected the allegations . " we are delivering - there is no delay , no backlog , no shortfall or lagging behind , " a spokeswoman for the european commission 's external-affairs chief in brussels said . exaggerated costs the report said the world bank had distributed just over half of its promised funds . furthermore , " just $ 15 billion in aid has so far been spent , of which it is estimated a staggering 40 percent has returned to donor countries in corporate profits and consultant salaries … vastly pushing up expenditures , " the report said .

or so one serious fare dodger seemed to think a man who just could n't stop himself from riding trains without buying a ticket will see the wrong side of a jail cell after fines and suspended sentences failed to put him on the straight and narrow . the 24-year-old will be celebrating his next birthday in the big house because of his predilection for hopping on german trains without paying his fare . his habit seemed to have gotten out of control .
from october 2006 to february 2007 , he was caught riding the train without a ticket102 times , often several times on the same day .
the court , fed up with imposing fines and suspended sentences , finally decided to get tough and gave him a 22-month holiday behind bars . throwing himself upon the mercy of the court was likely not an option this time .
it is not as if the man was riding ticketless due to a lack of financial means .
according to his own statement , he repeatedly dodged fares " pretty much out of boredom . " it 's likely he 'll learn the meaning of true boredom while doing time , when the highlight of his day will likely be marking another of his 669 days behind bars off his calendar . dw staff -lrb- jam -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

berlin stressed it did not back a boycott of the beijing olympics in august , although not all politicians agree . german foreign minister frank-walter steinmeier phoned his chinese counterpart , yang jiechi , on tuesday , march 25 , and called for an end of violence in tibet , according to a german foreign ministry spokesman .
steinmeier told the chinese foreign minister he hopes for " a permanent end of the violence and a pacification of the situation . " at a regular news conference in berlin , deputy government spokesman thomas steg said germany considers it " essential that both sides - tibet and the dalai lama on the one side and the government in beijing on the other - move toward each other . " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : pro-tibetan protests in thailand " the tibetans want to protect their culture and china has an interest in stability and territorial integrity , and thus the german government sees no alternative to a direct dialogue between the two sides . " steg said berlin stood by its position that an olympic boycott would be counterproductive but renewed its call for china to practice " transparency " in tibet by allowing foreign observers into the himalayan region . germany last week suspended talks with china on development financing for renewable energy projects over its concerns about " the perpetuation of violence in tibet . " dalai lama visit asked about a plans by the dalai lama to visit germany in may , steg said chancellor angela merkel would travelling and unable to fulfill his request to meet with her . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : chinese-german relations sank after merkel met with the dalai lama in berlin but he added that merkel was willing to hold talks with the exiled buddhist spiritual leader at any time . relations between germany and china plunged after merkel met with the dalai lama at the chancellery in berlin in september .
bilateral ties have only recently improved . the dalai lama , who has said he is open to dialogue with beijing , reiterated a pledge tuesday to resign as spokesman for the tibetan people if there were more violent anti-chinese protests . he has denied chinese charges of fomenting the unrest . olympic concerns the violence has cast a shadow over the planning for the olympic games , to be held in the chinese capital aug .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de bundesliga -pipe- 25.03.2008 nuremberg 's fairy-tale season turns to nightmare großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : for jan koller and nuremberg , it 's been a season of grimaces so you want to take a promising team coming off a dream year and get it relegated ?
nuremberg has written a play book on how it 's done .
they 're teetering on the edge of the second division . last fall , no one expected nuremberg to be down at the bottom of table , battling it out with the likes of duisburg and cottbus .
the team , known as simply " the club " to german soccer fans , was coming off its 2007 victory in the german cup - its first major title in 39 years - and playing some of the most positive soccer in the bundesliga . fast forward to late march 2008 , and nuremberg find themselves in second-to-last in the standings and winless in their last nine matches .
the precipitous fall of one of last season 's overachievers is an object lesson in how not to build on success . lose focus on the league bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : coach von heesen has yet to record a win nuremberg 's german cup win not only meant a new addition to the club 's trophy case .
it also qualified them for the 2007-08 uefa cup . playing internationally is every team 's ultimate goal , but as so often is the case for smaller teams , the double burden of european and domestic contests has been anything but a blessing for nuremberg . the club performed quite well in the competition , reaching the knock-out round before losing a heartbreaking tie in late february to portuguese side , benfica lisbon , on two last-minute goals . but nuremberg 's relatively good uefa performances distracted players ' attention away from the fact that they had fallen into the relegation zone at home . " it started perhaps with a too-relaxed attitude at the start of the season , " nuremberg goalkeeper daniel klewer told dw 's bundesliga kick-off .
" we said to ourselves that we had the best team ever at nuremberg .
but hard work and constant concentration are part of the game , and we forgot that .
and at some point you 're left standing there and nothing works .
that 's our situation now . " with only four league victories to date , no squad in the bundesliga has won less often this season . have a lot of personality clashes bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the club is now chasing the rest of the league to their credit , nuremberg 's management tried to address their precipitous slide earlier in february .
unfortunately for them , they chose exactly the wrong route , replacing veteran coach hans meyer with thomas von heesen . the popular meyer was reportedly given the ax because of personality conflicts with nuremberg 's front office , in particular sport director martin bader .
indeed , this seems the only plausible explanation for a decision that , from a soccer perspective , is like a slumping sprinter chopping off one of his legs . the 65-year-old meyer from the communist former east germany not only led the club to its biggest triumph in almost four decades .
he also saved the team from relegation in 2005-06 , after having previously achieved comparable feats for moenchengladbach and hertha berlin . the 46-year-old von heesen , by contrast , has a relatively brief bundesliga resume , his only other top-flight coaching experience coming at lowly bielefeld . whatever van heesen 's merits as a tactician , he 's gotten off to the worst start ever of any nuremberg coach and has n't shown any signs of solving the team 's main problem . buy players who do n't fit bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : nuremberg expended huge energy on the uefa cup nuremberg have only scored 26 times in the league despite being among the bundesliga 's best at creating goal chances .
that would suggest that the team 's strikers are most at fault for its demise . but that 's not the whole story .
nuremberg signed two solid scorers after their german cup triumph - reigning european champion angelos charisteas of greece and czech jan koller , who notched up 59 goals in five seasons with borussia dortmund . the problem is that neither of these classic big center forwards fits the successful style of play nuremberg showed in 2006-07 , which emphasized quick combinations rather than long balls into the box . moreover , nuremberg 's inefficiency up front is compounded by shakiness at the back .
neither klewer nor jaromir blazek has proved a completely satisfactory replacement for former keeper rafael schaefer , who departed for stuttgart in the off-season . the result is that nuremberg have conceded 18 goals in the final 30 minutes of games - second worst in the league .
that 's converted potential wins into draws , and draws into losses , costing the club some much-needed points . get yourself in must-win situations bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : ex-coach hans meyer could have the last laugh with five teams either in or near the drop zone , nuremberg 's fate is by no means sealed . whether the club can save itself from its fifth top-flight free-fall in 25 years will probably depend on how it fares in its upcoming matches against fellow relegation candidates bielefeld and duisburg . but as a team no one expected to be in such dire straits this late in the season , nuremberg will be under additional pressure to produce results . " the most important criterium is that the team believes in itself and performs , " von heesen told kick-off . " it 's a question of self-confidence , of what sort attitude one takes into matches - although i do n't want highlight a situation that puts lots of pressure on the players . " but is nuremberg fail to withstand the heat and end up in the second division again , they may find a quip by their loquacious ex-coach hans meyer ringing bitterly in their ears . " in soccer , people are very quick to erect a monument to you , " meyer once informed a curious journalist .
" but they 're just as quick to urinate on it . " the march 27 edition of bundesliga kick-off features an in-depth look at the problems in nuremberg . jefferson chase send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

instead , they 're appealing to individual athletes to make political statements during the games themselves . observers in europe have reacted with both cynicism and dismay as the olympic flame makes its way across the globe , and government authorities do their best to silence critical voices on tibet .
for many journalists , the fact that the summer games in beijing are virtually assured of going ahead as planned reflects what they see as the general hypocrisy of the sporting event and the leadership of international olympic committee chairman jacques rogge .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the olympic ideals do n't always reflect ...
" figures like rogge probably would n't have a problem with staging the next olympic games in sudan , north korea or saudi arabia , " wrote the conservative vienna newspaper die presse .
" the main thing is that organizers promise to improve the human rights situation .
no one takes them at their word anyway . "
but few are advocating a major boycott of the games , as happened in moscow in 1980 and los angeles in 1984 .
indeed , some see hypocrisy on both sides .
" it 's said that the lessons from the nazi dictatorship -lsb- which staged the 1936 summer games -rsb- should not be forgotten , but history is not repeating itself , " wrote berlin 's tageszeitung newspaper .
" the people 's republic of china is not the third reich , and the chinese communist party is not the nsdap .
moreover , tibet is a country that did n't interest anyone in 1959 , when an uprising against chinese occupation was brutally suppressed . "
" the chinese can legitimately ask with what right the former colonial powers great britain and france were allowed to stage the games , despite hardly treating the people they colonized with kid gloves , " wrote the left-wing budapest daily nepszava .
" if china was stripped of the olympics , it would only strengthen the communist-nationalist hardliners and paralyze the slow , but still perceptible democratization of the country . "
conscience as a guide bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : protestors were arrested at the flame-lighting ceremony on march 24 olympic functionaries often vacillate between claiming that sports and politics should not be mixed , and that the olympic games represent positive political ideals .
european pundits hold out little hope that the contradictions can be resolved by a threat from the world 's large sporting nations to boycott the beijing event .
but they are encouraging athletes to make critical statements about china 's policies toward tibet .
" it 's a simple matter of civic courage , and athletes and sports functionaries should show it just like anyone else , " wrote the online edition of the german weekly magazine focus .
" the statutes of the ioc may prohibit political statements during the games .
that places responsibly on older athletes who want to end their sporting careers after the games anyway .
by taking courageous actions and accepting the subsequent bans from competition , they could crown their careers by doing something for a worthy cause . "
another commentator praised one olympic representative for having taken just such a political stand .
" there is already an exception , a woman chosen to carry the olympic torch , who has refused to participate in the lie of the political summer games , " wrote the vienna newspaper der standard .
" thailand 's narisa chakrabongse will not be receiving the olympic flame in bangkok in april .
it is her message to beijing . "
back to the roots ?
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : once again the games have been politicized some say that the only way to avoid the political controversies that seem to dog most olympic host cities would be to stage all future games in greece .
" only the establishment of a permanent facility for quadrennial use , built close to the original site in the peloponnese and paid for by sponsors and broadcasters , will avoid the kind of repellent situation we are seeing now , " wrote the guardian in britain .
given the amounts of money at play in one of the world 's highest-profile sporting events , that 's extremely unlikely to happen .
and it 's almost as far-fetched to believe that most countries would risk angering the leaders of the world 's most populous and fastest growing nation by boycotting the showcase games this summer in beijing . dw staff -lrb- jc -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

germany and the eu , however , questioned the organizations ' calculations . aid agencies said that up to $ 10 billion -lrb- 6.5 billion euros -rrb- , or 40 percent , of promised aid to afghanistan has not been delivered by the west , and what does arrive bypasses the afghan government . western countries have failed to carry through on their pledges of aid to afghanistan , according to a report by the agency coordinating body for afghan relief -lrb- acbar -rrb- .
the umbrella group of non-governmental organizations which work in afghanistan said the international community had pledged $ 25 billion to afghanistan since 2001 , when the extremist taliban government was toppled , but that up to $ 10 billion had not reached the country . the us government - the biggest international donor to afghanistan - " has one of the biggest shortfalls , " providing only half of the $ 10.4 billion dollars of pledged money until 2008 , the report said . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : aid for development just a " fraction " of military expenditure the european commission and germany had delivered less than two-thirds of their respective $ 1.7 billion and $ 1.2 billion in commitments , acbar said . but a spokesperson for the german development ministry disputed that statement , saying that his country had paid up more than 90 percent of the money it had pledged between 2001 and 2006 . the european commission also rejected the allegations . " we are delivering - there is no delay , no backlog , no shortfall or lagging behind , " a spokeswoman for the european commission 's external-affairs chief in brussels said . exaggerated costs the report said the world bank had distributed just over half of its promised funds . furthermore , " just $ 15 billion in aid has so far been spent , of which it is estimated a staggering 40 percent has returned to donor countries in corporate profits and consultant salaries … vastly pushing up expenditures , " the report said . " for example , a road between the center of kabul and the international airport cost the united states more than $ 2.3 million per kilometer , at least four times the average cost of building a road in afghanistan . " many of the full-time expatriate consultants working for private companies in afghanistan receive $ 250,000 to $ 500,000 a year , including salary , allowances and other costs , the report said . a " fraction " spent on aid the report , entitled " falling short , " was written by the aid group oxfam for acbar .
acbar is made up of 94 agencies , including oxfam , christian aid , care , islamic relief and save the children . the group said that foreign money spent on aid , development and reconstruction is now just " a fraction " of military expenditures . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : afghanistan is the biggest producer of poppy-derived opium for heroin the us military alone spends some $ 100 million a day in fighting insurgents in afghanistan , but average spending on aid by all donors since 2001 has amounted to only $ 7 million daily . " given the links between development and security , the effectiveness of aid also has a major impact on peace and stability , " acbar said .
" yet thus far aid has been insufficient and in many cases wasteful and ineffective . " in addition , afghanistan received just $ 57 per capita in aid in the two years after international intervention in 2001 , compared to $ 679 a head in bosnia and $ 233 in east timor , acbar said . inefficiency and corruption are problematic some of the shortfalls , however , could be attributed to " challenging operating conditions , high levels of corruption and weak absorption capacities , " acbar noted . the group said this demonstrated the need for donors to solve such problems , adding that the weaknesses could be the reason that about two-thirds of foreign assistance bypassed the afghan government - undermining attempts to build effective state institutions . world bank country manager mariam sherman told afp news agency that its disbursal rate - estimated to be about 50 percent - was " actually very good . "
but she conceded that while the world bank channeled all its funds through the government budget , it was a problem that so much of it bypassed the administration . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : germany has more than 3,000 soldiers in afghanistan " to build a state and be accountable to its people , the government needs to have a say in resource allocation , " sherman told afp . extreme poverty prevails acbar stressed that despite the formation of the western-backed afghan government six years ago , the country still suffers from extreme poverty .
just 20 percent of the population has access to potable water ; only 5 percent has electricity . the group also drew attention to recent reports from the southern province of ghazni which said that residents in remote villages were eating grass to quell their hunger . acbar called on the international community to increase aid and ensure that it makes a lasting effect for the poorest afghans .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de in focus : beijing 2008 : a question of human rights german olympics official : we 're not ignoring human rights beijing truths smothered in the smog of conflicting views amnesty international : china has made only minor progress china breaks promise of unfettered internet at olympics olympics -pipe- 25.03.2008 human rights abuses increase in china , olympic protester says großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : julliard being taken into police custody during the torch-lighting ceremony ongoing violence in tibet is another example of how china ignores human rights , reporters without borders told dw-world.de. the paris-based media group called for a boycott of the 2008 olympic opening ceremony . jean-francois julliard is the head of research at reporters without borders .
along with two colleagues , julliard was arrested on monday , march 24 at the official olympic torch-lighting ceremony in olympia , greece after unfurling a banner calling attention to the state of human rights in china . the three were arrested by greek police for holding banners featuring handcuffs in the shape of the olympic rings during a speech by liu qi , the president of the beijing olympics organizing committee . after being detained for 10 hours and charged with offending a national symbol , the three demonstrators were released on bail .
a trial is scheduled for may 29 .
julliard is now back in paris . dw-world.de : you were arrested yesterday for protesting at the olympic torch lighting ceremony .
what were you trying to bring attention to ? bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the olympic torch began its journey to china on monday jean-francois julliard : we did it because the situation of human rights and press freedom in china is getting worse .
chinese authorities made some promises when they were chosen to host the olympic games in 2001 and they have not respected any of them . there are more journalists and internet users detained now than there were in 2001 .
chinese authorities do not want to improve the situation of human rights before the olympic games . we have less than five months until the opening ceremony in beijing and we have to use this period to put pressure on chinese authorities and to raise the issue of human rights violations in china . does that mean your actions had nothing to do with the recent protests in tibet ? we planned this weeks ago .
so even if nothing had happened in tibet we would have still held the same demonstration .
the situation in tibet is just one more piece of evidence that chinese authorities are not ready to make any improvements , to let journalists walk freely in china or let the tibetan people demonstrate peacefully . you were arrested , charged and later released on bail by the greek authorities .
what were you were charged with ? bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : authorities said banners like this offend greek national symbols we were detained for 10 hours and then presented to a prosecutor .
we were charged with offending a national symbol because we used the olympic symbol on our flag .
this is why we have been charged according to greek penal code and we face one year prison terms and fines . of course , greece is a european union country so we can not imagine that we will be sentenced to prison terms because we demonstrated during the torch-lighting ceremony .
but there will be a trial late may .
we will go back to greece to attend the trial because we want to use it to once again raise the issue of the situation of human rights in china a few months before the olympics start . are you planning to attend the olympics ? we would like to very much but , no , we can not .
we tried to enter china in december .
we went to hong kong and asked for visas and we were denied .
so i think that we are blacklisted now in china . many people say that the olympics should be kept separate from politics .
what are your opinions on that issue ? bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : a boycott of the opening ceremony would send a strong signal to beijing it is a good thing that there is this debate and we think it is a positive step .
we think that the situation is going to change in the next few weeks .
the french president just said this morning -lsb- tuesday , march 25 -rsb- that every option is open .
so maybe he will agree to boycott the opening ceremony .
maybe he will just make a strong statement .
we do not know . you do not support a total boycott of the games but you do support a boycott of the opening ceremony ? we think that a total boycott would sanction the athletes and the competitors have no responsibility .
they are not the ones that decided to hold the olympic games in china so they should not be punished for that .
but we ask heads of state , heads of government , members of royal families not to attend the opening ceremony . it would be a very significant gesture to say to the chinese authorities that we are going to attend the olympic games , we are going to attend sport events , but we are not going to attend the political event which is the opening ceremony . do you think there is a danger this kind of political action will make china take an even harder line ? no , because the line can not get harder .
we waited for months before we did what we did .
we were patient .
we tried to have positive discussions with chinese authorities , but it was not successful , it was not useful at all .
so no , we could not wait any longer . are you planning any further protests ? i ca n't tell you now , but , of course , we plan to use the torch relay to do a lot .
the torch will cross through cities all over the world , and we hope there will be a lot of demonstrations .
the torch will be in london and paris over the next 10 days so maybe that will be our next step . interview : ole tangen jr . send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de bundesliga -pipe- 25.03.2008 nuremberg 's fairy-tale season turns to nightmare großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : for jan koller and nuremberg , it 's been a season of grimaces so you want to take a promising team coming off a dream year and get it relegated ?
nuremberg has written a play book on how it 's done .
they 're teetering on the edge of the second division . last fall , no one expected nuremberg to be down at the bottom of table , battling it out with the likes of duisburg and cottbus .
the team , known as simply " the club " to german soccer fans , was coming off its 2007 victory in the german cup - its first major title in 39 years - and playing some of the most positive soccer in the bundesliga . fast forward to late march 2008 , and nuremberg find themselves in second-to-last in the standings and winless in their last nine matches .
the precipitous fall of one of last season 's overachievers is an object lesson in how not to build on success . lose focus on the league bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : coach von heesen has yet to record a win nuremberg 's german cup win not only meant a new addition to the club 's trophy case .
it also qualified them for the 2007-08 uefa cup . playing internationally is every team 's ultimate goal , but as so often is the case for smaller teams , the double burden of european and domestic contests has been anything but a blessing for nuremberg . the club performed quite well in the competition , reaching the knock-out round before losing a heartbreaking tie in late february to portuguese side , benfica lisbon , on two last-minute goals . but nuremberg 's relatively good uefa performances distracted players ' attention away from the fact that they had fallen into the relegation zone at home . " it started perhaps with a too-relaxed attitude at the start of the season , " nuremberg goalkeeper daniel klewer told dw 's bundesliga kick-off .
" we said to ourselves that we had the best team ever at nuremberg .
but hard work and constant concentration are part of the game , and we forgot that .
and at some point you 're left standing there and nothing works .
that 's our situation now . " with only four league victories to date , no squad in the bundesliga has won less often this season . have a lot of personality clashes bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the club is now chasing the rest of the league to their credit , nuremberg 's management tried to address their precipitous slide earlier in february .
unfortunately for them , they chose exactly the wrong route , replacing veteran coach hans meyer with thomas von heesen . the popular meyer was reportedly given the ax because of personality conflicts with nuremberg 's front office , in particular sport director martin bader .
indeed , this seems the only plausible explanation for a decision that , from a soccer perspective , is like a slumping sprinter chopping off one of his legs . the 65-year-old meyer from the communist former east germany not only led the club to its biggest triumph in almost four decades .
he also saved the team from relegation in 2005-06 , after having previously achieved comparable feats for moenchengladbach and hertha berlin . the 46-year-old von heesen , by contrast , has a relatively brief bundesliga resume , his only other top-flight coaching experience coming at lowly bielefeld . whatever van heesen 's merits as a tactician , he 's gotten off to the worst start ever of any nuremberg coach and has n't shown any signs of solving the team 's main problem . buy players who do n't fit bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : nuremberg expended huge energy on the uefa cup nuremberg have only scored 26 times in the league despite being among the bundesliga 's best at creating goal chances .
that would suggest that the team 's strikers are most at fault for its demise . but that 's not the whole story .
nuremberg signed two solid scorers after their german cup triumph - reigning european champion angelos charisteas of greece and czech jan koller , who notched up 59 goals in five seasons with borussia dortmund . the problem is that neither of these classic big center forwards fits the successful style of play nuremberg showed in 2006-07 , which emphasized quick combinations rather than long balls into the box . moreover , nuremberg 's inefficiency up front is compounded by shakiness at the back .
neither klewer nor jaromir blazek has proved a completely satisfactory replacement for former keeper rafael schaefer , who departed for stuttgart in the off-season . the result is that nuremberg have conceded 18 goals in the final 30 minutes of games - second worst in the league .
that 's converted potential wins into draws , and draws into losses , costing the club some much-needed points . get yourself in must-win situations bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : ex-coach hans meyer could have the last laugh with five teams either in or near the drop zone , nuremberg 's fate is by no means sealed . whether the club can save itself from its fifth top-flight free-fall in 25 years will probably depend on how it fares in its upcoming matches against fellow relegation candidates bielefeld and duisburg . but as a team no one expected to be in such dire straits this late in the season , nuremberg will be under additional pressure to produce results . " the most important criterium is that the team believes in itself and performs , " von heesen told kick-off . " it 's a question of self-confidence , of what sort attitude one takes into matches - although i do n't want highlight a situation that puts lots of pressure on the players .

nuremberg has written a play book on how it 's done .
they 're teetering on the edge of the second division . last fall , no one expected nuremberg to be down at the bottom of table , battling it out with the likes of duisburg and cottbus .
the team , known as simply " the club " to german soccer fans , was coming off its 2007 victory in the german cup - its first major title in 39 years - and playing some of the most positive soccer in the bundesliga . fast forward to late march 2008 , and nuremberg find themselves in second-to-last in the standings and winless in their last nine matches .
the precipitous fall of one of last season 's overachievers is an object lesson in how not to build on success . lose focus on the league bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : coach von heesen has yet to record a win nuremberg 's german cup win not only meant a new addition to the club 's trophy case .
it also qualified them for the 2007-08 uefa cup . playing internationally is every team 's ultimate goal , but as so often is the case for smaller teams , the double burden of european and domestic contests has been anything but a blessing for nuremberg . the club performed quite well in the competition , reaching the knock-out round before losing a heartbreaking tie in late february to portuguese side , benfica lisbon , on two last-minute goals . but nuremberg 's relatively good uefa performances distracted players ' attention away from the fact that they had fallen into the relegation zone at home . " it started perhaps with a too-relaxed attitude at the start of the season , " nuremberg goalkeeper daniel klewer told dw 's bundesliga kick-off .
" we said to ourselves that we had the best team ever at nuremberg .
but hard work and constant concentration are part of the game , and we forgot that .
and at some point you 're left standing there and nothing works .
that 's our situation now . " with only four league victories to date , no squad in the bundesliga has won less often this season . have a lot of personality clashes bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the club is now chasing the rest of the league to their credit , nuremberg 's management tried to address their precipitous slide earlier in february .
unfortunately for them , they chose exactly the wrong route , replacing veteran coach hans meyer with thomas von heesen . the popular meyer was reportedly given the ax because of personality conflicts with nuremberg 's front office , in particular sport director martin bader .
indeed , this seems the only plausible explanation for a decision that , from a soccer perspective , is like a slumping sprinter chopping off one of his legs . the 65-year-old meyer from the communist former east germany not only led the club to its biggest triumph in almost four decades .
he also saved the team from relegation in 2005-06 , after having previously achieved comparable feats for moenchengladbach and hertha berlin . the 46-year-old von heesen , by contrast , has a relatively brief bundesliga resume , his only other top-flight coaching experience coming at lowly bielefeld . whatever van heesen 's merits as a tactician , he 's gotten off to the worst start ever of any nuremberg coach and has n't shown any signs of solving the team 's main problem . buy players who do n't fit bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : nuremberg expended huge energy on the uefa cup nuremberg have only scored 26 times in the league despite being among the bundesliga 's best at creating goal chances .
that would suggest that the team 's strikers are most at fault for its demise . but that 's not the whole story .
nuremberg signed two solid scorers after their german cup triumph - reigning european champion angelos charisteas of greece and czech jan koller , who notched up 59 goals in five seasons with borussia dortmund . the problem is that neither of these classic big center forwards fits the successful style of play nuremberg showed in 2006-07 , which emphasized quick combinations rather than long balls into the box . moreover , nuremberg 's inefficiency up front is compounded by shakiness at the back .
neither klewer nor jaromir blazek has proved a completely satisfactory replacement for former keeper rafael schaefer , who departed for stuttgart in the off-season . the result is that nuremberg have conceded 18 goals in the final 30 minutes of games - second worst in the league .
that 's converted potential wins into draws , and draws into losses , costing the club some much-needed points . get yourself in must-win situations bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : ex-coach hans meyer could have the last laugh with five teams either in or near the drop zone , nuremberg 's fate is by no means sealed . whether the club can save itself from its fifth top-flight free-fall in 25 years will probably depend on how it fares in its upcoming matches against fellow relegation candidates bielefeld and duisburg . but as a team no one expected to be in such dire straits this late in the season , nuremberg will be under additional pressure to produce results . " the most important criterium is that the team believes in itself and performs , " von heesen told kick-off .

or so one serious fare dodger seemed to think a man who just could n't stop himself from riding trains without buying a ticket will see the wrong side of a jail cell after fines and suspended sentences failed to put him on the straight and narrow . the 24-year-old will be celebrating his next birthday in the big house because of his predilection for hopping on german trains without paying his fare . his habit seemed to have gotten out of control .
from october 2006 to february 2007 , he was caught riding the train without a ticket102 times , often several times on the same day .
the court , fed up with imposing fines and suspended sentences , finally decided to get tough and gave him a 22-month holiday behind bars . throwing himself upon the mercy of the court was likely not an option this time .
it is not as if the man was riding ticketless due to a lack of financial means .
according to his own statement , he repeatedly dodged fares " pretty much out of boredom . " it 's likely he 'll learn the meaning of true boredom while doing time , when the highlight of his day will likely be marking another of his 669 days behind bars off his calendar . dw staff -lrb- jam -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de in focus : beijing 2008 : a question of human rights german olympics official : we 're not ignoring human rights beijing truths smothered in the smog of conflicting views amnesty international : china has made only minor progress china breaks promise of unfettered internet at olympics olympics -pipe- 25.03.2008 human rights abuses increase in china , olympic protester says großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : julliard being taken into police custody during the torch-lighting ceremony ongoing violence in tibet is another example of how china ignores human rights , reporters without borders told dw-world.de. the paris-based media group called for a boycott of the 2008 olympic opening ceremony . jean-francois julliard is the head of research at reporters without borders .
along with two colleagues , julliard was arrested on monday , march 24 at the official olympic torch-lighting ceremony in olympia , greece after unfurling a banner calling attention to the state of human rights in china . the three were arrested by greek police for holding banners featuring handcuffs in the shape of the olympic rings during a speech by liu qi , the president of the beijing olympics organizing committee . after being detained for 10 hours and charged with offending a national symbol , the three demonstrators were released on bail .
a trial is scheduled for may 29 .
julliard is now back in paris . dw-world.de : you were arrested yesterday for protesting at the olympic torch lighting ceremony .
what were you trying to bring attention to ? bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the olympic torch began its journey to china on monday jean-francois julliard : we did it because the situation of human rights and press freedom in china is getting worse .
chinese authorities made some promises when they were chosen to host the olympic games in 2001 and they have not respected any of them . there are more journalists and internet users detained now than there were in 2001 .
chinese authorities do not want to improve the situation of human rights before the olympic games . we have less than five months until the opening ceremony in beijing and we have to use this period to put pressure on chinese authorities and to raise the issue of human rights violations in china . does that mean your actions had nothing to do with the recent protests in tibet ? we planned this weeks ago .
so even if nothing had happened in tibet we would have still held the same demonstration .
the situation in tibet is just one more piece of evidence that chinese authorities are not ready to make any improvements , to let journalists walk freely in china or let the tibetan people demonstrate peacefully . you were arrested , charged and later released on bail by the greek authorities .
what were you were charged with ? bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : authorities said banners like this offend greek national symbols we were detained for 10 hours and then presented to a prosecutor .
we were charged with offending a national symbol because we used the olympic symbol on our flag .
this is why we have been charged according to greek penal code and we face one year prison terms and fines . of course , greece is a european union country so we can not imagine that we will be sentenced to prison terms because we demonstrated during the torch-lighting ceremony .
but there will be a trial late may .
we will go back to greece to attend the trial because we want to use it to once again raise the issue of the situation of human rights in china a few months before the olympics start . are you planning to attend the olympics ? we would like to very much but , no , we can not .
we tried to enter china in december .
we went to hong kong and asked for visas and we were denied .
so i think that we are blacklisted now in china . many people say that the olympics should be kept separate from politics .
what are your opinions on that issue ? bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : a boycott of the opening ceremony would send a strong signal to beijing it is a good thing that there is this debate and we think it is a positive step .
we think that the situation is going to change in the next few weeks .
the french president just said this morning -lsb- tuesday , march 25 -rsb- that every option is open .
so maybe he will agree to boycott the opening ceremony .
maybe he will just make a strong statement .
we do not know . you do not support a total boycott of the games but you do support a boycott of the opening ceremony ? we think that a total boycott would sanction the athletes and the competitors have no responsibility .
they are not the ones that decided to hold the olympic games in china so they should not be punished for that .
but we ask heads of state , heads of government , members of royal families not to attend the opening ceremony . it would be a very significant gesture to say to the chinese authorities that we are going to attend the olympic games , we are going to attend sport events , but we are not going to attend the political event which is the opening ceremony . do you think there is a danger this kind of political action will make china take an even harder line ? no , because the line can not get harder .
we waited for months before we did what we did .
we were patient .
we tried to have positive discussions with chinese authorities , but it was not successful , it was not useful at all .
so no , we could not wait any longer . are you planning any further protests ? i ca n't tell you now , but , of course , we plan to use the torch relay to do a lot .
the torch will cross through cities all over the world , and we hope there will be a lot of demonstrations .
the torch will be in london and paris over the next 10 days so maybe that will be our next step . interview : ole tangen jr . send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de bundesliga -pipe- 25.03.2008 nuremberg 's fairy-tale season turns to nightmare großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : for jan koller and nuremberg , it 's been a season of grimaces so you want to take a promising team coming off a dream year and get it relegated ?
nuremberg has written a play book on how it 's done .
they 're teetering on the edge of the second division . last fall , no one expected nuremberg to be down at the bottom of table , battling it out with the likes of duisburg and cottbus .
the team , known as simply " the club " to german soccer fans , was coming off its 2007 victory in the german cup - its first major title in 39 years - and playing some of the most positive soccer in the bundesliga . fast forward to late march 2008 , and nuremberg find themselves in second-to-last in the standings and winless in their last nine matches .
the precipitous fall of one of last season 's overachievers is an object lesson in how not to build on success . lose focus on the league bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : coach von heesen has yet to record a win nuremberg 's german cup win not only meant a new addition to the club 's trophy case .
it also qualified them for the 2007-08 uefa cup . playing internationally is every team 's ultimate goal , but as so often is the case for smaller teams , the double burden of european and domestic contests has been anything but a blessing for nuremberg . the club performed quite well in the competition , reaching the knock-out round before losing a heartbreaking tie in late february to portuguese side , benfica lisbon , on two last-minute goals . but nuremberg 's relatively good uefa performances distracted players ' attention away from the fact that they had fallen into the relegation zone at home . " it started perhaps with a too-relaxed attitude at the start of the season , " nuremberg goalkeeper daniel klewer told dw 's bundesliga kick-off .
" we said to ourselves that we had the best team ever at nuremberg .
but hard work and constant concentration are part of the game , and we forgot that .
and at some point you 're left standing there and nothing works .
that 's our situation now . " with only four league victories to date , no squad in the bundesliga has won less often this season . have a lot of personality clashes bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the club is now chasing the rest of the league to their credit , nuremberg 's management tried to address their precipitous slide earlier in february .
unfortunately for them , they chose exactly the wrong route , replacing veteran coach hans meyer with thomas von heesen . the popular meyer was reportedly given the ax because of personality conflicts with nuremberg 's front office , in particular sport director martin bader .
indeed , this seems the only plausible explanation for a decision that , from a soccer perspective , is like a slumping sprinter chopping off one of his legs . the 65-year-old meyer from the communist former east germany not only led the club to its biggest triumph in almost four decades .
he also saved the team from relegation in 2005-06 , after having previously achieved comparable feats for moenchengladbach and hertha berlin . the 46-year-old von heesen , by contrast , has a relatively brief bundesliga resume , his only other top-flight coaching experience coming at lowly bielefeld . whatever van heesen 's merits as a tactician , he 's gotten off to the worst start ever of any nuremberg coach and has n't shown any signs of solving the team 's main problem . buy players who do n't fit bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : nuremberg expended huge energy on the uefa cup nuremberg have only scored 26 times in the league despite being among the bundesliga 's best at creating goal chances .
that would suggest that the team 's strikers are most at fault for its demise . but that 's not the whole story .
nuremberg signed two solid scorers after their german cup triumph - reigning european champion angelos charisteas of greece and czech jan koller , who notched up 59 goals in five seasons with borussia dortmund . the problem is that neither of these classic big center forwards fits the successful style of play nuremberg showed in 2006-07 , which emphasized quick combinations rather than long balls into the box . moreover , nuremberg 's inefficiency up front is compounded by shakiness at the back .
neither klewer nor jaromir blazek has proved a completely satisfactory replacement for former keeper rafael schaefer , who departed for stuttgart in the off-season . the result is that nuremberg have conceded 18 goals in the final 30 minutes of games - second worst in the league .
that 's converted potential wins into draws , and draws into losses , costing the club some much-needed points . get yourself in must-win situations bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : ex-coach hans meyer could have the last laugh with five teams either in or near the drop zone , nuremberg 's fate is by no means sealed . whether the club can save itself from its fifth top-flight free-fall in 25 years will probably depend on how it fares in its upcoming matches against fellow relegation candidates bielefeld and duisburg . but as a team no one expected to be in such dire straits this late in the season , nuremberg will be under additional pressure to produce results . " the most important criterium is that the team believes in itself and performs , " von heesen told kick-off . " it 's a question of self-confidence , of what sort attitude one takes into matches - although i do n't want highlight a situation that puts lots of pressure on the players . " but is nuremberg fail to withstand the heat and end up in the second division again , they may find a quip by their loquacious ex-coach hans meyer ringing bitterly in their ears . " in soccer , people are very quick to erect a monument to you , " meyer once informed a curious journalist .
" but they 're just as quick to urinate on it . " the march 27 edition of bundesliga kick-off features an in-depth look at the problems in nuremberg . jefferson chase send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

germany and the eu , however , questioned the organizations ' calculations . aid agencies said that up to $ 10 billion -lrb- 6.5 billion euros -rrb- , or 40 percent , of promised aid to afghanistan has not been delivered by the west , and what does arrive bypasses the afghan government . western countries have failed to carry through on their pledges of aid to afghanistan , according to a report by the agency coordinating body for afghan relief -lrb- acbar -rrb- .
the umbrella group of non-governmental organizations which work in afghanistan said the international community had pledged $ 25 billion to afghanistan since 2001 , when the extremist taliban government was toppled , but that up to $ 10 billion had not reached the country . the us government - the biggest international donor to afghanistan - " has one of the biggest shortfalls , " providing only half of the $ 10.4 billion dollars of pledged money until 2008 , the report said . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : aid for development just a " fraction " of military expenditure the european commission and germany had delivered less than two-thirds of their respective $ 1.7 billion and $ 1.2 billion in commitments , acbar said . but a spokesperson for the german development ministry disputed that statement , saying that his country had paid up more than 90 percent of the money it had pledged between 2001 and 2006 . the european commission also rejected the allegations . " we are delivering - there is no delay , no backlog , no shortfall or lagging behind , " a spokeswoman for the european commission 's external-affairs chief in brussels said . exaggerated costs the report said the world bank had distributed just over half of its promised funds . furthermore , " just $ 15 billion in aid has so far been spent , of which it is estimated a staggering 40 percent has returned to donor countries in corporate profits and consultant salaries … vastly pushing up expenditures , " the report said . " for example , a road between the center of kabul and the international airport cost the united states more than $ 2.3 million per kilometer , at least four times the average cost of building a road in afghanistan . " many of the full-time expatriate consultants working for private companies in afghanistan receive $ 250,000 to $ 500,000 a year , including salary , allowances and other costs , the report said . a " fraction " spent on aid the report , entitled " falling short , " was written by the aid group oxfam for acbar .
acbar is made up of 94 agencies , including oxfam , christian aid , care , islamic relief and save the children . the group said that foreign money spent on aid , development and reconstruction is now just " a fraction " of military expenditures . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : afghanistan is the biggest producer of poppy-derived opium for heroin the us military alone spends some $ 100 million a day in fighting insurgents in afghanistan , but average spending on aid by all donors since 2001 has amounted to only $ 7 million daily . " given the links between development and security , the effectiveness of aid also has a major impact on peace and stability , " acbar said .
" yet thus far aid has been insufficient and in many cases wasteful and ineffective . " in addition , afghanistan received just $ 57 per capita in aid in the two years after international intervention in 2001 , compared to $ 679 a head in bosnia and $ 233 in east timor , acbar said . inefficiency and corruption are problematic some of the shortfalls , however , could be attributed to " challenging operating conditions , high levels of corruption and weak absorption capacities , " acbar noted . the group said this demonstrated the need for donors to solve such problems , adding that the weaknesses could be the reason that about two-thirds of foreign assistance bypassed the afghan government - undermining attempts to build effective state institutions . world bank country manager mariam sherman told afp news agency that its disbursal rate - estimated to be about 50 percent - was " actually very good . "
but she conceded that while the world bank channeled all its funds through the government budget , it was a problem that so much of it bypassed the administration . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : germany has more than 3,000 soldiers in afghanistan " to build a state and be accountable to its people , the government needs to have a say in resource allocation , " sherman told afp . extreme poverty prevails acbar stressed that despite the formation of the western-backed afghan government six years ago , the country still suffers from extreme poverty .
just 20 percent of the population has access to potable water ; only 5 percent has electricity . the group also drew attention to recent reports from the southern province of ghazni which said that residents in remote villages were eating grass to quell their hunger . acbar called on the international community to increase aid and ensure that it makes a lasting effect for the poorest afghans . " aid must address afghan needs , build local capacities and help afghans help themselves , " said matt waldman , afghanistan policy adviser at oxfam and the report 's author . dw staff -lrb- als -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de bundesliga -pipe- 25.03.2008 nuremberg 's fairy-tale season turns to nightmare großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : for jan koller and nuremberg , it 's been a season of grimaces so you want to take a promising team coming off a dream year and get it relegated ?
nuremberg has written a play book on how it 's done .
they 're teetering on the edge of the second division . last fall , no one expected nuremberg to be down at the bottom of table , battling it out with the likes of duisburg and cottbus .
the team , known as simply " the club " to german soccer fans , was coming off its 2007 victory in the german cup - its first major title in 39 years - and playing some of the most positive soccer in the bundesliga . fast forward to late march 2008 , and nuremberg find themselves in second-to-last in the standings and winless in their last nine matches .
the precipitous fall of one of last season 's overachievers is an object lesson in how not to build on success . lose focus on the league bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : coach von heesen has yet to record a win nuremberg 's german cup win not only meant a new addition to the club 's trophy case .
it also qualified them for the 2007-08 uefa cup . playing internationally is every team 's ultimate goal , but as so often is the case for smaller teams , the double burden of european and domestic contests has been anything but a blessing for nuremberg . the club performed quite well in the competition , reaching the knock-out round before losing a heartbreaking tie in late february to portuguese side , benfica lisbon , on two last-minute goals . but nuremberg 's relatively good uefa performances distracted players ' attention away from the fact that they had fallen into the relegation zone at home . " it started perhaps with a too-relaxed attitude at the start of the season , " nuremberg goalkeeper daniel klewer told dw 's bundesliga kick-off .
" we said to ourselves that we had the best team ever at nuremberg .
but hard work and constant concentration are part of the game , and we forgot that .
and at some point you 're left standing there and nothing works .
that 's our situation now . " with only four league victories to date , no squad in the bundesliga has won less often this season . have a lot of personality clashes bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the club is now chasing the rest of the league to their credit , nuremberg 's management tried to address their precipitous slide earlier in february .
unfortunately for them , they chose exactly the wrong route , replacing veteran coach hans meyer with thomas von heesen . the popular meyer was reportedly given the ax because of personality conflicts with nuremberg 's front office , in particular sport director martin bader .
indeed , this seems the only plausible explanation for a decision that , from a soccer perspective , is like a slumping sprinter chopping off one of his legs . the 65-year-old meyer from the communist former east germany not only led the club to its biggest triumph in almost four decades .
he also saved the team from relegation in 2005-06 , after having previously achieved comparable feats for moenchengladbach and hertha berlin . the 46-year-old von heesen , by contrast , has a relatively brief bundesliga resume , his only other top-flight coaching experience coming at lowly bielefeld . whatever van heesen 's merits as a tactician , he 's gotten off to the worst start ever of any nuremberg coach and has n't shown any signs of solving the team 's main problem . buy players who do n't fit bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : nuremberg expended huge energy on the uefa cup nuremberg have only scored 26 times in the league despite being among the bundesliga 's best at creating goal chances .
that would suggest that the team 's strikers are most at fault for its demise . but that 's not the whole story .
nuremberg signed two solid scorers after their german cup triumph - reigning european champion angelos charisteas of greece and czech jan koller , who notched up 59 goals in five seasons with borussia dortmund . the problem is that neither of these classic big center forwards fits the successful style of play nuremberg showed in 2006-07 , which emphasized quick combinations rather than long balls into the box . moreover , nuremberg 's inefficiency up front is compounded by shakiness at the back .
neither klewer nor jaromir blazek has proved a completely satisfactory replacement for former keeper rafael schaefer , who departed for stuttgart in the off-season . the result is that nuremberg have conceded 18 goals in the final 30 minutes of games - second worst in the league .
that 's converted potential wins into draws , and draws into losses , costing the club some much-needed points . get yourself in must-win situations bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : ex-coach hans meyer could have the last laugh with five teams either in or near the drop zone , nuremberg 's fate is by no means sealed . whether the club can save itself from its fifth top-flight free-fall in 25 years will probably depend on how it fares in its upcoming matches against fellow relegation candidates bielefeld and duisburg . but as a team no one expected to be in such dire straits this late in the season , nuremberg will be under additional pressure to produce results . " the most important criterium is that the team believes in itself and performs , " von heesen told kick-off . " it 's a question of self-confidence , of what sort attitude one takes into matches - although i do n't want highlight a situation that puts lots of pressure on the players . " but is nuremberg fail to withstand the heat and end up in the second division again , they may find a quip by their loquacious ex-coach hans meyer ringing bitterly in their ears .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de in focus : dossier : independence demonstrations turn violent in tibet olympic torch starts journey to beijing , despite disruptions germany calls on china to open up on tibet expert believes west can do little to sway china over tibet germany suspends aid talks with china over tibet violence press review -pipe- 25.03.2008 european press review : olympic protests , not boycott , needed großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : pro-tibet protests look set to continue as china continues to suppress pro-tibet protestors , journalists in europe say a boycott would be fruitless .
instead , they 're appealing to individual athletes to make political statements during the games themselves . observers in europe have reacted with both cynicism and dismay as the olympic flame makes its way across the globe , and government authorities do their best to silence critical voices on tibet .
for many journalists , the fact that the summer games in beijing are virtually assured of going ahead as planned reflects what they see as the general hypocrisy of the sporting event and the leadership of international olympic committee chairman jacques rogge .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the olympic ideals do n't always reflect ...
" figures like rogge probably would n't have a problem with staging the next olympic games in sudan , north korea or saudi arabia , " wrote the conservative vienna newspaper die presse .
" the main thing is that organizers promise to improve the human rights situation .
no one takes them at their word anyway . "
but few are advocating a major boycott of the games , as happened in moscow in 1980 and los angeles in 1984 .
indeed , some see hypocrisy on both sides .
" it 's said that the lessons from the nazi dictatorship -lsb- which staged the 1936 summer games -rsb- should not be forgotten , but history is not repeating itself , " wrote berlin 's tageszeitung newspaper .
" the people 's republic of china is not the third reich , and the chinese communist party is not the nsdap .
moreover , tibet is a country that did n't interest anyone in 1959 , when an uprising against chinese occupation was brutally suppressed . "
" the chinese can legitimately ask with what right the former colonial powers great britain and france were allowed to stage the games , despite hardly treating the people they colonized with kid gloves , " wrote the left-wing budapest daily nepszava .
" if china was stripped of the olympics , it would only strengthen the communist-nationalist hardliners and paralyze the slow , but still perceptible democratization of the country . "
conscience as a guide bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : protestors were arrested at the flame-lighting ceremony on march 24 olympic functionaries often vacillate between claiming that sports and politics should not be mixed , and that the olympic games represent positive political ideals .
european pundits hold out little hope that the contradictions can be resolved by a threat from the world 's large sporting nations to boycott the beijing event .
but they are encouraging athletes to make critical statements about china 's policies toward tibet .
" it 's a simple matter of civic courage , and athletes and sports functionaries should show it just like anyone else , " wrote the online edition of the german weekly magazine focus .
" the statutes of the ioc may prohibit political statements during the games .
that places responsibly on older athletes who want to end their sporting careers after the games anyway .
by taking courageous actions and accepting the subsequent bans from competition , they could crown their careers by doing something for a worthy cause . "
another commentator praised one olympic representative for having taken just such a political stand .
" there is already an exception , a woman chosen to carry the olympic torch , who has refused to participate in the lie of the political summer games , " wrote the vienna newspaper der standard .
" thailand 's narisa chakrabongse will not be receiving the olympic flame in bangkok in april .
it is her message to beijing . "
back to the roots ?
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : once again the games have been politicized some say that the only way to avoid the political controversies that seem to dog most olympic host cities would be to stage all future games in greece .
" only the establishment of a permanent facility for quadrennial use , built close to the original site in the peloponnese and paid for by sponsors and broadcasters , will avoid the kind of repellent situation we are seeing now , " wrote the guardian in britain .
given the amounts of money at play in one of the world 's highest-profile sporting events , that 's extremely unlikely to happen .
and it 's almost as far-fetched to believe that most countries would risk angering the leaders of the world 's most populous and fastest growing nation by boycotting the showcase games this summer in beijing . dw staff -lrb- jc -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

the umbrella group of non-governmental organizations which work in afghanistan said the international community had pledged $ 25 billion to afghanistan since 2001 , when the extremist taliban government was toppled , but that up to $ 10 billion had not reached the country . the us government - the biggest international donor to afghanistan - " has one of the biggest shortfalls , " providing only half of the $ 10.4 billion dollars of pledged money until 2008 , the report said . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : aid for development just a " fraction " of military expenditure the european commission and germany had delivered less than two-thirds of their respective $ 1.7 billion and $ 1.2 billion in commitments , acbar said . but a spokesperson for the german development ministry disputed that statement , saying that his country had paid up more than 90 percent of the money it had pledged between 2001 and 2006 . the european commission also rejected the allegations .

" given the links between development and security , the effectiveness of aid also has a major impact on peace and stability , " acbar said .
" yet thus far aid has been insufficient and in many cases wasteful and ineffective .

but she conceded that while the world bank channeled all its funds through the government budget , it was a problem that so much of it bypassed the administration . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : germany has more than 3,000 soldiers in afghanistan " to build a state and be accountable to its people , the government needs to have a say in resource allocation , " sherman told afp . extreme poverty prevails acbar stressed that despite the formation of the western-backed afghan government six years ago , the country still suffers from extreme poverty .
just 20 percent of the population has access to potable water ; only 5 percent has electricity . the group also drew attention to recent reports from the southern province of ghazni which said that residents in remote villages were eating grass to quell their hunger . acbar called on the international community to increase aid and ensure that it makes a lasting effect for the poorest afghans . " aid must address afghan needs , build local capacities and help afghans help themselves , " said matt waldman , afghanistan policy adviser at oxfam and the report 's author . dw staff -lrb- als -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

or so one serious fare dodger seemed to think a man who just could n't stop himself from riding trains without buying a ticket will see the wrong side of a jail cell after fines and suspended sentences failed to put him on the straight and narrow . the 24-year-old will be celebrating his next birthday in the big house because of his predilection for hopping on german trains without paying his fare . his habit seemed to have gotten out of control .
from october 2006 to february 2007 , he was caught riding the train without a ticket102 times , often several times on the same day .
the court , fed up with imposing fines and suspended sentences , finally decided to get tough and gave him a 22-month holiday behind bars . throwing himself upon the mercy of the court was likely not an option this time .
it is not as if the man was riding ticketless due to a lack of financial means .
according to his own statement , he repeatedly dodged fares " pretty much out of boredom . " it 's likely he 'll learn the meaning of true boredom while doing time , when the highlight of his day will likely be marking another of his 669 days behind bars off his calendar . dw staff -lrb- jam -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

along with two colleagues , julliard was arrested on monday , march 24 at the official olympic torch-lighting ceremony in olympia , greece after unfurling a banner calling attention to the state of human rights in china . the three were arrested by greek police for holding banners featuring handcuffs in the shape of the olympic rings during a speech by liu qi , the president of the beijing olympics organizing committee . after being detained for 10 hours and charged with offending a national symbol , the three demonstrators were released on bail .
a trial is scheduled for may 29 .
julliard is now back in paris . dw-world.de : you were arrested yesterday for protesting at the olympic torch lighting ceremony .
what were you trying to bring attention to ? bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the olympic torch began its journey to china on monday jean-francois julliard : we did it because the situation of human rights and press freedom in china is getting worse .
chinese authorities made some promises when they were chosen to host the olympic games in 2001 and they have not respected any of them . there are more journalists and internet users detained now than there were in 2001 .
chinese authorities do not want to improve the situation of human rights before the olympic games . we have less than five months until the opening ceremony in beijing and we have to use this period to put pressure on chinese authorities and to raise the issue of human rights violations in china . does that mean your actions had nothing to do with the recent protests in tibet ? we planned this weeks ago .
so even if nothing had happened in tibet we would have still held the same demonstration .
the situation in tibet is just one more piece of evidence that chinese authorities are not ready to make any improvements , to let journalists walk freely in china or let the tibetan people demonstrate peacefully . you were arrested , charged and later released on bail by the greek authorities .
what were you were charged with ? bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : authorities said banners like this offend greek national symbols we were detained for 10 hours and then presented to a prosecutor .
we were charged with offending a national symbol because we used the olympic symbol on our flag .
this is why we have been charged according to greek penal code and we face one year prison terms and fines . of course , greece is a european union country so we can not imagine that we will be sentenced to prison terms because we demonstrated during the torch-lighting ceremony .
but there will be a trial late may .
we will go back to greece to attend the trial because we want to use it to once again raise the issue of the situation of human rights in china a few months before the olympics start . are you planning to attend the olympics ? we would like to very much but , no , we can not .

we think that the situation is going to change in the next few weeks .
the french president just said this morning -lsb- tuesday , march 25 -rsb- that every option is open .
so maybe he will agree to boycott the opening ceremony .

we do not know . you do not support a total boycott of the games but you do support a boycott of the opening ceremony ? we think that a total boycott would sanction the athletes and the competitors have no responsibility .
they are not the ones that decided to hold the olympic games in china so they should not be punished for that .
but we ask heads of state , heads of government , members of royal families not to attend the opening ceremony . it would be a very significant gesture to say to the chinese authorities that we are going to attend the olympic games , we are going to attend sport events , but we are not going to attend the political event which is the opening ceremony . do you think there is a danger this kind of political action will make china take an even harder line ? no , because the line can not get harder .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de in focus : beijing 2008 : a question of human rights german olympics official : we 're not ignoring human rights beijing truths smothered in the smog of conflicting views amnesty international : china has made only minor progress china breaks promise of unfettered internet at olympics olympics -pipe- 25.03.2008 human rights abuses increase in china , olympic protester says großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : julliard being taken into police custody during the torch-lighting ceremony ongoing violence in tibet is another example of how china ignores human rights , reporters without borders told dw-world.de. the paris-based media group called for a boycott of the 2008 olympic opening ceremony . jean-francois julliard is the head of research at reporters without borders .
along with two colleagues , julliard was arrested on monday , march 24 at the official olympic torch-lighting ceremony in olympia , greece after unfurling a banner calling attention to the state of human rights in china . the three were arrested by greek police for holding banners featuring handcuffs in the shape of the olympic rings during a speech by liu qi , the president of the beijing olympics organizing committee . after being detained for 10 hours and charged with offending a national symbol , the three demonstrators were released on bail .
a trial is scheduled for may 29 .
julliard is now back in paris . dw-world.de : you were arrested yesterday for protesting at the olympic torch lighting ceremony .
what were you trying to bring attention to ? bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the olympic torch began its journey to china on monday jean-francois julliard : we did it because the situation of human rights and press freedom in china is getting worse .
chinese authorities made some promises when they were chosen to host the olympic games in 2001 and they have not respected any of them . there are more journalists and internet users detained now than there were in 2001 .
chinese authorities do not want to improve the situation of human rights before the olympic games . we have less than five months until the opening ceremony in beijing and we have to use this period to put pressure on chinese authorities and to raise the issue of human rights violations in china . does that mean your actions had nothing to do with the recent protests in tibet ? we planned this weeks ago .
so even if nothing had happened in tibet we would have still held the same demonstration .
the situation in tibet is just one more piece of evidence that chinese authorities are not ready to make any improvements , to let journalists walk freely in china or let the tibetan people demonstrate peacefully . you were arrested , charged and later released on bail by the greek authorities .
what were you were charged with ? bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : authorities said banners like this offend greek national symbols we were detained for 10 hours and then presented to a prosecutor .
we were charged with offending a national symbol because we used the olympic symbol on our flag .
this is why we have been charged according to greek penal code and we face one year prison terms and fines . of course , greece is a european union country so we can not imagine that we will be sentenced to prison terms because we demonstrated during the torch-lighting ceremony .
but there will be a trial late may .
we will go back to greece to attend the trial because we want to use it to once again raise the issue of the situation of human rights in china a few months before the olympics start . are you planning to attend the olympics ? we would like to very much but , no , we can not .
we tried to enter china in december .
we went to hong kong and asked for visas and we were denied .
so i think that we are blacklisted now in china . many people say that the olympics should be kept separate from politics .
what are your opinions on that issue ? bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : a boycott of the opening ceremony would send a strong signal to beijing it is a good thing that there is this debate and we think it is a positive step .
we think that the situation is going to change in the next few weeks .
the french president just said this morning -lsb- tuesday , march 25 -rsb- that every option is open .
so maybe he will agree to boycott the opening ceremony .
maybe he will just make a strong statement .
we do not know . you do not support a total boycott of the games but you do support a boycott of the opening ceremony ? we think that a total boycott would sanction the athletes and the competitors have no responsibility .
they are not the ones that decided to hold the olympic games in china so they should not be punished for that .
but we ask heads of state , heads of government , members of royal families not to attend the opening ceremony . it would be a very significant gesture to say to the chinese authorities that we are going to attend the olympic games , we are going to attend sport events , but we are not going to attend the political event which is the opening ceremony . do you think there is a danger this kind of political action will make china take an even harder line ? no , because the line can not get harder .
we waited for months before we did what we did .
we were patient .
we tried to have positive discussions with chinese authorities , but it was not successful , it was not useful at all .
so no , we could not wait any longer . are you planning any further protests ? i ca n't tell you now , but , of course , we plan to use the torch relay to do a lot .
the torch will cross through cities all over the world , and we hope there will be a lot of demonstrations .
the torch will be in london and paris over the next 10 days so maybe that will be our next step . interview : ole tangen jr . send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

the fliers showed a traditional white german jersey with the number 25 - the number worn by german-nigerian player patrick owomoyela - with the caption " white , not just the color of a jersey !
for a real national team ! " prosecutor sabine herbeth said in a statement on tuesday , march 25 , that udo voigt , head of the npd , as well as party spokesman klaus beier and member frank schwerdt have been charged . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : owomoyela was one of the players targeted by the fliers according to the charges , the fliers indicated that owomoyela and other players were not worthy of playing for germany because of their skin color . owomoyela said he was glad to see the case had made progress . " for me it 's an important sign that the proscuter is of the opinion that the case has enough substance to take further steps , " he said , according to a statement released by his current team , werder bremen . a second racist fliers authorities carrying out a search of the npd headquarters in april 2006 found tens of thousands of the fliers and confiscated them . but , according to prosecutors , the men charged then printed another flier , which featured a pictogram of a team made up of one white player and the question : " national eleven in 2010 ? " owomoyela , who was born in hamburg , has a german mother and a nigerian father .
he is no longer a member of the national team .
according to his club , he is active as a sponsor and mentor with anti-racism organizations and other social projects . owomoyela and german soccer 's governing body , the dfb , had filed charges related to the fliers in 2006 . if convicted , voigt and the two other co-defendants could face up to five years of prison or house arrest . dw staff -lrb- jam -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

or so one serious fare dodger seemed to think a man who just could n't stop himself from riding trains without buying a ticket will see the wrong side of a jail cell after fines and suspended sentences failed to put him on the straight and narrow . the 24-year-old will be celebrating his next birthday in the big house because of his predilection for hopping on german trains without paying his fare . his habit seemed to have gotten out of control .
from october 2006 to february 2007 , he was caught riding the train without a ticket102 times , often several times on the same day .
the court , fed up with imposing fines and suspended sentences , finally decided to get tough and gave him a 22-month holiday behind bars . throwing himself upon the mercy of the court was likely not an option this time .
it is not as if the man was riding ticketless due to a lack of financial means .
according to his own statement , he repeatedly dodged fares " pretty much out of boredom . " it 's likely he 'll learn the meaning of true boredom while doing time , when the highlight of his day will likely be marking another of his 669 days behind bars off his calendar . dw staff -lrb- jam -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

along with two colleagues , julliard was arrested on monday , march 24 at the official olympic torch-lighting ceremony in olympia , greece after unfurling a banner calling attention to the state of human rights in china . the three were arrested by greek police for holding banners featuring handcuffs in the shape of the olympic rings during a speech by liu qi , the president of the beijing olympics organizing committee . after being detained for 10 hours and charged with offending a national symbol , the three demonstrators were released on bail .
a trial is scheduled for may 29 .
julliard is now back in paris . dw-world.de : you were arrested yesterday for protesting at the olympic torch lighting ceremony .
what were you trying to bring attention to ? bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the olympic torch began its journey to china on monday jean-francois julliard : we did it because the situation of human rights and press freedom in china is getting worse .
chinese authorities made some promises when they were chosen to host the olympic games in 2001 and they have not respected any of them . there are more journalists and internet users detained now than there were in 2001 .
chinese authorities do not want to improve the situation of human rights before the olympic games . we have less than five months until the opening ceremony in beijing and we have to use this period to put pressure on chinese authorities and to raise the issue of human rights violations in china . does that mean your actions had nothing to do with the recent protests in tibet ? we planned this weeks ago .
so even if nothing had happened in tibet we would have still held the same demonstration .
the situation in tibet is just one more piece of evidence that chinese authorities are not ready to make any improvements , to let journalists walk freely in china or let the tibetan people demonstrate peacefully . you were arrested , charged and later released on bail by the greek authorities .
what were you were charged with ? bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : authorities said banners like this offend greek national symbols we were detained for 10 hours and then presented to a prosecutor .
we were charged with offending a national symbol because we used the olympic symbol on our flag .
this is why we have been charged according to greek penal code and we face one year prison terms and fines . of course , greece is a european union country so we can not imagine that we will be sentenced to prison terms because we demonstrated during the torch-lighting ceremony .
but there will be a trial late may .
we will go back to greece to attend the trial because we want to use it to once again raise the issue of the situation of human rights in china a few months before the olympics start . are you planning to attend the olympics ? we would like to very much but , no , we can not .
we tried to enter china in december .
we went to hong kong and asked for visas and we were denied .
so i think that we are blacklisted now in china . many people say that the olympics should be kept separate from politics .
what are your opinions on that issue ? bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : a boycott of the opening ceremony would send a strong signal to beijing it is a good thing that there is this debate and we think it is a positive step .
we think that the situation is going to change in the next few weeks .
the french president just said this morning -lsb- tuesday , march 25 -rsb- that every option is open .
so maybe he will agree to boycott the opening ceremony .
maybe he will just make a strong statement .
we do not know . you do not support a total boycott of the games but you do support a boycott of the opening ceremony ? we think that a total boycott would sanction the athletes and the competitors have no responsibility .
they are not the ones that decided to hold the olympic games in china so they should not be punished for that .
but we ask heads of state , heads of government , members of royal families not to attend the opening ceremony . it would be a very significant gesture to say to the chinese authorities that we are going to attend the olympic games , we are going to attend sport events , but we are not going to attend the political event which is the opening ceremony . do you think there is a danger this kind of political action will make china take an even harder line ? no , because the line can not get harder .
we waited for months before we did what we did .
we were patient .
we tried to have positive discussions with chinese authorities , but it was not successful , it was not useful at all .
so no , we could not wait any longer . are you planning any further protests ? i ca n't tell you now , but , of course , we plan to use the torch relay to do a lot .
the torch will cross through cities all over the world , and we hope there will be a lot of demonstrations .

along with two colleagues , julliard was arrested on monday , march 24 at the official olympic torch-lighting ceremony in olympia , greece after unfurling a banner calling attention to the state of human rights in china . the three were arrested by greek police for holding banners featuring handcuffs in the shape of the olympic rings during a speech by liu qi , the president of the beijing olympics organizing committee . after being detained for 10 hours and charged with offending a national symbol , the three demonstrators were released on bail .
a trial is scheduled for may 29 .
julliard is now back in paris . dw-world.de : you were arrested yesterday for protesting at the olympic torch lighting ceremony .
what were you trying to bring attention to ? bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the olympic torch began its journey to china on monday jean-francois julliard : we did it because the situation of human rights and press freedom in china is getting worse .
chinese authorities made some promises when they were chosen to host the olympic games in 2001 and they have not respected any of them . there are more journalists and internet users detained now than there were in 2001 .
chinese authorities do not want to improve the situation of human rights before the olympic games . we have less than five months until the opening ceremony in beijing and we have to use this period to put pressure on chinese authorities and to raise the issue of human rights violations in china . does that mean your actions had nothing to do with the recent protests in tibet ? we planned this weeks ago .
so even if nothing had happened in tibet we would have still held the same demonstration .
the situation in tibet is just one more piece of evidence that chinese authorities are not ready to make any improvements , to let journalists walk freely in china or let the tibetan people demonstrate peacefully . you were arrested , charged and later released on bail by the greek authorities .
what were you were charged with ? bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : authorities said banners like this offend greek national symbols we were detained for 10 hours and then presented to a prosecutor .
we were charged with offending a national symbol because we used the olympic symbol on our flag .
this is why we have been charged according to greek penal code and we face one year prison terms and fines . of course , greece is a european union country so we can not imagine that we will be sentenced to prison terms because we demonstrated during the torch-lighting ceremony .
but there will be a trial late may .
we will go back to greece to attend the trial because we want to use it to once again raise the issue of the situation of human rights in china a few months before the olympics start . are you planning to attend the olympics ? we would like to very much but , no , we can not .
we tried to enter china in december .
we went to hong kong and asked for visas and we were denied .
so i think that we are blacklisted now in china . many people say that the olympics should be kept separate from politics .
what are your opinions on that issue ? bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : a boycott of the opening ceremony would send a strong signal to beijing it is a good thing that there is this debate and we think it is a positive step .
we think that the situation is going to change in the next few weeks .
the french president just said this morning -lsb- tuesday , march 25 -rsb- that every option is open .
so maybe he will agree to boycott the opening ceremony .
maybe he will just make a strong statement .
we do not know . you do not support a total boycott of the games but you do support a boycott of the opening ceremony ? we think that a total boycott would sanction the athletes and the competitors have no responsibility .
they are not the ones that decided to hold the olympic games in china so they should not be punished for that .
but we ask heads of state , heads of government , members of royal families not to attend the opening ceremony . it would be a very significant gesture to say to the chinese authorities that we are going to attend the olympic games , we are going to attend sport events , but we are not going to attend the political event which is the opening ceremony . do you think there is a danger this kind of political action will make china take an even harder line ? no , because the line can not get harder .
we waited for months before we did what we did .

or so one serious fare dodger seemed to think a man who just could n't stop himself from riding trains without buying a ticket will see the wrong side of a jail cell after fines and suspended sentences failed to put him on the straight and narrow . the 24-year-old will be celebrating his next birthday in the big house because of his predilection for hopping on german trains without paying his fare . his habit seemed to have gotten out of control .
from october 2006 to february 2007 , he was caught riding the train without a ticket102 times , often several times on the same day .
the court , fed up with imposing fines and suspended sentences , finally decided to get tough and gave him a 22-month holiday behind bars . throwing himself upon the mercy of the court was likely not an option this time .
it is not as if the man was riding ticketless due to a lack of financial means .
according to his own statement , he repeatedly dodged fares " pretty much out of boredom . " it 's likely he 'll learn the meaning of true boredom while doing time , when the highlight of his day will likely be marking another of his 669 days behind bars off his calendar . dw staff -lrb- jam -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de afghanistan -pipe- 25.03.2008 western aid failing to reach afghanistan , report says großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : afghanistan has been ravaged by war for years aid agencies said that up to $ 10 billion -lrb- 6.5 billion euros -rrb- , or 40 percent , of promised aid to afghanistan has not been delivered by the west .
germany and the eu , however , questioned the organizations ' calculations . aid agencies said that up to $ 10 billion -lrb- 6.5 billion euros -rrb- , or 40 percent , of promised aid to afghanistan has not been delivered by the west , and what does arrive bypasses the afghan government . western countries have failed to carry through on their pledges of aid to afghanistan , according to a report by the agency coordinating body for afghan relief -lrb- acbar -rrb- .
the umbrella group of non-governmental organizations which work in afghanistan said the international community had pledged $ 25 billion to afghanistan since 2001 , when the extremist taliban government was toppled , but that up to $ 10 billion had not reached the country . the us government - the biggest international donor to afghanistan - " has one of the biggest shortfalls , " providing only half of the $ 10.4 billion dollars of pledged money until 2008 , the report said . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : aid for development just a " fraction " of military expenditure the european commission and germany had delivered less than two-thirds of their respective $ 1.7 billion and $ 1.2 billion in commitments , acbar said . but a spokesperson for the german development ministry disputed that statement , saying that his country had paid up more than 90 percent of the money it had pledged between 2001 and 2006 . the european commission also rejected the allegations . " we are delivering - there is no delay , no backlog , no shortfall or lagging behind , " a spokeswoman for the european commission 's external-affairs chief in brussels said . exaggerated costs the report said the world bank had distributed just over half of its promised funds . furthermore , " just $ 15 billion in aid has so far been spent , of which it is estimated a staggering 40 percent has returned to donor countries in corporate profits and consultant salaries … vastly pushing up expenditures , " the report said . " for example , a road between the center of kabul and the international airport cost the united states more than $ 2.3 million per kilometer , at least four times the average cost of building a road in afghanistan . " many of the full-time expatriate consultants working for private companies in afghanistan receive $ 250,000 to $ 500,000 a year , including salary , allowances and other costs , the report said . a " fraction " spent on aid the report , entitled " falling short , " was written by the aid group oxfam for acbar .
acbar is made up of 94 agencies , including oxfam , christian aid , care , islamic relief and save the children . the group said that foreign money spent on aid , development and reconstruction is now just " a fraction " of military expenditures . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : afghanistan is the biggest producer of poppy-derived opium for heroin the us military alone spends some $ 100 million a day in fighting insurgents in afghanistan , but average spending on aid by all donors since 2001 has amounted to only $ 7 million daily . " given the links between development and security , the effectiveness of aid also has a major impact on peace and stability , " acbar said .
" yet thus far aid has been insufficient and in many cases wasteful and ineffective . " in addition , afghanistan received just $ 57 per capita in aid in the two years after international intervention in 2001 , compared to $ 679 a head in bosnia and $ 233 in east timor , acbar said . inefficiency and corruption are problematic some of the shortfalls , however , could be attributed to " challenging operating conditions , high levels of corruption and weak absorption capacities , " acbar noted . the group said this demonstrated the need for donors to solve such problems , adding that the weaknesses could be the reason that about two-thirds of foreign assistance bypassed the afghan government - undermining attempts to build effective state institutions . world bank country manager mariam sherman told afp news agency that its disbursal rate - estimated to be about 50 percent - was " actually very good . "
but she conceded that while the world bank channeled all its funds through the government budget , it was a problem that so much of it bypassed the administration . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : germany has more than 3,000 soldiers in afghanistan " to build a state and be accountable to its people , the government needs to have a say in resource allocation , " sherman told afp . extreme poverty prevails acbar stressed that despite the formation of the western-backed afghan government six years ago , the country still suffers from extreme poverty .
just 20 percent of the population has access to potable water ; only 5 percent has electricity . the group also drew attention to recent reports from the southern province of ghazni which said that residents in remote villages were eating grass to quell their hunger . acbar called on the international community to increase aid and ensure that it makes a lasting effect for the poorest afghans . " aid must address afghan needs , build local capacities and help afghans help themselves , " said matt waldman , afghanistan policy adviser at oxfam and the report 's author . dw staff -lrb- als -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de afghanistan -pipe- 25.03.2008 western aid failing to reach afghanistan , report says großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : afghanistan has been ravaged by war for years aid agencies said that up to $ 10 billion -lrb- 6.5 billion euros -rrb- , or 40 percent , of promised aid to afghanistan has not been delivered by the west .
germany and the eu , however , questioned the organizations ' calculations . aid agencies said that up to $ 10 billion -lrb- 6.5 billion euros -rrb- , or 40 percent , of promised aid to afghanistan has not been delivered by the west , and what does arrive bypasses the afghan government . western countries have failed to carry through on their pledges of aid to afghanistan , according to a report by the agency coordinating body for afghan relief -lrb- acbar -rrb- .
the umbrella group of non-governmental organizations which work in afghanistan said the international community had pledged $ 25 billion to afghanistan since 2001 , when the extremist taliban government was toppled , but that up to $ 10 billion had not reached the country . the us government - the biggest international donor to afghanistan - " has one of the biggest shortfalls , " providing only half of the $ 10.4 billion dollars of pledged money until 2008 , the report said . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : aid for development just a " fraction " of military expenditure the european commission and germany had delivered less than two-thirds of their respective $ 1.7 billion and $ 1.2 billion in commitments , acbar said . but a spokesperson for the german development ministry disputed that statement , saying that his country had paid up more than 90 percent of the money it had pledged between 2001 and 2006 . the european commission also rejected the allegations . " we are delivering - there is no delay , no backlog , no shortfall or lagging behind , " a spokeswoman for the european commission 's external-affairs chief in brussels said . exaggerated costs the report said the world bank had distributed just over half of its promised funds . furthermore , " just $ 15 billion in aid has so far been spent , of which it is estimated a staggering 40 percent has returned to donor countries in corporate profits and consultant salaries … vastly pushing up expenditures , " the report said . " for example , a road between the center of kabul and the international airport cost the united states more than $ 2.3 million per kilometer , at least four times the average cost of building a road in afghanistan . " many of the full-time expatriate consultants working for private companies in afghanistan receive $ 250,000 to $ 500,000 a year , including salary , allowances and other costs , the report said . a " fraction " spent on aid the report , entitled " falling short , " was written by the aid group oxfam for acbar .
acbar is made up of 94 agencies , including oxfam , christian aid , care , islamic relief and save the children . the group said that foreign money spent on aid , development and reconstruction is now just " a fraction " of military expenditures . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : afghanistan is the biggest producer of poppy-derived opium for heroin the us military alone spends some $ 100 million a day in fighting insurgents in afghanistan , but average spending on aid by all donors since 2001 has amounted to only $ 7 million daily . " given the links between development and security , the effectiveness of aid also has a major impact on peace and stability , " acbar said .
" yet thus far aid has been insufficient and in many cases wasteful and ineffective . " in addition , afghanistan received just $ 57 per capita in aid in the two years after international intervention in 2001 , compared to $ 679 a head in bosnia and $ 233 in east timor , acbar said . inefficiency and corruption are problematic some of the shortfalls , however , could be attributed to " challenging operating conditions , high levels of corruption and weak absorption capacities , " acbar noted . the group said this demonstrated the need for donors to solve such problems , adding that the weaknesses could be the reason that about two-thirds of foreign assistance bypassed the afghan government - undermining attempts to build effective state institutions . world bank country manager mariam sherman told afp news agency that its disbursal rate - estimated to be about 50 percent - was " actually very good . "
but she conceded that while the world bank channeled all its funds through the government budget , it was a problem that so much of it bypassed the administration . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : germany has more than 3,000 soldiers in afghanistan " to build a state and be accountable to its people , the government needs to have a say in resource allocation , " sherman told afp . extreme poverty prevails acbar stressed that despite the formation of the western-backed afghan government six years ago , the country still suffers from extreme poverty .
just 20 percent of the population has access to potable water ; only 5 percent has electricity . the group also drew attention to recent reports from the southern province of ghazni which said that residents in remote villages were eating grass to quell their hunger . acbar called on the international community to increase aid and ensure that it makes a lasting effect for the poorest afghans . " aid must address afghan needs , build local capacities and help afghans help themselves , " said matt waldman , afghanistan policy adviser at oxfam and the report 's author . dw staff -lrb- als -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

nuremberg has written a play book on how it 's done .
they 're teetering on the edge of the second division . last fall , no one expected nuremberg to be down at the bottom of table , battling it out with the likes of duisburg and cottbus .
the team , known as simply " the club " to german soccer fans , was coming off its 2007 victory in the german cup - its first major title in 39 years - and playing some of the most positive soccer in the bundesliga . fast forward to late march 2008 , and nuremberg find themselves in second-to-last in the standings and winless in their last nine matches .
the precipitous fall of one of last season 's overachievers is an object lesson in how not to build on success . lose focus on the league bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : coach von heesen has yet to record a win nuremberg 's german cup win not only meant a new addition to the club 's trophy case .
it also qualified them for the 2007-08 uefa cup . playing internationally is every team 's ultimate goal , but as so often is the case for smaller teams , the double burden of european and domestic contests has been anything but a blessing for nuremberg . the club performed quite well in the competition , reaching the knock-out round before losing a heartbreaking tie in late february to portuguese side , benfica lisbon , on two last-minute goals . but nuremberg 's relatively good uefa performances distracted players ' attention away from the fact that they had fallen into the relegation zone at home . " it started perhaps with a too-relaxed attitude at the start of the season , " nuremberg goalkeeper daniel klewer told dw 's bundesliga kick-off .
" we said to ourselves that we had the best team ever at nuremberg .
but hard work and constant concentration are part of the game , and we forgot that .
and at some point you 're left standing there and nothing works .
that 's our situation now . " with only four league victories to date , no squad in the bundesliga has won less often this season . have a lot of personality clashes bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the club is now chasing the rest of the league to their credit , nuremberg 's management tried to address their precipitous slide earlier in february .
unfortunately for them , they chose exactly the wrong route , replacing veteran coach hans meyer with thomas von heesen . the popular meyer was reportedly given the ax because of personality conflicts with nuremberg 's front office , in particular sport director martin bader .
indeed , this seems the only plausible explanation for a decision that , from a soccer perspective , is like a slumping sprinter chopping off one of his legs . the 65-year-old meyer from the communist former east germany not only led the club to its biggest triumph in almost four decades .
he also saved the team from relegation in 2005-06 , after having previously achieved comparable feats for moenchengladbach and hertha berlin . the 46-year-old von heesen , by contrast , has a relatively brief bundesliga resume , his only other top-flight coaching experience coming at lowly bielefeld . whatever van heesen 's merits as a tactician , he 's gotten off to the worst start ever of any nuremberg coach and has n't shown any signs of solving the team 's main problem . buy players who do n't fit bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : nuremberg expended huge energy on the uefa cup nuremberg have only scored 26 times in the league despite being among the bundesliga 's best at creating goal chances .
that would suggest that the team 's strikers are most at fault for its demise . but that 's not the whole story .
nuremberg signed two solid scorers after their german cup triumph - reigning european champion angelos charisteas of greece and czech jan koller , who notched up 59 goals in five seasons with borussia dortmund . the problem is that neither of these classic big center forwards fits the successful style of play nuremberg showed in 2006-07 , which emphasized quick combinations rather than long balls into the box . moreover , nuremberg 's inefficiency up front is compounded by shakiness at the back .
neither klewer nor jaromir blazek has proved a completely satisfactory replacement for former keeper rafael schaefer , who departed for stuttgart in the off-season . the result is that nuremberg have conceded 18 goals in the final 30 minutes of games - second worst in the league .
that 's converted potential wins into draws , and draws into losses , costing the club some much-needed points . get yourself in must-win situations bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : ex-coach hans meyer could have the last laugh with five teams either in or near the drop zone , nuremberg 's fate is by no means sealed . whether the club can save itself from its fifth top-flight free-fall in 25 years will probably depend on how it fares in its upcoming matches against fellow relegation candidates bielefeld and duisburg . but as a team no one expected to be in such dire straits this late in the season , nuremberg will be under additional pressure to produce results . " the most important criterium is that the team believes in itself and performs , " von heesen told kick-off . " it 's a question of self-confidence , of what sort attitude one takes into matches - although i do n't want highlight a situation that puts lots of pressure on the players . " but is nuremberg fail to withstand the heat and end up in the second division again , they may find a quip by their loquacious ex-coach hans meyer ringing bitterly in their ears . " in soccer , people are very quick to erect a monument to you , " meyer once informed a curious journalist .

nuremberg has written a play book on how it 's done .
they 're teetering on the edge of the second division . last fall , no one expected nuremberg to be down at the bottom of table , battling it out with the likes of duisburg and cottbus .
the team , known as simply " the club " to german soccer fans , was coming off its 2007 victory in the german cup - its first major title in 39 years - and playing some of the most positive soccer in the bundesliga . fast forward to late march 2008 , and nuremberg find themselves in second-to-last in the standings and winless in their last nine matches .

it also qualified them for the 2007-08 uefa cup . playing internationally is every team 's ultimate goal , but as so often is the case for smaller teams , the double burden of european and domestic contests has been anything but a blessing for nuremberg . the club performed quite well in the competition , reaching the knock-out round before losing a heartbreaking tie in late february to portuguese side , benfica lisbon , on two last-minute goals . but nuremberg 's relatively good uefa performances distracted players ' attention away from the fact that they had fallen into the relegation zone at home . " it started perhaps with a too-relaxed attitude at the start of the season , " nuremberg goalkeeper daniel klewer told dw 's bundesliga kick-off .
" we said to ourselves that we had the best team ever at nuremberg .
but hard work and constant concentration are part of the game , and we forgot that .
and at some point you 're left standing there and nothing works .

indeed , this seems the only plausible explanation for a decision that , from a soccer perspective , is like a slumping sprinter chopping off one of his legs . the 65-year-old meyer from the communist former east germany not only led the club to its biggest triumph in almost four decades .
he also saved the team from relegation in 2005-06 , after having previously achieved comparable feats for moenchengladbach and hertha berlin . the 46-year-old von heesen , by contrast , has a relatively brief bundesliga resume , his only other top-flight coaching experience coming at lowly bielefeld . whatever van heesen 's merits as a tactician , he 's gotten off to the worst start ever of any nuremberg coach and has n't shown any signs of solving the team 's main problem . buy players who do n't fit bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : nuremberg expended huge energy on the uefa cup nuremberg have only scored 26 times in the league despite being among the bundesliga 's best at creating goal chances .
that would suggest that the team 's strikers are most at fault for its demise . but that 's not the whole story .
nuremberg signed two solid scorers after their german cup triumph - reigning european champion angelos charisteas of greece and czech jan koller , who notched up 59 goals in five seasons with borussia dortmund . the problem is that neither of these classic big center forwards fits the successful style of play nuremberg showed in 2006-07 , which emphasized quick combinations rather than long balls into the box . moreover , nuremberg 's inefficiency up front is compounded by shakiness at the back .
neither klewer nor jaromir blazek has proved a completely satisfactory replacement for former keeper rafael schaefer , who departed for stuttgart in the off-season . the result is that nuremberg have conceded 18 goals in the final 30 minutes of games - second worst in the league .
that 's converted potential wins into draws , and draws into losses , costing the club some much-needed points . get yourself in must-win situations bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : ex-coach hans meyer could have the last laugh with five teams either in or near the drop zone , nuremberg 's fate is by no means sealed . whether the club can save itself from its fifth top-flight free-fall in 25 years will probably depend on how it fares in its upcoming matches against fellow relegation candidates bielefeld and duisburg . but as a team no one expected to be in such dire straits this late in the season , nuremberg will be under additional pressure to produce results .

it also qualified them for the 2007-08 uefa cup . playing internationally is every team 's ultimate goal , but as so often is the case for smaller teams , the double burden of european and domestic contests has been anything but a blessing for nuremberg . the club performed quite well in the competition , reaching the knock-out round before losing a heartbreaking tie in late february to portuguese side , benfica lisbon , on two last-minute goals . but nuremberg 's relatively good uefa performances distracted players ' attention away from the fact that they had fallen into the relegation zone at home . " it started perhaps with a too-relaxed attitude at the start of the season , " nuremberg goalkeeper daniel klewer told dw 's bundesliga kick-off .
" we said to ourselves that we had the best team ever at nuremberg .
but hard work and constant concentration are part of the game , and we forgot that .
and at some point you 're left standing there and nothing works .
that 's our situation now . " with only four league victories to date , no squad in the bundesliga has won less often this season . have a lot of personality clashes bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the club is now chasing the rest of the league to their credit , nuremberg 's management tried to address their precipitous slide earlier in february .
unfortunately for them , they chose exactly the wrong route , replacing veteran coach hans meyer with thomas von heesen . the popular meyer was reportedly given the ax because of personality conflicts with nuremberg 's front office , in particular sport director martin bader .
indeed , this seems the only plausible explanation for a decision that , from a soccer perspective , is like a slumping sprinter chopping off one of his legs . the 65-year-old meyer from the communist former east germany not only led the club to its biggest triumph in almost four decades .
he also saved the team from relegation in 2005-06 , after having previously achieved comparable feats for moenchengladbach and hertha berlin . the 46-year-old von heesen , by contrast , has a relatively brief bundesliga resume , his only other top-flight coaching experience coming at lowly bielefeld . whatever van heesen 's merits as a tactician , he 's gotten off to the worst start ever of any nuremberg coach and has n't shown any signs of solving the team 's main problem . buy players who do n't fit bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : nuremberg expended huge energy on the uefa cup nuremberg have only scored 26 times in the league despite being among the bundesliga 's best at creating goal chances .
that would suggest that the team 's strikers are most at fault for its demise . but that 's not the whole story .
nuremberg signed two solid scorers after their german cup triumph - reigning european champion angelos charisteas of greece and czech jan koller , who notched up 59 goals in five seasons with borussia dortmund . the problem is that neither of these classic big center forwards fits the successful style of play nuremberg showed in 2006-07 , which emphasized quick combinations rather than long balls into the box . moreover , nuremberg 's inefficiency up front is compounded by shakiness at the back .
neither klewer nor jaromir blazek has proved a completely satisfactory replacement for former keeper rafael schaefer , who departed for stuttgart in the off-season . the result is that nuremberg have conceded 18 goals in the final 30 minutes of games - second worst in the league .
that 's converted potential wins into draws , and draws into losses , costing the club some much-needed points . get yourself in must-win situations bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : ex-coach hans meyer could have the last laugh with five teams either in or near the drop zone , nuremberg 's fate is by no means sealed . whether the club can save itself from its fifth top-flight free-fall in 25 years will probably depend on how it fares in its upcoming matches against fellow relegation candidates bielefeld and duisburg . but as a team no one expected to be in such dire straits this late in the season , nuremberg will be under additional pressure to produce results . " the most important criterium is that the team believes in itself and performs , " von heesen told kick-off . " it 's a question of self-confidence , of what sort attitude one takes into matches - although i do n't want highlight a situation that puts lots of pressure on the players . " but is nuremberg fail to withstand the heat and end up in the second division again , they may find a quip by their loquacious ex-coach hans meyer ringing bitterly in their ears . " in soccer , people are very quick to erect a monument to you , " meyer once informed a curious journalist .
" but they 're just as quick to urinate on it . " the march 27 edition of bundesliga kick-off features an in-depth look at the problems in nuremberg . jefferson chase send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

or so one serious fare dodger seemed to think a man who just could n't stop himself from riding trains without buying a ticket will see the wrong side of a jail cell after fines and suspended sentences failed to put him on the straight and narrow . the 24-year-old will be celebrating his next birthday in the big house because of his predilection for hopping on german trains without paying his fare . his habit seemed to have gotten out of control .
from october 2006 to february 2007 , he was caught riding the train without a ticket102 times , often several times on the same day .
the court , fed up with imposing fines and suspended sentences , finally decided to get tough and gave him a 22-month holiday behind bars . throwing himself upon the mercy of the court was likely not an option this time .
it is not as if the man was riding ticketless due to a lack of financial means .
according to his own statement , he repeatedly dodged fares " pretty much out of boredom . " it 's likely he 'll learn the meaning of true boredom while doing time , when the highlight of his day will likely be marking another of his 669 days behind bars off his calendar . dw staff -lrb- jam -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

the umbrella group of non-governmental organizations which work in afghanistan said the international community had pledged $ 25 billion to afghanistan since 2001 , when the extremist taliban government was toppled , but that up to $ 10 billion had not reached the country . the us government - the biggest international donor to afghanistan - " has one of the biggest shortfalls , " providing only half of the $ 10.4 billion dollars of pledged money until 2008 , the report said . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : aid for development just a " fraction " of military expenditure the european commission and germany had delivered less than two-thirds of their respective $ 1.7 billion and $ 1.2 billion in commitments , acbar said . but a spokesperson for the german development ministry disputed that statement , saying that his country had paid up more than 90 percent of the money it had pledged between 2001 and 2006 . the european commission also rejected the allegations . " we are delivering - there is no delay , no backlog , no shortfall or lagging behind , " a spokeswoman for the european commission 's external-affairs chief in brussels said . exaggerated costs the report said the world bank had distributed just over half of its promised funds . furthermore , " just $ 15 billion in aid has so far been spent , of which it is estimated a staggering 40 percent has returned to donor countries in corporate profits and consultant salaries … vastly pushing up expenditures , " the report said . " for example , a road between the center of kabul and the international airport cost the united states more than $ 2.3 million per kilometer , at least four times the average cost of building a road in afghanistan .

acbar is made up of 94 agencies , including oxfam , christian aid , care , islamic relief and save the children . the group said that foreign money spent on aid , development and reconstruction is now just " a fraction " of military expenditures . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : afghanistan is the biggest producer of poppy-derived opium for heroin the us military alone spends some $ 100 million a day in fighting insurgents in afghanistan , but average spending on aid by all donors since 2001 has amounted to only $ 7 million daily . " given the links between development and security , the effectiveness of aid also has a major impact on peace and stability , " acbar said .
" yet thus far aid has been insufficient and in many cases wasteful and ineffective . " in addition , afghanistan received just $ 57 per capita in aid in the two years after international intervention in 2001 , compared to $ 679 a head in bosnia and $ 233 in east timor , acbar said . inefficiency and corruption are problematic some of the shortfalls , however , could be attributed to " challenging operating conditions , high levels of corruption and weak absorption capacities , " acbar noted . the group said this demonstrated the need for donors to solve such problems , adding that the weaknesses could be the reason that about two-thirds of foreign assistance bypassed the afghan government - undermining attempts to build effective state institutions . world bank country manager mariam sherman told afp news agency that its disbursal rate - estimated to be about 50 percent - was " actually very good . "
but she conceded that while the world bank channeled all its funds through the government budget , it was a problem that so much of it bypassed the administration . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : germany has more than 3,000 soldiers in afghanistan " to build a state and be accountable to its people , the government needs to have a say in resource allocation , " sherman told afp . extreme poverty prevails acbar stressed that despite the formation of the western-backed afghan government six years ago , the country still suffers from extreme poverty .
just 20 percent of the population has access to potable water ; only 5 percent has electricity . the group also drew attention to recent reports from the southern province of ghazni which said that residents in remote villages were eating grass to quell their hunger . acbar called on the international community to increase aid and ensure that it makes a lasting effect for the poorest afghans .

or so one serious fare dodger seemed to think a man who just could n't stop himself from riding trains without buying a ticket will see the wrong side of a jail cell after fines and suspended sentences failed to put him on the straight and narrow . the 24-year-old will be celebrating his next birthday in the big house because of his predilection for hopping on german trains without paying his fare . his habit seemed to have gotten out of control .
from october 2006 to february 2007 , he was caught riding the train without a ticket102 times , often several times on the same day .
the court , fed up with imposing fines and suspended sentences , finally decided to get tough and gave him a 22-month holiday behind bars . throwing himself upon the mercy of the court was likely not an option this time .
it is not as if the man was riding ticketless due to a lack of financial means .
according to his own statement , he repeatedly dodged fares " pretty much out of boredom .

germany and the eu , however , questioned the organizations ' calculations . aid agencies said that up to $ 10 billion -lrb- 6.5 billion euros -rrb- , or 40 percent , of promised aid to afghanistan has not been delivered by the west , and what does arrive bypasses the afghan government . western countries have failed to carry through on their pledges of aid to afghanistan , according to a report by the agency coordinating body for afghan relief -lrb- acbar -rrb- .
the umbrella group of non-governmental organizations which work in afghanistan said the international community had pledged $ 25 billion to afghanistan since 2001 , when the extremist taliban government was toppled , but that up to $ 10 billion had not reached the country . the us government - the biggest international donor to afghanistan - " has one of the biggest shortfalls , " providing only half of the $ 10.4 billion dollars of pledged money until 2008 , the report said . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : aid for development just a " fraction " of military expenditure the european commission and germany had delivered less than two-thirds of their respective $ 1.7 billion and $ 1.2 billion in commitments , acbar said . but a spokesperson for the german development ministry disputed that statement , saying that his country had paid up more than 90 percent of the money it had pledged between 2001 and 2006 . the european commission also rejected the allegations . " we are delivering - there is no delay , no backlog , no shortfall or lagging behind , " a spokeswoman for the european commission 's external-affairs chief in brussels said . exaggerated costs the report said the world bank had distributed just over half of its promised funds . furthermore , " just $ 15 billion in aid has so far been spent , of which it is estimated a staggering 40 percent has returned to donor countries in corporate profits and consultant salaries … vastly pushing up expenditures , " the report said . " for example , a road between the center of kabul and the international airport cost the united states more than $ 2.3 million per kilometer , at least four times the average cost of building a road in afghanistan . " many of the full-time expatriate consultants working for private companies in afghanistan receive $ 250,000 to $ 500,000 a year , including salary , allowances and other costs , the report said . a " fraction " spent on aid the report , entitled " falling short , " was written by the aid group oxfam for acbar .
acbar is made up of 94 agencies , including oxfam , christian aid , care , islamic relief and save the children . the group said that foreign money spent on aid , development and reconstruction is now just " a fraction " of military expenditures . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : afghanistan is the biggest producer of poppy-derived opium for heroin the us military alone spends some $ 100 million a day in fighting insurgents in afghanistan , but average spending on aid by all donors since 2001 has amounted to only $ 7 million daily . " given the links between development and security , the effectiveness of aid also has a major impact on peace and stability , " acbar said .
" yet thus far aid has been insufficient and in many cases wasteful and ineffective . " in addition , afghanistan received just $ 57 per capita in aid in the two years after international intervention in 2001 , compared to $ 679 a head in bosnia and $ 233 in east timor , acbar said . inefficiency and corruption are problematic some of the shortfalls , however , could be attributed to " challenging operating conditions , high levels of corruption and weak absorption capacities , " acbar noted . the group said this demonstrated the need for donors to solve such problems , adding that the weaknesses could be the reason that about two-thirds of foreign assistance bypassed the afghan government - undermining attempts to build effective state institutions . world bank country manager mariam sherman told afp news agency that its disbursal rate - estimated to be about 50 percent - was " actually very good . "
but she conceded that while the world bank channeled all its funds through the government budget , it was a problem that so much of it bypassed the administration . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : germany has more than 3,000 soldiers in afghanistan " to build a state and be accountable to its people , the government needs to have a say in resource allocation , " sherman told afp . extreme poverty prevails acbar stressed that despite the formation of the western-backed afghan government six years ago , the country still suffers from extreme poverty .
just 20 percent of the population has access to potable water ; only 5 percent has electricity . the group also drew attention to recent reports from the southern province of ghazni which said that residents in remote villages were eating grass to quell their hunger . acbar called on the international community to increase aid and ensure that it makes a lasting effect for the poorest afghans .

along with two colleagues , julliard was arrested on monday , march 24 at the official olympic torch-lighting ceremony in olympia , greece after unfurling a banner calling attention to the state of human rights in china . the three were arrested by greek police for holding banners featuring handcuffs in the shape of the olympic rings during a speech by liu qi , the president of the beijing olympics organizing committee . after being detained for 10 hours and charged with offending a national symbol , the three demonstrators were released on bail .
a trial is scheduled for may 29 .
julliard is now back in paris . dw-world.de : you were arrested yesterday for protesting at the olympic torch lighting ceremony .
what were you trying to bring attention to ? bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the olympic torch began its journey to china on monday jean-francois julliard : we did it because the situation of human rights and press freedom in china is getting worse .
chinese authorities made some promises when they were chosen to host the olympic games in 2001 and they have not respected any of them . there are more journalists and internet users detained now than there were in 2001 .
chinese authorities do not want to improve the situation of human rights before the olympic games . we have less than five months until the opening ceremony in beijing and we have to use this period to put pressure on chinese authorities and to raise the issue of human rights violations in china . does that mean your actions had nothing to do with the recent protests in tibet ? we planned this weeks ago .
so even if nothing had happened in tibet we would have still held the same demonstration .
the situation in tibet is just one more piece of evidence that chinese authorities are not ready to make any improvements , to let journalists walk freely in china or let the tibetan people demonstrate peacefully . you were arrested , charged and later released on bail by the greek authorities .
what were you were charged with ? bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : authorities said banners like this offend greek national symbols we were detained for 10 hours and then presented to a prosecutor .
we were charged with offending a national symbol because we used the olympic symbol on our flag .
this is why we have been charged according to greek penal code and we face one year prison terms and fines . of course , greece is a european union country so we can not imagine that we will be sentenced to prison terms because we demonstrated during the torch-lighting ceremony .
but there will be a trial late may .
we will go back to greece to attend the trial because we want to use it to once again raise the issue of the situation of human rights in china a few months before the olympics start . are you planning to attend the olympics ? we would like to very much but , no , we can not .
we tried to enter china in december .
we went to hong kong and asked for visas and we were denied .
so i think that we are blacklisted now in china . many people say that the olympics should be kept separate from politics .
what are your opinions on that issue ? bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : a boycott of the opening ceremony would send a strong signal to beijing it is a good thing that there is this debate and we think it is a positive step .
we think that the situation is going to change in the next few weeks .
the french president just said this morning -lsb- tuesday , march 25 -rsb- that every option is open .
so maybe he will agree to boycott the opening ceremony .
maybe he will just make a strong statement .
we do not know . you do not support a total boycott of the games but you do support a boycott of the opening ceremony ? we think that a total boycott would sanction the athletes and the competitors have no responsibility .
they are not the ones that decided to hold the olympic games in china so they should not be punished for that .
but we ask heads of state , heads of government , members of royal families not to attend the opening ceremony . it would be a very significant gesture to say to the chinese authorities that we are going to attend the olympic games , we are going to attend sport events , but we are not going to attend the political event which is the opening ceremony . do you think there is a danger this kind of political action will make china take an even harder line ? no , because the line can not get harder .
we waited for months before we did what we did .
we were patient .
we tried to have positive discussions with chinese authorities , but it was not successful , it was not useful at all .
so no , we could not wait any longer . are you planning any further protests ? i ca n't tell you now , but , of course , we plan to use the torch relay to do a lot .
the torch will cross through cities all over the world , and we hope there will be a lot of demonstrations .
the torch will be in london and paris over the next 10 days so maybe that will be our next step . interview : ole tangen jr . send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

steinmeier told the chinese foreign minister he hopes for " a permanent end of the violence and a pacification of the situation . " at a regular news conference in berlin , deputy government spokesman thomas steg said germany considers it " essential that both sides - tibet and the dalai lama on the one side and the government in beijing on the other - move toward each other . " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : pro-tibetan protests in thailand " the tibetans want to protect their culture and china has an interest in stability and territorial integrity , and thus the german government sees no alternative to a direct dialogue between the two sides . " steg said berlin stood by its position that an olympic boycott would be counterproductive but renewed its call for china to practice " transparency " in tibet by allowing foreign observers into the himalayan region . germany last week suspended talks with china on development financing for renewable energy projects over its concerns about " the perpetuation of violence in tibet .

instead , they 're appealing to individual athletes to make political statements during the games themselves . observers in europe have reacted with both cynicism and dismay as the olympic flame makes its way across the globe , and government authorities do their best to silence critical voices on tibet .
for many journalists , the fact that the summer games in beijing are virtually assured of going ahead as planned reflects what they see as the general hypocrisy of the sporting event and the leadership of international olympic committee chairman jacques rogge .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the olympic ideals do n't always reflect ...
" figures like rogge probably would n't have a problem with staging the next olympic games in sudan , north korea or saudi arabia , " wrote the conservative vienna newspaper die presse .
" the main thing is that organizers promise to improve the human rights situation .
no one takes them at their word anyway . "
but few are advocating a major boycott of the games , as happened in moscow in 1980 and los angeles in 1984 .
indeed , some see hypocrisy on both sides .
" it 's said that the lessons from the nazi dictatorship -lsb- which staged the 1936 summer games -rsb- should not be forgotten , but history is not repeating itself , " wrote berlin 's tageszeitung newspaper .
" the people 's republic of china is not the third reich , and the chinese communist party is not the nsdap .
moreover , tibet is a country that did n't interest anyone in 1959 , when an uprising against chinese occupation was brutally suppressed . "
" the chinese can legitimately ask with what right the former colonial powers great britain and france were allowed to stage the games , despite hardly treating the people they colonized with kid gloves , " wrote the left-wing budapest daily nepszava .
" if china was stripped of the olympics , it would only strengthen the communist-nationalist hardliners and paralyze the slow , but still perceptible democratization of the country . "
conscience as a guide bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : protestors were arrested at the flame-lighting ceremony on march 24 olympic functionaries often vacillate between claiming that sports and politics should not be mixed , and that the olympic games represent positive political ideals .
european pundits hold out little hope that the contradictions can be resolved by a threat from the world 's large sporting nations to boycott the beijing event .
but they are encouraging athletes to make critical statements about china 's policies toward tibet .
" it 's a simple matter of civic courage , and athletes and sports functionaries should show it just like anyone else , " wrote the online edition of the german weekly magazine focus .
" the statutes of the ioc may prohibit political statements during the games .
that places responsibly on older athletes who want to end their sporting careers after the games anyway .
by taking courageous actions and accepting the subsequent bans from competition , they could crown their careers by doing something for a worthy cause . "
another commentator praised one olympic representative for having taken just such a political stand .
" there is already an exception , a woman chosen to carry the olympic torch , who has refused to participate in the lie of the political summer games , " wrote the vienna newspaper der standard .
" thailand 's narisa chakrabongse will not be receiving the olympic flame in bangkok in april .
it is her message to beijing . "
back to the roots ?
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : once again the games have been politicized some say that the only way to avoid the political controversies that seem to dog most olympic host cities would be to stage all future games in greece .
" only the establishment of a permanent facility for quadrennial use , built close to the original site in the peloponnese and paid for by sponsors and broadcasters , will avoid the kind of repellent situation we are seeing now , " wrote the guardian in britain .
given the amounts of money at play in one of the world 's highest-profile sporting events , that 's extremely unlikely to happen .
and it 's almost as far-fetched to believe that most countries would risk angering the leaders of the world 's most populous and fastest growing nation by boycotting the showcase games this summer in beijing . dw staff -lrb- jc -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

instead , they 're appealing to individual athletes to make political statements during the games themselves . observers in europe have reacted with both cynicism and dismay as the olympic flame makes its way across the globe , and government authorities do their best to silence critical voices on tibet .
for many journalists , the fact that the summer games in beijing are virtually assured of going ahead as planned reflects what they see as the general hypocrisy of the sporting event and the leadership of international olympic committee chairman jacques rogge .

" the main thing is that organizers promise to improve the human rights situation .
no one takes them at their word anyway . "
but few are advocating a major boycott of the games , as happened in moscow in 1980 and los angeles in 1984 .
indeed , some see hypocrisy on both sides .
" it 's said that the lessons from the nazi dictatorship -lsb- which staged the 1936 summer games -rsb- should not be forgotten , but history is not repeating itself , " wrote berlin 's tageszeitung newspaper .
" the people 's republic of china is not the third reich , and the chinese communist party is not the nsdap .
moreover , tibet is a country that did n't interest anyone in 1959 , when an uprising against chinese occupation was brutally suppressed . "
" the chinese can legitimately ask with what right the former colonial powers great britain and france were allowed to stage the games , despite hardly treating the people they colonized with kid gloves , " wrote the left-wing budapest daily nepszava .

conscience as a guide bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : protestors were arrested at the flame-lighting ceremony on march 24 olympic functionaries often vacillate between claiming that sports and politics should not be mixed , and that the olympic games represent positive political ideals .
european pundits hold out little hope that the contradictions can be resolved by a threat from the world 's large sporting nations to boycott the beijing event .
but they are encouraging athletes to make critical statements about china 's policies toward tibet .
" it 's a simple matter of civic courage , and athletes and sports functionaries should show it just like anyone else , " wrote the online edition of the german weekly magazine focus .
" the statutes of the ioc may prohibit political statements during the games .
that places responsibly on older athletes who want to end their sporting careers after the games anyway .
by taking courageous actions and accepting the subsequent bans from competition , they could crown their careers by doing something for a worthy cause . "
another commentator praised one olympic representative for having taken just such a political stand .
" there is already an exception , a woman chosen to carry the olympic torch , who has refused to participate in the lie of the political summer games , " wrote the vienna newspaper der standard .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de afghanistan -pipe- 25.03.2008 western aid failing to reach afghanistan , report says großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : afghanistan has been ravaged by war for years aid agencies said that up to $ 10 billion -lrb- 6.5 billion euros -rrb- , or 40 percent , of promised aid to afghanistan has not been delivered by the west .
germany and the eu , however , questioned the organizations ' calculations . aid agencies said that up to $ 10 billion -lrb- 6.5 billion euros -rrb- , or 40 percent , of promised aid to afghanistan has not been delivered by the west , and what does arrive bypasses the afghan government . western countries have failed to carry through on their pledges of aid to afghanistan , according to a report by the agency coordinating body for afghan relief -lrb- acbar -rrb- .
the umbrella group of non-governmental organizations which work in afghanistan said the international community had pledged $ 25 billion to afghanistan since 2001 , when the extremist taliban government was toppled , but that up to $ 10 billion had not reached the country . the us government - the biggest international donor to afghanistan - " has one of the biggest shortfalls , " providing only half of the $ 10.4 billion dollars of pledged money until 2008 , the report said . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : aid for development just a " fraction " of military expenditure the european commission and germany had delivered less than two-thirds of their respective $ 1.7 billion and $ 1.2 billion in commitments , acbar said . but a spokesperson for the german development ministry disputed that statement , saying that his country had paid up more than 90 percent of the money it had pledged between 2001 and 2006 . the european commission also rejected the allegations . " we are delivering - there is no delay , no backlog , no shortfall or lagging behind , " a spokeswoman for the european commission 's external-affairs chief in brussels said . exaggerated costs the report said the world bank had distributed just over half of its promised funds . furthermore , " just $ 15 billion in aid has so far been spent , of which it is estimated a staggering 40 percent has returned to donor countries in corporate profits and consultant salaries … vastly pushing up expenditures , " the report said . " for example , a road between the center of kabul and the international airport cost the united states more than $ 2.3 million per kilometer , at least four times the average cost of building a road in afghanistan . " many of the full-time expatriate consultants working for private companies in afghanistan receive $ 250,000 to $ 500,000 a year , including salary , allowances and other costs , the report said . a " fraction " spent on aid the report , entitled " falling short , " was written by the aid group oxfam for acbar .
acbar is made up of 94 agencies , including oxfam , christian aid , care , islamic relief and save the children . the group said that foreign money spent on aid , development and reconstruction is now just " a fraction " of military expenditures . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : afghanistan is the biggest producer of poppy-derived opium for heroin the us military alone spends some $ 100 million a day in fighting insurgents in afghanistan , but average spending on aid by all donors since 2001 has amounted to only $ 7 million daily . " given the links between development and security , the effectiveness of aid also has a major impact on peace and stability , " acbar said .
" yet thus far aid has been insufficient and in many cases wasteful and ineffective . " in addition , afghanistan received just $ 57 per capita in aid in the two years after international intervention in 2001 , compared to $ 679 a head in bosnia and $ 233 in east timor , acbar said . inefficiency and corruption are problematic some of the shortfalls , however , could be attributed to " challenging operating conditions , high levels of corruption and weak absorption capacities , " acbar noted . the group said this demonstrated the need for donors to solve such problems , adding that the weaknesses could be the reason that about two-thirds of foreign assistance bypassed the afghan government - undermining attempts to build effective state institutions . world bank country manager mariam sherman told afp news agency that its disbursal rate - estimated to be about 50 percent - was " actually very good . "
but she conceded that while the world bank channeled all its funds through the government budget , it was a problem that so much of it bypassed the administration . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : germany has more than 3,000 soldiers in afghanistan " to build a state and be accountable to its people , the government needs to have a say in resource allocation , " sherman told afp . extreme poverty prevails acbar stressed that despite the formation of the western-backed afghan government six years ago , the country still suffers from extreme poverty .
just 20 percent of the population has access to potable water ; only 5 percent has electricity . the group also drew attention to recent reports from the southern province of ghazni which said that residents in remote villages were eating grass to quell their hunger . acbar called on the international community to increase aid and ensure that it makes a lasting effect for the poorest afghans . " aid must address afghan needs , build local capacities and help afghans help themselves , " said matt waldman , afghanistan policy adviser at oxfam and the report 's author . dw staff -lrb- als -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de in focus : beijing 2008 : a question of human rights german olympics official : we 're not ignoring human rights beijing truths smothered in the smog of conflicting views amnesty international : china has made only minor progress china breaks promise of unfettered internet at olympics olympics -pipe- 25.03.2008 human rights abuses increase in china , olympic protester says großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : julliard being taken into police custody during the torch-lighting ceremony ongoing violence in tibet is another example of how china ignores human rights , reporters without borders told dw-world.de. the paris-based media group called for a boycott of the 2008 olympic opening ceremony . jean-francois julliard is the head of research at reporters without borders .
along with two colleagues , julliard was arrested on monday , march 24 at the official olympic torch-lighting ceremony in olympia , greece after unfurling a banner calling attention to the state of human rights in china . the three were arrested by greek police for holding banners featuring handcuffs in the shape of the olympic rings during a speech by liu qi , the president of the beijing olympics organizing committee . after being detained for 10 hours and charged with offending a national symbol , the three demonstrators were released on bail .
a trial is scheduled for may 29 .
julliard is now back in paris . dw-world.de : you were arrested yesterday for protesting at the olympic torch lighting ceremony .
what were you trying to bring attention to ? bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the olympic torch began its journey to china on monday jean-francois julliard : we did it because the situation of human rights and press freedom in china is getting worse .
chinese authorities made some promises when they were chosen to host the olympic games in 2001 and they have not respected any of them . there are more journalists and internet users detained now than there were in 2001 .
chinese authorities do not want to improve the situation of human rights before the olympic games . we have less than five months until the opening ceremony in beijing and we have to use this period to put pressure on chinese authorities and to raise the issue of human rights violations in china . does that mean your actions had nothing to do with the recent protests in tibet ? we planned this weeks ago .
so even if nothing had happened in tibet we would have still held the same demonstration .
the situation in tibet is just one more piece of evidence that chinese authorities are not ready to make any improvements , to let journalists walk freely in china or let the tibetan people demonstrate peacefully . you were arrested , charged and later released on bail by the greek authorities .
what were you were charged with ? bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : authorities said banners like this offend greek national symbols we were detained for 10 hours and then presented to a prosecutor .
we were charged with offending a national symbol because we used the olympic symbol on our flag .
this is why we have been charged according to greek penal code and we face one year prison terms and fines . of course , greece is a european union country so we can not imagine that we will be sentenced to prison terms because we demonstrated during the torch-lighting ceremony .
but there will be a trial late may .
we will go back to greece to attend the trial because we want to use it to once again raise the issue of the situation of human rights in china a few months before the olympics start . are you planning to attend the olympics ? we would like to very much but , no , we can not .
we tried to enter china in december .
we went to hong kong and asked for visas and we were denied .
so i think that we are blacklisted now in china . many people say that the olympics should be kept separate from politics .
what are your opinions on that issue ? bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : a boycott of the opening ceremony would send a strong signal to beijing it is a good thing that there is this debate and we think it is a positive step .
we think that the situation is going to change in the next few weeks .
the french president just said this morning -lsb- tuesday , march 25 -rsb- that every option is open .
so maybe he will agree to boycott the opening ceremony .
maybe he will just make a strong statement .
we do not know . you do not support a total boycott of the games but you do support a boycott of the opening ceremony ? we think that a total boycott would sanction the athletes and the competitors have no responsibility .
they are not the ones that decided to hold the olympic games in china so they should not be punished for that .
but we ask heads of state , heads of government , members of royal families not to attend the opening ceremony . it would be a very significant gesture to say to the chinese authorities that we are going to attend the olympic games , we are going to attend sport events , but we are not going to attend the political event which is the opening ceremony . do you think there is a danger this kind of political action will make china take an even harder line ? no , because the line can not get harder .
we waited for months before we did what we did .
we were patient .
we tried to have positive discussions with chinese authorities , but it was not successful , it was not useful at all .
so no , we could not wait any longer . are you planning any further protests ? i ca n't tell you now , but , of course , we plan to use the torch relay to do a lot .
the torch will cross through cities all over the world , and we hope there will be a lot of demonstrations .
the torch will be in london and paris over the next 10 days so maybe that will be our next step . interview : ole tangen jr . send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

he also said he was open to a thaw with britain . in a wide-ranging interview with britain 's financial times , dmitry medvedev said moscow did not approve of ex-soviet republics georgia and ukraine becoming nato members .
he also said he wanted to improve relations with britain and vowed to crack down on corruption and what he called russia 's " legal nihilism . " " we are not happy about the situation around georgia and ukraine , " he told the business daily ahead of a nato summit in the romanian capital bucharest next week .
" no state can be pleased about having representatives of a military bloc to which it does not belong coming close to its borders . " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : dmitry medvedev , russia 's president-elect medvedev , a 42-year-old former law professor , won a landslide victory in an election earlier this month as expected , and will succeed his political mentor , outgoing president vladimir putin , in may .
putin , however , will stay in the government as medvedev 's prime minister . at a nato summit next week , which putin will attend , georgia and ukraine are hoping to get approval from the western military alliance for its membership action plan -lrb- map -rrb- that would be seen as a signal that its application bid is on track . but the 26 nato members are split on whether to accept the two countries .
germany and france oppose the membership bids , fearful of increasing tensions with russia .
however , many of nato 's eastern european members are pushing for membership as soon as possible , saying it would increase security and reinforce democracy in both nations . us president george w. bush is due to travel to ukraine and croatia on the eve of the bucharest summit , according to the white house . russo-british thaw ? on relations with britain , which are at a post-cold war low after the murder of former russian spy alexander litvinenko in london in november 2006 , medvedev said , " we are open to the re-establishment of cooperation to the full extent .

the council suspended work in two regional offices in january because of what it called harassment by the russian authorities . " we can restore the whole specter of full bilateral cooperation , of course , without preliminary conditions , understanding the independence of each others ' positions , " medvedev said in the interview . rule of law more generally medvedev vowed to crack down on corruption .
upholding the rule of law was a huge challenge because of russians ' general attitude to the law , he said . " it is a monumental task ... russia is a country where people do n't like to observe the law , " he said .
" it is , as they say , a country of legal nihilism . " he touched upon a number of other issues , such as inflation , which he called " a fairly serious problem for the russian economy . "

germany and the eu , however , questioned the organizations ' calculations . aid agencies said that up to $ 10 billion -lrb- 6.5 billion euros -rrb- , or 40 percent , of promised aid to afghanistan has not been delivered by the west , and what does arrive bypasses the afghan government . western countries have failed to carry through on their pledges of aid to afghanistan , according to a report by the agency coordinating body for afghan relief -lrb- acbar -rrb- .
the umbrella group of non-governmental organizations which work in afghanistan said the international community had pledged $ 25 billion to afghanistan since 2001 , when the extremist taliban government was toppled , but that up to $ 10 billion had not reached the country . the us government - the biggest international donor to afghanistan - " has one of the biggest shortfalls , " providing only half of the $ 10.4 billion dollars of pledged money until 2008 , the report said . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : aid for development just a " fraction " of military expenditure the european commission and germany had delivered less than two-thirds of their respective $ 1.7 billion and $ 1.2 billion in commitments , acbar said . but a spokesperson for the german development ministry disputed that statement , saying that his country had paid up more than 90 percent of the money it had pledged between 2001 and 2006 . the european commission also rejected the allegations . " we are delivering - there is no delay , no backlog , no shortfall or lagging behind , " a spokeswoman for the european commission 's external-affairs chief in brussels said . exaggerated costs the report said the world bank had distributed just over half of its promised funds . furthermore , " just $ 15 billion in aid has so far been spent , of which it is estimated a staggering 40 percent has returned to donor countries in corporate profits and consultant salaries … vastly pushing up expenditures , " the report said . " for example , a road between the center of kabul and the international airport cost the united states more than $ 2.3 million per kilometer , at least four times the average cost of building a road in afghanistan . " many of the full-time expatriate consultants working for private companies in afghanistan receive $ 250,000 to $ 500,000 a year , including salary , allowances and other costs , the report said . a " fraction " spent on aid the report , entitled " falling short , " was written by the aid group oxfam for acbar .
acbar is made up of 94 agencies , including oxfam , christian aid , care , islamic relief and save the children . the group said that foreign money spent on aid , development and reconstruction is now just " a fraction " of military expenditures . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : afghanistan is the biggest producer of poppy-derived opium for heroin the us military alone spends some $ 100 million a day in fighting insurgents in afghanistan , but average spending on aid by all donors since 2001 has amounted to only $ 7 million daily . " given the links between development and security , the effectiveness of aid also has a major impact on peace and stability , " acbar said .
" yet thus far aid has been insufficient and in many cases wasteful and ineffective . " in addition , afghanistan received just $ 57 per capita in aid in the two years after international intervention in 2001 , compared to $ 679 a head in bosnia and $ 233 in east timor , acbar said . inefficiency and corruption are problematic some of the shortfalls , however , could be attributed to " challenging operating conditions , high levels of corruption and weak absorption capacities , " acbar noted . the group said this demonstrated the need for donors to solve such problems , adding that the weaknesses could be the reason that about two-thirds of foreign assistance bypassed the afghan government - undermining attempts to build effective state institutions . world bank country manager mariam sherman told afp news agency that its disbursal rate - estimated to be about 50 percent - was " actually very good . "
but she conceded that while the world bank channeled all its funds through the government budget , it was a problem that so much of it bypassed the administration . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : germany has more than 3,000 soldiers in afghanistan " to build a state and be accountable to its people , the government needs to have a say in resource allocation , " sherman told afp . extreme poverty prevails acbar stressed that despite the formation of the western-backed afghan government six years ago , the country still suffers from extreme poverty .
just 20 percent of the population has access to potable water ; only 5 percent has electricity . the group also drew attention to recent reports from the southern province of ghazni which said that residents in remote villages were eating grass to quell their hunger . acbar called on the international community to increase aid and ensure that it makes a lasting effect for the poorest afghans .

instead , they 're appealing to individual athletes to make political statements during the games themselves . observers in europe have reacted with both cynicism and dismay as the olympic flame makes its way across the globe , and government authorities do their best to silence critical voices on tibet .
for many journalists , the fact that the summer games in beijing are virtually assured of going ahead as planned reflects what they see as the general hypocrisy of the sporting event and the leadership of international olympic committee chairman jacques rogge .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the olympic ideals do n't always reflect ...
" figures like rogge probably would n't have a problem with staging the next olympic games in sudan , north korea or saudi arabia , " wrote the conservative vienna newspaper die presse .
" the main thing is that organizers promise to improve the human rights situation .
no one takes them at their word anyway . "
but few are advocating a major boycott of the games , as happened in moscow in 1980 and los angeles in 1984 .
indeed , some see hypocrisy on both sides .
" it 's said that the lessons from the nazi dictatorship -lsb- which staged the 1936 summer games -rsb- should not be forgotten , but history is not repeating itself , " wrote berlin 's tageszeitung newspaper .
" the people 's republic of china is not the third reich , and the chinese communist party is not the nsdap .
moreover , tibet is a country that did n't interest anyone in 1959 , when an uprising against chinese occupation was brutally suppressed . "
" the chinese can legitimately ask with what right the former colonial powers great britain and france were allowed to stage the games , despite hardly treating the people they colonized with kid gloves , " wrote the left-wing budapest daily nepszava .
" if china was stripped of the olympics , it would only strengthen the communist-nationalist hardliners and paralyze the slow , but still perceptible democratization of the country . "
conscience as a guide bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : protestors were arrested at the flame-lighting ceremony on march 24 olympic functionaries often vacillate between claiming that sports and politics should not be mixed , and that the olympic games represent positive political ideals .
european pundits hold out little hope that the contradictions can be resolved by a threat from the world 's large sporting nations to boycott the beijing event .
but they are encouraging athletes to make critical statements about china 's policies toward tibet .
" it 's a simple matter of civic courage , and athletes and sports functionaries should show it just like anyone else , " wrote the online edition of the german weekly magazine focus .
" the statutes of the ioc may prohibit political statements during the games .
that places responsibly on older athletes who want to end their sporting careers after the games anyway .
by taking courageous actions and accepting the subsequent bans from competition , they could crown their careers by doing something for a worthy cause . "
another commentator praised one olympic representative for having taken just such a political stand .
" there is already an exception , a woman chosen to carry the olympic torch , who has refused to participate in the lie of the political summer games , " wrote the vienna newspaper der standard .
" thailand 's narisa chakrabongse will not be receiving the olympic flame in bangkok in april .

instead , they 're appealing to individual athletes to make political statements during the games themselves . observers in europe have reacted with both cynicism and dismay as the olympic flame makes its way across the globe , and government authorities do their best to silence critical voices on tibet .
for many journalists , the fact that the summer games in beijing are virtually assured of going ahead as planned reflects what they see as the general hypocrisy of the sporting event and the leadership of international olympic committee chairman jacques rogge .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the olympic ideals do n't always reflect ...
" figures like rogge probably would n't have a problem with staging the next olympic games in sudan , north korea or saudi arabia , " wrote the conservative vienna newspaper die presse .
" the main thing is that organizers promise to improve the human rights situation .
no one takes them at their word anyway . "
but few are advocating a major boycott of the games , as happened in moscow in 1980 and los angeles in 1984 .
indeed , some see hypocrisy on both sides .
" it 's said that the lessons from the nazi dictatorship -lsb- which staged the 1936 summer games -rsb- should not be forgotten , but history is not repeating itself , " wrote berlin 's tageszeitung newspaper .
" the people 's republic of china is not the third reich , and the chinese communist party is not the nsdap .
moreover , tibet is a country that did n't interest anyone in 1959 , when an uprising against chinese occupation was brutally suppressed . "
" the chinese can legitimately ask with what right the former colonial powers great britain and france were allowed to stage the games , despite hardly treating the people they colonized with kid gloves , " wrote the left-wing budapest daily nepszava .
" if china was stripped of the olympics , it would only strengthen the communist-nationalist hardliners and paralyze the slow , but still perceptible democratization of the country . "
conscience as a guide bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : protestors were arrested at the flame-lighting ceremony on march 24 olympic functionaries often vacillate between claiming that sports and politics should not be mixed , and that the olympic games represent positive political ideals .
european pundits hold out little hope that the contradictions can be resolved by a threat from the world 's large sporting nations to boycott the beijing event .
but they are encouraging athletes to make critical statements about china 's policies toward tibet .
" it 's a simple matter of civic courage , and athletes and sports functionaries should show it just like anyone else , " wrote the online edition of the german weekly magazine focus .
" the statutes of the ioc may prohibit political statements during the games .
that places responsibly on older athletes who want to end their sporting careers after the games anyway .
by taking courageous actions and accepting the subsequent bans from competition , they could crown their careers by doing something for a worthy cause . "
another commentator praised one olympic representative for having taken just such a political stand .
" there is already an exception , a woman chosen to carry the olympic torch , who has refused to participate in the lie of the political summer games , " wrote the vienna newspaper der standard .
" thailand 's narisa chakrabongse will not be receiving the olympic flame in bangkok in april .
it is her message to beijing . "
back to the roots ?
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : once again the games have been politicized some say that the only way to avoid the political controversies that seem to dog most olympic host cities would be to stage all future games in greece .
" only the establishment of a permanent facility for quadrennial use , built close to the original site in the peloponnese and paid for by sponsors and broadcasters , will avoid the kind of repellent situation we are seeing now , " wrote the guardian in britain .
given the amounts of money at play in one of the world 's highest-profile sporting events , that 's extremely unlikely to happen .
and it 's almost as far-fetched to believe that most countries would risk angering the leaders of the world 's most populous and fastest growing nation by boycotting the showcase games this summer in beijing . dw staff -lrb- jc -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

nato mulls an eastward expansion ukraine hopes for bush 's support in nato bid abkhazia solution remains distant for europe , russia russia -pipe- 25.03.2008 incoming russian leader criticizes nato expansion großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : russia says new nato members at its border might endanger european security russia 's incoming president medvedev is " not happy " about possible nato membership for georgia and ukraine , according to comments published tuesday , march 25 .
he also said he was open to a thaw with britain . in a wide-ranging interview with britain 's financial times , dmitry medvedev said moscow did not approve of ex-soviet republics georgia and ukraine becoming nato members .
he also said he wanted to improve relations with britain and vowed to crack down on corruption and what he called russia 's " legal nihilism . " " we are not happy about the situation around georgia and ukraine , " he told the business daily ahead of a nato summit in the romanian capital bucharest next week .
" no state can be pleased about having representatives of a military bloc to which it does not belong coming close to its borders . " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : dmitry medvedev , russia 's president-elect medvedev , a 42-year-old former law professor , won a landslide victory in an election earlier this month as expected , and will succeed his political mentor , outgoing president vladimir putin , in may .
putin , however , will stay in the government as medvedev 's prime minister . at a nato summit next week , which putin will attend , georgia and ukraine are hoping to get approval from the western military alliance for its membership action plan -lrb- map -rrb- that would be seen as a signal that its application bid is on track . but the 26 nato members are split on whether to accept the two countries .
germany and france oppose the membership bids , fearful of increasing tensions with russia .
however , many of nato 's eastern european members are pushing for membership as soon as possible , saying it would increase security and reinforce democracy in both nations . us president george w. bush is due to travel to ukraine and croatia on the eve of the bucharest summit , according to the white house . russo-british thaw ? on relations with britain , which are at a post-cold war low after the murder of former russian spy alexander litvinenko in london in november 2006 , medvedev said , " we are open to the re-establishment of cooperation to the full extent . " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : alexander litvinenko london and moscow have traded sharp words since the litvinenko affair , expelled each others ' diplomats and cut back on cooperation between their intelligence services .
moscow refused to hand over a suspect of the 2006 murder . medvedev repeated accusations that the british council , a cultural body partly funded by the british foreign ministry , was engaged in spying in russia , the financial times said .
the council suspended work in two regional offices in january because of what it called harassment by the russian authorities . " we can restore the whole specter of full bilateral cooperation , of course , without preliminary conditions , understanding the independence of each others ' positions , " medvedev said in the interview . rule of law more generally medvedev vowed to crack down on corruption .
upholding the rule of law was a huge challenge because of russians ' general attitude to the law , he said . " it is a monumental task ... russia is a country where people do n't like to observe the law , " he said .
" it is , as they say , a country of legal nihilism . " he touched upon a number of other issues , such as inflation , which he called " a fairly serious problem for the russian economy . "
inflation in year-on-year terms is running at nearly 13 percent .
medvedev added , however , that russia would be able to ride out the turbulence on global markets . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : former yukos oil company ceo mikhail khodorkovsky seen behind bars at a courtroom questioned about mikhail khodorkovsky , the jailed former boss of oil group yukos , he said it was for the courts to decide whether he should remain imprisoned .

germany and the eu , however , questioned the organizations ' calculations . aid agencies said that up to $ 10 billion -lrb- 6.5 billion euros -rrb- , or 40 percent , of promised aid to afghanistan has not been delivered by the west , and what does arrive bypasses the afghan government . western countries have failed to carry through on their pledges of aid to afghanistan , according to a report by the agency coordinating body for afghan relief -lrb- acbar -rrb- .
the umbrella group of non-governmental organizations which work in afghanistan said the international community had pledged $ 25 billion to afghanistan since 2001 , when the extremist taliban government was toppled , but that up to $ 10 billion had not reached the country . the us government - the biggest international donor to afghanistan - " has one of the biggest shortfalls , " providing only half of the $ 10.4 billion dollars of pledged money until 2008 , the report said . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : aid for development just a " fraction " of military expenditure the european commission and germany had delivered less than two-thirds of their respective $ 1.7 billion and $ 1.2 billion in commitments , acbar said . but a spokesperson for the german development ministry disputed that statement , saying that his country had paid up more than 90 percent of the money it had pledged between 2001 and 2006 . the european commission also rejected the allegations . " we are delivering - there is no delay , no backlog , no shortfall or lagging behind , " a spokeswoman for the european commission 's external-affairs chief in brussels said . exaggerated costs the report said the world bank had distributed just over half of its promised funds . furthermore , " just $ 15 billion in aid has so far been spent , of which it is estimated a staggering 40 percent has returned to donor countries in corporate profits and consultant salaries … vastly pushing up expenditures , " the report said . " for example , a road between the center of kabul and the international airport cost the united states more than $ 2.3 million per kilometer , at least four times the average cost of building a road in afghanistan . " many of the full-time expatriate consultants working for private companies in afghanistan receive $ 250,000 to $ 500,000 a year , including salary , allowances and other costs , the report said . a " fraction " spent on aid the report , entitled " falling short , " was written by the aid group oxfam for acbar .
acbar is made up of 94 agencies , including oxfam , christian aid , care , islamic relief and save the children . the group said that foreign money spent on aid , development and reconstruction is now just " a fraction " of military expenditures . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : afghanistan is the biggest producer of poppy-derived opium for heroin the us military alone spends some $ 100 million a day in fighting insurgents in afghanistan , but average spending on aid by all donors since 2001 has amounted to only $ 7 million daily . " given the links between development and security , the effectiveness of aid also has a major impact on peace and stability , " acbar said .
" yet thus far aid has been insufficient and in many cases wasteful and ineffective . " in addition , afghanistan received just $ 57 per capita in aid in the two years after international intervention in 2001 , compared to $ 679 a head in bosnia and $ 233 in east timor , acbar said . inefficiency and corruption are problematic some of the shortfalls , however , could be attributed to " challenging operating conditions , high levels of corruption and weak absorption capacities , " acbar noted . the group said this demonstrated the need for donors to solve such problems , adding that the weaknesses could be the reason that about two-thirds of foreign assistance bypassed the afghan government - undermining attempts to build effective state institutions . world bank country manager mariam sherman told afp news agency that its disbursal rate - estimated to be about 50 percent - was " actually very good . "
but she conceded that while the world bank channeled all its funds through the government budget , it was a problem that so much of it bypassed the administration . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : germany has more than 3,000 soldiers in afghanistan " to build a state and be accountable to its people , the government needs to have a say in resource allocation , " sherman told afp . extreme poverty prevails acbar stressed that despite the formation of the western-backed afghan government six years ago , the country still suffers from extreme poverty .
just 20 percent of the population has access to potable water ; only 5 percent has electricity . the group also drew attention to recent reports from the southern province of ghazni which said that residents in remote villages were eating grass to quell their hunger . acbar called on the international community to increase aid and ensure that it makes a lasting effect for the poorest afghans . " aid must address afghan needs , build local capacities and help afghans help themselves , " said matt waldman , afghanistan policy adviser at oxfam and the report 's author . dw staff -lrb- als -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

or so one serious fare dodger seemed to think a man who just could n't stop himself from riding trains without buying a ticket will see the wrong side of a jail cell after fines and suspended sentences failed to put him on the straight and narrow . the 24-year-old will be celebrating his next birthday in the big house because of his predilection for hopping on german trains without paying his fare . his habit seemed to have gotten out of control .
from october 2006 to february 2007 , he was caught riding the train without a ticket102 times , often several times on the same day .
the court , fed up with imposing fines and suspended sentences , finally decided to get tough and gave him a 22-month holiday behind bars . throwing himself upon the mercy of the court was likely not an option this time .
it is not as if the man was riding ticketless due to a lack of financial means .
according to his own statement , he repeatedly dodged fares " pretty much out of boredom . " it 's likely he 'll learn the meaning of true boredom while doing time , when the highlight of his day will likely be marking another of his 669 days behind bars off his calendar . dw staff -lrb- jam -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de bundesliga -pipe- 25.03.2008 nuremberg 's fairy-tale season turns to nightmare großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : for jan koller and nuremberg , it 's been a season of grimaces so you want to take a promising team coming off a dream year and get it relegated ?
nuremberg has written a play book on how it 's done .
they 're teetering on the edge of the second division . last fall , no one expected nuremberg to be down at the bottom of table , battling it out with the likes of duisburg and cottbus .
the team , known as simply " the club " to german soccer fans , was coming off its 2007 victory in the german cup - its first major title in 39 years - and playing some of the most positive soccer in the bundesliga . fast forward to late march 2008 , and nuremberg find themselves in second-to-last in the standings and winless in their last nine matches .
the precipitous fall of one of last season 's overachievers is an object lesson in how not to build on success . lose focus on the league bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : coach von heesen has yet to record a win nuremberg 's german cup win not only meant a new addition to the club 's trophy case .
it also qualified them for the 2007-08 uefa cup . playing internationally is every team 's ultimate goal , but as so often is the case for smaller teams , the double burden of european and domestic contests has been anything but a blessing for nuremberg . the club performed quite well in the competition , reaching the knock-out round before losing a heartbreaking tie in late february to portuguese side , benfica lisbon , on two last-minute goals . but nuremberg 's relatively good uefa performances distracted players ' attention away from the fact that they had fallen into the relegation zone at home . " it started perhaps with a too-relaxed attitude at the start of the season , " nuremberg goalkeeper daniel klewer told dw 's bundesliga kick-off .
" we said to ourselves that we had the best team ever at nuremberg .
but hard work and constant concentration are part of the game , and we forgot that .
and at some point you 're left standing there and nothing works .
that 's our situation now . " with only four league victories to date , no squad in the bundesliga has won less often this season . have a lot of personality clashes bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the club is now chasing the rest of the league to their credit , nuremberg 's management tried to address their precipitous slide earlier in february .
unfortunately for them , they chose exactly the wrong route , replacing veteran coach hans meyer with thomas von heesen . the popular meyer was reportedly given the ax because of personality conflicts with nuremberg 's front office , in particular sport director martin bader .
indeed , this seems the only plausible explanation for a decision that , from a soccer perspective , is like a slumping sprinter chopping off one of his legs . the 65-year-old meyer from the communist former east germany not only led the club to its biggest triumph in almost four decades .
he also saved the team from relegation in 2005-06 , after having previously achieved comparable feats for moenchengladbach and hertha berlin . the 46-year-old von heesen , by contrast , has a relatively brief bundesliga resume , his only other top-flight coaching experience coming at lowly bielefeld . whatever van heesen 's merits as a tactician , he 's gotten off to the worst start ever of any nuremberg coach and has n't shown any signs of solving the team 's main problem . buy players who do n't fit bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : nuremberg expended huge energy on the uefa cup nuremberg have only scored 26 times in the league despite being among the bundesliga 's best at creating goal chances .
that would suggest that the team 's strikers are most at fault for its demise . but that 's not the whole story .

nuremberg has written a play book on how it 's done .
they 're teetering on the edge of the second division . last fall , no one expected nuremberg to be down at the bottom of table , battling it out with the likes of duisburg and cottbus .
the team , known as simply " the club " to german soccer fans , was coming off its 2007 victory in the german cup - its first major title in 39 years - and playing some of the most positive soccer in the bundesliga . fast forward to late march 2008 , and nuremberg find themselves in second-to-last in the standings and winless in their last nine matches .
the precipitous fall of one of last season 's overachievers is an object lesson in how not to build on success . lose focus on the league bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : coach von heesen has yet to record a win nuremberg 's german cup win not only meant a new addition to the club 's trophy case .
it also qualified them for the 2007-08 uefa cup . playing internationally is every team 's ultimate goal , but as so often is the case for smaller teams , the double burden of european and domestic contests has been anything but a blessing for nuremberg . the club performed quite well in the competition , reaching the knock-out round before losing a heartbreaking tie in late february to portuguese side , benfica lisbon , on two last-minute goals . but nuremberg 's relatively good uefa performances distracted players ' attention away from the fact that they had fallen into the relegation zone at home . " it started perhaps with a too-relaxed attitude at the start of the season , " nuremberg goalkeeper daniel klewer told dw 's bundesliga kick-off .
" we said to ourselves that we had the best team ever at nuremberg .
but hard work and constant concentration are part of the game , and we forgot that .
and at some point you 're left standing there and nothing works .
that 's our situation now . " with only four league victories to date , no squad in the bundesliga has won less often this season . have a lot of personality clashes bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the club is now chasing the rest of the league to their credit , nuremberg 's management tried to address their precipitous slide earlier in february .
unfortunately for them , they chose exactly the wrong route , replacing veteran coach hans meyer with thomas von heesen . the popular meyer was reportedly given the ax because of personality conflicts with nuremberg 's front office , in particular sport director martin bader .
indeed , this seems the only plausible explanation for a decision that , from a soccer perspective , is like a slumping sprinter chopping off one of his legs . the 65-year-old meyer from the communist former east germany not only led the club to its biggest triumph in almost four decades .
he also saved the team from relegation in 2005-06 , after having previously achieved comparable feats for moenchengladbach and hertha berlin . the 46-year-old von heesen , by contrast , has a relatively brief bundesliga resume , his only other top-flight coaching experience coming at lowly bielefeld . whatever van heesen 's merits as a tactician , he 's gotten off to the worst start ever of any nuremberg coach and has n't shown any signs of solving the team 's main problem . buy players who do n't fit bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : nuremberg expended huge energy on the uefa cup nuremberg have only scored 26 times in the league despite being among the bundesliga 's best at creating goal chances .
that would suggest that the team 's strikers are most at fault for its demise . but that 's not the whole story .
nuremberg signed two solid scorers after their german cup triumph - reigning european champion angelos charisteas of greece and czech jan koller , who notched up 59 goals in five seasons with borussia dortmund . the problem is that neither of these classic big center forwards fits the successful style of play nuremberg showed in 2006-07 , which emphasized quick combinations rather than long balls into the box . moreover , nuremberg 's inefficiency up front is compounded by shakiness at the back .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de in focus : beijing 2008 : a question of human rights german olympics official : we 're not ignoring human rights beijing truths smothered in the smog of conflicting views amnesty international : china has made only minor progress china breaks promise of unfettered internet at olympics olympics -pipe- 25.03.2008 human rights abuses increase in china , olympic protester says großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : julliard being taken into police custody during the torch-lighting ceremony ongoing violence in tibet is another example of how china ignores human rights , reporters without borders told dw-world.de. the paris-based media group called for a boycott of the 2008 olympic opening ceremony . jean-francois julliard is the head of research at reporters without borders .
along with two colleagues , julliard was arrested on monday , march 24 at the official olympic torch-lighting ceremony in olympia , greece after unfurling a banner calling attention to the state of human rights in china . the three were arrested by greek police for holding banners featuring handcuffs in the shape of the olympic rings during a speech by liu qi , the president of the beijing olympics organizing committee . after being detained for 10 hours and charged with offending a national symbol , the three demonstrators were released on bail .
a trial is scheduled for may 29 .
julliard is now back in paris . dw-world.de : you were arrested yesterday for protesting at the olympic torch lighting ceremony .
what were you trying to bring attention to ? bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the olympic torch began its journey to china on monday jean-francois julliard : we did it because the situation of human rights and press freedom in china is getting worse .
chinese authorities made some promises when they were chosen to host the olympic games in 2001 and they have not respected any of them . there are more journalists and internet users detained now than there were in 2001 .
chinese authorities do not want to improve the situation of human rights before the olympic games . we have less than five months until the opening ceremony in beijing and we have to use this period to put pressure on chinese authorities and to raise the issue of human rights violations in china . does that mean your actions had nothing to do with the recent protests in tibet ? we planned this weeks ago .
so even if nothing had happened in tibet we would have still held the same demonstration .
the situation in tibet is just one more piece of evidence that chinese authorities are not ready to make any improvements , to let journalists walk freely in china or let the tibetan people demonstrate peacefully . you were arrested , charged and later released on bail by the greek authorities .
what were you were charged with ? bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : authorities said banners like this offend greek national symbols we were detained for 10 hours and then presented to a prosecutor .
we were charged with offending a national symbol because we used the olympic symbol on our flag .
this is why we have been charged according to greek penal code and we face one year prison terms and fines . of course , greece is a european union country so we can not imagine that we will be sentenced to prison terms because we demonstrated during the torch-lighting ceremony .
but there will be a trial late may .
we will go back to greece to attend the trial because we want to use it to once again raise the issue of the situation of human rights in china a few months before the olympics start . are you planning to attend the olympics ? we would like to very much but , no , we can not .
we tried to enter china in december .
we went to hong kong and asked for visas and we were denied .
so i think that we are blacklisted now in china . many people say that the olympics should be kept separate from politics .
what are your opinions on that issue ? bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : a boycott of the opening ceremony would send a strong signal to beijing it is a good thing that there is this debate and we think it is a positive step .
we think that the situation is going to change in the next few weeks .
the french president just said this morning -lsb- tuesday , march 25 -rsb- that every option is open .
so maybe he will agree to boycott the opening ceremony .
maybe he will just make a strong statement .
we do not know . you do not support a total boycott of the games but you do support a boycott of the opening ceremony ? we think that a total boycott would sanction the athletes and the competitors have no responsibility .
they are not the ones that decided to hold the olympic games in china so they should not be punished for that .
but we ask heads of state , heads of government , members of royal families not to attend the opening ceremony . it would be a very significant gesture to say to the chinese authorities that we are going to attend the olympic games , we are going to attend sport events , but we are not going to attend the political event which is the opening ceremony . do you think there is a danger this kind of political action will make china take an even harder line ? no , because the line can not get harder .
we waited for months before we did what we did .
we were patient .
we tried to have positive discussions with chinese authorities , but it was not successful , it was not useful at all .
so no , we could not wait any longer . are you planning any further protests ? i ca n't tell you now , but , of course , we plan to use the torch relay to do a lot .
the torch will cross through cities all over the world , and we hope there will be a lot of demonstrations .
the torch will be in london and paris over the next 10 days so maybe that will be our next step . interview : ole tangen jr . send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de in focus : beijing 2008 : a question of human rights german olympics official : we 're not ignoring human rights beijing truths smothered in the smog of conflicting views amnesty international : china has made only minor progress china breaks promise of unfettered internet at olympics olympics -pipe- 25.03.2008 human rights abuses increase in china , olympic protester says großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : julliard being taken into police custody during the torch-lighting ceremony ongoing violence in tibet is another example of how china ignores human rights , reporters without borders told dw-world.de. the paris-based media group called for a boycott of the 2008 olympic opening ceremony . jean-francois julliard is the head of research at reporters without borders .
along with two colleagues , julliard was arrested on monday , march 24 at the official olympic torch-lighting ceremony in olympia , greece after unfurling a banner calling attention to the state of human rights in china . the three were arrested by greek police for holding banners featuring handcuffs in the shape of the olympic rings during a speech by liu qi , the president of the beijing olympics organizing committee . after being detained for 10 hours and charged with offending a national symbol , the three demonstrators were released on bail .
a trial is scheduled for may 29 .
julliard is now back in paris . dw-world.de : you were arrested yesterday for protesting at the olympic torch lighting ceremony .
what were you trying to bring attention to ? bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the olympic torch began its journey to china on monday jean-francois julliard : we did it because the situation of human rights and press freedom in china is getting worse .
chinese authorities made some promises when they were chosen to host the olympic games in 2001 and they have not respected any of them . there are more journalists and internet users detained now than there were in 2001 .
chinese authorities do not want to improve the situation of human rights before the olympic games . we have less than five months until the opening ceremony in beijing and we have to use this period to put pressure on chinese authorities and to raise the issue of human rights violations in china . does that mean your actions had nothing to do with the recent protests in tibet ? we planned this weeks ago .
so even if nothing had happened in tibet we would have still held the same demonstration .
the situation in tibet is just one more piece of evidence that chinese authorities are not ready to make any improvements , to let journalists walk freely in china or let the tibetan people demonstrate peacefully . you were arrested , charged and later released on bail by the greek authorities .
what were you were charged with ? bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : authorities said banners like this offend greek national symbols we were detained for 10 hours and then presented to a prosecutor .
we were charged with offending a national symbol because we used the olympic symbol on our flag .
this is why we have been charged according to greek penal code and we face one year prison terms and fines . of course , greece is a european union country so we can not imagine that we will be sentenced to prison terms because we demonstrated during the torch-lighting ceremony .
but there will be a trial late may .
we will go back to greece to attend the trial because we want to use it to once again raise the issue of the situation of human rights in china a few months before the olympics start . are you planning to attend the olympics ? we would like to very much but , no , we can not .
we tried to enter china in december .
we went to hong kong and asked for visas and we were denied .
so i think that we are blacklisted now in china . many people say that the olympics should be kept separate from politics .
what are your opinions on that issue ? bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : a boycott of the opening ceremony would send a strong signal to beijing it is a good thing that there is this debate and we think it is a positive step .
we think that the situation is going to change in the next few weeks .
the french president just said this morning -lsb- tuesday , march 25 -rsb- that every option is open .
so maybe he will agree to boycott the opening ceremony .
maybe he will just make a strong statement .
we do not know . you do not support a total boycott of the games but you do support a boycott of the opening ceremony ? we think that a total boycott would sanction the athletes and the competitors have no responsibility .
they are not the ones that decided to hold the olympic games in china so they should not be punished for that .
but we ask heads of state , heads of government , members of royal families not to attend the opening ceremony . it would be a very significant gesture to say to the chinese authorities that we are going to attend the olympic games , we are going to attend sport events , but we are not going to attend the political event which is the opening ceremony . do you think there is a danger this kind of political action will make china take an even harder line ? no , because the line can not get harder .
we waited for months before we did what we did .
we were patient .
we tried to have positive discussions with chinese authorities , but it was not successful , it was not useful at all .
so no , we could not wait any longer . are you planning any further protests ? i ca n't tell you now , but , of course , we plan to use the torch relay to do a lot .
the torch will cross through cities all over the world , and we hope there will be a lot of demonstrations .
the torch will be in london and paris over the next 10 days so maybe that will be our next step . interview : ole tangen jr . send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

or so one serious fare dodger seemed to think a man who just could n't stop himself from riding trains without buying a ticket will see the wrong side of a jail cell after fines and suspended sentences failed to put him on the straight and narrow . the 24-year-old will be celebrating his next birthday in the big house because of his predilection for hopping on german trains without paying his fare . his habit seemed to have gotten out of control .
from october 2006 to february 2007 , he was caught riding the train without a ticket102 times , often several times on the same day .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de in focus : beijing 2008 : a question of human rights german olympics official : we 're not ignoring human rights beijing truths smothered in the smog of conflicting views amnesty international : china has made only minor progress china breaks promise of unfettered internet at olympics olympics -pipe- 25.03.2008 human rights abuses increase in china , olympic protester says großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : julliard being taken into police custody during the torch-lighting ceremony ongoing violence in tibet is another example of how china ignores human rights , reporters without borders told dw-world.de. the paris-based media group called for a boycott of the 2008 olympic opening ceremony . jean-francois julliard is the head of research at reporters without borders .
along with two colleagues , julliard was arrested on monday , march 24 at the official olympic torch-lighting ceremony in olympia , greece after unfurling a banner calling attention to the state of human rights in china . the three were arrested by greek police for holding banners featuring handcuffs in the shape of the olympic rings during a speech by liu qi , the president of the beijing olympics organizing committee . after being detained for 10 hours and charged with offending a national symbol , the three demonstrators were released on bail .
a trial is scheduled for may 29 .
julliard is now back in paris . dw-world.de : you were arrested yesterday for protesting at the olympic torch lighting ceremony .
what were you trying to bring attention to ? bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the olympic torch began its journey to china on monday jean-francois julliard : we did it because the situation of human rights and press freedom in china is getting worse .
chinese authorities made some promises when they were chosen to host the olympic games in 2001 and they have not respected any of them . there are more journalists and internet users detained now than there were in 2001 .
chinese authorities do not want to improve the situation of human rights before the olympic games . we have less than five months until the opening ceremony in beijing and we have to use this period to put pressure on chinese authorities and to raise the issue of human rights violations in china . does that mean your actions had nothing to do with the recent protests in tibet ? we planned this weeks ago .
so even if nothing had happened in tibet we would have still held the same demonstration .
the situation in tibet is just one more piece of evidence that chinese authorities are not ready to make any improvements , to let journalists walk freely in china or let the tibetan people demonstrate peacefully . you were arrested , charged and later released on bail by the greek authorities .
what were you were charged with ? bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : authorities said banners like this offend greek national symbols we were detained for 10 hours and then presented to a prosecutor .
we were charged with offending a national symbol because we used the olympic symbol on our flag .
this is why we have been charged according to greek penal code and we face one year prison terms and fines . of course , greece is a european union country so we can not imagine that we will be sentenced to prison terms because we demonstrated during the torch-lighting ceremony .
but there will be a trial late may .
we will go back to greece to attend the trial because we want to use it to once again raise the issue of the situation of human rights in china a few months before the olympics start . are you planning to attend the olympics ? we would like to very much but , no , we can not .
we tried to enter china in december .
we went to hong kong and asked for visas and we were denied .
so i think that we are blacklisted now in china . many people say that the olympics should be kept separate from politics .
what are your opinions on that issue ? bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : a boycott of the opening ceremony would send a strong signal to beijing it is a good thing that there is this debate and we think it is a positive step .
we think that the situation is going to change in the next few weeks .
the french president just said this morning -lsb- tuesday , march 25 -rsb- that every option is open .
so maybe he will agree to boycott the opening ceremony .
maybe he will just make a strong statement .
we do not know . you do not support a total boycott of the games but you do support a boycott of the opening ceremony ? we think that a total boycott would sanction the athletes and the competitors have no responsibility .
they are not the ones that decided to hold the olympic games in china so they should not be punished for that .
but we ask heads of state , heads of government , members of royal families not to attend the opening ceremony . it would be a very significant gesture to say to the chinese authorities that we are going to attend the olympic games , we are going to attend sport events , but we are not going to attend the political event which is the opening ceremony . do you think there is a danger this kind of political action will make china take an even harder line ? no , because the line can not get harder .
we waited for months before we did what we did .
we were patient .
we tried to have positive discussions with chinese authorities , but it was not successful , it was not useful at all .
so no , we could not wait any longer . are you planning any further protests ? i ca n't tell you now , but , of course , we plan to use the torch relay to do a lot .
the torch will cross through cities all over the world , and we hope there will be a lot of demonstrations .
the torch will be in london and paris over the next 10 days so maybe that will be our next step . interview : ole tangen jr . send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

or so one serious fare dodger seemed to think a man who just could n't stop himself from riding trains without buying a ticket will see the wrong side of a jail cell after fines and suspended sentences failed to put him on the straight and narrow . the 24-year-old will be celebrating his next birthday in the big house because of his predilection for hopping on german trains without paying his fare . his habit seemed to have gotten out of control .
from october 2006 to february 2007 , he was caught riding the train without a ticket102 times , often several times on the same day .
the court , fed up with imposing fines and suspended sentences , finally decided to get tough and gave him a 22-month holiday behind bars . throwing himself upon the mercy of the court was likely not an option this time .
it is not as if the man was riding ticketless due to a lack of financial means .
according to his own statement , he repeatedly dodged fares " pretty much out of boredom . " it 's likely he 'll learn the meaning of true boredom while doing time , when the highlight of his day will likely be marking another of his 669 days behind bars off his calendar . dw staff -lrb- jam -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

germany and the eu , however , questioned the organizations ' calculations . aid agencies said that up to $ 10 billion -lrb- 6.5 billion euros -rrb- , or 40 percent , of promised aid to afghanistan has not been delivered by the west , and what does arrive bypasses the afghan government . western countries have failed to carry through on their pledges of aid to afghanistan , according to a report by the agency coordinating body for afghan relief -lrb- acbar -rrb- .
the umbrella group of non-governmental organizations which work in afghanistan said the international community had pledged $ 25 billion to afghanistan since 2001 , when the extremist taliban government was toppled , but that up to $ 10 billion had not reached the country . the us government - the biggest international donor to afghanistan - " has one of the biggest shortfalls , " providing only half of the $ 10.4 billion dollars of pledged money until 2008 , the report said . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : aid for development just a " fraction " of military expenditure the european commission and germany had delivered less than two-thirds of their respective $ 1.7 billion and $ 1.2 billion in commitments , acbar said . but a spokesperson for the german development ministry disputed that statement , saying that his country had paid up more than 90 percent of the money it had pledged between 2001 and 2006 . the european commission also rejected the allegations . " we are delivering - there is no delay , no backlog , no shortfall or lagging behind , " a spokeswoman for the european commission 's external-affairs chief in brussels said . exaggerated costs the report said the world bank had distributed just over half of its promised funds . furthermore , " just $ 15 billion in aid has so far been spent , of which it is estimated a staggering 40 percent has returned to donor countries in corporate profits and consultant salaries … vastly pushing up expenditures , " the report said . " for example , a road between the center of kabul and the international airport cost the united states more than $ 2.3 million per kilometer , at least four times the average cost of building a road in afghanistan . " many of the full-time expatriate consultants working for private companies in afghanistan receive $ 250,000 to $ 500,000 a year , including salary , allowances and other costs , the report said . a " fraction " spent on aid the report , entitled " falling short , " was written by the aid group oxfam for acbar .
acbar is made up of 94 agencies , including oxfam , christian aid , care , islamic relief and save the children . the group said that foreign money spent on aid , development and reconstruction is now just " a fraction " of military expenditures . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : afghanistan is the biggest producer of poppy-derived opium for heroin the us military alone spends some $ 100 million a day in fighting insurgents in afghanistan , but average spending on aid by all donors since 2001 has amounted to only $ 7 million daily . " given the links between development and security , the effectiveness of aid also has a major impact on peace and stability , " acbar said .
" yet thus far aid has been insufficient and in many cases wasteful and ineffective . " in addition , afghanistan received just $ 57 per capita in aid in the two years after international intervention in 2001 , compared to $ 679 a head in bosnia and $ 233 in east timor , acbar said . inefficiency and corruption are problematic some of the shortfalls , however , could be attributed to " challenging operating conditions , high levels of corruption and weak absorption capacities , " acbar noted . the group said this demonstrated the need for donors to solve such problems , adding that the weaknesses could be the reason that about two-thirds of foreign assistance bypassed the afghan government - undermining attempts to build effective state institutions . world bank country manager mariam sherman told afp news agency that its disbursal rate - estimated to be about 50 percent - was " actually very good . "
but she conceded that while the world bank channeled all its funds through the government budget , it was a problem that so much of it bypassed the administration . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : germany has more than 3,000 soldiers in afghanistan " to build a state and be accountable to its people , the government needs to have a say in resource allocation , " sherman told afp . extreme poverty prevails acbar stressed that despite the formation of the western-backed afghan government six years ago , the country still suffers from extreme poverty .
just 20 percent of the population has access to potable water ; only 5 percent has electricity . the group also drew attention to recent reports from the southern province of ghazni which said that residents in remote villages were eating grass to quell their hunger . acbar called on the international community to increase aid and ensure that it makes a lasting effect for the poorest afghans .

he is no longer a member of the national team .

or so one serious fare dodger seemed to think a man who just could n't stop himself from riding trains without buying a ticket will see the wrong side of a jail cell after fines and suspended sentences failed to put him on the straight and narrow . the 24-year-old will be celebrating his next birthday in the big house because of his predilection for hopping on german trains without paying his fare . his habit seemed to have gotten out of control .
from october 2006 to february 2007 , he was caught riding the train without a ticket102 times , often several times on the same day .
the court , fed up with imposing fines and suspended sentences , finally decided to get tough and gave him a 22-month holiday behind bars . throwing himself upon the mercy of the court was likely not an option this time .
it is not as if the man was riding ticketless due to a lack of financial means .
according to his own statement , he repeatedly dodged fares " pretty much out of boredom . " it 's likely he 'll learn the meaning of true boredom while doing time , when the highlight of his day will likely be marking another of his 669 days behind bars off his calendar . dw staff -lrb- jam -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

now the international community - and dw readers - are deliberating what should be done next . the following comments reflect the views of dw-world.de readers .
not all reader comments have been published .
dw-world.de reserves the right to edit for length and appropriateness of content . it is absolute necessary that germany let the chinese government know that its position and that the action in tibet is totally unacceptable .
chancellor merkel is on the right course . - guenther wirth , somalia of course the international community could do more about china , and i think they should be doing more .
it is fear of economic reprisal or loss of economic opportunity with china that creates the inertia and inaction .
i do n't believe that the athletes should boycott the olympic games .
but i do believe that a boycott of the opening ceremony by dignitaries , government representatives , vip 's and corporate executives should happen . - beren molony , australia the beijing olympics should be collectively boycotted , period .
the chinese government is comprised of hardcore communists , disallowing human rights and personal freedoms , yet they enjoy all the financial accolades of a free enterprise market .
china not only oppresses the people of tibet , but its very own citizens .
i for one will refuse to watch the beijing olympics when they are on tv . - eric weiss , us bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : protests supporting tibet do n't look like they will be stopping soon the german government should and must take a tougher stance but it wo n't do that because china is the " market of the future . "
money plays the most important role in this game .
it is the only medium that is of great significance . - walter roos , germany given that very few eu citizens will be in beijing for the olympics , eu citizens can simply change their television channels during the olympics in order to have a big impact on media and advertising revenues .
how hard would that be to show our commitment to the tibetans ?
i , for one , will . - charles smyth , great britain tibet is a separate culture with a long-established society separate from china .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de in focus : beijing 2008 : a question of human rights german olympics official : we 're not ignoring human rights beijing truths smothered in the smog of conflicting views amnesty international : china has made only minor progress china breaks promise of unfettered internet at olympics olympics -pipe- 25.03.2008 human rights abuses increase in china , olympic protester says großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : julliard being taken into police custody during the torch-lighting ceremony ongoing violence in tibet is another example of how china ignores human rights , reporters without borders told dw-world.de. the paris-based media group called for a boycott of the 2008 olympic opening ceremony . jean-francois julliard is the head of research at reporters without borders .
along with two colleagues , julliard was arrested on monday , march 24 at the official olympic torch-lighting ceremony in olympia , greece after unfurling a banner calling attention to the state of human rights in china . the three were arrested by greek police for holding banners featuring handcuffs in the shape of the olympic rings during a speech by liu qi , the president of the beijing olympics organizing committee . after being detained for 10 hours and charged with offending a national symbol , the three demonstrators were released on bail .
a trial is scheduled for may 29 .
julliard is now back in paris . dw-world.de : you were arrested yesterday for protesting at the olympic torch lighting ceremony .
what were you trying to bring attention to ? bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the olympic torch began its journey to china on monday jean-francois julliard : we did it because the situation of human rights and press freedom in china is getting worse .
chinese authorities made some promises when they were chosen to host the olympic games in 2001 and they have not respected any of them . there are more journalists and internet users detained now than there were in 2001 .
chinese authorities do not want to improve the situation of human rights before the olympic games . we have less than five months until the opening ceremony in beijing and we have to use this period to put pressure on chinese authorities and to raise the issue of human rights violations in china . does that mean your actions had nothing to do with the recent protests in tibet ? we planned this weeks ago .
so even if nothing had happened in tibet we would have still held the same demonstration .
the situation in tibet is just one more piece of evidence that chinese authorities are not ready to make any improvements , to let journalists walk freely in china or let the tibetan people demonstrate peacefully . you were arrested , charged and later released on bail by the greek authorities .
what were you were charged with ? bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : authorities said banners like this offend greek national symbols we were detained for 10 hours and then presented to a prosecutor .
we were charged with offending a national symbol because we used the olympic symbol on our flag .
this is why we have been charged according to greek penal code and we face one year prison terms and fines . of course , greece is a european union country so we can not imagine that we will be sentenced to prison terms because we demonstrated during the torch-lighting ceremony .
but there will be a trial late may .
we will go back to greece to attend the trial because we want to use it to once again raise the issue of the situation of human rights in china a few months before the olympics start . are you planning to attend the olympics ? we would like to very much but , no , we can not .
we tried to enter china in december .
we went to hong kong and asked for visas and we were denied .
so i think that we are blacklisted now in china . many people say that the olympics should be kept separate from politics .
what are your opinions on that issue ? bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : a boycott of the opening ceremony would send a strong signal to beijing it is a good thing that there is this debate and we think it is a positive step .
we think that the situation is going to change in the next few weeks .
the french president just said this morning -lsb- tuesday , march 25 -rsb- that every option is open .
so maybe he will agree to boycott the opening ceremony .
maybe he will just make a strong statement .
we do not know . you do not support a total boycott of the games but you do support a boycott of the opening ceremony ? we think that a total boycott would sanction the athletes and the competitors have no responsibility .
they are not the ones that decided to hold the olympic games in china so they should not be punished for that .
but we ask heads of state , heads of government , members of royal families not to attend the opening ceremony . it would be a very significant gesture to say to the chinese authorities that we are going to attend the olympic games , we are going to attend sport events , but we are not going to attend the political event which is the opening ceremony . do you think there is a danger this kind of political action will make china take an even harder line ? no , because the line can not get harder .
we waited for months before we did what we did .
we were patient .
we tried to have positive discussions with chinese authorities , but it was not successful , it was not useful at all .
so no , we could not wait any longer . are you planning any further protests ? i ca n't tell you now , but , of course , we plan to use the torch relay to do a lot .
the torch will cross through cities all over the world , and we hope there will be a lot of demonstrations .
the torch will be in london and paris over the next 10 days so maybe that will be our next step . interview : ole tangen jr . send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

or so one serious fare dodger seemed to think a man who just could n't stop himself from riding trains without buying a ticket will see the wrong side of a jail cell after fines and suspended sentences failed to put him on the straight and narrow . the 24-year-old will be celebrating his next birthday in the big house because of his predilection for hopping on german trains without paying his fare . his habit seemed to have gotten out of control .
from october 2006 to february 2007 , he was caught riding the train without a ticket102 times , often several times on the same day .
the court , fed up with imposing fines and suspended sentences , finally decided to get tough and gave him a 22-month holiday behind bars . throwing himself upon the mercy of the court was likely not an option this time .
it is not as if the man was riding ticketless due to a lack of financial means .
according to his own statement , he repeatedly dodged fares " pretty much out of boredom . " it 's likely he 'll learn the meaning of true boredom while doing time , when the highlight of his day will likely be marking another of his 669 days behind bars off his calendar . dw staff -lrb- jam -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

along with two colleagues , julliard was arrested on monday , march 24 at the official olympic torch-lighting ceremony in olympia , greece after unfurling a banner calling attention to the state of human rights in china . the three were arrested by greek police for holding banners featuring handcuffs in the shape of the olympic rings during a speech by liu qi , the president of the beijing olympics organizing committee . after being detained for 10 hours and charged with offending a national symbol , the three demonstrators were released on bail .
a trial is scheduled for may 29 .
julliard is now back in paris . dw-world.de : you were arrested yesterday for protesting at the olympic torch lighting ceremony .
what were you trying to bring attention to ? bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the olympic torch began its journey to china on monday jean-francois julliard : we did it because the situation of human rights and press freedom in china is getting worse .
chinese authorities made some promises when they were chosen to host the olympic games in 2001 and they have not respected any of them . there are more journalists and internet users detained now than there were in 2001 .
chinese authorities do not want to improve the situation of human rights before the olympic games . we have less than five months until the opening ceremony in beijing and we have to use this period to put pressure on chinese authorities and to raise the issue of human rights violations in china . does that mean your actions had nothing to do with the recent protests in tibet ? we planned this weeks ago .
so even if nothing had happened in tibet we would have still held the same demonstration .
the situation in tibet is just one more piece of evidence that chinese authorities are not ready to make any improvements , to let journalists walk freely in china or let the tibetan people demonstrate peacefully . you were arrested , charged and later released on bail by the greek authorities .
what were you were charged with ? bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : authorities said banners like this offend greek national symbols we were detained for 10 hours and then presented to a prosecutor .
we were charged with offending a national symbol because we used the olympic symbol on our flag .
this is why we have been charged according to greek penal code and we face one year prison terms and fines . of course , greece is a european union country so we can not imagine that we will be sentenced to prison terms because we demonstrated during the torch-lighting ceremony .
but there will be a trial late may .
we will go back to greece to attend the trial because we want to use it to once again raise the issue of the situation of human rights in china a few months before the olympics start . are you planning to attend the olympics ? we would like to very much but , no , we can not .
we tried to enter china in december .
we went to hong kong and asked for visas and we were denied .
so i think that we are blacklisted now in china . many people say that the olympics should be kept separate from politics .
what are your opinions on that issue ? bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : a boycott of the opening ceremony would send a strong signal to beijing it is a good thing that there is this debate and we think it is a positive step .
we think that the situation is going to change in the next few weeks .
the french president just said this morning -lsb- tuesday , march 25 -rsb- that every option is open .
so maybe he will agree to boycott the opening ceremony .
maybe he will just make a strong statement .
we do not know . you do not support a total boycott of the games but you do support a boycott of the opening ceremony ? we think that a total boycott would sanction the athletes and the competitors have no responsibility .
they are not the ones that decided to hold the olympic games in china so they should not be punished for that .
but we ask heads of state , heads of government , members of royal families not to attend the opening ceremony . it would be a very significant gesture to say to the chinese authorities that we are going to attend the olympic games , we are going to attend sport events , but we are not going to attend the political event which is the opening ceremony . do you think there is a danger this kind of political action will make china take an even harder line ? no , because the line can not get harder .
we waited for months before we did what we did .
we were patient .
we tried to have positive discussions with chinese authorities , but it was not successful , it was not useful at all .
so no , we could not wait any longer . are you planning any further protests ? i ca n't tell you now , but , of course , we plan to use the torch relay to do a lot .
the torch will cross through cities all over the world , and we hope there will be a lot of demonstrations .
the torch will be in london and paris over the next 10 days so maybe that will be our next step . interview : ole tangen jr . send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

he also said he was open to a thaw with britain . in a wide-ranging interview with britain 's financial times , dmitry medvedev said moscow did not approve of ex-soviet republics georgia and ukraine becoming nato members .
he also said he wanted to improve relations with britain and vowed to crack down on corruption and what he called russia 's " legal nihilism . " " we are not happy about the situation around georgia and ukraine , " he told the business daily ahead of a nato summit in the romanian capital bucharest next week .
" no state can be pleased about having representatives of a military bloc to which it does not belong coming close to its borders . " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : dmitry medvedev , russia 's president-elect medvedev , a 42-year-old former law professor , won a landslide victory in an election earlier this month as expected , and will succeed his political mentor , outgoing president vladimir putin , in may .
putin , however , will stay in the government as medvedev 's prime minister . at a nato summit next week , which putin will attend , georgia and ukraine are hoping to get approval from the western military alliance for its membership action plan -lrb- map -rrb- that would be seen as a signal that its application bid is on track . but the 26 nato members are split on whether to accept the two countries .
germany and france oppose the membership bids , fearful of increasing tensions with russia .
however , many of nato 's eastern european members are pushing for membership as soon as possible , saying it would increase security and reinforce democracy in both nations . us president george w. bush is due to travel to ukraine and croatia on the eve of the bucharest summit , according to the white house . russo-british thaw ? on relations with britain , which are at a post-cold war low after the murder of former russian spy alexander litvinenko in london in november 2006 , medvedev said , " we are open to the re-establishment of cooperation to the full extent . " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : alexander litvinenko london and moscow have traded sharp words since the litvinenko affair , expelled each others ' diplomats and cut back on cooperation between their intelligence services .
moscow refused to hand over a suspect of the 2006 murder . medvedev repeated accusations that the british council , a cultural body partly funded by the british foreign ministry , was engaged in spying in russia , the financial times said .
the council suspended work in two regional offices in january because of what it called harassment by the russian authorities . " we can restore the whole specter of full bilateral cooperation , of course , without preliminary conditions , understanding the independence of each others ' positions , " medvedev said in the interview . rule of law more generally medvedev vowed to crack down on corruption .
upholding the rule of law was a huge challenge because of russians ' general attitude to the law , he said . " it is a monumental task ... russia is a country where people do n't like to observe the law , " he said .
" it is , as they say , a country of legal nihilism . " he touched upon a number of other issues , such as inflation , which he called " a fairly serious problem for the russian economy . "
inflation in year-on-year terms is running at nearly 13 percent .
medvedev added , however , that russia would be able to ride out the turbulence on global markets . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : former yukos oil company ceo mikhail khodorkovsky seen behind bars at a courtroom questioned about mikhail khodorkovsky , the jailed former boss of oil group yukos , he said it was for the courts to decide whether he should remain imprisoned .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de in focus : beijing 2008 : a question of human rights german olympics official : we 're not ignoring human rights beijing truths smothered in the smog of conflicting views amnesty international : china has made only minor progress china breaks promise of unfettered internet at olympics olympics -pipe- 25.03.2008 human rights abuses increase in china , olympic protester says großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : julliard being taken into police custody during the torch-lighting ceremony ongoing violence in tibet is another example of how china ignores human rights , reporters without borders told dw-world.de. the paris-based media group called for a boycott of the 2008 olympic opening ceremony . jean-francois julliard is the head of research at reporters without borders .
along with two colleagues , julliard was arrested on monday , march 24 at the official olympic torch-lighting ceremony in olympia , greece after unfurling a banner calling attention to the state of human rights in china . the three were arrested by greek police for holding banners featuring handcuffs in the shape of the olympic rings during a speech by liu qi , the president of the beijing olympics organizing committee . after being detained for 10 hours and charged with offending a national symbol , the three demonstrators were released on bail .
a trial is scheduled for may 29 .
julliard is now back in paris . dw-world.de : you were arrested yesterday for protesting at the olympic torch lighting ceremony .
what were you trying to bring attention to ? bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the olympic torch began its journey to china on monday jean-francois julliard : we did it because the situation of human rights and press freedom in china is getting worse .
chinese authorities made some promises when they were chosen to host the olympic games in 2001 and they have not respected any of them . there are more journalists and internet users detained now than there were in 2001 .
chinese authorities do not want to improve the situation of human rights before the olympic games . we have less than five months until the opening ceremony in beijing and we have to use this period to put pressure on chinese authorities and to raise the issue of human rights violations in china . does that mean your actions had nothing to do with the recent protests in tibet ? we planned this weeks ago .
so even if nothing had happened in tibet we would have still held the same demonstration .
the situation in tibet is just one more piece of evidence that chinese authorities are not ready to make any improvements , to let journalists walk freely in china or let the tibetan people demonstrate peacefully . you were arrested , charged and later released on bail by the greek authorities .
what were you were charged with ? bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : authorities said banners like this offend greek national symbols we were detained for 10 hours and then presented to a prosecutor .
we were charged with offending a national symbol because we used the olympic symbol on our flag .
this is why we have been charged according to greek penal code and we face one year prison terms and fines . of course , greece is a european union country so we can not imagine that we will be sentenced to prison terms because we demonstrated during the torch-lighting ceremony .
but there will be a trial late may .
we will go back to greece to attend the trial because we want to use it to once again raise the issue of the situation of human rights in china a few months before the olympics start . are you planning to attend the olympics ? we would like to very much but , no , we can not .
we tried to enter china in december .
we went to hong kong and asked for visas and we were denied .
so i think that we are blacklisted now in china . many people say that the olympics should be kept separate from politics .
what are your opinions on that issue ? bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : a boycott of the opening ceremony would send a strong signal to beijing it is a good thing that there is this debate and we think it is a positive step .
we think that the situation is going to change in the next few weeks .
the french president just said this morning -lsb- tuesday , march 25 -rsb- that every option is open .
so maybe he will agree to boycott the opening ceremony .
maybe he will just make a strong statement .
we do not know . you do not support a total boycott of the games but you do support a boycott of the opening ceremony ? we think that a total boycott would sanction the athletes and the competitors have no responsibility .
they are not the ones that decided to hold the olympic games in china so they should not be punished for that .
but we ask heads of state , heads of government , members of royal families not to attend the opening ceremony . it would be a very significant gesture to say to the chinese authorities that we are going to attend the olympic games , we are going to attend sport events , but we are not going to attend the political event which is the opening ceremony . do you think there is a danger this kind of political action will make china take an even harder line ? no , because the line can not get harder .
we waited for months before we did what we did .
we were patient .
we tried to have positive discussions with chinese authorities , but it was not successful , it was not useful at all .
so no , we could not wait any longer . are you planning any further protests ? i ca n't tell you now , but , of course , we plan to use the torch relay to do a lot .
the torch will cross through cities all over the world , and we hope there will be a lot of demonstrations .
the torch will be in london and paris over the next 10 days so maybe that will be our next step . interview : ole tangen jr . send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

nuremberg has written a play book on how it 's done .
they 're teetering on the edge of the second division . last fall , no one expected nuremberg to be down at the bottom of table , battling it out with the likes of duisburg and cottbus .
the team , known as simply " the club " to german soccer fans , was coming off its 2007 victory in the german cup - its first major title in 39 years - and playing some of the most positive soccer in the bundesliga . fast forward to late march 2008 , and nuremberg find themselves in second-to-last in the standings and winless in their last nine matches .
the precipitous fall of one of last season 's overachievers is an object lesson in how not to build on success . lose focus on the league bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : coach von heesen has yet to record a win nuremberg 's german cup win not only meant a new addition to the club 's trophy case .
it also qualified them for the 2007-08 uefa cup . playing internationally is every team 's ultimate goal , but as so often is the case for smaller teams , the double burden of european and domestic contests has been anything but a blessing for nuremberg . the club performed quite well in the competition , reaching the knock-out round before losing a heartbreaking tie in late february to portuguese side , benfica lisbon , on two last-minute goals . but nuremberg 's relatively good uefa performances distracted players ' attention away from the fact that they had fallen into the relegation zone at home . " it started perhaps with a too-relaxed attitude at the start of the season , " nuremberg goalkeeper daniel klewer told dw 's bundesliga kick-off .
" we said to ourselves that we had the best team ever at nuremberg .

indeed , this seems the only plausible explanation for a decision that , from a soccer perspective , is like a slumping sprinter chopping off one of his legs . the 65-year-old meyer from the communist former east germany not only led the club to its biggest triumph in almost four decades .
he also saved the team from relegation in 2005-06 , after having previously achieved comparable feats for moenchengladbach and hertha berlin . the 46-year-old von heesen , by contrast , has a relatively brief bundesliga resume , his only other top-flight coaching experience coming at lowly bielefeld . whatever van heesen 's merits as a tactician , he 's gotten off to the worst start ever of any nuremberg coach and has n't shown any signs of solving the team 's main problem . buy players who do n't fit bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : nuremberg expended huge energy on the uefa cup nuremberg have only scored 26 times in the league despite being among the bundesliga 's best at creating goal chances .

nuremberg signed two solid scorers after their german cup triumph - reigning european champion angelos charisteas of greece and czech jan koller , who notched up 59 goals in five seasons with borussia dortmund . the problem is that neither of these classic big center forwards fits the successful style of play nuremberg showed in 2006-07 , which emphasized quick combinations rather than long balls into the box . moreover , nuremberg 's inefficiency up front is compounded by shakiness at the back .
neither klewer nor jaromir blazek has proved a completely satisfactory replacement for former keeper rafael schaefer , who departed for stuttgart in the off-season . the result is that nuremberg have conceded 18 goals in the final 30 minutes of games - second worst in the league .

nuremberg has written a play book on how it 's done .
they 're teetering on the edge of the second division . last fall , no one expected nuremberg to be down at the bottom of table , battling it out with the likes of duisburg and cottbus .
the team , known as simply " the club " to german soccer fans , was coming off its 2007 victory in the german cup - its first major title in 39 years - and playing some of the most positive soccer in the bundesliga . fast forward to late march 2008 , and nuremberg find themselves in second-to-last in the standings and winless in their last nine matches .

it also qualified them for the 2007-08 uefa cup . playing internationally is every team 's ultimate goal , but as so often is the case for smaller teams , the double burden of european and domestic contests has been anything but a blessing for nuremberg . the club performed quite well in the competition , reaching the knock-out round before losing a heartbreaking tie in late february to portuguese side , benfica lisbon , on two last-minute goals . but nuremberg 's relatively good uefa performances distracted players ' attention away from the fact that they had fallen into the relegation zone at home . " it started perhaps with a too-relaxed attitude at the start of the season , " nuremberg goalkeeper daniel klewer told dw 's bundesliga kick-off .
" we said to ourselves that we had the best team ever at nuremberg .
but hard work and constant concentration are part of the game , and we forgot that .

he also saved the team from relegation in 2005-06 , after having previously achieved comparable feats for moenchengladbach and hertha berlin . the 46-year-old von heesen , by contrast , has a relatively brief bundesliga resume , his only other top-flight coaching experience coming at lowly bielefeld . whatever van heesen 's merits as a tactician , he 's gotten off to the worst start ever of any nuremberg coach and has n't shown any signs of solving the team 's main problem . buy players who do n't fit bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : nuremberg expended huge energy on the uefa cup nuremberg have only scored 26 times in the league despite being among the bundesliga 's best at creating goal chances .

nuremberg signed two solid scorers after their german cup triumph - reigning european champion angelos charisteas of greece and czech jan koller , who notched up 59 goals in five seasons with borussia dortmund . the problem is that neither of these classic big center forwards fits the successful style of play nuremberg showed in 2006-07 , which emphasized quick combinations rather than long balls into the box . moreover , nuremberg 's inefficiency up front is compounded by shakiness at the back .
neither klewer nor jaromir blazek has proved a completely satisfactory replacement for former keeper rafael schaefer , who departed for stuttgart in the off-season . the result is that nuremberg have conceded 18 goals in the final 30 minutes of games - second worst in the league .

he also saved the team from relegation in 2005-06 , after having previously achieved comparable feats for moenchengladbach and hertha berlin . the 46-year-old von heesen , by contrast , has a relatively brief bundesliga resume , his only other top-flight coaching experience coming at lowly bielefeld . whatever van heesen 's merits as a tactician , he 's gotten off to the worst start ever of any nuremberg coach and has n't shown any signs of solving the team 's main problem . buy players who do n't fit bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : nuremberg expended huge energy on the uefa cup nuremberg have only scored 26 times in the league despite being among the bundesliga 's best at creating goal chances .
that would suggest that the team 's strikers are most at fault for its demise . but that 's not the whole story .
nuremberg signed two solid scorers after their german cup triumph - reigning european champion angelos charisteas of greece and czech jan koller , who notched up 59 goals in five seasons with borussia dortmund . the problem is that neither of these classic big center forwards fits the successful style of play nuremberg showed in 2006-07 , which emphasized quick combinations rather than long balls into the box . moreover , nuremberg 's inefficiency up front is compounded by shakiness at the back .
neither klewer nor jaromir blazek has proved a completely satisfactory replacement for former keeper rafael schaefer , who departed for stuttgart in the off-season . the result is that nuremberg have conceded 18 goals in the final 30 minutes of games - second worst in the league .
that 's converted potential wins into draws , and draws into losses , costing the club some much-needed points . get yourself in must-win situations bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : ex-coach hans meyer could have the last laugh with five teams either in or near the drop zone , nuremberg 's fate is by no means sealed . whether the club can save itself from its fifth top-flight free-fall in 25 years will probably depend on how it fares in its upcoming matches against fellow relegation candidates bielefeld and duisburg . but as a team no one expected to be in such dire straits this late in the season , nuremberg will be under additional pressure to produce results . " the most important criterium is that the team believes in itself and performs , " von heesen told kick-off . " it 's a question of self-confidence , of what sort attitude one takes into matches - although i do n't want highlight a situation that puts lots of pressure on the players . " but is nuremberg fail to withstand the heat and end up in the second division again , they may find a quip by their loquacious ex-coach hans meyer ringing bitterly in their ears . " in soccer , people are very quick to erect a monument to you , " meyer once informed a curious journalist .
" but they 're just as quick to urinate on it . " the march 27 edition of bundesliga kick-off features an in-depth look at the problems in nuremberg . jefferson chase send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

germany and the eu , however , questioned the organizations ' calculations . aid agencies said that up to $ 10 billion -lrb- 6.5 billion euros -rrb- , or 40 percent , of promised aid to afghanistan has not been delivered by the west , and what does arrive bypasses the afghan government . western countries have failed to carry through on their pledges of aid to afghanistan , according to a report by the agency coordinating body for afghan relief -lrb- acbar -rrb- .
the umbrella group of non-governmental organizations which work in afghanistan said the international community had pledged $ 25 billion to afghanistan since 2001 , when the extremist taliban government was toppled , but that up to $ 10 billion had not reached the country . the us government - the biggest international donor to afghanistan - " has one of the biggest shortfalls , " providing only half of the $ 10.4 billion dollars of pledged money until 2008 , the report said . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : aid for development just a " fraction " of military expenditure the european commission and germany had delivered less than two-thirds of their respective $ 1.7 billion and $ 1.2 billion in commitments , acbar said . but a spokesperson for the german development ministry disputed that statement , saying that his country had paid up more than 90 percent of the money it had pledged between 2001 and 2006 . the european commission also rejected the allegations . " we are delivering - there is no delay , no backlog , no shortfall or lagging behind , " a spokeswoman for the european commission 's external-affairs chief in brussels said . exaggerated costs the report said the world bank had distributed just over half of its promised funds . furthermore , " just $ 15 billion in aid has so far been spent , of which it is estimated a staggering 40 percent has returned to donor countries in corporate profits and consultant salaries … vastly pushing up expenditures , " the report said . " for example , a road between the center of kabul and the international airport cost the united states more than $ 2.3 million per kilometer , at least four times the average cost of building a road in afghanistan . " many of the full-time expatriate consultants working for private companies in afghanistan receive $ 250,000 to $ 500,000 a year , including salary , allowances and other costs , the report said . a " fraction " spent on aid the report , entitled " falling short , " was written by the aid group oxfam for acbar .
acbar is made up of 94 agencies , including oxfam , christian aid , care , islamic relief and save the children . the group said that foreign money spent on aid , development and reconstruction is now just " a fraction " of military expenditures . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : afghanistan is the biggest producer of poppy-derived opium for heroin the us military alone spends some $ 100 million a day in fighting insurgents in afghanistan , but average spending on aid by all donors since 2001 has amounted to only $ 7 million daily . " given the links between development and security , the effectiveness of aid also has a major impact on peace and stability , " acbar said .
" yet thus far aid has been insufficient and in many cases wasteful and ineffective . " in addition , afghanistan received just $ 57 per capita in aid in the two years after international intervention in 2001 , compared to $ 679 a head in bosnia and $ 233 in east timor , acbar said . inefficiency and corruption are problematic some of the shortfalls , however , could be attributed to " challenging operating conditions , high levels of corruption and weak absorption capacities , " acbar noted . the group said this demonstrated the need for donors to solve such problems , adding that the weaknesses could be the reason that about two-thirds of foreign assistance bypassed the afghan government - undermining attempts to build effective state institutions . world bank country manager mariam sherman told afp news agency that its disbursal rate - estimated to be about 50 percent - was " actually very good .

germany and the eu , however , questioned the organizations ' calculations . aid agencies said that up to $ 10 billion -lrb- 6.5 billion euros -rrb- , or 40 percent , of promised aid to afghanistan has not been delivered by the west , and what does arrive bypasses the afghan government . western countries have failed to carry through on their pledges of aid to afghanistan , according to a report by the agency coordinating body for afghan relief -lrb- acbar -rrb- .
the umbrella group of non-governmental organizations which work in afghanistan said the international community had pledged $ 25 billion to afghanistan since 2001 , when the extremist taliban government was toppled , but that up to $ 10 billion had not reached the country . the us government - the biggest international donor to afghanistan - " has one of the biggest shortfalls , " providing only half of the $ 10.4 billion dollars of pledged money until 2008 , the report said . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : aid for development just a " fraction " of military expenditure the european commission and germany had delivered less than two-thirds of their respective $ 1.7 billion and $ 1.2 billion in commitments , acbar said . but a spokesperson for the german development ministry disputed that statement , saying that his country had paid up more than 90 percent of the money it had pledged between 2001 and 2006 . the european commission also rejected the allegations . " we are delivering - there is no delay , no backlog , no shortfall or lagging behind , " a spokeswoman for the european commission 's external-affairs chief in brussels said . exaggerated costs the report said the world bank had distributed just over half of its promised funds . furthermore , " just $ 15 billion in aid has so far been spent , of which it is estimated a staggering 40 percent has returned to donor countries in corporate profits and consultant salaries … vastly pushing up expenditures , " the report said . " for example , a road between the center of kabul and the international airport cost the united states more than $ 2.3 million per kilometer , at least four times the average cost of building a road in afghanistan . " many of the full-time expatriate consultants working for private companies in afghanistan receive $ 250,000 to $ 500,000 a year , including salary , allowances and other costs , the report said . a " fraction " spent on aid the report , entitled " falling short , " was written by the aid group oxfam for acbar .
acbar is made up of 94 agencies , including oxfam , christian aid , care , islamic relief and save the children . the group said that foreign money spent on aid , development and reconstruction is now just " a fraction " of military expenditures . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : afghanistan is the biggest producer of poppy-derived opium for heroin the us military alone spends some $ 100 million a day in fighting insurgents in afghanistan , but average spending on aid by all donors since 2001 has amounted to only $ 7 million daily . " given the links between development and security , the effectiveness of aid also has a major impact on peace and stability , " acbar said .
" yet thus far aid has been insufficient and in many cases wasteful and ineffective . " in addition , afghanistan received just $ 57 per capita in aid in the two years after international intervention in 2001 , compared to $ 679 a head in bosnia and $ 233 in east timor , acbar said . inefficiency and corruption are problematic some of the shortfalls , however , could be attributed to " challenging operating conditions , high levels of corruption and weak absorption capacities , " acbar noted . the group said this demonstrated the need for donors to solve such problems , adding that the weaknesses could be the reason that about two-thirds of foreign assistance bypassed the afghan government - undermining attempts to build effective state institutions . world bank country manager mariam sherman told afp news agency that its disbursal rate - estimated to be about 50 percent - was " actually very good . "
but she conceded that while the world bank channeled all its funds through the government budget , it was a problem that so much of it bypassed the administration . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : germany has more than 3,000 soldiers in afghanistan " to build a state and be accountable to its people , the government needs to have a say in resource allocation , " sherman told afp . extreme poverty prevails acbar stressed that despite the formation of the western-backed afghan government six years ago , the country still suffers from extreme poverty .
just 20 percent of the population has access to potable water ; only 5 percent has electricity . the group also drew attention to recent reports from the southern province of ghazni which said that residents in remote villages were eating grass to quell their hunger . acbar called on the international community to increase aid and ensure that it makes a lasting effect for the poorest afghans .

instead , they 're appealing to individual athletes to make political statements during the games themselves . observers in europe have reacted with both cynicism and dismay as the olympic flame makes its way across the globe , and government authorities do their best to silence critical voices on tibet .
for many journalists , the fact that the summer games in beijing are virtually assured of going ahead as planned reflects what they see as the general hypocrisy of the sporting event and the leadership of international olympic committee chairman jacques rogge .

" the main thing is that organizers promise to improve the human rights situation .
no one takes them at their word anyway . "
but few are advocating a major boycott of the games , as happened in moscow in 1980 and los angeles in 1984 .
indeed , some see hypocrisy on both sides .
" it 's said that the lessons from the nazi dictatorship -lsb- which staged the 1936 summer games -rsb- should not be forgotten , but history is not repeating itself , " wrote berlin 's tageszeitung newspaper .
" the people 's republic of china is not the third reich , and the chinese communist party is not the nsdap .
moreover , tibet is a country that did n't interest anyone in 1959 , when an uprising against chinese occupation was brutally suppressed . "
" the chinese can legitimately ask with what right the former colonial powers great britain and france were allowed to stage the games , despite hardly treating the people they colonized with kid gloves , " wrote the left-wing budapest daily nepszava .

european pundits hold out little hope that the contradictions can be resolved by a threat from the world 's large sporting nations to boycott the beijing event .
but they are encouraging athletes to make critical statements about china 's policies toward tibet .
" it 's a simple matter of civic courage , and athletes and sports functionaries should show it just like anyone else , " wrote the online edition of the german weekly magazine focus .
" the statutes of the ioc may prohibit political statements during the games .
that places responsibly on older athletes who want to end their sporting careers after the games anyway .
by taking courageous actions and accepting the subsequent bans from competition , they could crown their careers by doing something for a worthy cause . "
another commentator praised one olympic representative for having taken just such a political stand .
" there is already an exception , a woman chosen to carry the olympic torch , who has refused to participate in the lie of the political summer games , " wrote the vienna newspaper der standard .

he also said he was open to a thaw with britain . in a wide-ranging interview with britain 's financial times , dmitry medvedev said moscow did not approve of ex-soviet republics georgia and ukraine becoming nato members .
he also said he wanted to improve relations with britain and vowed to crack down on corruption and what he called russia 's " legal nihilism . " " we are not happy about the situation around georgia and ukraine , " he told the business daily ahead of a nato summit in the romanian capital bucharest next week .
" no state can be pleased about having representatives of a military bloc to which it does not belong coming close to its borders . " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : dmitry medvedev , russia 's president-elect medvedev , a 42-year-old former law professor , won a landslide victory in an election earlier this month as expected , and will succeed his political mentor , outgoing president vladimir putin , in may .
putin , however , will stay in the government as medvedev 's prime minister . at a nato summit next week , which putin will attend , georgia and ukraine are hoping to get approval from the western military alliance for its membership action plan -lrb- map -rrb- that would be seen as a signal that its application bid is on track . but the 26 nato members are split on whether to accept the two countries .
germany and france oppose the membership bids , fearful of increasing tensions with russia .
however , many of nato 's eastern european members are pushing for membership as soon as possible , saying it would increase security and reinforce democracy in both nations . us president george w. bush is due to travel to ukraine and croatia on the eve of the bucharest summit , according to the white house . russo-british thaw ? on relations with britain , which are at a post-cold war low after the murder of former russian spy alexander litvinenko in london in november 2006 , medvedev said , " we are open to the re-establishment of cooperation to the full extent . " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : alexander litvinenko london and moscow have traded sharp words since the litvinenko affair , expelled each others ' diplomats and cut back on cooperation between their intelligence services .
moscow refused to hand over a suspect of the 2006 murder . medvedev repeated accusations that the british council , a cultural body partly funded by the british foreign ministry , was engaged in spying in russia , the financial times said .
the council suspended work in two regional offices in january because of what it called harassment by the russian authorities . " we can restore the whole specter of full bilateral cooperation , of course , without preliminary conditions , understanding the independence of each others ' positions , " medvedev said in the interview . rule of law more generally medvedev vowed to crack down on corruption .
upholding the rule of law was a huge challenge because of russians ' general attitude to the law , he said . " it is a monumental task ... russia is a country where people do n't like to observe the law , " he said .
" it is , as they say , a country of legal nihilism . " he touched upon a number of other issues , such as inflation , which he called " a fairly serious problem for the russian economy . "
inflation in year-on-year terms is running at nearly 13 percent .
medvedev added , however , that russia would be able to ride out the turbulence on global markets . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : former yukos oil company ceo mikhail khodorkovsky seen behind bars at a courtroom questioned about mikhail khodorkovsky , the jailed former boss of oil group yukos , he said it was for the courts to decide whether he should remain imprisoned . " no one should interfere , neither a village elder nor the president of the country , " he said . asked whether putin was right when he said that medvedev would be no easier for the west to deal with , he said : " of course he is right " - with a slightly forced smile , according to the financial times . dw staff -lrb- jam -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

now the international community - and dw readers - are deliberating what should be done next . the following comments reflect the views of dw-world.de readers .
not all reader comments have been published .
dw-world.de reserves the right to edit for length and appropriateness of content . it is absolute necessary that germany let the chinese government know that its position and that the action in tibet is totally unacceptable .
chancellor merkel is on the right course . - guenther wirth , somalia of course the international community could do more about china , and i think they should be doing more .
it is fear of economic reprisal or loss of economic opportunity with china that creates the inertia and inaction .
i do n't believe that the athletes should boycott the olympic games .
but i do believe that a boycott of the opening ceremony by dignitaries , government representatives , vip 's and corporate executives should happen . - beren molony , australia the beijing olympics should be collectively boycotted , period .
the chinese government is comprised of hardcore communists , disallowing human rights and personal freedoms , yet they enjoy all the financial accolades of a free enterprise market .
china not only oppresses the people of tibet , but its very own citizens .
i for one will refuse to watch the beijing olympics when they are on tv . - eric weiss , us bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : protests supporting tibet do n't look like they will be stopping soon the german government should and must take a tougher stance but it wo n't do that because china is the " market of the future . "
money plays the most important role in this game .
it is the only medium that is of great significance . - walter roos , germany given that very few eu citizens will be in beijing for the olympics , eu citizens can simply change their television channels during the olympics in order to have a big impact on media and advertising revenues .
how hard would that be to show our commitment to the tibetans ?
i , for one , will . - charles smyth , great britain tibet is a separate culture with a long-established society separate from china .
it is a shame the great reputation of such an ancient culture as china has brought it self so low in the eyes of the world .
shame on them . - camille von forman , argentina the olympics must stay about sports and not change into politics or religion or anything other than what they are .
the trouble will start if we try to mix the pleasure of competition with anything else . - pat schreer , us the olympic games should not be used as a political tool . - g. gosau , canada there should be a boycott of the olympic games .
if my government and others fail to protect innocent people from senseless violence then i must look at my options as a world citizen .
i lived in beijing for five months in 1993 , and i can attest to how important it is to them to host the olympics .
they should be hit where it hurts .
supporting a boycott is the least i can do . - justine , us china knows any violent response would risk damaging the olympics games or international boycott .
those tibetans were burning , beating and killing innocent people , including both ethnic chinese and tibetans , in addition to those poor young policemen .
you are sympathetic to rioters but cruel to those innocent people who were killed , or injured badly . - john wu , us compiled by dw staff -lrb- ot -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

or so one serious fare dodger seemed to think a man who just could n't stop himself from riding trains without buying a ticket will see the wrong side of a jail cell after fines and suspended sentences failed to put him on the straight and narrow . the 24-year-old will be celebrating his next birthday in the big house because of his predilection for hopping on german trains without paying his fare . his habit seemed to have gotten out of control .
from october 2006 to february 2007 , he was caught riding the train without a ticket102 times , often several times on the same day .
the court , fed up with imposing fines and suspended sentences , finally decided to get tough and gave him a 22-month holiday behind bars . throwing himself upon the mercy of the court was likely not an option this time .
it is not as if the man was riding ticketless due to a lack of financial means .
according to his own statement , he repeatedly dodged fares " pretty much out of boredom .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de afghanistan -pipe- 25.03.2008 western aid failing to reach afghanistan , report says großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : afghanistan has been ravaged by war for years aid agencies said that up to $ 10 billion -lrb- 6.5 billion euros -rrb- , or 40 percent , of promised aid to afghanistan has not been delivered by the west .
germany and the eu , however , questioned the organizations ' calculations . aid agencies said that up to $ 10 billion -lrb- 6.5 billion euros -rrb- , or 40 percent , of promised aid to afghanistan has not been delivered by the west , and what does arrive bypasses the afghan government . western countries have failed to carry through on their pledges of aid to afghanistan , according to a report by the agency coordinating body for afghan relief -lrb- acbar -rrb- .
the umbrella group of non-governmental organizations which work in afghanistan said the international community had pledged $ 25 billion to afghanistan since 2001 , when the extremist taliban government was toppled , but that up to $ 10 billion had not reached the country . the us government - the biggest international donor to afghanistan - " has one of the biggest shortfalls , " providing only half of the $ 10.4 billion dollars of pledged money until 2008 , the report said . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : aid for development just a " fraction " of military expenditure the european commission and germany had delivered less than two-thirds of their respective $ 1.7 billion and $ 1.2 billion in commitments , acbar said . but a spokesperson for the german development ministry disputed that statement , saying that his country had paid up more than 90 percent of the money it had pledged between 2001 and 2006 . the european commission also rejected the allegations . " we are delivering - there is no delay , no backlog , no shortfall or lagging behind , " a spokeswoman for the european commission 's external-affairs chief in brussels said . exaggerated costs the report said the world bank had distributed just over half of its promised funds . furthermore , " just $ 15 billion in aid has so far been spent , of which it is estimated a staggering 40 percent has returned to donor countries in corporate profits and consultant salaries … vastly pushing up expenditures , " the report said . " for example , a road between the center of kabul and the international airport cost the united states more than $ 2.3 million per kilometer , at least four times the average cost of building a road in afghanistan . " many of the full-time expatriate consultants working for private companies in afghanistan receive $ 250,000 to $ 500,000 a year , including salary , allowances and other costs , the report said . a " fraction " spent on aid the report , entitled " falling short , " was written by the aid group oxfam for acbar .
acbar is made up of 94 agencies , including oxfam , christian aid , care , islamic relief and save the children . the group said that foreign money spent on aid , development and reconstruction is now just " a fraction " of military expenditures . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : afghanistan is the biggest producer of poppy-derived opium for heroin the us military alone spends some $ 100 million a day in fighting insurgents in afghanistan , but average spending on aid by all donors since 2001 has amounted to only $ 7 million daily . " given the links between development and security , the effectiveness of aid also has a major impact on peace and stability , " acbar said .
" yet thus far aid has been insufficient and in many cases wasteful and ineffective . " in addition , afghanistan received just $ 57 per capita in aid in the two years after international intervention in 2001 , compared to $ 679 a head in bosnia and $ 233 in east timor , acbar said . inefficiency and corruption are problematic some of the shortfalls , however , could be attributed to " challenging operating conditions , high levels of corruption and weak absorption capacities , " acbar noted . the group said this demonstrated the need for donors to solve such problems , adding that the weaknesses could be the reason that about two-thirds of foreign assistance bypassed the afghan government - undermining attempts to build effective state institutions . world bank country manager mariam sherman told afp news agency that its disbursal rate - estimated to be about 50 percent - was " actually very good . "
but she conceded that while the world bank channeled all its funds through the government budget , it was a problem that so much of it bypassed the administration . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : germany has more than 3,000 soldiers in afghanistan " to build a state and be accountable to its people , the government needs to have a say in resource allocation , " sherman told afp . extreme poverty prevails acbar stressed that despite the formation of the western-backed afghan government six years ago , the country still suffers from extreme poverty .
just 20 percent of the population has access to potable water ; only 5 percent has electricity . the group also drew attention to recent reports from the southern province of ghazni which said that residents in remote villages were eating grass to quell their hunger . acbar called on the international community to increase aid and ensure that it makes a lasting effect for the poorest afghans . " aid must address afghan needs , build local capacities and help afghans help themselves , " said matt waldman , afghanistan policy adviser at oxfam and the report 's author . dw staff -lrb- als -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

some claim prince madoc ap owain was one of the first europeans on north american soil when he landed at mobile bay , alabama , in around 1170 .
a plaque marking the legend that welsh was passed on to native americans went up in the 50s but has now been removed .
the alabama welsh society has begun a petition calling for it to be restored .
the madoc -lrb- or madog -rrb- legend claims he and his followers were the first welsh emigrants to the new world when they sailed from what is now rhos-on-sea , colwyn bay .
the prince and his brother were said to be escaping the turmoil of 12th century wales following the death of their father , king owain of gwynedd .
the legend has it their two ships dropped anchor at what is now mobile bay , alabama , in 1169 or 1170 . "
prince madoc is too important to alabama 's history to have the only plaque in our state commemorating him disappear " billy price , alabama welsh society madoc is said to have returned to wales when up to 10 ships are claimed to have gathered at lundy island in the bristol channel before heading west .
they were never seen or heard from again but the madoc myth continued amid claims the settlers integrated with the mandan tribe of native americans , who were said to have spoken a form of welsh .
the madoc legend was taken up by a local chapter of the group daughters of the american revolution , who are said to have paid for the plaque to be erected at fort morgan , mobile bay , in 1953 .
the plaque read : " in memory of prince madoc , a welsh explorer , who landed on the shores of mobile bay in 1170 and left behind , with the indians , the welsh language " .
' first european ' it is thought the plaque was taken down as the site , declared a historical landmark in 1960 , focuses on the us military presence from 1800 to the end of world war ii .
the madoc plaque has been put in storage and people can view it upon request but the alabama welsh society wants it to be put back in place .
vice president billy price said : " prince madoc is believed to have discovered america hundreds of years prior to columbus .
" mobile could and should capitalise on this , not hide it in a storage shed .
" prince madoc is too important to alabama 's history to have the only plaque in our state commemorating him disappear .
" millions of welsh americans know of this historical event that took place in alabama and spend their vacations in the mobile area all because one of their own can lay claim to being the first european who really discovered america . "

the sale raised £ 265m , which will be split between baa and morley .
the sale is part of ferrovial 's programme of non-core sales to help pay off the debt it took on to buy baa .
it comes as the group , which owns heathrow and gatwick airports , faces calls for a break-up amid growing criticism of its dominance .
ferrovial is in the process of restructuring the debt it took on to make its £ 10bn acquisition of baa in 2006 .
the credit crisis has made refinancing debt more complicated , while bank loans have become more expensive .
earlier this month , baa sold its world duty free -lrb- wdf -rrb- shops to italy 's autogrill for £ 546.6m.
meanwhile , there are growing calls for the group to sell one or more of the seven uk airports it owns amid concern about mismanagement of resources and a lack of competition .
the competition commission has launched an inquiry into the matter .

the sale raised £ 265m , which will be split between baa and morley .
the sale is part of ferrovial 's programme of non-core sales to help pay off the debt it took on to buy baa .
it comes as the group , which owns heathrow and gatwick airports , faces calls for a break-up amid growing criticism of its dominance .
ferrovial is in the process of restructuring the debt it took on to make its £ 10bn acquisition of baa in 2006 .
the credit crisis has made refinancing debt more complicated , while bank loans have become more expensive .
earlier this month , baa sold its world duty free -lrb- wdf -rrb- shops to italy 's autogrill for £ 546.6m.
meanwhile , there are growing calls for the group to sell one or more of the seven uk airports it owns amid concern about mismanagement of resources and a lack of competition .
the competition commission has launched an inquiry into the matter .

the firm has written an open letter to regulators saying the us spectrum was a " once in a lifetime opportunity " .
white space is unused blocks of frequencies in-between channels broadcast on analogue airwaves .
" the vast majority of viable spectrum in this country simply goes unused , or else is grossly underutilised , " wrote google 's richard whitt in the letter .
" unlike other natural resources , there is no benefit to allowing this spectrum to lie fallow , " he added .
google has said the white space could be used to bring " ubiquitous wireless broadband access to all americans " .
in the past tv broadcasters have opposed the use of white space , fearing it would cause interference with television programming .
google believes the spectrum could create a wi-fi dividend but in its letter , google urged the fcc to adopt a series of overlapping technologies , including " spectrum sensing , " designed to prevent signals from interfering with each other .
mr whitt said there was enough unused spectrum for businesses to create a wide range of options , such as building small peer-to-peer networks or even establishing an alternative national wireless network .
google has said that devices designed to take advantage of the white space spectrum could be on the market by the end of 2009 .
other countries are also looking at using white space spectrum .
in the uk much of this space is being dedicated for use by services like wireless microphones for broadcast use , and for cognitive radio , a smart wireless technology that allows for the use of wi-fi .

the firm has written an open letter to regulators saying the us spectrum was a " once in a lifetime opportunity " .
white space is unused blocks of frequencies in-between channels broadcast on analogue airwaves .
" the vast majority of viable spectrum in this country simply goes unused , or else is grossly underutilised , " wrote google 's richard whitt in the letter .
" unlike other natural resources , there is no benefit to allowing this spectrum to lie fallow , " he added .
google has said the white space could be used to bring " ubiquitous wireless broadband access to all americans " .
in the past tv broadcasters have opposed the use of white space , fearing it would cause interference with television programming .
google believes the spectrum could create a wi-fi dividend but in its letter , google urged the fcc to adopt a series of overlapping technologies , including " spectrum sensing , " designed to prevent signals from interfering with each other .
mr whitt said there was enough unused spectrum for businesses to create a wide range of options , such as building small peer-to-peer networks or even establishing an alternative national wireless network .
google has said that devices designed to take advantage of the white space spectrum could be on the market by the end of 2009 .
other countries are also looking at using white space spectrum .
in the uk much of this space is being dedicated for use by services like wireless microphones for broadcast use , and for cognitive radio , a smart wireless technology that allows for the use of wi-fi .

lawyer john eardley , who claims to represent the singer , argued she had not been given sufficient notice when the order was granted in february .

meanwhile , the singer 's guest appearance on tv comedy how i met your mother was screened on monday night .

telephone conversation the singer 's father james spears was originally granted temporary conservatorship over his daughter in february after she was admitted to a psychiatric ward .
a us court creates a conservatorship when a person is unable to care for themselves .
the order , which puts mr spears in charge of his daughter 's assets and estate - thought to be worth $ 100m -lrb- £ 50.8m -rrb- - has since been extended to 31 july .
in his challenge , mr eardley said a " five-day notice requirement " had been dispensed without " legitimate grounds " .
mr eardley has claimed ms spears employed him during a telephone conversation in february .
but under the conservatorship order , she is not allowed to hire a lawyer .

health minister edwina hart says wales is the first part of the uk to commit to such a move to tackle obesity and diet-related disease .
it is part of the labour-plaid cymru assembly government 's commitment in the deal which created their coalition to improve hospital food and nutrition .
most junk food will be removed from the machines in the next six months .
only one nhs hospital in wales out of 130 will not have healthy vending in place by 2010 .
almost 20 % of six to 13-year-olds in wales are overweight or obese - the highest rate in the uk - as are six out of every 10 men , and half of women .
the assembly government believes hospitals in particular should show best practice in providing health options .
the assembly government said it would liaise with vending machine providers to find ways of introducing healthier food and drink .
we need to create an environment where it is easier for people to make healthy choices health minister edwina hart guidance will be issued to support the change , providing clear definitions of what will be allowed in the machines .
vanessa bourne , from the patients association , said many patients would be " very glad " to have a choice .
but she said : " it 's important that it is a choice and not just a blanket ban on certain things .
" a choice is the obvious way to go and to educate people in the most meaningful sense .
but also we need to be aware that the healthy option should n't become the expensive option because if it is , it wo n't work . "
ms hart said : " diet has an important role to play in the prevention of obesity and chronic diseases such as coronary heart disease , diabetes and certain cancers .
" the assembly government is committed to improving the health of the population of wales and reducing inequalities by tackling the underlying causes of ill health . "
" we need to create an environment where it is easier for people to make healthy choices and our public sector settings should be an exemplar of best practice , particularly our hospitals .
" this is the first stage of the work to improve hospital food , " ms hart added .
paediatric departments " we will be speaking with wrvs -lrb- women 's royal voluntary service -rrb- and other outlets in hospitals about further ways they can support the broader over-arching agenda to improve nutrition in hospitals . "
a study carried out by cardiff 's university hospital of wales which looked at vending machines in or near paediatric departments in welsh hospitals showed very few nhs trusts had any machines where half of more of the drinks were healthy .
huw jenkins , consultant paediatric gastroenterologist at the hospital , said : " it is clear from a recent survey that the majority of vending machines around children 's areas in welsh hospitals do not provide enough healthy options .
he said the minister 's announcement would ensure " all vending machines are stocked with healthy options in the future " .
the vending machine ban follows a report from a group set up last year and chaired by the chief nursing officer for wales , to improve patients ' food and drink .
similar work is being undertaken on vending both in schools and in leisure centres .
it also follows an announcement earlier this month of plans to improve oral health by giving children as young as three free toothbrushes , as well as lessons in how to use them .

health minister edwina hart says wales is the first part of the uk to commit to such a move to tackle obesity and diet-related disease .
it is part of the labour-plaid cymru assembly government 's commitment in the deal which created their coalition to improve hospital food and nutrition .
most junk food will be removed from the machines in the next six months .
only one nhs hospital in wales out of 130 will not have healthy vending in place by 2010 .
almost 20 % of six to 13-year-olds in wales are overweight or obese - the highest rate in the uk - as are six out of every 10 men , and half of women .
the assembly government believes hospitals in particular should show best practice in providing health options .
the assembly government said it would liaise with vending machine providers to find ways of introducing healthier food and drink .
we need to create an environment where it is easier for people to make healthy choices health minister edwina hart guidance will be issued to support the change , providing clear definitions of what will be allowed in the machines .
vanessa bourne , from the patients association , said many patients would be " very glad " to have a choice .
but she said : " it 's important that it is a choice and not just a blanket ban on certain things .
" a choice is the obvious way to go and to educate people in the most meaningful sense .
but also we need to be aware that the healthy option should n't become the expensive option because if it is , it wo n't work . "
ms hart said : " diet has an important role to play in the prevention of obesity and chronic diseases such as coronary heart disease , diabetes and certain cancers .
" the assembly government is committed to improving the health of the population of wales and reducing inequalities by tackling the underlying causes of ill health . "
" we need to create an environment where it is easier for people to make healthy choices and our public sector settings should be an exemplar of best practice , particularly our hospitals .
" this is the first stage of the work to improve hospital food , " ms hart added .
paediatric departments " we will be speaking with wrvs -lrb- women 's royal voluntary service -rrb- and other outlets in hospitals about further ways they can support the broader over-arching agenda to improve nutrition in hospitals . "
a study carried out by cardiff 's university hospital of wales which looked at vending machines in or near paediatric departments in welsh hospitals showed very few nhs trusts had any machines where half of more of the drinks were healthy .
huw jenkins , consultant paediatric gastroenterologist at the hospital , said : " it is clear from a recent survey that the majority of vending machines around children 's areas in welsh hospitals do not provide enough healthy options .
he said the minister 's announcement would ensure " all vending machines are stocked with healthy options in the future " .
the vending machine ban follows a report from a group set up last year and chaired by the chief nursing officer for wales , to improve patients ' food and drink .
similar work is being undertaken on vending both in schools and in leisure centres .
it also follows an announcement earlier this month of plans to improve oral health by giving children as young as three free toothbrushes , as well as lessons in how to use them .

the ecuadorean government said it would appeal to the organisation of american states -lrb- oas -rrb- for help in the matter .
colombia on sunday confirmed that an ecuadorean died when its troops attacked a rebel camp three weeks ago .
the raid provoked the worst regional tensions in recent years , with ecuador breaking off diplomatic relations .
colombian forces attacked the revolutionary armed forced of colombia -lrb- farc -rrb- camp located just across the border in ecuador on 1 march .
a senior farc commander , raul reyes , and more than 20 other people , including four mexican nationals , were killed .
aerial photos show the ruins of the farc camp inside ecuador colombian defence minister juan manuel santos confirmed that an ecuadorean national was among the dead and that his body had been taken to colombia .
his ecuadorean counterpart , wellington sandoval , said that the news " complicated " bilateral relations .
" things have become complicated , because an ecuadorean has died in an attack by a foreign country , " mr sandoval said .
identity ecuador 's president rafael correa had earlier warned of grave diplomatic consequences if it were proved that an ecuadorean had died in the raid .
the ecuadorean authorities say fingerprint records show the dead man is franklin aisalia molina , while mr aisalia 's family said they identified his body from news photos .
in a statement , the ecuadorean foreign ministry said the killing of mr aisalia and the transfer of his body to colombia was a human rights abuse and a violation of international law .
" ecuador will appeal to the secretary general of the oas with the aim of finding a definitive solution to this case , " the statement said .
any " positive explanations " that colombia could give mr aisalia 's family " will create an atmosphere conducive to establishing a climate of confidence between the two nations . "
tensions colombia 's defence ministry had earlier said the dead man appeared to have been a member of the farc who specialised in helping rebels cross into ecuador to hide .
mr aisalia 's family has denied this .
ecuador and venezuela sent troops to their borders after colombia 's raid , withdrawing them several days later after a meeting of regional leaders in the dominican republic .
but tensions remain .
on monday , venezuelan president hugo chavez said comments by the colombian officials defending the raid could risk a new diplomatic crisis .
" for the love of god , " mr chavez said in remarks directed at his colombian counterpart , alvaro uribe , " take good care with spokesman of war like your defence minister . "
mr santos had said the rebel camp had been a legitimate military target .

bbc news -pipe- technology -pipe- how the open net closed its doors bbc news / technology graphics version bbc sport home news front page -pipe- africa -pipe- americas -pipe- asia-pacific -pipe- europe -pipe- middle east -pipe- south asia -pipe- uk -pipe- business -pipe- health -pipe- science & environment -pipe- technology -pipe- entertainment -pipe- also in the news -pipe- have your say -pipe- 10:19 gmt , tuesday , 25 march 2008 how the open net closed its doors by clark boyd technology correspondent , in boston a new book details the extent to which countries across the globe are increasingly censoring online information they find strategically , politically or culturally threatening .
access denied : the practice and policy of global internet filtering challenges the long-standing assumption that the internet is an unfettered space where citizens from around the world can freely communicate and mobilise .
in fact , the book makes it clear that the scope , scale and sophistication of net censorship are growing .
" there 's been a conventional wisdom or myth that the internet was immune from state regulation , " says ronald deibert , one of the book 's editors .
" what we 're finding is that states that were taking a hands-off approach to the internet for many years are now finding ways to intervene at key internet choke points , and block access to information . "
mr. deibert heads the citizen lab at the university of toronto .
the lab , along with harvard law school , the university of cambridge , and oxford university , has spent the last five years testing internet access in some 40 countries . "
we are starting to see something more like the china wide web , the pakistan wide web , and the iran wide web " john palfrey , director of harvard law school 's berkman center for internet and society the book highlights saudi arabia , iran and china as some of the most aggressive nations when it comes to net filtering .
they use a variety of techniques to limit what their citizens can see online .
but they reinforce that filtering with other methods , such as net surveillance .
" surveillance is a huge deterrent , " says the citizen lab 's nart villeneuve .
" if you talk to dissident groups in these countries , they 'll tell you that they 're under surveillance , that they 're concerned for their safety , and that it definitely influences their online behavior . "
and even as human rights and internet rights groups fight to raise awareness about internet censorship , countries such as china have responded by getting smarter in what they block , and when they block it .
' selectively blocking ' " we call it ' just-in-time ' filtering , " mr. deibert says .
" countries are selectively blocking access to information around key events , such as demonstrations or elections .
they are clamping down on the internet during times that it suits their strategic interests to do so . "
as an example of this kind of filtering , he points to china 's recent blocking of youtube after videos of tibetan protestors appeared on the video-sharing site .
belarus , cambodia and burma have all engaged in this kind of selective censorship as well .
and then there is the case of pakistan , which recently caused the entire youtube service to go down worldwide for a couple of hours because of a government order to block material .
according to john palfrey , director of harvard law school 's berkman center for internet and society , the pakistan case points to certain weaknesses inherent in the very architecture of the internet .
" it was designed by a bunch of friends in essence - academics and military people - who were just creating a local network .
now , it has scaled globally .
' informal protocols ' " but it 's still based on some fairly informal protocols .
it turns out that when one censor in one country messes around with something , he can bring down access to entire parts of the internet . "
mr palfrey points out that some countries are considering whether or not to bypass the world wide web all together by creating what amounts to their own local area networks .
" we are starting to see something more like the china wide web , the pakistan wide web , and the iran wide web . "
but the citizen lab 's ronald deibert does not think the evidence points to a complete " balkanization " of the net by sovereign states .
" i do n't think it 's a stretch to say that a person in iran experiences a much different internet than a citizen in a country like canada , " he says .
" but it 's not a simple equation with territorial boundaries .
maybe the best analogy is with the old middle ages , where you had multiple and overlapping layers of authority .
i think that 's the future of the net . "
that future is being complicated by the increased use of mobile phones , pdas and other devices to access information online .
for citizens , these devices mean more ways to access the internet , and therefore more potential ways around government blocking .
but jonathan zittrain , chair in internet governance and regulation at oxford university , says that governments are already starting to realize the potential threats from mobile devices as tools to access and spread information .
" in fact , when it comes to mobile devices , " zittrain says , " you may see common cause among china , the united states and europe , all of whom would like another lever they can pull that will enhance their control over the net , whether they 're looking for terrorists , subversives or political dissidents . "
" i 'd hate to think that the technological advances , say , in america , turn out to be exactly the advances , wrapped in a bow , the technologies china might use to squash dissidents . "

as an example of this kind of filtering , he points to china 's recent blocking of youtube after videos of tibetan protestors appeared on the video-sharing site .
google has been criticised for working with chinese authorities belarus , cambodia and burma have all engaged in this kind of selective censorship as well .
and then there is the case of pakistan , which recently caused the entire youtube service to go down worldwide for a couple of hours because of a government order to block material .
according to john palfrey , director of harvard law school 's berkman center for internet and society , the pakistan case points to certain weaknesses inherent in the very architecture of the internet .
" it was designed by a bunch of friends in essence - academics and military people - who were just creating a local network .
now , it has scaled globally .
' informal protocols ' " but it 's still based on some fairly informal protocols .
it turns out that when one censor in one country messes around with something , he can bring down access to entire parts of the internet . "
mr palfrey points out that some countries are considering whether or not to bypass the world wide web all together by creating what amounts to their own local area networks .
" we are starting to see something more like the china wide web , the pakistan wide web , and the iran wide web . "
but the citizen lab 's ronald deibert does not think the evidence points to a complete " balkanization " of the net by sovereign states .
" i do n't think it 's a stretch to say that a person in iran experiences a much different internet than a citizen in a country like canada , " he says .
" but it 's not a simple equation with territorial boundaries .
maybe the best analogy is with the old middle ages , where you had multiple and overlapping layers of authority .
i think that 's the future of the net . "
that future is being complicated by the increased use of mobile phones , pdas and other devices to access information online .
for citizens , these devices mean more ways to access the internet , and therefore more potential ways around government blocking .
but jonathan zittrain , chair in internet governance and regulation at oxford university , says that governments are already starting to realize the potential threats from mobile devices as tools to access and spread information .
" in fact , when it comes to mobile devices , " zittrain says , " you may see common cause among china , the united states and europe , all of whom would like another lever they can pull that will enhance their control over the net , whether they 're looking for terrorists , subversives or political dissidents . "
" i 'd hate to think that the technological advances , say , in america , turn out to be exactly the advances , wrapped in a bow , the technologies china might use to squash dissidents . "

access denied : the practice and policy of global internet filtering challenges the long-standing assumption that the internet is an unfettered space where citizens from around the world can freely communicate and mobilise .
in fact , the book makes it clear that the scope , scale and sophistication of net censorship are growing .
" there 's been a conventional wisdom or myth that the internet was immune from state regulation , " says ronald deibert , one of the book 's editors .
" what we 're finding is that states that were taking a hands-off approach to the internet for many years are now finding ways to intervene at key internet choke points , and block access to information . "
mr. deibert heads the citizen lab at the university of toronto .
the lab , along with harvard law school , the university of cambridge , and oxford university , has spent the last five years testing internet access in some 40 countries .
we are starting to see something more like the china wide web , the pakistan wide web , and the iran wide web john palfrey , director of harvard law school 's berkman center for internet and society the book highlights saudi arabia , iran and china as some of the most aggressive nations when it comes to net filtering .
they use a variety of techniques to limit what their citizens can see online .
but they reinforce that filtering with other methods , such as net surveillance .
" surveillance is a huge deterrent , " says the citizen lab 's nart villeneuve .
" if you talk to dissident groups in these countries , they 'll tell you that they 're under surveillance , that they 're concerned for their safety , and that it definitely influences their online behavior . "
and even as human rights and internet rights groups fight to raise awareness about internet censorship , countries such as china have responded by getting smarter in what they block , and when they block it .
' selectively blocking ' " we call it ' just-in-time ' filtering , " mr. deibert says .
" countries are selectively blocking access to information around key events , such as demonstrations or elections .
they are clamping down on the internet during times that it suits their strategic interests to do so . "
as an example of this kind of filtering , he points to china 's recent blocking of youtube after videos of tibetan protestors appeared on the video-sharing site .
google has been criticised for working with chinese authorities belarus , cambodia and burma have all engaged in this kind of selective censorship as well .
and then there is the case of pakistan , which recently caused the entire youtube service to go down worldwide for a couple of hours because of a government order to block material .
according to john palfrey , director of harvard law school 's berkman center for internet and society , the pakistan case points to certain weaknesses inherent in the very architecture of the internet .
" it was designed by a bunch of friends in essence - academics and military people - who were just creating a local network .
now , it has scaled globally .
' informal protocols ' " but it 's still based on some fairly informal protocols .
it turns out that when one censor in one country messes around with something , he can bring down access to entire parts of the internet . "
mr palfrey points out that some countries are considering whether or not to bypass the world wide web all together by creating what amounts to their own local area networks .
" we are starting to see something more like the china wide web , the pakistan wide web , and the iran wide web . "
but the citizen lab 's ronald deibert does not think the evidence points to a complete " balkanization " of the net by sovereign states .
" i do n't think it 's a stretch to say that a person in iran experiences a much different internet than a citizen in a country like canada , " he says .
