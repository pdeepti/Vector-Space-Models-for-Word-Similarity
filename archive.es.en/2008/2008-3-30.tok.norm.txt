the script is by germans , uwe eric laufenberg and marcus mislin .
police in potsdam described the watch at the theater as a precaution , saying there had been no threats to the event .
some muslims have been upset by the production , suggesting that insulting islam was a gimmick to attract audiences .
germany 's various muslim groups have differed in their reactions , with one group , the central council of muslims , calling for calm .
though rushdie 's content was " insulting " to islam , " despite the common misconception , the majority of the world 's muslims have rejected censorship , " aiman mazyek , secretary general of the multi-ethnic council , said on friday .
attracting publicity bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : salmand rusdhie lived under police protection for many years german-born mazyek , 39 , a political science graduate , told radio multikulti , a station run by public broadcaster rbb , the subject matter had the potential to " insult religious people in general and muslims in particular .

" these days , insulting islam is often used to attract publicity , " he said .
" sulking only played into the hands of those doing the insulting . "
" i say we should pursue a critical and constructive dialogue , " he said .
" one should explain that freedom of opinion and the arts is a prime value , but our values do not extend to insulting what is sacred to a religion . "
but ali kizilkaya , chairman of the islamic council of germany , a mainly turkish group , said the stage show was one of a series of increasingly frequent provocations that went beyond the bounds of ordinary debate .
" evidently it is becoming the fashion to insult islam , " he said in remarks quoted on friday by the newspaper schweriner volkszeitung .
freedom of the arts was " an important value " but the rule of respect also applied .

in potsdam , the two main indian characters were played by tobias rott , as saladin and the devil , and robert gallinowski , as gibril and the archangel , whose interplay is the theme of the story .
the hot website said a cast of 12 germans was performing the world 's first stage adaptation of a work about " the battle between modernism and anti-modernism " and it would include the controversial climax with " a prophet named mahound . "
rushdie has frequently visited germany and lectured at writers ' conferences .

"
mackeben said wearing the robes was not compulsory as they are not part of the official german olympic kit for the august 8-24 games .
he insisted he will not breach the olympic charter and express his opinion on tibet outside olympic areas in the chinese capital .
a german network of athletes has the same in mind with a silicon armband in green and blue with the writing " sport for human rights . "
" we will express our protest during the games not in reference to tibet but in a general way concerning abiding to human rights and freedom of press , " said a statement on the network 's website .
" that is because the olympic charter outlaws any kind of political propaganda at the olympics . "
refusing to turn a blind eye bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : china is hopeing to present itself in the best possible light during the games canoeing olympic bronze-medallist stefan pfannmoeller , one of the initiators of the network , said that athletes can not turn a blind eye to the systematic abuse of human rights and freedom of press .
" as athletes we carry a big responsibility and must show it .
if not us , who else ? , " he said .
but the issue is delicate as athletes face punishment from the international olympic committee in the case of protest action in the olympic areas .
the olympic charter says in article 51 that " no kind of demonstration or political , religious or racial propaganda is permitted in any olympic sites , venues or other areas . "
violations can lead to disqualification and loss of olympic accreditation .
american sprinters tommie smith and john carlos were kicked out of the 1968 games after their black power protest at the 200m victory ceremony .
less than two weeks ago serbian swimmer and gold-medal winner milorad cavic had to leave the european swim championships after wearing a t-shirt with the writing " kosovo is serbia . "
a thin line bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : olympic rules must be observed the incidents show that athletes will walk a thin line with any kind of visible or spoken protests at venues and other areas .
german lawyer dirk-reiner martens , who is one of the judges at the court of arbitration for sport -lrb- cas -rrb- told die welt daily that this is necessary .
he said that he did not envy his colleagues in beijing because of possible tough decisions to make on ethically impeccable athletes , but insisted that " anyone who competes voluntarily at the olympics must respect the rules . "
sebastian schulte , a spokesman of the german olympic team and part of the rowing eighth , said that athletes will not overstep the rules .
" i will not undermine the chances of my crew by voicing my opinion in a careless way , but i will express myself within the rules .
" sport can not be misused as the last resort to continue a war with other methods , but as mature athletes we will look closely into what the olympic charter allows and use our options within this framework for our protests , " said schulte .
eu rules out boycott bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : eu will continue to monitor the human rights situation in china , said rupel in a break with tradition , eu foreign ministers at an informal meeting in slovenia over the weekend issued a statement calling for an end to violence in tibet , but ruled out a boycott of the forthcoming olympic games in beijing .
the 27-member bloc asked that " arrested persons be treated in conformity with international standards " and called for " substantive and constructive dialog which addresses core issues like the preservation of the tibetan language , culture , religion and traditions , " the statement said .
the ministers did not wish to discuss suggestions that the eu as a whole should boycott the games ' opening ceremony , french foreign minister bernard kouchner said .
but slovenian foreign minister dimitrij rupel , who chaired the meeting , did not rule out further statements and other actions should the situation deteriorate .
" if something else happens in the future , we 'll return to the subject , " he said .
the eu will " continue to pay close attention to the human-rights situation in china , " the statement concluded . dpa news agency -lrb- tt -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

the script is by germans , uwe eric laufenberg and marcus mislin .
police in potsdam described the watch at the theater as a precaution , saying there had been no threats to the event .
some muslims have been upset by the production , suggesting that insulting islam was a gimmick to attract audiences .
germany 's various muslim groups have differed in their reactions , with one group , the central council of muslims , calling for calm .
though rushdie 's content was " insulting " to islam , " despite the common misconception , the majority of the world 's muslims have rejected censorship , " aiman mazyek , secretary general of the multi-ethnic council , said on friday .
attracting publicity bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : salmand rusdhie lived under police protection for many years german-born mazyek , 39 , a political science graduate , told radio multikulti , a station run by public broadcaster rbb , the subject matter had the potential to " insult religious people in general and muslims in particular . "
" these days , insulting islam is often used to attract publicity , " he said .
" sulking only played into the hands of those doing the insulting . "
" i say we should pursue a critical and constructive dialogue , " he said .
" one should explain that freedom of opinion and the arts is a prime value , but our values do not extend to insulting what is sacred to a religion . "
but ali kizilkaya , chairman of the islamic council of germany , a mainly turkish group , said the stage show was one of a series of increasingly frequent provocations that went beyond the bounds of ordinary debate .
" evidently it is becoming the fashion to insult islam , " he said in remarks quoted on friday by the newspaper schweriner volkszeitung .
freedom of the arts was " an important value " but the rule of respect also applied .
scandal sells bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : robert gallinowski -lrb- left -rrb- as gibril and tobias rott as saladin germans have shown only slight interest in rushdie 's theme , the dilemmas of indian expatriates in contemporary england , but have been fascinated by the scandal over the book and threats to assassinate the author in revenge for passages portraying the prophet mohammed .
in potsdam , the two main indian characters were played by tobias rott , as saladin and the devil , and robert gallinowski , as gibril and the archangel , whose interplay is the theme of the story .
the hot website said a cast of 12 germans was performing the world 's first stage adaptation of a work about " the battle between modernism and anti-modernism " and it would include the controversial climax with " a prophet named mahound . "
rushdie has frequently visited germany and lectured at writers ' conferences .
under a shiite iranian fatwa or edict issued in iran in 1989 , it was declared right to murder him .
as a result , for many years he had police bodyguards . dpa news agency -lrb- tt -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

the script is by germans , uwe eric laufenberg and marcus mislin .
police in potsdam described the watch at the theater as a precaution , saying there had been no threats to the event .

the script is by germans , uwe eric laufenberg and marcus mislin .
police in potsdam described the watch at the theater as a precaution , saying there had been no threats to the event .
some muslims have been upset by the production , suggesting that insulting islam was a gimmick to attract audiences .
germany 's various muslim groups have differed in their reactions , with one group , the central council of muslims , calling for calm .
though rushdie 's content was " insulting " to islam , " despite the common misconception , the majority of the world 's muslims have rejected censorship , " aiman mazyek , secretary general of the multi-ethnic council , said on friday .
attracting publicity bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : salmand rusdhie lived under police protection for many years german-born mazyek , 39 , a political science graduate , told radio multikulti , a station run by public broadcaster rbb , the subject matter had the potential to " insult religious people in general and muslims in particular . "
" these days , insulting islam is often used to attract publicity , " he said .
" sulking only played into the hands of those doing the insulting . "
" i say we should pursue a critical and constructive dialogue , " he said .
" one should explain that freedom of opinion and the arts is a prime value , but our values do not extend to insulting what is sacred to a religion . "
but ali kizilkaya , chairman of the islamic council of germany , a mainly turkish group , said the stage show was one of a series of increasingly frequent provocations that went beyond the bounds of ordinary debate .
" evidently it is becoming the fashion to insult islam , " he said in remarks quoted on friday by the newspaper schweriner volkszeitung .
freedom of the arts was " an important value " but the rule of respect also applied .
scandal sells bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : robert gallinowski -lrb- left -rrb- as gibril and tobias rott as saladin germans have shown only slight interest in rushdie 's theme , the dilemmas of indian expatriates in contemporary england , but have been fascinated by the scandal over the book and threats to assassinate the author in revenge for passages portraying the prophet mohammed .
in potsdam , the two main indian characters were played by tobias rott , as saladin and the devil , and robert gallinowski , as gibril and the archangel , whose interplay is the theme of the story .
the hot website said a cast of 12 germans was performing the world 's first stage adaptation of a work about " the battle between modernism and anti-modernism " and it would include the controversial climax with " a prophet named mahound . "
rushdie has frequently visited germany and lectured at writers ' conferences .
under a shiite iranian fatwa or edict issued in iran in 1989 , it was declared right to murder him .
as a result , for many years he had police bodyguards . dpa news agency -lrb- tt -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

"
mackeben said wearing the robes was not compulsory as they are not part of the official german olympic kit for the august 8-24 games .
he insisted he will not breach the olympic charter and express his opinion on tibet outside olympic areas in the chinese capital .
a german network of athletes has the same in mind with a silicon armband in green and blue with the writing " sport for human rights . "
" we will express our protest during the games not in reference to tibet but in a general way concerning abiding to human rights and freedom of press , " said a statement on the network 's website .
" that is because the olympic charter outlaws any kind of political propaganda at the olympics . "
refusing to turn a blind eye bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : china is hopeing to present itself in the best possible light during the games canoeing olympic bronze-medallist stefan pfannmoeller , one of the initiators of the network , said that athletes can not turn a blind eye to the systematic abuse of human rights and freedom of press .
" as athletes we carry a big responsibility and must show it .
if not us , who else ? , " he said .
but the issue is delicate as athletes face punishment from the international olympic committee in the case of protest action in the olympic areas .
the olympic charter says in article 51 that " no kind of demonstration or political , religious or racial propaganda is permitted in any olympic sites , venues or other areas . "
violations can lead to disqualification and loss of olympic accreditation .
american sprinters tommie smith and john carlos were kicked out of the 1968 games after their black power protest at the 200m victory ceremony .
less than two weeks ago serbian swimmer and gold-medal winner milorad cavic had to leave the european swim championships after wearing a t-shirt with the writing " kosovo is serbia . "
a thin line bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : olympic rules must be observed the incidents show that athletes will walk a thin line with any kind of visible or spoken protests at venues and other areas .
german lawyer dirk-reiner martens , who is one of the judges at the court of arbitration for sport -lrb- cas -rrb- told die welt daily that this is necessary .
he said that he did not envy his colleagues in beijing because of possible tough decisions to make on ethically impeccable athletes , but insisted that " anyone who competes voluntarily at the olympics must respect the rules . "
sebastian schulte , a spokesman of the german olympic team and part of the rowing eighth , said that athletes will not overstep the rules .
" i will not undermine the chances of my crew by voicing my opinion in a careless way , but i will express myself within the rules .
" sport can not be misused as the last resort to continue a war with other methods , but as mature athletes we will look closely into what the olympic charter allows and use our options within this framework for our protests , " said schulte .
eu rules out boycott bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : eu will continue to monitor the human rights situation in china , said rupel in a break with tradition , eu foreign ministers at an informal meeting in slovenia over the weekend issued a statement calling for an end to violence in tibet , but ruled out a boycott of the forthcoming olympic games in beijing .
the 27-member bloc asked that " arrested persons be treated in conformity with international standards " and called for " substantive and constructive dialog which addresses core issues like the preservation of the tibetan language , culture , religion and traditions , " the statement said .
the ministers did not wish to discuss suggestions that the eu as a whole should boycott the games ' opening ceremony , french foreign minister bernard kouchner said .
but slovenian foreign minister dimitrij rupel , who chaired the meeting , did not rule out further statements and other actions should the situation deteriorate .
" if something else happens in the future , we 'll return to the subject , " he said .
the eu will " continue to pay close attention to the human-rights situation in china , " the statement concluded . dpa news agency -lrb- tt -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

germany is no longer just a consumer , but also has become producer of cannabis-related drugs . the marijuana business in germany is growing , juergen maurer , head of the organized crime department of the german federal crime office , said on friday . last year , police secured 83 cannabis fields and 347 sheds and greenhouses where the plant was secretly grown , according to an annual report released on friday by the federal crime office .
indoor plantations are preferred because the plants retain up to a 12-percent higher concentration of the intoxicating substance thc . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : germany is no longer just a consumer though the 3.68 tons of hashish confiscated in 2007 represented a decrease of 34 percent compared to the previous year , police secured 28 percent more marijuana -lrb- 3.77 tons -rrb- .

"
mackeben said wearing the robes was not compulsory as they are not part of the official german olympic kit for the august 8-24 games .
he insisted he will not breach the olympic charter and express his opinion on tibet outside olympic areas in the chinese capital .
a german network of athletes has the same in mind with a silicon armband in green and blue with the writing " sport for human rights . "
" we will express our protest during the games not in reference to tibet but in a general way concerning abiding to human rights and freedom of press , " said a statement on the network 's website .
" that is because the olympic charter outlaws any kind of political propaganda at the olympics . "
refusing to turn a blind eye bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : china is hopeing to present itself in the best possible light during the games canoeing olympic bronze-medallist stefan pfannmoeller , one of the initiators of the network , said that athletes can not turn a blind eye to the systematic abuse of human rights and freedom of press .
" as athletes we carry a big responsibility and must show it .
if not us , who else ? , " he said .
but the issue is delicate as athletes face punishment from the international olympic committee in the case of protest action in the olympic areas .
the olympic charter says in article 51 that " no kind of demonstration or political , religious or racial propaganda is permitted in any olympic sites , venues or other areas . "
violations can lead to disqualification and loss of olympic accreditation .
american sprinters tommie smith and john carlos were kicked out of the 1968 games after their black power protest at the 200m victory ceremony .
less than two weeks ago serbian swimmer and gold-medal winner milorad cavic had to leave the european swim championships after wearing a t-shirt with the writing " kosovo is serbia . "
a thin line bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : olympic rules must be observed the incidents show that athletes will walk a thin line with any kind of visible or spoken protests at venues and other areas .
german lawyer dirk-reiner martens , who is one of the judges at the court of arbitration for sport -lrb- cas -rrb- told die welt daily that this is necessary .
he said that he did not envy his colleagues in beijing because of possible tough decisions to make on ethically impeccable athletes , but insisted that " anyone who competes voluntarily at the olympics must respect the rules . "
sebastian schulte , a spokesman of the german olympic team and part of the rowing eighth , said that athletes will not overstep the rules .
" i will not undermine the chances of my crew by voicing my opinion in a careless way , but i will express myself within the rules .

"
mackeben said wearing the robes was not compulsory as they are not part of the official german olympic kit for the august 8-24 games .
he insisted he will not breach the olympic charter and express his opinion on tibet outside olympic areas in the chinese capital .
a german network of athletes has the same in mind with a silicon armband in green and blue with the writing " sport for human rights . "
" we will express our protest during the games not in reference to tibet but in a general way concerning abiding to human rights and freedom of press , " said a statement on the network 's website .
" that is because the olympic charter outlaws any kind of political propaganda at the olympics . "
refusing to turn a blind eye bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : china is hopeing to present itself in the best possible light during the games canoeing olympic bronze-medallist stefan pfannmoeller , one of the initiators of the network , said that athletes can not turn a blind eye to the systematic abuse of human rights and freedom of press .
" as athletes we carry a big responsibility and must show it .
if not us , who else ? , " he said .
but the issue is delicate as athletes face punishment from the international olympic committee in the case of protest action in the olympic areas .
the olympic charter says in article 51 that " no kind of demonstration or political , religious or racial propaganda is permitted in any olympic sites , venues or other areas . "
violations can lead to disqualification and loss of olympic accreditation .
american sprinters tommie smith and john carlos were kicked out of the 1968 games after their black power protest at the 200m victory ceremony .
less than two weeks ago serbian swimmer and gold-medal winner milorad cavic had to leave the european swim championships after wearing a t-shirt with the writing " kosovo is serbia . "
a thin line bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : olympic rules must be observed the incidents show that athletes will walk a thin line with any kind of visible or spoken protests at venues and other areas .
german lawyer dirk-reiner martens , who is one of the judges at the court of arbitration for sport -lrb- cas -rrb- told die welt daily that this is necessary .
he said that he did not envy his colleagues in beijing because of possible tough decisions to make on ethically impeccable athletes , but insisted that " anyone who competes voluntarily at the olympics must respect the rules . "
sebastian schulte , a spokesman of the german olympic team and part of the rowing eighth , said that athletes will not overstep the rules .
" i will not undermine the chances of my crew by voicing my opinion in a careless way , but i will express myself within the rules .
" sport can not be misused as the last resort to continue a war with other methods , but as mature athletes we will look closely into what the olympic charter allows and use our options within this framework for our protests , " said schulte .
eu rules out boycott bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : eu will continue to monitor the human rights situation in china , said rupel in a break with tradition , eu foreign ministers at an informal meeting in slovenia over the weekend issued a statement calling for an end to violence in tibet , but ruled out a boycott of the forthcoming olympic games in beijing .

the script is by germans , uwe eric laufenberg and marcus mislin .
police in potsdam described the watch at the theater as a precaution , saying there had been no threats to the event .
some muslims have been upset by the production , suggesting that insulting islam was a gimmick to attract audiences .
germany 's various muslim groups have differed in their reactions , with one group , the central council of muslims , calling for calm .
though rushdie 's content was " insulting " to islam , " despite the common misconception , the majority of the world 's muslims have rejected censorship , " aiman mazyek , secretary general of the multi-ethnic council , said on friday .
attracting publicity bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : salmand rusdhie lived under police protection for many years german-born mazyek , 39 , a political science graduate , told radio multikulti , a station run by public broadcaster rbb , the subject matter had the potential to " insult religious people in general and muslims in particular . "
" these days , insulting islam is often used to attract publicity , " he said .
" sulking only played into the hands of those doing the insulting . "
" i say we should pursue a critical and constructive dialogue , " he said .
" one should explain that freedom of opinion and the arts is a prime value , but our values do not extend to insulting what is sacred to a religion . "
but ali kizilkaya , chairman of the islamic council of germany , a mainly turkish group , said the stage show was one of a series of increasingly frequent provocations that went beyond the bounds of ordinary debate .
" evidently it is becoming the fashion to insult islam , " he said in remarks quoted on friday by the newspaper schweriner volkszeitung .
freedom of the arts was " an important value " but the rule of respect also applied .
scandal sells bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : robert gallinowski -lrb- left -rrb- as gibril and tobias rott as saladin germans have shown only slight interest in rushdie 's theme , the dilemmas of indian expatriates in contemporary england , but have been fascinated by the scandal over the book and threats to assassinate the author in revenge for passages portraying the prophet mohammed .
in potsdam , the two main indian characters were played by tobias rott , as saladin and the devil , and robert gallinowski , as gibril and the archangel , whose interplay is the theme of the story .
the hot website said a cast of 12 germans was performing the world 's first stage adaptation of a work about " the battle between modernism and anti-modernism " and it would include the controversial climax with " a prophet named mahound . "
rushdie has frequently visited germany and lectured at writers ' conferences .
under a shiite iranian fatwa or edict issued in iran in 1989 , it was declared right to murder him .
as a result , for many years he had police bodyguards . dpa news agency -lrb- tt -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

" the effective worth can normally be estimated by making comparisons with other authors - franz kafka , for instance , who was an ingenious author , but who was not nearly as widely read as may , " schmid said , adding that such a comparison would show that the price of the may estate should actually be double of what he is asking . estimates of worth vary widely volker wahl , director of the thueringia state archive , who has also researched may 's estate , can not tolerate those sorts of analogies . " you can not make comparisons like that , " he said .
" karl may and franz kafka are two completely different types of writers .

"
mackeben said wearing the robes was not compulsory as they are not part of the official german olympic kit for the august 8-24 games .
he insisted he will not breach the olympic charter and express his opinion on tibet outside olympic areas in the chinese capital .
a german network of athletes has the same in mind with a silicon armband in green and blue with the writing " sport for human rights . "
" we will express our protest during the games not in reference to tibet but in a general way concerning abiding to human rights and freedom of press , " said a statement on the network 's website .
" that is because the olympic charter outlaws any kind of political propaganda at the olympics . "
refusing to turn a blind eye bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : china is hopeing to present itself in the best possible light during the games canoeing olympic bronze-medallist stefan pfannmoeller , one of the initiators of the network , said that athletes can not turn a blind eye to the systematic abuse of human rights and freedom of press .
" as athletes we carry a big responsibility and must show it .
if not us , who else ? , " he said .
but the issue is delicate as athletes face punishment from the international olympic committee in the case of protest action in the olympic areas .
the olympic charter says in article 51 that " no kind of demonstration or political , religious or racial propaganda is permitted in any olympic sites , venues or other areas . "
violations can lead to disqualification and loss of olympic accreditation .
american sprinters tommie smith and john carlos were kicked out of the 1968 games after their black power protest at the 200m victory ceremony .
less than two weeks ago serbian swimmer and gold-medal winner milorad cavic had to leave the european swim championships after wearing a t-shirt with the writing " kosovo is serbia . "
a thin line bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : olympic rules must be observed the incidents show that athletes will walk a thin line with any kind of visible or spoken protests at venues and other areas .
german lawyer dirk-reiner martens , who is one of the judges at the court of arbitration for sport -lrb- cas -rrb- told die welt daily that this is necessary .
he said that he did not envy his colleagues in beijing because of possible tough decisions to make on ethically impeccable athletes , but insisted that " anyone who competes voluntarily at the olympics must respect the rules . "
sebastian schulte , a spokesman of the german olympic team and part of the rowing eighth , said that athletes will not overstep the rules .
" i will not undermine the chances of my crew by voicing my opinion in a careless way , but i will express myself within the rules .
" sport can not be misused as the last resort to continue a war with other methods , but as mature athletes we will look closely into what the olympic charter allows and use our options within this framework for our protests , " said schulte .
eu rules out boycott bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : eu will continue to monitor the human rights situation in china , said rupel in a break with tradition , eu foreign ministers at an informal meeting in slovenia over the weekend issued a statement calling for an end to violence in tibet , but ruled out a boycott of the forthcoming olympic games in beijing .
the 27-member bloc asked that " arrested persons be treated in conformity with international standards " and called for " substantive and constructive dialog which addresses core issues like the preservation of the tibetan language , culture , religion and traditions , " the statement said .
the ministers did not wish to discuss suggestions that the eu as a whole should boycott the games ' opening ceremony , french foreign minister bernard kouchner said .
but slovenian foreign minister dimitrij rupel , who chaired the meeting , did not rule out further statements and other actions should the situation deteriorate .
" if something else happens in the future , we 'll return to the subject , " he said .
the eu will " continue to pay close attention to the human-rights situation in china , " the statement concluded . dpa news agency -lrb- tt -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de society -pipe- 30.03.2008 modern experiment in communal living gives hope to residents großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : 66 people live in the three-part amaryllis complex in bonn in a country where living alone is commonplace , a new communal living project in bonn has sparked curiosity .
there may always be someone there to lend a helping hand , but will the dozens of residents actually get along ? the walls in the stairwell have n't been plastered yet , the elevator squeaks and the yard is full of tools .
the two-year building project is drawing to a close but there 's still a lot to do .
this is n't an ordinary house , but three large complexes . sixty-six people have already moved in - families , couples , mothers , singles , widows and pensioner who no longer want to live alone . the residents of the multiple-generation living project " amaryllis " in bonn are interested to see how it will all turn out . a network of helping hands bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : resident helga ahrenhoevel said she 'd like to teach the kids in the community to crochet " i 'm definitely not a fairy tale grandma , " said 74-year-old helga ahrenhoevel , " but i think it would be good if i could teach the children how to knit or crochet . "
the " children " are not her grandchildren but her housemates . it 's practically unheard of in germany these days to have grandparents living in the same house as their children and grandchildren .
only two out of every 100 households are made up of multiple generations . but as larger families disappear , so do the practical everyday benefits that come with them .
who takes care of the children when their parents have to work ?
who 'll help the elderly woman with her shopping bags ?
and who 'll lend their car to someone who does n't have one ? the residents of the bonn living project take a pragmatic view .
each one can choose where to live within the complex - in a more private apartment , in a house , or with roommates . most importantly , there is always an opportunity to come together , " whether it 's a game evening with the kids or a deep conversation with my neighbor , " said 44-year-old jochen lampe , who uses a wheelchair . for lampe , the only alternative to his new community would be a nursing home . " there i would miss the social component that i have here , " he said .
" there are so many helping hands here . " single households on the rise bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : if it were n't for the community , lampe would have to go to a nursing home the notion of people of different ages , and who are not relatives , living under one roof is unusual in europe .
the trend toward one- or two-person households is increasing , and not only in germany .
in scandinavian countries , there are already more single than multiple-person households . only in spain , ireland and portugal , the average household includes three people .
but even in these countries , it 's become uncommon for more than two generations to live together . for the residents in bonn , it 's often the little things that they look forward to in their new environment : the sound of children playing , sharing a meal , chatting with a neighbor .
but expectations are also kept within bounds . " you just ca n't be equally good friends with everyone here , " said anneke burger , who lives in the community with her husband and three children .

now , the last estate of a german-speaking writer held in private hands could be sold off . nearly every german has heard of winnetou or old shatterhand - some of german writer karl may 's most famous figures .
for some of the older generation , the names trigger memories of childhood afternoons spent immersed in may 's tales . but for lothar schmid , it 's all more than just a memory - it 's his life .
the 79-year-old senior manager of karl may verlag -lrb- karl may publishing -rrb- recently explained at the leipzig book fair how his father founded the publishing company in radebeul , near the eastern city of dresden , in 1913 . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : writer karl may lived and worked in radebeul he also descibed how his father 's three sons managed to rescue the legacy of karl may from the chaos of world war ii and the soviet occupation , and resettle the publishing company in bamberg , where karl may 's original manuscripts are kept . " there are only a few of the originals still left , including ' winnetou iv , ' which does not have all of the adventure and action of ' winnetou i-iii , " ' schmid said .
" winnetou iv is more of a symbolic work in which may wrote about native americans and white people and generally about the hero winnetou . " the archive also contains other manuscripts , letters , notes and musical scores : karl may not only wrote , he also sometimes composed . splitting up the estate lothar schmid 's two brothers started thinking about selling their shares in the publishing company at the beginning of the 1990s .
but at the time , lothar did everything in his power to keep karl may 's estate from falling into private hands .
he invested all of his money and took out a loan of one million deutsche marks -lrb- about 500,000 euros or $ 777,775 -rrb- to buy out his brothers . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : a fan at the karl may museum in radebeul now , schmid wants to rid himself of the financial burden and retire at last .
he hopes to sell the estate to the eastern state of saxony , where may was born - for 15 million euros . schmid said that the estate was worth twice that amount . " the effective worth can normally be estimated by making comparisons with other authors - franz kafka , for instance , who was an ingenious author , but who was not nearly as widely read as may , " schmid said , adding that such a comparison would show that the price of the may estate should actually be double of what he is asking . estimates of worth vary widely volker wahl , director of the thueringia state archive , who has also researched may 's estate , can not tolerate those sorts of analogies . " you can not make comparisons like that , " he said .
" karl may and franz kafka are two completely different types of writers .
i do not even want to make judgements about the varying literary quality of their work ; they are simply not comparable . " " may 's winnetou manuscript is no more comparable to kafka 's ' the trial " than goethe 's ' faust ' is , " he added . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : another winnetou actor during a presentation of the karl may play " unter geiern " wahl is critical of schmid 's price demand , and believes may 's estate is not worth more than one million euros - an estimate supported by an expert report commissioned by the state government of saxony , which looked at the cultural-historical value . " lothar schmid went to an antiquarian bookseller in munich , who used completely different criteria to come up with the estimate of 15 million euros , " wahl said .
" he was basing it on assumptions of what could be paid for individual books at auctions . " at any rate , it looks unlikely that the state of saxony could pay the 15 million schmid is demanding , said state minister for science and culture , eva maria stange .

now , the last estate of a german-speaking writer held in private hands could be sold off . nearly every german has heard of winnetou or old shatterhand - some of german writer karl may 's most famous figures .
for some of the older generation , the names trigger memories of childhood afternoons spent immersed in may 's tales . but for lothar schmid , it 's all more than just a memory - it 's his life .
the 79-year-old senior manager of karl may verlag -lrb- karl may publishing -rrb- recently explained at the leipzig book fair how his father founded the publishing company in radebeul , near the eastern city of dresden , in 1913 . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : writer karl may lived and worked in radebeul he also descibed how his father 's three sons managed to rescue the legacy of karl may from the chaos of world war ii and the soviet occupation , and resettle the publishing company in bamberg , where karl may 's original manuscripts are kept . " there are only a few of the originals still left , including ' winnetou iv , ' which does not have all of the adventure and action of ' winnetou i-iii , " ' schmid said .

but at the time , lothar did everything in his power to keep karl may 's estate from falling into private hands .
he invested all of his money and took out a loan of one million deutsche marks -lrb- about 500,000 euros or $ 777,775 -rrb- to buy out his brothers . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : a fan at the karl may museum in radebeul now , schmid wants to rid himself of the financial burden and retire at last .
he hopes to sell the estate to the eastern state of saxony , where may was born - for 15 million euros . schmid said that the estate was worth twice that amount . " the effective worth can normally be estimated by making comparisons with other authors - franz kafka , for instance , who was an ingenious author , but who was not nearly as widely read as may , " schmid said , adding that such a comparison would show that the price of the may estate should actually be double of what he is asking . estimates of worth vary widely volker wahl , director of the thueringia state archive , who has also researched may 's estate , can not tolerate those sorts of analogies . " you can not make comparisons like that , " he said .
" karl may and franz kafka are two completely different types of writers .

there may always be someone there to lend a helping hand , but will the dozens of residents actually get along ? the walls in the stairwell have n't been plastered yet , the elevator squeaks and the yard is full of tools .
the two-year building project is drawing to a close but there 's still a lot to do .
this is n't an ordinary house , but three large complexes . sixty-six people have already moved in - families , couples , mothers , singles , widows and pensioner who no longer want to live alone . the residents of the multiple-generation living project " amaryllis " in bonn are interested to see how it will all turn out . a network of helping hands bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : resident helga ahrenhoevel said she 'd like to teach the kids in the community to crochet " i 'm definitely not a fairy tale grandma , " said 74-year-old helga ahrenhoevel , " but i think it would be good if i could teach the children how to knit or crochet . "
the " children " are not her grandchildren but her housemates . it 's practically unheard of in germany these days to have grandparents living in the same house as their children and grandchildren .
only two out of every 100 households are made up of multiple generations . but as larger families disappear , so do the practical everyday benefits that come with them .
who takes care of the children when their parents have to work ?
who 'll help the elderly woman with her shopping bags ?
and who 'll lend their car to someone who does n't have one ? the residents of the bonn living project take a pragmatic view .
each one can choose where to live within the complex - in a more private apartment , in a house , or with roommates . most importantly , there is always an opportunity to come together , " whether it 's a game evening with the kids or a deep conversation with my neighbor , " said 44-year-old jochen lampe , who uses a wheelchair . for lampe , the only alternative to his new community would be a nursing home .

in scandinavian countries , there are already more single than multiple-person households . only in spain , ireland and portugal , the average household includes three people .
but even in these countries , it 's become uncommon for more than two generations to live together . for the residents in bonn , it 's often the little things that they look forward to in their new environment : the sound of children playing , sharing a meal , chatting with a neighbor .
but expectations are also kept within bounds . " you just ca n't be equally good friends with everyone here , " said anneke burger , who lives in the community with her husband and three children .

now , the last estate of a german-speaking writer held in private hands could be sold off . nearly every german has heard of winnetou or old shatterhand - some of german writer karl may 's most famous figures .
for some of the older generation , the names trigger memories of childhood afternoons spent immersed in may 's tales . but for lothar schmid , it 's all more than just a memory - it 's his life .
the 79-year-old senior manager of karl may verlag -lrb- karl may publishing -rrb- recently explained at the leipzig book fair how his father founded the publishing company in radebeul , near the eastern city of dresden , in 1913 . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : writer karl may lived and worked in radebeul he also descibed how his father 's three sons managed to rescue the legacy of karl may from the chaos of world war ii and the soviet occupation , and resettle the publishing company in bamberg , where karl may 's original manuscripts are kept . " there are only a few of the originals still left , including ' winnetou iv , ' which does not have all of the adventure and action of ' winnetou i-iii , " ' schmid said .
" winnetou iv is more of a symbolic work in which may wrote about native americans and white people and generally about the hero winnetou .

but at the time , lothar did everything in his power to keep karl may 's estate from falling into private hands .
he invested all of his money and took out a loan of one million deutsche marks -lrb- about 500,000 euros or $ 777,775 -rrb- to buy out his brothers . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : a fan at the karl may museum in radebeul now , schmid wants to rid himself of the financial burden and retire at last .
he hopes to sell the estate to the eastern state of saxony , where may was born - for 15 million euros . schmid said that the estate was worth twice that amount . " the effective worth can normally be estimated by making comparisons with other authors - franz kafka , for instance , who was an ingenious author , but who was not nearly as widely read as may , " schmid said , adding that such a comparison would show that the price of the may estate should actually be double of what he is asking . estimates of worth vary widely volker wahl , director of the thueringia state archive , who has also researched may 's estate , can not tolerate those sorts of analogies . " you can not make comparisons like that , " he said .
" karl may and franz kafka are two completely different types of writers .
i do not even want to make judgements about the varying literary quality of their work ; they are simply not comparable . " " may 's winnetou manuscript is no more comparable to kafka 's ' the trial " than goethe 's ' faust ' is , " he added . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : another winnetou actor during a presentation of the karl may play " unter geiern " wahl is critical of schmid 's price demand , and believes may 's estate is not worth more than one million euros - an estimate supported by an expert report commissioned by the state government of saxony , which looked at the cultural-historical value . " lothar schmid went to an antiquarian bookseller in munich , who used completely different criteria to come up with the estimate of 15 million euros , " wahl said .
" he was basing it on assumptions of what could be paid for individual books at auctions . " at any rate , it looks unlikely that the state of saxony could pay the 15 million schmid is demanding , said state minister for science and culture , eva maria stange .

" lothar schmid went to an antiquarian bookseller in munich , who used completely different criteria to come up with the estimate of 15 million euros , " wahl said .
" he was basing it on assumptions of what could be paid for individual books at auctions . " at any rate , it looks unlikely that the state of saxony could pay the 15 million schmid is demanding , said state minister for science and culture , eva maria stange .
more negotiations are currently underway . should they fail , lothar schmid might just be forced to sell the works individually at auctions - which would see may originals scattered across the globe . christian werner -lrb- als -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

only two out of every 100 households are made up of multiple generations . but as larger families disappear , so do the practical everyday benefits that come with them .
who takes care of the children when their parents have to work ?
who 'll help the elderly woman with her shopping bags ?
and who 'll lend their car to someone who does n't have one ? the residents of the bonn living project take a pragmatic view .
each one can choose where to live within the complex - in a more private apartment , in a house , or with roommates . most importantly , there is always an opportunity to come together , " whether it 's a game evening with the kids or a deep conversation with my neighbor , " said 44-year-old jochen lampe , who uses a wheelchair . for lampe , the only alternative to his new community would be a nursing home . " there i would miss the social component that i have here , " he said .
" there are so many helping hands here . " single households on the rise bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : if it were n't for the community , lampe would have to go to a nursing home the notion of people of different ages , and who are not relatives , living under one roof is unusual in europe .
the trend toward one- or two-person households is increasing , and not only in germany .
in scandinavian countries , there are already more single than multiple-person households . only in spain , ireland and portugal , the average household includes three people .
but even in these countries , it 's become uncommon for more than two generations to live together . for the residents in bonn , it 's often the little things that they look forward to in their new environment : the sound of children playing , sharing a meal , chatting with a neighbor .
but expectations are also kept within bounds . " you just ca n't be equally good friends with everyone here , " said anneke burger , who lives in the community with her husband and three children .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de computer -pipe- 30.03.2008 new data law could benefit music pirates großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : things were a bit simpler for the music industry before the internet germany 's music industry fears that a new telephone data law could become a carte blanche for internet users , who download tunes illegally .
until now , they 've traced music pirates with the help of phone records . the agony of the recorded-music industry as it fights the " world of free " on the internet may have become a little more painful in germany this month , with a court ruling that seems to restrict surveillance of web users . following the example set by the recording industry association of america -lrb- riaa -rrb- , the german music companies have been tracking down web users , mostly 15 to 30 years old , who download music in breach of copyright . it reports them to the police . the industry in western europe 's most populous nation says it employs 98 sleuths working 24 hours a day .
working from crack computers in a bland hamburg office building , they collect the downloaders ' internet protocol numbers - a kind of internet phone number - and the times and dates that they were observed . is pirating music a serious crime ? bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : just how much information should be made available to piracy fighters and police ?
to link an ip number to a user , police have to have access to phone-company records . however that may prove difficult in the light of a march 19 constitutional court ruling that police can only obtain telephone company data to uncover serious crimes .
copying music on the internet may not be considered serious enough . a debate in the united states on reforming copyright laws to encourage freer exchange has only echoed quietly in germany .
but eco , the german internet business association , welcomed the court ruling as a rebuff to music-industry snooping . eco promotes new ways of earning money online and has been critical of the music industry .
in both europe and north america , the industry has been accused of failing to adapt to the internet age and the web 's culture of sharing communities .

for some of the older generation , the names trigger memories of childhood afternoons spent immersed in may 's tales . but for lothar schmid , it 's all more than just a memory - it 's his life .
the 79-year-old senior manager of karl may verlag -lrb- karl may publishing -rrb- recently explained at the leipzig book fair how his father founded the publishing company in radebeul , near the eastern city of dresden , in 1913 . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : writer karl may lived and worked in radebeul he also descibed how his father 's three sons managed to rescue the legacy of karl may from the chaos of world war ii and the soviet occupation , and resettle the publishing company in bamberg , where karl may 's original manuscripts are kept . " there are only a few of the originals still left , including ' winnetou iv , ' which does not have all of the adventure and action of ' winnetou i-iii , " ' schmid said .
" winnetou iv is more of a symbolic work in which may wrote about native americans and white people and generally about the hero winnetou . " the archive also contains other manuscripts , letters , notes and musical scores : karl may not only wrote , he also sometimes composed . splitting up the estate lothar schmid 's two brothers started thinking about selling their shares in the publishing company at the beginning of the 1990s .
but at the time , lothar did everything in his power to keep karl may 's estate from falling into private hands .
he invested all of his money and took out a loan of one million deutsche marks -lrb- about 500,000 euros or $ 777,775 -rrb- to buy out his brothers . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : a fan at the karl may museum in radebeul now , schmid wants to rid himself of the financial burden and retire at last .
he hopes to sell the estate to the eastern state of saxony , where may was born - for 15 million euros . schmid said that the estate was worth twice that amount . " the effective worth can normally be estimated by making comparisons with other authors - franz kafka , for instance , who was an ingenious author , but who was not nearly as widely read as may , " schmid said , adding that such a comparison would show that the price of the may estate should actually be double of what he is asking . estimates of worth vary widely volker wahl , director of the thueringia state archive , who has also researched may 's estate , can not tolerate those sorts of analogies . " you can not make comparisons like that , " he said .
" karl may and franz kafka are two completely different types of writers .
i do not even want to make judgements about the varying literary quality of their work ; they are simply not comparable . " " may 's winnetou manuscript is no more comparable to kafka 's ' the trial " than goethe 's ' faust ' is , " he added . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : another winnetou actor during a presentation of the karl may play " unter geiern " wahl is critical of schmid 's price demand , and believes may 's estate is not worth more than one million euros - an estimate supported by an expert report commissioned by the state government of saxony , which looked at the cultural-historical value . " lothar schmid went to an antiquarian bookseller in munich , who used completely different criteria to come up with the estimate of 15 million euros , " wahl said .
" he was basing it on assumptions of what could be paid for individual books at auctions . " at any rate , it looks unlikely that the state of saxony could pay the 15 million schmid is demanding , said state minister for science and culture , eva maria stange .
more negotiations are currently underway . should they fail , lothar schmid might just be forced to sell the works individually at auctions - which would see may originals scattered across the globe . christian werner -lrb- als -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

the two-year building project is drawing to a close but there 's still a lot to do .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de computer -pipe- 30.03.2008 new data law could benefit music pirates großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : things were a bit simpler for the music industry before the internet germany 's music industry fears that a new telephone data law could become a carte blanche for internet users , who download tunes illegally .
until now , they 've traced music pirates with the help of phone records . the agony of the recorded-music industry as it fights the " world of free " on the internet may have become a little more painful in germany this month , with a court ruling that seems to restrict surveillance of web users . following the example set by the recording industry association of america -lrb- riaa -rrb- , the german music companies have been tracking down web users , mostly 15 to 30 years old , who download music in breach of copyright . it reports them to the police . the industry in western europe 's most populous nation says it employs 98 sleuths working 24 hours a day .
working from crack computers in a bland hamburg office building , they collect the downloaders ' internet protocol numbers - a kind of internet phone number - and the times and dates that they were observed . is pirating music a serious crime ? bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : just how much information should be made available to piracy fighters and police ?
to link an ip number to a user , police have to have access to phone-company records . however that may prove difficult in the light of a march 19 constitutional court ruling that police can only obtain telephone company data to uncover serious crimes .
copying music on the internet may not be considered serious enough . a debate in the united states on reforming copyright laws to encourage freer exchange has only echoed quietly in germany .
but eco , the german internet business association , welcomed the court ruling as a rebuff to music-industry snooping . eco promotes new ways of earning money online and has been critical of the music industry .
in both europe and north america , the industry has been accused of failing to adapt to the internet age and the web 's culture of sharing communities .
critics describe the major labels as dinosaurs , likely to go the same way as telegraph companies : extinct . sharing info was " established practice " the music industry declared confidence that it could continue to pursue the " bootleggers " under legislation that took effect at the start of this year , making it an offense in germany to download music from sites that are obviously not the legal owners . dieter gorny , chief of the german music federation , which funds the hunt , said it was " established practice " for public prosecutors to obtain names and addresses of telephone company customers which matched known ip numbers and monitored times of use . gorny insisted that the constitutional court had only restricted police use of data about two-way contacts , such as telephone numbers called or the recipients ' addresses for e-mails , as well as the duration of phone calls . this position has yet to be tested in the courts , but this fine distinction may not convince some judges , who may see the constitutional court as sheltering file sharers as well . property versus privacy rights in the past year , some media companies have agreed to free up copying , and have abandoned software known as digital rights management -lrb- drm -rrb- , which is designed to prevent copying but annoys many customers . gorny insisted that protecting the industry 's intellectual property rights had nothing to do with any privacy issues , although many of the 30,000 people who brought this week 's class-action case said they were concerned about surveillance by big business . " we support privacy , but privacy should not be used as an invisibility cloak for copyright breaches on the internet , " gorny said . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : an estimated 312 million music tracks were illegally downloaded in germany last year the music federation argues that its pursuit of downloaders is not conducted under the legislation which was partially stayed this month , requiring data retention by telephone companies for six months as a tool to track down terrorism and other serious crime . the federation says it relies on section 113 of the german telecommunications law , which requires phone companies to release customer names and addresses to police who are investigating a witnessed offense . sony forced to reinvent itself last year alone , 312 million music tracks were illegally downloaded in germany , the federation says . the peak time of the week for bootleggers is sunday afternoons when young users take time off from their studies to replenish their music collections .
some studies claim that as much as 70 percent of all internet traffic is file-swapping of video and music tracks . sony bmg , one of the biggest labels , says the recordings market has shrunk by 40 percent with the advent of file sharing . edgar berger , head of sony bmg germany , advocates banning the downloaders from the internet .
but he said this month that sony bmg had an alternative plan if it could not stop the bootleggers : reducing its dependence on recordings sales . his firm is remaking itself as an " entertainment company , " with revenues from live performances , merchandising and the like soon to equal income from recordings , he said . dw staff / dpa -lrb- kjb -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

now , the last estate of a german-speaking writer held in private hands could be sold off . nearly every german has heard of winnetou or old shatterhand - some of german writer karl may 's most famous figures .
for some of the older generation , the names trigger memories of childhood afternoons spent immersed in may 's tales . but for lothar schmid , it 's all more than just a memory - it 's his life .
the 79-year-old senior manager of karl may verlag -lrb- karl may publishing -rrb- recently explained at the leipzig book fair how his father founded the publishing company in radebeul , near the eastern city of dresden , in 1913 . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : writer karl may lived and worked in radebeul he also descibed how his father 's three sons managed to rescue the legacy of karl may from the chaos of world war ii and the soviet occupation , and resettle the publishing company in bamberg , where karl may 's original manuscripts are kept . " there are only a few of the originals still left , including ' winnetou iv , ' which does not have all of the adventure and action of ' winnetou i-iii , " ' schmid said .
" winnetou iv is more of a symbolic work in which may wrote about native americans and white people and generally about the hero winnetou . " the archive also contains other manuscripts , letters , notes and musical scores : karl may not only wrote , he also sometimes composed . splitting up the estate lothar schmid 's two brothers started thinking about selling their shares in the publishing company at the beginning of the 1990s .
but at the time , lothar did everything in his power to keep karl may 's estate from falling into private hands .
he invested all of his money and took out a loan of one million deutsche marks -lrb- about 500,000 euros or $ 777,775 -rrb- to buy out his brothers . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : a fan at the karl may museum in radebeul now , schmid wants to rid himself of the financial burden and retire at last .
he hopes to sell the estate to the eastern state of saxony , where may was born - for 15 million euros . schmid said that the estate was worth twice that amount . " the effective worth can normally be estimated by making comparisons with other authors - franz kafka , for instance , who was an ingenious author , but who was not nearly as widely read as may , " schmid said , adding that such a comparison would show that the price of the may estate should actually be double of what he is asking . estimates of worth vary widely volker wahl , director of the thueringia state archive , who has also researched may 's estate , can not tolerate those sorts of analogies . " you can not make comparisons like that , " he said .
" karl may and franz kafka are two completely different types of writers .
i do not even want to make judgements about the varying literary quality of their work ; they are simply not comparable .

now , the last estate of a german-speaking writer held in private hands could be sold off . nearly every german has heard of winnetou or old shatterhand - some of german writer karl may 's most famous figures .
for some of the older generation , the names trigger memories of childhood afternoons spent immersed in may 's tales . but for lothar schmid , it 's all more than just a memory - it 's his life .
the 79-year-old senior manager of karl may verlag -lrb- karl may publishing -rrb- recently explained at the leipzig book fair how his father founded the publishing company in radebeul , near the eastern city of dresden , in 1913 . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : writer karl may lived and worked in radebeul he also descibed how his father 's three sons managed to rescue the legacy of karl may from the chaos of world war ii and the soviet occupation , and resettle the publishing company in bamberg , where karl may 's original manuscripts are kept . " there are only a few of the originals still left , including ' winnetou iv , ' which does not have all of the adventure and action of ' winnetou i-iii , " ' schmid said .
" winnetou iv is more of a symbolic work in which may wrote about native americans and white people and generally about the hero winnetou . " the archive also contains other manuscripts , letters , notes and musical scores : karl may not only wrote , he also sometimes composed . splitting up the estate lothar schmid 's two brothers started thinking about selling their shares in the publishing company at the beginning of the 1990s .
but at the time , lothar did everything in his power to keep karl may 's estate from falling into private hands .
he invested all of his money and took out a loan of one million deutsche marks -lrb- about 500,000 euros or $ 777,775 -rrb- to buy out his brothers . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : a fan at the karl may museum in radebeul now , schmid wants to rid himself of the financial burden and retire at last .
he hopes to sell the estate to the eastern state of saxony , where may was born - for 15 million euros . schmid said that the estate was worth twice that amount . " the effective worth can normally be estimated by making comparisons with other authors - franz kafka , for instance , who was an ingenious author , but who was not nearly as widely read as may , " schmid said , adding that such a comparison would show that the price of the may estate should actually be double of what he is asking . estimates of worth vary widely volker wahl , director of the thueringia state archive , who has also researched may 's estate , can not tolerate those sorts of analogies . " you can not make comparisons like that , " he said .
" karl may and franz kafka are two completely different types of writers .
i do not even want to make judgements about the varying literary quality of their work ; they are simply not comparable . " " may 's winnetou manuscript is no more comparable to kafka 's ' the trial " than goethe 's ' faust ' is , " he added . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : another winnetou actor during a presentation of the karl may play " unter geiern " wahl is critical of schmid 's price demand , and believes may 's estate is not worth more than one million euros - an estimate supported by an expert report commissioned by the state government of saxony , which looked at the cultural-historical value .

there may always be someone there to lend a helping hand , but will the dozens of residents actually get along ? the walls in the stairwell have n't been plastered yet , the elevator squeaks and the yard is full of tools .
the two-year building project is drawing to a close but there 's still a lot to do .
this is n't an ordinary house , but three large complexes . sixty-six people have already moved in - families , couples , mothers , singles , widows and pensioner who no longer want to live alone . the residents of the multiple-generation living project " amaryllis " in bonn are interested to see how it will all turn out . a network of helping hands bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : resident helga ahrenhoevel said she 'd like to teach the kids in the community to crochet " i 'm definitely not a fairy tale grandma , " said 74-year-old helga ahrenhoevel , " but i think it would be good if i could teach the children how to knit or crochet . "
the " children " are not her grandchildren but her housemates . it 's practically unheard of in germany these days to have grandparents living in the same house as their children and grandchildren .
only two out of every 100 households are made up of multiple generations . but as larger families disappear , so do the practical everyday benefits that come with them .
who takes care of the children when their parents have to work ?
who 'll help the elderly woman with her shopping bags ?
and who 'll lend their car to someone who does n't have one ? the residents of the bonn living project take a pragmatic view .
each one can choose where to live within the complex - in a more private apartment , in a house , or with roommates . most importantly , there is always an opportunity to come together , " whether it 's a game evening with the kids or a deep conversation with my neighbor , " said 44-year-old jochen lampe , who uses a wheelchair . for lampe , the only alternative to his new community would be a nursing home . " there i would miss the social component that i have here , " he said .
" there are so many helping hands here . " single households on the rise bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : if it were n't for the community , lampe would have to go to a nursing home the notion of people of different ages , and who are not relatives , living under one roof is unusual in europe .
the trend toward one- or two-person households is increasing , and not only in germany .
in scandinavian countries , there are already more single than multiple-person households . only in spain , ireland and portugal , the average household includes three people .
but even in these countries , it 's become uncommon for more than two generations to live together . for the residents in bonn , it 's often the little things that they look forward to in their new environment : the sound of children playing , sharing a meal , chatting with a neighbor .
but expectations are also kept within bounds . " you just ca n't be equally good friends with everyone here , " said anneke burger , who lives in the community with her husband and three children .

now , the last estate of a german-speaking writer held in private hands could be sold off . nearly every german has heard of winnetou or old shatterhand - some of german writer karl may 's most famous figures .
for some of the older generation , the names trigger memories of childhood afternoons spent immersed in may 's tales . but for lothar schmid , it 's all more than just a memory - it 's his life .
the 79-year-old senior manager of karl may verlag -lrb- karl may publishing -rrb- recently explained at the leipzig book fair how his father founded the publishing company in radebeul , near the eastern city of dresden , in 1913 . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : writer karl may lived and worked in radebeul he also descibed how his father 's three sons managed to rescue the legacy of karl may from the chaos of world war ii and the soviet occupation , and resettle the publishing company in bamberg , where karl may 's original manuscripts are kept . " there are only a few of the originals still left , including ' winnetou iv , ' which does not have all of the adventure and action of ' winnetou i-iii , " ' schmid said .
" winnetou iv is more of a symbolic work in which may wrote about native americans and white people and generally about the hero winnetou . " the archive also contains other manuscripts , letters , notes and musical scores : karl may not only wrote , he also sometimes composed . splitting up the estate lothar schmid 's two brothers started thinking about selling their shares in the publishing company at the beginning of the 1990s .
but at the time , lothar did everything in his power to keep karl may 's estate from falling into private hands .
he invested all of his money and took out a loan of one million deutsche marks -lrb- about 500,000 euros or $ 777,775 -rrb- to buy out his brothers . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : a fan at the karl may museum in radebeul now , schmid wants to rid himself of the financial burden and retire at last .
he hopes to sell the estate to the eastern state of saxony , where may was born - for 15 million euros . schmid said that the estate was worth twice that amount . " the effective worth can normally be estimated by making comparisons with other authors - franz kafka , for instance , who was an ingenious author , but who was not nearly as widely read as may , " schmid said , adding that such a comparison would show that the price of the may estate should actually be double of what he is asking . estimates of worth vary widely volker wahl , director of the thueringia state archive , who has also researched may 's estate , can not tolerate those sorts of analogies . " you can not make comparisons like that , " he said .
" karl may and franz kafka are two completely different types of writers .
i do not even want to make judgements about the varying literary quality of their work ; they are simply not comparable . " " may 's winnetou manuscript is no more comparable to kafka 's ' the trial " than goethe 's ' faust ' is , " he added . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : another winnetou actor during a presentation of the karl may play " unter geiern " wahl is critical of schmid 's price demand , and believes may 's estate is not worth more than one million euros - an estimate supported by an expert report commissioned by the state government of saxony , which looked at the cultural-historical value . " lothar schmid went to an antiquarian bookseller in munich , who used completely different criteria to come up with the estimate of 15 million euros , " wahl said .
" he was basing it on assumptions of what could be paid for individual books at auctions . " at any rate , it looks unlikely that the state of saxony could pay the 15 million schmid is demanding , said state minister for science and culture , eva maria stange .
more negotiations are currently underway . should they fail , lothar schmid might just be forced to sell the works individually at auctions - which would see may originals scattered across the globe . christian werner -lrb- als -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

until now , they 've traced music pirates with the help of phone records . the agony of the recorded-music industry as it fights the " world of free " on the internet may have become a little more painful in germany this month , with a court ruling that seems to restrict surveillance of web users . following the example set by the recording industry association of america -lrb- riaa -rrb- , the german music companies have been tracking down web users , mostly 15 to 30 years old , who download music in breach of copyright . it reports them to the police . the industry in western europe 's most populous nation says it employs 98 sleuths working 24 hours a day .

copying music on the internet may not be considered serious enough . a debate in the united states on reforming copyright laws to encourage freer exchange has only echoed quietly in germany .

there may always be someone there to lend a helping hand , but will the dozens of residents actually get along ? the walls in the stairwell have n't been plastered yet , the elevator squeaks and the yard is full of tools .
the two-year building project is drawing to a close but there 's still a lot to do .
this is n't an ordinary house , but three large complexes . sixty-six people have already moved in - families , couples , mothers , singles , widows and pensioner who no longer want to live alone . the residents of the multiple-generation living project " amaryllis " in bonn are interested to see how it will all turn out . a network of helping hands bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : resident helga ahrenhoevel said she 'd like to teach the kids in the community to crochet " i 'm definitely not a fairy tale grandma , " said 74-year-old helga ahrenhoevel , " but i think it would be good if i could teach the children how to knit or crochet . "
the " children " are not her grandchildren but her housemates . it 's practically unheard of in germany these days to have grandparents living in the same house as their children and grandchildren .
only two out of every 100 households are made up of multiple generations . but as larger families disappear , so do the practical everyday benefits that come with them .
who takes care of the children when their parents have to work ?
who 'll help the elderly woman with her shopping bags ?
and who 'll lend their car to someone who does n't have one ? the residents of the bonn living project take a pragmatic view .
each one can choose where to live within the complex - in a more private apartment , in a house , or with roommates . most importantly , there is always an opportunity to come together , " whether it 's a game evening with the kids or a deep conversation with my neighbor , " said 44-year-old jochen lampe , who uses a wheelchair . for lampe , the only alternative to his new community would be a nursing home . " there i would miss the social component that i have here , " he said .
" there are so many helping hands here . " single households on the rise bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : if it were n't for the community , lampe would have to go to a nursing home the notion of people of different ages , and who are not relatives , living under one roof is unusual in europe .
the trend toward one- or two-person households is increasing , and not only in germany .
in scandinavian countries , there are already more single than multiple-person households . only in spain , ireland and portugal , the average household includes three people .
but even in these countries , it 's become uncommon for more than two generations to live together . for the residents in bonn , it 's often the little things that they look forward to in their new environment : the sound of children playing , sharing a meal , chatting with a neighbor .
but expectations are also kept within bounds . " you just ca n't be equally good friends with everyone here , " said anneke burger , who lives in the community with her husband and three children .

but eco , the german internet business association , welcomed the court ruling as a rebuff to music-industry snooping . eco promotes new ways of earning money online and has been critical of the music industry .
in both europe and north america , the industry has been accused of failing to adapt to the internet age and the web 's culture of sharing communities .
critics describe the major labels as dinosaurs , likely to go the same way as telegraph companies : extinct . sharing info was " established practice " the music industry declared confidence that it could continue to pursue the " bootleggers " under legislation that took effect at the start of this year , making it an offense in germany to download music from sites that are obviously not the legal owners . dieter gorny , chief of the german music federation , which funds the hunt , said it was " established practice " for public prosecutors to obtain names and addresses of telephone company customers which matched known ip numbers and monitored times of use . gorny insisted that the constitutional court had only restricted police use of data about two-way contacts , such as telephone numbers called or the recipients ' addresses for e-mails , as well as the duration of phone calls . this position has yet to be tested in the courts , but this fine distinction may not convince some judges , who may see the constitutional court as sheltering file sharers as well . property versus privacy rights in the past year , some media companies have agreed to free up copying , and have abandoned software known as digital rights management -lrb- drm -rrb- , which is designed to prevent copying but annoys many customers . gorny insisted that protecting the industry 's intellectual property rights had nothing to do with any privacy issues , although many of the 30,000 people who brought this week 's class-action case said they were concerned about surveillance by big business . " we support privacy , but privacy should not be used as an invisibility cloak for copyright breaches on the internet , " gorny said . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : an estimated 312 million music tracks were illegally downloaded in germany last year the music federation argues that its pursuit of downloaders is not conducted under the legislation which was partially stayed this month , requiring data retention by telephone companies for six months as a tool to track down terrorism and other serious crime . the federation says it relies on section 113 of the german telecommunications law , which requires phone companies to release customer names and addresses to police who are investigating a witnessed offense . sony forced to reinvent itself last year alone , 312 million music tracks were illegally downloaded in germany , the federation says . the peak time of the week for bootleggers is sunday afternoons when young users take time off from their studies to replenish their music collections .
some studies claim that as much as 70 percent of all internet traffic is file-swapping of video and music tracks . sony bmg , one of the biggest labels , says the recordings market has shrunk by 40 percent with the advent of file sharing . edgar berger , head of sony bmg germany , advocates banning the downloaders from the internet .
but he said this month that sony bmg had an alternative plan if it could not stop the bootleggers : reducing its dependence on recordings sales . his firm is remaking itself as an " entertainment company , " with revenues from live performances , merchandising and the like soon to equal income from recordings , he said . dw staff / dpa -lrb- kjb -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

there may always be someone there to lend a helping hand , but will the dozens of residents actually get along ? the walls in the stairwell have n't been plastered yet , the elevator squeaks and the yard is full of tools .
the two-year building project is drawing to a close but there 's still a lot to do .
this is n't an ordinary house , but three large complexes . sixty-six people have already moved in - families , couples , mothers , singles , widows and pensioner who no longer want to live alone . the residents of the multiple-generation living project " amaryllis " in bonn are interested to see how it will all turn out . a network of helping hands bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : resident helga ahrenhoevel said she 'd like to teach the kids in the community to crochet " i 'm definitely not a fairy tale grandma , " said 74-year-old helga ahrenhoevel , " but i think it would be good if i could teach the children how to knit or crochet . "
the " children " are not her grandchildren but her housemates . it 's practically unheard of in germany these days to have grandparents living in the same house as their children and grandchildren .
only two out of every 100 households are made up of multiple generations . but as larger families disappear , so do the practical everyday benefits that come with them .
who takes care of the children when their parents have to work ?
who 'll help the elderly woman with her shopping bags ?
and who 'll lend their car to someone who does n't have one ? the residents of the bonn living project take a pragmatic view .
each one can choose where to live within the complex - in a more private apartment , in a house , or with roommates . most importantly , there is always an opportunity to come together , " whether it 's a game evening with the kids or a deep conversation with my neighbor , " said 44-year-old jochen lampe , who uses a wheelchair . for lampe , the only alternative to his new community would be a nursing home . " there i would miss the social component that i have here , " he said .
" there are so many helping hands here . " single households on the rise bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : if it were n't for the community , lampe would have to go to a nursing home the notion of people of different ages , and who are not relatives , living under one roof is unusual in europe .
the trend toward one- or two-person households is increasing , and not only in germany .
in scandinavian countries , there are already more single than multiple-person households . only in spain , ireland and portugal , the average household includes three people .
but even in these countries , it 's become uncommon for more than two generations to live together . for the residents in bonn , it 's often the little things that they look forward to in their new environment : the sound of children playing , sharing a meal , chatting with a neighbor .
but expectations are also kept within bounds . " you just ca n't be equally good friends with everyone here , " said anneke burger , who lives in the community with her husband and three children .

there may always be someone there to lend a helping hand , but will the dozens of residents actually get along ? the walls in the stairwell have n't been plastered yet , the elevator squeaks and the yard is full of tools .
the two-year building project is drawing to a close but there 's still a lot to do .
this is n't an ordinary house , but three large complexes . sixty-six people have already moved in - families , couples , mothers , singles , widows and pensioner who no longer want to live alone . the residents of the multiple-generation living project " amaryllis " in bonn are interested to see how it will all turn out . a network of helping hands bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : resident helga ahrenhoevel said she 'd like to teach the kids in the community to crochet " i 'm definitely not a fairy tale grandma , " said 74-year-old helga ahrenhoevel , " but i think it would be good if i could teach the children how to knit or crochet . "
the " children " are not her grandchildren but her housemates . it 's practically unheard of in germany these days to have grandparents living in the same house as their children and grandchildren .
only two out of every 100 households are made up of multiple generations . but as larger families disappear , so do the practical everyday benefits that come with them .
who takes care of the children when their parents have to work ?
who 'll help the elderly woman with her shopping bags ?
and who 'll lend their car to someone who does n't have one ? the residents of the bonn living project take a pragmatic view .
each one can choose where to live within the complex - in a more private apartment , in a house , or with roommates . most importantly , there is always an opportunity to come together , " whether it 's a game evening with the kids or a deep conversation with my neighbor , " said 44-year-old jochen lampe , who uses a wheelchair . for lampe , the only alternative to his new community would be a nursing home .

in scandinavian countries , there are already more single than multiple-person households . only in spain , ireland and portugal , the average household includes three people .
but even in these countries , it 's become uncommon for more than two generations to live together . for the residents in bonn , it 's often the little things that they look forward to in their new environment : the sound of children playing , sharing a meal , chatting with a neighbor .

"
mackeben said wearing the robes was not compulsory as they are not part of the official german olympic kit for the august 8-24 games .
he insisted he will not breach the olympic charter and express his opinion on tibet outside olympic areas in the chinese capital .
a german network of athletes has the same in mind with a silicon armband in green and blue with the writing " sport for human rights . "
" we will express our protest during the games not in reference to tibet but in a general way concerning abiding to human rights and freedom of press , " said a statement on the network 's website .
" that is because the olympic charter outlaws any kind of political propaganda at the olympics . "
refusing to turn a blind eye bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : china is hopeing to present itself in the best possible light during the games canoeing olympic bronze-medallist stefan pfannmoeller , one of the initiators of the network , said that athletes can not turn a blind eye to the systematic abuse of human rights and freedom of press .
" as athletes we carry a big responsibility and must show it .
if not us , who else ? , " he said .
but the issue is delicate as athletes face punishment from the international olympic committee in the case of protest action in the olympic areas .
the olympic charter says in article 51 that " no kind of demonstration or political , religious or racial propaganda is permitted in any olympic sites , venues or other areas . "
violations can lead to disqualification and loss of olympic accreditation .
american sprinters tommie smith and john carlos were kicked out of the 1968 games after their black power protest at the 200m victory ceremony .

the script is by germans , uwe eric laufenberg and marcus mislin .
police in potsdam described the watch at the theater as a precaution , saying there had been no threats to the event .
some muslims have been upset by the production , suggesting that insulting islam was a gimmick to attract audiences .
germany 's various muslim groups have differed in their reactions , with one group , the central council of muslims , calling for calm .
though rushdie 's content was " insulting " to islam , " despite the common misconception , the majority of the world 's muslims have rejected censorship , " aiman mazyek , secretary general of the multi-ethnic council , said on friday .
attracting publicity bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : salmand rusdhie lived under police protection for many years german-born mazyek , 39 , a political science graduate , told radio multikulti , a station run by public broadcaster rbb , the subject matter had the potential to " insult religious people in general and muslims in particular . "
" these days , insulting islam is often used to attract publicity , " he said .
" sulking only played into the hands of those doing the insulting . "
" i say we should pursue a critical and constructive dialogue , " he said .
" one should explain that freedom of opinion and the arts is a prime value , but our values do not extend to insulting what is sacred to a religion . "
but ali kizilkaya , chairman of the islamic council of germany , a mainly turkish group , said the stage show was one of a series of increasingly frequent provocations that went beyond the bounds of ordinary debate .
" evidently it is becoming the fashion to insult islam , " he said in remarks quoted on friday by the newspaper schweriner volkszeitung .
freedom of the arts was " an important value " but the rule of respect also applied .
scandal sells bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : robert gallinowski -lrb- left -rrb- as gibril and tobias rott as saladin germans have shown only slight interest in rushdie 's theme , the dilemmas of indian expatriates in contemporary england , but have been fascinated by the scandal over the book and threats to assassinate the author in revenge for passages portraying the prophet mohammed .
in potsdam , the two main indian characters were played by tobias rott , as saladin and the devil , and robert gallinowski , as gibril and the archangel , whose interplay is the theme of the story .
the hot website said a cast of 12 germans was performing the world 's first stage adaptation of a work about " the battle between modernism and anti-modernism " and it would include the controversial climax with " a prophet named mahound . "

some muslims have been upset by the production , suggesting that insulting islam was a gimmick to attract audiences .
germany 's various muslim groups have differed in their reactions , with one group , the central council of muslims , calling for calm .

there may always be someone there to lend a helping hand , but will the dozens of residents actually get along ? the walls in the stairwell have n't been plastered yet , the elevator squeaks and the yard is full of tools .
the two-year building project is drawing to a close but there 's still a lot to do .
this is n't an ordinary house , but three large complexes . sixty-six people have already moved in - families , couples , mothers , singles , widows and pensioner who no longer want to live alone . the residents of the multiple-generation living project " amaryllis " in bonn are interested to see how it will all turn out . a network of helping hands bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : resident helga ahrenhoevel said she 'd like to teach the kids in the community to crochet " i 'm definitely not a fairy tale grandma , " said 74-year-old helga ahrenhoevel , " but i think it would be good if i could teach the children how to knit or crochet . "
the " children " are not her grandchildren but her housemates . it 's practically unheard of in germany these days to have grandparents living in the same house as their children and grandchildren .
only two out of every 100 households are made up of multiple generations . but as larger families disappear , so do the practical everyday benefits that come with them .
who takes care of the children when their parents have to work ?
who 'll help the elderly woman with her shopping bags ?
and who 'll lend their car to someone who does n't have one ? the residents of the bonn living project take a pragmatic view .
each one can choose where to live within the complex - in a more private apartment , in a house , or with roommates . most importantly , there is always an opportunity to come together , " whether it 's a game evening with the kids or a deep conversation with my neighbor , " said 44-year-old jochen lampe , who uses a wheelchair . for lampe , the only alternative to his new community would be a nursing home .

in scandinavian countries , there are already more single than multiple-person households . only in spain , ireland and portugal , the average household includes three people .
but even in these countries , it 's become uncommon for more than two generations to live together . for the residents in bonn , it 's often the little things that they look forward to in their new environment : the sound of children playing , sharing a meal , chatting with a neighbor .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de computer -pipe- 30.03.2008 new data law could benefit music pirates großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : things were a bit simpler for the music industry before the internet germany 's music industry fears that a new telephone data law could become a carte blanche for internet users , who download tunes illegally .
until now , they 've traced music pirates with the help of phone records . the agony of the recorded-music industry as it fights the " world of free " on the internet may have become a little more painful in germany this month , with a court ruling that seems to restrict surveillance of web users . following the example set by the recording industry association of america -lrb- riaa -rrb- , the german music companies have been tracking down web users , mostly 15 to 30 years old , who download music in breach of copyright . it reports them to the police . the industry in western europe 's most populous nation says it employs 98 sleuths working 24 hours a day .
working from crack computers in a bland hamburg office building , they collect the downloaders ' internet protocol numbers - a kind of internet phone number - and the times and dates that they were observed . is pirating music a serious crime ? bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : just how much information should be made available to piracy fighters and police ?
to link an ip number to a user , police have to have access to phone-company records . however that may prove difficult in the light of a march 19 constitutional court ruling that police can only obtain telephone company data to uncover serious crimes .
copying music on the internet may not be considered serious enough . a debate in the united states on reforming copyright laws to encourage freer exchange has only echoed quietly in germany .
but eco , the german internet business association , welcomed the court ruling as a rebuff to music-industry snooping . eco promotes new ways of earning money online and has been critical of the music industry .
in both europe and north america , the industry has been accused of failing to adapt to the internet age and the web 's culture of sharing communities .
critics describe the major labels as dinosaurs , likely to go the same way as telegraph companies : extinct . sharing info was " established practice " the music industry declared confidence that it could continue to pursue the " bootleggers " under legislation that took effect at the start of this year , making it an offense in germany to download music from sites that are obviously not the legal owners . dieter gorny , chief of the german music federation , which funds the hunt , said it was " established practice " for public prosecutors to obtain names and addresses of telephone company customers which matched known ip numbers and monitored times of use . gorny insisted that the constitutional court had only restricted police use of data about two-way contacts , such as telephone numbers called or the recipients ' addresses for e-mails , as well as the duration of phone calls . this position has yet to be tested in the courts , but this fine distinction may not convince some judges , who may see the constitutional court as sheltering file sharers as well . property versus privacy rights in the past year , some media companies have agreed to free up copying , and have abandoned software known as digital rights management -lrb- drm -rrb- , which is designed to prevent copying but annoys many customers . gorny insisted that protecting the industry 's intellectual property rights had nothing to do with any privacy issues , although many of the 30,000 people who brought this week 's class-action case said they were concerned about surveillance by big business .

some studies claim that as much as 70 percent of all internet traffic is file-swapping of video and music tracks . sony bmg , one of the biggest labels , says the recordings market has shrunk by 40 percent with the advent of file sharing . edgar berger , head of sony bmg germany , advocates banning the downloaders from the internet .
but he said this month that sony bmg had an alternative plan if it could not stop the bootleggers : reducing its dependence on recordings sales . his firm is remaking itself as an " entertainment company , " with revenues from live performances , merchandising and the like soon to equal income from recordings , he said . dw staff / dpa -lrb- kjb -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

now , the last estate of a german-speaking writer held in private hands could be sold off . nearly every german has heard of winnetou or old shatterhand - some of german writer karl may 's most famous figures .
for some of the older generation , the names trigger memories of childhood afternoons spent immersed in may 's tales . but for lothar schmid , it 's all more than just a memory - it 's his life .
the 79-year-old senior manager of karl may verlag -lrb- karl may publishing -rrb- recently explained at the leipzig book fair how his father founded the publishing company in radebeul , near the eastern city of dresden , in 1913 . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : writer karl may lived and worked in radebeul he also descibed how his father 's three sons managed to rescue the legacy of karl may from the chaos of world war ii and the soviet occupation , and resettle the publishing company in bamberg , where karl may 's original manuscripts are kept . " there are only a few of the originals still left , including ' winnetou iv , ' which does not have all of the adventure and action of ' winnetou i-iii , " ' schmid said .
" winnetou iv is more of a symbolic work in which may wrote about native americans and white people and generally about the hero winnetou . " the archive also contains other manuscripts , letters , notes and musical scores : karl may not only wrote , he also sometimes composed . splitting up the estate lothar schmid 's two brothers started thinking about selling their shares in the publishing company at the beginning of the 1990s .
but at the time , lothar did everything in his power to keep karl may 's estate from falling into private hands .
he invested all of his money and took out a loan of one million deutsche marks -lrb- about 500,000 euros or $ 777,775 -rrb- to buy out his brothers . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : a fan at the karl may museum in radebeul now , schmid wants to rid himself of the financial burden and retire at last .
he hopes to sell the estate to the eastern state of saxony , where may was born - for 15 million euros . schmid said that the estate was worth twice that amount . " the effective worth can normally be estimated by making comparisons with other authors - franz kafka , for instance , who was an ingenious author , but who was not nearly as widely read as may , " schmid said , adding that such a comparison would show that the price of the may estate should actually be double of what he is asking . estimates of worth vary widely volker wahl , director of the thueringia state archive , who has also researched may 's estate , can not tolerate those sorts of analogies . " you can not make comparisons like that , " he said .
" karl may and franz kafka are two completely different types of writers .
i do not even want to make judgements about the varying literary quality of their work ; they are simply not comparable . " " may 's winnetou manuscript is no more comparable to kafka 's ' the trial " than goethe 's ' faust ' is , " he added . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : another winnetou actor during a presentation of the karl may play " unter geiern " wahl is critical of schmid 's price demand , and believes may 's estate is not worth more than one million euros - an estimate supported by an expert report commissioned by the state government of saxony , which looked at the cultural-historical value . " lothar schmid went to an antiquarian bookseller in munich , who used completely different criteria to come up with the estimate of 15 million euros , " wahl said .
" he was basing it on assumptions of what could be paid for individual books at auctions . " at any rate , it looks unlikely that the state of saxony could pay the 15 million schmid is demanding , said state minister for science and culture , eva maria stange .
more negotiations are currently underway . should they fail , lothar schmid might just be forced to sell the works individually at auctions - which would see may originals scattered across the globe . christian werner -lrb- als -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

the script is by germans , uwe eric laufenberg and marcus mislin .
police in potsdam described the watch at the theater as a precaution , saying there had been no threats to the event .
some muslims have been upset by the production , suggesting that insulting islam was a gimmick to attract audiences .
germany 's various muslim groups have differed in their reactions , with one group , the central council of muslims , calling for calm .
though rushdie 's content was " insulting " to islam , " despite the common misconception , the majority of the world 's muslims have rejected censorship , " aiman mazyek , secretary general of the multi-ethnic council , said on friday .
attracting publicity bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : salmand rusdhie lived under police protection for many years german-born mazyek , 39 , a political science graduate , told radio multikulti , a station run by public broadcaster rbb , the subject matter had the potential to " insult religious people in general and muslims in particular . "
" these days , insulting islam is often used to attract publicity , " he said .
" sulking only played into the hands of those doing the insulting . "
" i say we should pursue a critical and constructive dialogue , " he said .
" one should explain that freedom of opinion and the arts is a prime value , but our values do not extend to insulting what is sacred to a religion . "
but ali kizilkaya , chairman of the islamic council of germany , a mainly turkish group , said the stage show was one of a series of increasingly frequent provocations that went beyond the bounds of ordinary debate .
" evidently it is becoming the fashion to insult islam , " he said in remarks quoted on friday by the newspaper schweriner volkszeitung .
freedom of the arts was " an important value " but the rule of respect also applied .
scandal sells bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : robert gallinowski -lrb- left -rrb- as gibril and tobias rott as saladin germans have shown only slight interest in rushdie 's theme , the dilemmas of indian expatriates in contemporary england , but have been fascinated by the scandal over the book and threats to assassinate the author in revenge for passages portraying the prophet mohammed .
in potsdam , the two main indian characters were played by tobias rott , as saladin and the devil , and robert gallinowski , as gibril and the archangel , whose interplay is the theme of the story .
the hot website said a cast of 12 germans was performing the world 's first stage adaptation of a work about " the battle between modernism and anti-modernism " and it would include the controversial climax with " a prophet named mahound . "
rushdie has frequently visited germany and lectured at writers ' conferences .
under a shiite iranian fatwa or edict issued in iran in 1989 , it was declared right to murder him .
as a result , for many years he had police bodyguards . dpa news agency -lrb- tt -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

it went dark in main government buildings between 2000 and 2100 gmt on saturday to support " earth hour " .
the symbolic campaign was launched last year in sydney , australia , and 24 cities are taking part on saturday .
environment minister jane davidson said it was a " simple yet powerful way " to show how everyone can play their part .
the minister said : " climate change is one of the greatest challenges we all face today and cutting down on the energy we use will be one of the most effective ways to reduce the c02 emissions that contribute to climate change . "
assembly government offices in cathays park , cardiff , merthyr tydfil , carmarthen , llandrindod wells , caernarfon and colwyn bay all took part in the one-hour blackout .
other offices also took part where the assembly government has direct control over lighting .
last march , 2.2m people and 2,100 businesses in sydney switched off for earth hour , and this year the city has taken part in the initiative again .
the welsh assembly government said sydney 's inspirational collective effort reduced the city 's energy consumption by a " whopping 10.2 % during that hour - equivalent to taking 48,000 cars off the road " .
the assembly government said earth hour was about simple changes that would " collectively make a difference - from businesses turning off their lights when their offices are empty , to households turning off appliances rather than leaving them on standby . "
some assembly government offices share sites with other organisations , but before the blackout officials said it would ensure that its lights go off at the designated time .
there were some exceptions for health and safety and security requirements , and traffic management centres at coryton and morfa were not taking part because they are an essential 24-hour operation .

it went dark in main government buildings between 2000 and 2100 gmt on saturday to support " earth hour " .
the symbolic campaign was launched last year in sydney , australia , and 24 cities are taking part on saturday .
environment minister jane davidson said it was a " simple yet powerful way " to show how everyone can play their part .
the minister said : " climate change is one of the greatest challenges we all face today and cutting down on the energy we use will be one of the most effective ways to reduce the c02 emissions that contribute to climate change . "
assembly government offices in cathays park , cardiff , merthyr tydfil , carmarthen , llandrindod wells , caernarfon and colwyn bay all took part in the one-hour blackout .
the lights went out across sydney harbour bridge other offices also took part where the assembly government has direct control over lighting .
last march , 2.2m people and 2,100 businesses in sydney switched off for earth hour , and this year the city has taken part in the initiative again .
the welsh assembly government said sydney 's inspirational collective effort reduced the city 's energy consumption by a " whopping 10.2 % during that hour - equivalent to taking 48,000 cars off the road " .
the assembly government said earth hour was about simple changes that would " collectively make a difference - from businesses turning off their lights when their offices are empty , to households turning off appliances rather than leaving them on standby . "
some assembly government offices share sites with other organisations , but before the blackout officials said it would ensure that its lights go off at the designated time .
there were some exceptions for health and safety and security requirements , and traffic management centres at coryton and morfa were not taking part because they are an essential 24-hour operation .

almost 300 flights in and out of heathrow airport were cancelled during the first five days as teething problems at the new terminal 5 caused chaos .
but what went wrong on that fateful first day ?
passengers at t5 have not been getting the expected prompt service the problems appear to be due to a combination of factors .
some were technical , involving glitches with the sophisticated new baggage set-up , which is designed to handle 12,000 bags an hour .
but other issues were more mundane .
employees arriving for work , for example , could not find their way to the staff car park .
see where problems developed at terminal 5 ba has said " initial teething problems " with car parking , delays in getting staff through security screening and staff familiarisation had resulted in a backlog of baggage which meant severe delays and flight cancellations over the days that followed .
the first warning signs came as early as 0400 gmt on thursday when passengers began to arrive , only to be confronted with the same problems as the staff in trying to find somewhere to park .
the road signs were apparently not clear outside the terminal , and people said they were given wrong directions once inside .
but that was only the start of their problems .
all the check-in desks were apparently closed at 0400 gmt , leaving passengers no option other than to form a queue .
then , when one was finally opened , the resulting rush was " chaos " according to one would-be flyer .
warning signs the first flight arrived at t5 from hong kong at 0442 gmt , slightly ahead of schedule , but its passengers faced a delay of about an hour to collect their bags .
the problems began to mount and by 0630 gmt a queue of about 300 people waiting to board flights had formed , another passenger said .
as the morning wore on , some passengers had to wait up to two-and-a-half hours to collect their suitcases from baggage reclaim .
an underground conveyor system had become clogged up , according to the bbc 's transport correspondent tom symonds .
this was being blamed on staff failing to remove luggage quickly enough at the final unloading stage .
further technical faults also meant seven flights also had to leave t5 without luggage on board .
check-in suspended by thursday lunchtime the cumulative effect meant ba had to cancel 20 flights .
by early afternoon , a queue of more than 100 people whose flights had been cancelled , stood in line to try to get away on other flights or get refunds .
to make matters worse , the luggage belt in one part of the departure lounge failed .
at about 1630 gmt , all check-in at the new ba terminal 5 was suspended because of further problems with the baggage system .
long queues were also building up around that time at the fast-bag drop desks , where passengers leave their luggage after checking in using computer terminals .
by about 1700 gmt , ba suspended the checking in of all luggage going into the hold .
this meant passengers already at the airport had the choice of either flying with just hand luggage , getting an alternative flight or claiming a refund .
by the end of t5 's first traumatic day , a total of 34 flights had been cancelled and hundreds of passengers had been left stranded , either for a flight or even for their bags .
by saturday , ba said at least 15,000 bags were stranded at heathrow - with one source telling the bbc that the number may have been closer to 20,000 .
while the airline says it is working to clear the bag backlog , how long it will take for ba to work off the negative publicity caused by the fiasco remains to be seen .

almost 300 flights in and out of heathrow airport were cancelled during the first five days as teething problems at the new terminal 5 caused chaos .
but what went wrong on that fateful first day ?
passengers at t5 have not been getting the expected prompt service the problems appear to be due to a combination of factors .
some were technical , involving glitches with the sophisticated new baggage set-up , which is designed to handle 12,000 bags an hour .
but other issues were more mundane .
employees arriving for work , for example , could not find their way to the staff car park .
see where problems developed at terminal 5 ba has said " initial teething problems " with car parking , delays in getting staff through security screening and staff familiarisation had resulted in a backlog of baggage which meant severe delays and flight cancellations over the days that followed .
the first warning signs came as early as 0400 gmt on thursday when passengers began to arrive , only to be confronted with the same problems as the staff in trying to find somewhere to park .
the road signs were apparently not clear outside the terminal , and people said they were given wrong directions once inside .
but that was only the start of their problems .
all the check-in desks were apparently closed at 0400 gmt , leaving passengers no option other than to form a queue .
then , when one was finally opened , the resulting rush was " chaos " according to one would-be flyer .
warning signs the first flight arrived at t5 from hong kong at 0442 gmt , slightly ahead of schedule , but its passengers faced a delay of about an hour to collect their bags .
the problems began to mount and by 0630 gmt a queue of about 300 people waiting to board flights had formed , another passenger said .
as the morning wore on , some passengers had to wait up to two-and-a-half hours to collect their suitcases from baggage reclaim .
an underground conveyor system had become clogged up , according to the bbc 's transport correspondent tom symonds .
this was being blamed on staff failing to remove luggage quickly enough at the final unloading stage .
further technical faults also meant seven flights also had to leave t5 without luggage on board .
check-in suspended by thursday lunchtime the cumulative effect meant ba had to cancel 20 flights .
by early afternoon , a queue of more than 100 people whose flights had been cancelled , stood in line to try to get away on other flights or get refunds .
to make matters worse , the luggage belt in one part of the departure lounge failed .
at about 1630 gmt , all check-in at the new ba terminal 5 was suspended because of further problems with the baggage system .
long queues were also building up around that time at the fast-bag drop desks , where passengers leave their luggage after checking in using computer terminals .
by about 1700 gmt , ba suspended the checking in of all luggage going into the hold .
this meant passengers already at the airport had the choice of either flying with just hand luggage , getting an alternative flight or claiming a refund .
by the end of t5 's first traumatic day , a total of 34 flights had been cancelled and hundreds of passengers had been left stranded , either for a flight or even for their bags .
by saturday , ba said at least 15,000 bags were stranded at heathrow - with one source telling the bbc that the number may have been closer to 20,000 .
while the airline says it is working to clear the bag backlog , how long it will take for ba to work off the negative publicity caused by the fiasco remains to be seen .

almost 300 flights in and out of heathrow airport were cancelled during the first five days as teething problems at the new terminal 5 caused chaos .
but what went wrong on that fateful first day ?
passengers at t5 have not been getting the expected prompt service the problems appear to be due to a combination of factors .
some were technical , involving glitches with the sophisticated new baggage set-up , which is designed to handle 12,000 bags an hour .
but other issues were more mundane .
employees arriving for work , for example , could not find their way to the staff car park .
see where problems developed at terminal 5 ba has said " initial teething problems " with car parking , delays in getting staff through security screening and staff familiarisation had resulted in a backlog of baggage which meant severe delays and flight cancellations over the days that followed .
the first warning signs came as early as 0400 gmt on thursday when passengers began to arrive , only to be confronted with the same problems as the staff in trying to find somewhere to park .
the road signs were apparently not clear outside the terminal , and people said they were given wrong directions once inside .
but that was only the start of their problems .
all the check-in desks were apparently closed at 0400 gmt , leaving passengers no option other than to form a queue .
then , when one was finally opened , the resulting rush was " chaos " according to one would-be flyer .
warning signs the first flight arrived at t5 from hong kong at 0442 gmt , slightly ahead of schedule , but its passengers faced a delay of about an hour to collect their bags .
the problems began to mount and by 0630 gmt a queue of about 300 people waiting to board flights had formed , another passenger said .
as the morning wore on , some passengers had to wait up to two-and-a-half hours to collect their suitcases from baggage reclaim .
an underground conveyor system had become clogged up , according to the bbc 's transport correspondent tom symonds .
this was being blamed on staff failing to remove luggage quickly enough at the final unloading stage .
further technical faults also meant seven flights also had to leave t5 without luggage on board .
check-in suspended by thursday lunchtime the cumulative effect meant ba had to cancel 20 flights .
by early afternoon , a queue of more than 100 people whose flights had been cancelled , stood in line to try to get away on other flights or get refunds .
to make matters worse , the luggage belt in one part of the departure lounge failed .
at about 1630 gmt , all check-in at the new ba terminal 5 was suspended because of further problems with the baggage system .
long queues were also building up around that time at the fast-bag drop desks , where passengers leave their luggage after checking in using computer terminals .
by about 1700 gmt , ba suspended the checking in of all luggage going into the hold .
this meant passengers already at the airport had the choice of either flying with just hand luggage , getting an alternative flight or claiming a refund .
by the end of t5 's first traumatic day , a total of 34 flights had been cancelled and hundreds of passengers had been left stranded , either for a flight or even for their bags .
by saturday , ba said at least 15,000 bags were stranded at heathrow - with one source telling the bbc that the number may have been closer to 20,000 .
while the airline says it is working to clear the bag backlog , how long it will take for ba to work off the negative publicity caused by the fiasco remains to be seen .

almost 300 flights in and out of heathrow airport were cancelled during the first five days as teething problems at the new terminal 5 caused chaos .
but what went wrong on that fateful first day ?
passengers at t5 have not been getting the expected prompt service the problems appear to be due to a combination of factors .
some were technical , involving glitches with the sophisticated new baggage set-up , which is designed to handle 12,000 bags an hour .
but other issues were more mundane .
employees arriving for work , for example , could not find their way to the staff car park .
see where problems developed at terminal 5 ba has said " initial teething problems " with car parking , delays in getting staff through security screening and staff familiarisation had resulted in a backlog of baggage which meant severe delays and flight cancellations over the days that followed .
the first warning signs came as early as 0400 gmt on thursday when passengers began to arrive , only to be confronted with the same problems as the staff in trying to find somewhere to park .
the road signs were apparently not clear outside the terminal , and people said they were given wrong directions once inside .
but that was only the start of their problems .
all the check-in desks were apparently closed at 0400 gmt , leaving passengers no option other than to form a queue .
then , when one was finally opened , the resulting rush was " chaos " according to one would-be flyer .
warning signs the first flight arrived at t5 from hong kong at 0442 gmt , slightly ahead of schedule , but its passengers faced a delay of about an hour to collect their bags .
the problems began to mount and by 0630 gmt a queue of about 300 people waiting to board flights had formed , another passenger said .
as the morning wore on , some passengers had to wait up to two-and-a-half hours to collect their suitcases from baggage reclaim .
an underground conveyor system had become clogged up , according to the bbc 's transport correspondent tom symonds .
this was being blamed on staff failing to remove luggage quickly enough at the final unloading stage .
further technical faults also meant seven flights also had to leave t5 without luggage on board .
check-in suspended by thursday lunchtime the cumulative effect meant ba had to cancel 20 flights .
by early afternoon , a queue of more than 100 people whose flights had been cancelled , stood in line to try to get away on other flights or get refunds .
to make matters worse , the luggage belt in one part of the departure lounge failed .
at about 1630 gmt , all check-in at the new ba terminal 5 was suspended because of further problems with the baggage system .
long queues were also building up around that time at the fast-bag drop desks , where passengers leave their luggage after checking in using computer terminals .
by about 1700 gmt , ba suspended the checking in of all luggage going into the hold .
this meant passengers already at the airport had the choice of either flying with just hand luggage , getting an alternative flight or claiming a refund .
by the end of t5 's first traumatic day , a total of 34 flights had been cancelled and hundreds of passengers had been left stranded , either for a flight or even for their bags .
by saturday , ba said at least 15,000 bags were stranded at heathrow - with one source telling the bbc that the number may have been closer to 20,000 .
while the airline says it is working to clear the bag backlog , how long it will take for ba to work off the negative publicity caused by the fiasco remains to be seen .
