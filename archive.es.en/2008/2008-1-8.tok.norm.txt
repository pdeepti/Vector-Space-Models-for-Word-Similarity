the club has said the machines could be easily manipulated . eight different cities and districts have planned to use voting computers for the jan .
27 state parliament election in hesse .
the computers are intended to replace paper ballots for for about 100,000 of the states 4.3 million voters . but one voter in hesse has taken the lead , along with members of the chaos computer club -lrb- ccc -rrb- , and filed an injunction with the hesse state supreme court against the use of voting computers in the forthcoming election . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : electronic voting machines were used in saxony-anhalt in 2002 ccc members said voting computers violate basic principles of electoral law by making it impossible to verify or recount ballots .
the hacker group also pointed to hard and software manipulation vulnerability among computer voting machines by the manufacturer nedap . the dutch reverted to paper past elections in the netherlands have shown that the machines can be tampered with .
since 2006 , the dutch have gone back to voting on paper - after hackers from ccc and a dutch group exposed technical security and transparency flaws among nedap voting computers . while the hesse interior ministry has implemented what it calls " security measures " to protect computer voting vulnerabilities among esd1 and nsd2 models , which the state intends to employ , the computer organization said measures still do not address the fundamental problems with the voting machine system . dirk engling , a spokesman for the ccc , noted on the club 's web site one basic issue with the computer technology : " the voter does n't know if software or hardware has been manipulated . " " no checks and balances " furthermore , lacking a paper printout confirming the vote , there is no way of proving that the tally stored in the machine really corresponds to the votes cast .
paper ballots , at least , can be recounted , he added . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : without a paper trail , there 's no way to prove whether votes are counted correctly , the ccc said another spokesman for the ccc said that no voting computer in the world can fulfill all security requirements . other counties in hesse have chosen not to use the computerized voting system , citing financial or reliability reasons for their decision to revert back to paper ballots . during local elections in march 2006 , 13 communities in hesse employed a total of 306 voting computers , with around 180,000 citizens casting their votes via such machines . should the hesse state supreme court allow the use of the machines for this election , the prosecuting counsel for ccc said there were " dozens of volunteers who would raise objections against the ballot after the election .

the computers are intended to replace paper ballots for for about 100,000 of the states 4.3 million voters . but one voter in hesse has taken the lead , along with members of the chaos computer club -lrb- ccc -rrb- , and filed an injunction with the hesse state supreme court against the use of voting computers in the forthcoming election . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : electronic voting machines were used in saxony-anhalt in 2002 ccc members said voting computers violate basic principles of electoral law by making it impossible to verify or recount ballots .
the hacker group also pointed to hard and software manipulation vulnerability among computer voting machines by the manufacturer nedap . the dutch reverted to paper past elections in the netherlands have shown that the machines can be tampered with .
since 2006 , the dutch have gone back to voting on paper - after hackers from ccc and a dutch group exposed technical security and transparency flaws among nedap voting computers . while the hesse interior ministry has implemented what it calls " security measures " to protect computer voting vulnerabilities among esd1 and nsd2 models , which the state intends to employ , the computer organization said measures still do not address the fundamental problems with the voting machine system . dirk engling , a spokesman for the ccc , noted on the club 's web site one basic issue with the computer technology : " the voter does n't know if software or hardware has been manipulated . " " no checks and balances " furthermore , lacking a paper printout confirming the vote , there is no way of proving that the tally stored in the machine really corresponds to the votes cast .
paper ballots , at least , can be recounted , he added . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : without a paper trail , there 's no way to prove whether votes are counted correctly , the ccc said another spokesman for the ccc said that no voting computer in the world can fulfill all security requirements . other counties in hesse have chosen not to use the computerized voting system , citing financial or reliability reasons for their decision to revert back to paper ballots . during local elections in march 2006 , 13 communities in hesse employed a total of 306 voting computers , with around 180,000 citizens casting their votes via such machines . should the hesse state supreme court allow the use of the machines for this election , the prosecuting counsel for ccc said there were " dozens of volunteers who would raise objections against the ballot after the election .

historians have typically characterized palestinians collectively as hitler-supporters during the nazi regime .
but a german researcher has said that they were more concerned with relations with an other european country . any historical conversation in germany over palestine and national socialism usually turns to one name : grand mufti hajj amin al husseini .
the muslim leader was an anti-semite , a passionate follower of the nazis and moved to germany in 1941 to collaborate with hitler 's regime . however , in a recently published study , berlin-based historian rene wildangel has claimed husseini " was simply not representative " of his countrymen during that time . contrary to current studies " it 's not a question of whether he was an anti-semite or a collaborator - that 's relatively clear , " said wildangel .
" we have to consider the things that were happening in palestine and not just this one person . " much of the research conducted on relations between arab nations and the nazi regime , including a 2006 book by klaus-michael mallmann and martin cüppers titled " the crescent and the swastika : the third reich , the arabs , and palestine " -lrb- halbmond und hakenkreuz .
das dritte reich , die araber und palästina -rrb- , has reached the conclusion that only germany 's defeat in northern africa prevented " german-arab mass crime " against jews .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : wildangel 's book reached a different conclusion than most other research most of the historical research on the topic is based on german , british and israeli sources and neglects the palestinian perspective , which is why it has been taken for granted that the palestinians took the same pro-hitler stance as their leader , said wildangel . by examining how nazi germany was portrayed in palestinian newspapers and publications in the 1930s and 1940s , wildangel found a fascination about adolf hitler among palestinians . nazis were enemy of the enemy but the nazis ' positive reception had less to do with a general anti-semitic sentiment , concluded wildangel , and more to do with opposition to british colonial rule , which would last until 1948 .
nazi germany was , after all , britain 's enemy in the war . the palestinians who read newspapers were presented with arguments for and against nazi germany and well informed about the true aims of the nazi regime - and also that hitler 's racism extended well beyond the jews . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : not everyone thought like the grand mufti " they , in part , embraced anti-semitism and racism , but did not share the in eliminatory character of the nazi regime , " wildangel said of arab nationalists , adding that husayni 's ideological and political views frequently met with explicit opposition in the palestinian population . the tendency to represent palestinians as collective adherents of the nazis primarily has to do with the ongoing israeli-palestinian conflict that heated up after 1945 , said wildangel . history as a political weapon " the more intense the hate becomes in the middle east conflict , the more likely people are to convey this view of history , " he said .
" the israeli authors make reference to the mufti and the arabs refuse to deal with anti-semitism and the holocaust at all . " wildangel said he believes that shifting the blame and not dealing with the other side 's past only intensify the crisis .

historians have typically characterized palestinians collectively as hitler-supporters during the nazi regime .
but a german researcher has said that they were more concerned with relations with an other european country . any historical conversation in germany over palestine and national socialism usually turns to one name : grand mufti hajj amin al husseini .
the muslim leader was an anti-semite , a passionate follower of the nazis and moved to germany in 1941 to collaborate with hitler 's regime . however , in a recently published study , berlin-based historian rene wildangel has claimed husseini " was simply not representative " of his countrymen during that time . contrary to current studies " it 's not a question of whether he was an anti-semite or a collaborator - that 's relatively clear , " said wildangel .
" we have to consider the things that were happening in palestine and not just this one person . " much of the research conducted on relations between arab nations and the nazi regime , including a 2006 book by klaus-michael mallmann and martin cüppers titled " the crescent and the swastika : the third reich , the arabs , and palestine " -lrb- halbmond und hakenkreuz .
das dritte reich , die araber und palästina -rrb- , has reached the conclusion that only germany 's defeat in northern africa prevented " german-arab mass crime " against jews .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : wildangel 's book reached a different conclusion than most other research most of the historical research on the topic is based on german , british and israeli sources and neglects the palestinian perspective , which is why it has been taken for granted that the palestinians took the same pro-hitler stance as their leader , said wildangel . by examining how nazi germany was portrayed in palestinian newspapers and publications in the 1930s and 1940s , wildangel found a fascination about adolf hitler among palestinians . nazis were enemy of the enemy but the nazis ' positive reception had less to do with a general anti-semitic sentiment , concluded wildangel , and more to do with opposition to british colonial rule , which would last until 1948 .
nazi germany was , after all , britain 's enemy in the war . the palestinians who read newspapers were presented with arguments for and against nazi germany and well informed about the true aims of the nazi regime - and also that hitler 's racism extended well beyond the jews . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : not everyone thought like the grand mufti " they , in part , embraced anti-semitism and racism , but did not share the in eliminatory character of the nazi regime , " wildangel said of arab nationalists , adding that husayni 's ideological and political views frequently met with explicit opposition in the palestinian population . the tendency to represent palestinians as collective adherents of the nazis primarily has to do with the ongoing israeli-palestinian conflict that heated up after 1945 , said wildangel . history as a political weapon " the more intense the hate becomes in the middle east conflict , the more likely people are to convey this view of history , " he said .
" the israeli authors make reference to the mufti and the arabs refuse to deal with anti-semitism and the holocaust at all . " wildangel said he believes that shifting the blame and not dealing with the other side 's past only intensify the crisis .

and that includes not only croatia and bosnia-herzegovina , but also serbia .
germany agrees . speaking during a meeting with top eu officials in the estate of brdo , near the capital ljubljana , slovenian prime minister janez jansa said that his government would assist balkan states joining the eu .
he added that he hoped membership talks would not be slowed down over the coming months .
" we need to find solutions that will stabilize the region in the long term , " jansa told reporters .
slovenia has close ties with the other balkan nations that used to form yugoslavia , including croatia and bosnia-herzogovina .
and dismissing objections from some quarters , slovenian foreign minister dimitrij rupel said serbia should be allowed to sign a stabilization and association agreement -lrb- saa -rrb- - a precursor of accession negotiations proper - with the eu " as soon as possible , possibly by the end of this month . "
several eu member states have argued that serbia should first prove its full cooperation with the international war crimes tribunal in the hague by arresting former general ratko mladic and other fugitives wanted for alleged crimes against humanity during the 1990s balkan wars .
but speaking after a meeting with his finnish counterpart in berlin on tuesday , german foreign minister frank-walter steinmeier also said that an saa could be signed with serbia as early as the end of january .

the eu is later this month due to decide on sending a law-enforcing mission to replace a un administered system which has governed kosovo since 1999 , in spite of objections from serbia and russia .
slovenia is the first former communist country from eastern europe , as well as the first new eu member state , to assume the bloc 's presidency .
with a population of just two million , the country has to rely on the help of france , its much bigger successor in the eu presidency .
and observers in brussels say it risks by overshadowed .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de european union -pipe- 08.01.2008 belgian woes mirror europe 's expansion challenges großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : belgium is still struggling for unity but the country remains in one piece it can appear at times that the eu has forgotten the little things in pursuit of the bigger picture .
working for european unity is all well and good but how can it succeed when member states themselves are divided ? the widening of the schengen agreement at the end of 2007 not only opened up more of europe 's borders and welcomed nine more eu countries to the bloc 's free movement zone , it also represented another significant step in the european union 's quest for unity and inclusiveness .
as the travel restrictions between countries are eradicated , the eu project gets ever closer to its goal of a european super-state , a collection of countries all deciding on the fate of europe .
however , not everyone shares in the feeling of enthusiasm for such a body .
while schengen means freedom for some , its ultimate objective - to bring europe closer together - represents a threat to others .
many of those countries which oppose the increase in centralized power that the eu super-state would need to operate efficiently and credibly are concerned about the erosion of sovereignty .
others , like the czech republic 's president vaclav klaus , fear the dilution of culture and identity for those countries absorbed into the new whole .
while the opening of the borders between the czech republic and slovakia in december caused some to muse about a romantic return to a single czechoslovakia , klaus warned that such mergers may come with a high price .
" our identity must be cultivated and protected if we do not want , as so many times in the past , to lose our freedom , " he said .
the quest for a united states of europe also spreads a similar concern among the continent 's minorities .
the fight for statehood becomes harder for the likes of the catalans , basques , corsicans , flemings and walloons when the opponent is no longer just a country but the whole of the european union .
quest for autonomy undermines eu unity bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : it 's hard enough to keep all 27 eu nations together in turn , the desire for autonomy grows .
" as their countries lose sovereignty , all such minorities are encouraged to assert their identity through independence and statehood , " said kristine dekeyser , a political scientist and author on belgian politics .
" in the case of european minorities , given the incentive to increase their demands , their destabilizing actions begin to have a much wider effect .
agitating for independence ultimately puts a strain on the eu 's progress towards unity . "
the situation concerning the divided flemings and walloons of belgium , one made more poignant by the fact that they live side-by-side in the country which hosts the european seat of power , has been described by some observers as a microcosm of the problems facing the eu in its quest for unity .
some have gone as far as to say that belgium 's crisis today is the eu 's crisis tomorrow .
" the argument that some use is : how can you possibly create a unified europe if you ca n't even bring a small country like belgium together ? " ' said peter bursens from the political science faculty at the university of antwerp .
" both instances have very similar problems , such as the need for more political integration , more cooperation and more trust . "
belgium and europe share similar challenges bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : affluent flanders resents supporting poorer wallonia the unwillingness to concede , which has been threatening to pull belgium apart , mirrors that which has been dogging the eu since its inception .
both have majority powers which once tolerated the minorities but have since grown tired of supporting and paying for these apparently ungrateful and selfish groups and have advocated at times for a parting of the ways .
both are faced with the challenges of combining centralization and decentralization , identity and solidarity , and creating a forum for very different opinions .
in the belgian political process , the obstacles stopping the two main groups facing those challenges together appear self-made .
rather than uniting , the flemish and walloon parties seem to be drifting further apart .
instead of joining together , free of the constraints of actual borders , minorities in the country are intent on building new barriers to keep them apart .
" in belgium , it is the flemish - and mainly only the regionalists , nationalists and extremists , i must add - who promote this divide , " bursens said .
" they have a strong history of fighting for the right to speak their own language , to have their own policies and governance .
they fear encroachment on that from the walloons in the south .
they are also responsible for opposing european integration initiatives .
they want to protect all they have achieved . "
embracing diversity can heal the rifts bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : premier verhofstadt is charged with making both sides see sense while the belgian process slides dangerously close to a separation , the european process is heading towards integration .
that , observers believe , is a reason for hope for both the stability of belgium and the future of europe .
" people have the wrong idea about europe , that we should all be one , " bursens said .
" that 's not the point .
diversity is what europe is all about ; diversity of identity and culture .
for all its differences , the eu works because the cost of it not working is too great .
the politicians always find a way because there is a will to make it work .
the same will happen with belgium .
it has to . "
political scientist kristine dekeyser added that belgium 's two separate public spheres could make people think that the country could never stand a chance .
" but people have been making belgium function for years , " she said .

working for european unity is all well and good but how can it succeed when member states themselves are divided ? the widening of the schengen agreement at the end of 2007 not only opened up more of europe 's borders and welcomed nine more eu countries to the bloc 's free movement zone , it also represented another significant step in the european union 's quest for unity and inclusiveness .
as the travel restrictions between countries are eradicated , the eu project gets ever closer to its goal of a european super-state , a collection of countries all deciding on the fate of europe .
however , not everyone shares in the feeling of enthusiasm for such a body .
while schengen means freedom for some , its ultimate objective - to bring europe closer together - represents a threat to others .
many of those countries which oppose the increase in centralized power that the eu super-state would need to operate efficiently and credibly are concerned about the erosion of sovereignty .
others , like the czech republic 's president vaclav klaus , fear the dilution of culture and identity for those countries absorbed into the new whole .
while the opening of the borders between the czech republic and slovakia in december caused some to muse about a romantic return to a single czechoslovakia , klaus warned that such mergers may come with a high price .
" our identity must be cultivated and protected if we do not want , as so many times in the past , to lose our freedom , " he said .
the quest for a united states of europe also spreads a similar concern among the continent 's minorities .
the fight for statehood becomes harder for the likes of the catalans , basques , corsicans , flemings and walloons when the opponent is no longer just a country but the whole of the european union .
quest for autonomy undermines eu unity bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : it 's hard enough to keep all 27 eu nations together in turn , the desire for autonomy grows .
" as their countries lose sovereignty , all such minorities are encouraged to assert their identity through independence and statehood , " said kristine dekeyser , a political scientist and author on belgian politics .
" in the case of european minorities , given the incentive to increase their demands , their destabilizing actions begin to have a much wider effect .

that included not entering the bear 's den until at least six weeks after the birth since it could otherwise disturb the animals ' natural behavior - a policy prescribed by the european animal conservation and breeding program . a zoo spokesman on tuesday agreed , saying the keepers had acted " absolutely correctly " under the guidelines . but late tuesday afternoon , the zoo announced it would err on the side of caution , remove vera 's baby , and bottle-feed it like knut .

two polar bear babies at the nuremberg zoo were n't so lucky . when one zookeeper in nuremberg checked the cage of mama bear vilma on monday , he found no sign of the little ones .
dag encke , director of the zoo , said monday : " we presume she 's eaten them . " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : knut won hearts around the world the cubs may have been ill or dead already when vilma devoured them . " predators are known to eat their offspring when there 's something wrong , or when the mother knows she can not raise them properly , " encke told ap news agency . mixed bear signals the zoo apparently became aware of a change when keepers stopped hearing the howls of the cubs over the weekend , but they believed that meant vilma was taking care of her offspring well . but on monday , when she came out of her cave alone and paced the cage nervously , one keeper became alarmed and searched the stall . the german association for the protection of animals said the nuremberg zoo should have acted sooner . " we are against keeping and breeding polar bears in zoos , " the association 's head thomas schröder said , adding however , that a zoo has a responsibility once it takes on the task .
" that means : every animal has a right to life . " knut forged the path knut certainly can attest to that .

"
that included not entering the bear 's den until at least six weeks after the birth since it could otherwise disturb the animals ' natural behavior - a policy prescribed by the european animal conservation and breeding program . a zoo spokesman on tuesday agreed , saying the keepers had acted " absolutely correctly " under the guidelines . but late tuesday afternoon , the zoo announced it would err on the side of caution , remove vera 's baby , and bottle-feed it like knut .
the zoo made the decision after observing how vera had brought out the cub from the den and tried to hide it in shrubbery . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : having just turned a year old , knut is n't so cute anymore nuremberg zoo 's deputy director helmut mägdefrau told ap news agency : " she 's completely nervous .

and there are more and more countries using jamming transmitters to interfere with radio broadcasts , as well as blocking or censoring the internet . ”
regardless of differing historical backgrounds , missions and experience , the five international broadcasters all have the goal of offering truthful and pluralistic news and information to people around the world .

working for european unity is all well and good but how can it succeed when member states themselves are divided ? the widening of the schengen agreement at the end of 2007 not only opened up more of europe 's borders and welcomed nine more eu countries to the bloc 's free movement zone , it also represented another significant step in the european union 's quest for unity and inclusiveness .
as the travel restrictions between countries are eradicated , the eu project gets ever closer to its goal of a european super-state , a collection of countries all deciding on the fate of europe .
however , not everyone shares in the feeling of enthusiasm for such a body .
while schengen means freedom for some , its ultimate objective - to bring europe closer together - represents a threat to others .
many of those countries which oppose the increase in centralized power that the eu super-state would need to operate efficiently and credibly are concerned about the erosion of sovereignty .
others , like the czech republic 's president vaclav klaus , fear the dilution of culture and identity for those countries absorbed into the new whole .
while the opening of the borders between the czech republic and slovakia in december caused some to muse about a romantic return to a single czechoslovakia , klaus warned that such mergers may come with a high price .
" our identity must be cultivated and protected if we do not want , as so many times in the past , to lose our freedom , " he said .
the quest for a united states of europe also spreads a similar concern among the continent 's minorities .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de history -pipe- 08.01.2008 not all palestinians were pro-nazi , says german historian großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : was germany 's defeat in northern africa all that prevented " german-arab mass crime " ?
historians have typically characterized palestinians collectively as hitler-supporters during the nazi regime .
but a german researcher has said that they were more concerned with relations with an other european country . any historical conversation in germany over palestine and national socialism usually turns to one name : grand mufti hajj amin al husseini .
the muslim leader was an anti-semite , a passionate follower of the nazis and moved to germany in 1941 to collaborate with hitler 's regime . however , in a recently published study , berlin-based historian rene wildangel has claimed husseini " was simply not representative " of his countrymen during that time . contrary to current studies " it 's not a question of whether he was an anti-semite or a collaborator - that 's relatively clear , " said wildangel .
" we have to consider the things that were happening in palestine and not just this one person . " much of the research conducted on relations between arab nations and the nazi regime , including a 2006 book by klaus-michael mallmann and martin cüppers titled " the crescent and the swastika : the third reich , the arabs , and palestine " -lrb- halbmond und hakenkreuz .
das dritte reich , die araber und palästina -rrb- , has reached the conclusion that only germany 's defeat in northern africa prevented " german-arab mass crime " against jews .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : wildangel 's book reached a different conclusion than most other research most of the historical research on the topic is based on german , british and israeli sources and neglects the palestinian perspective , which is why it has been taken for granted that the palestinians took the same pro-hitler stance as their leader , said wildangel . by examining how nazi germany was portrayed in palestinian newspapers and publications in the 1930s and 1940s , wildangel found a fascination about adolf hitler among palestinians . nazis were enemy of the enemy but the nazis ' positive reception had less to do with a general anti-semitic sentiment , concluded wildangel , and more to do with opposition to british colonial rule , which would last until 1948 .
nazi germany was , after all , britain 's enemy in the war . the palestinians who read newspapers were presented with arguments for and against nazi germany and well informed about the true aims of the nazi regime - and also that hitler 's racism extended well beyond the jews . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : not everyone thought like the grand mufti " they , in part , embraced anti-semitism and racism , but did not share the in eliminatory character of the nazi regime , " wildangel said of arab nationalists , adding that husayni 's ideological and political views frequently met with explicit opposition in the palestinian population . the tendency to represent palestinians as collective adherents of the nazis primarily has to do with the ongoing israeli-palestinian conflict that heated up after 1945 , said wildangel . history as a political weapon " the more intense the hate becomes in the middle east conflict , the more likely people are to convey this view of history , " he said .
" the israeli authors make reference to the mufti and the arabs refuse to deal with anti-semitism and the holocaust at all . " wildangel said he believes that shifting the blame and not dealing with the other side 's past only intensify the crisis .
his latest book , available in german -lrb- " zwischen achse und mandatsmacht " -rrb- , is at least one effort to spur a two-sided discussion . sarah mersch -lrb- kjb -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de european union -pipe- 08.01.2008 belgian woes mirror europe 's expansion challenges großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : belgium is still struggling for unity but the country remains in one piece it can appear at times that the eu has forgotten the little things in pursuit of the bigger picture .
working for european unity is all well and good but how can it succeed when member states themselves are divided ? the widening of the schengen agreement at the end of 2007 not only opened up more of europe 's borders and welcomed nine more eu countries to the bloc 's free movement zone , it also represented another significant step in the european union 's quest for unity and inclusiveness .
as the travel restrictions between countries are eradicated , the eu project gets ever closer to its goal of a european super-state , a collection of countries all deciding on the fate of europe .
however , not everyone shares in the feeling of enthusiasm for such a body .
while schengen means freedom for some , its ultimate objective - to bring europe closer together - represents a threat to others .
many of those countries which oppose the increase in centralized power that the eu super-state would need to operate efficiently and credibly are concerned about the erosion of sovereignty .
others , like the czech republic 's president vaclav klaus , fear the dilution of culture and identity for those countries absorbed into the new whole .
while the opening of the borders between the czech republic and slovakia in december caused some to muse about a romantic return to a single czechoslovakia , klaus warned that such mergers may come with a high price .
" our identity must be cultivated and protected if we do not want , as so many times in the past , to lose our freedom , " he said .
the quest for a united states of europe also spreads a similar concern among the continent 's minorities .
the fight for statehood becomes harder for the likes of the catalans , basques , corsicans , flemings and walloons when the opponent is no longer just a country but the whole of the european union .
quest for autonomy undermines eu unity bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : it 's hard enough to keep all 27 eu nations together in turn , the desire for autonomy grows .
" as their countries lose sovereignty , all such minorities are encouraged to assert their identity through independence and statehood , " said kristine dekeyser , a political scientist and author on belgian politics .
" in the case of european minorities , given the incentive to increase their demands , their destabilizing actions begin to have a much wider effect .
agitating for independence ultimately puts a strain on the eu 's progress towards unity . "
the situation concerning the divided flemings and walloons of belgium , one made more poignant by the fact that they live side-by-side in the country which hosts the european seat of power , has been described by some observers as a microcosm of the problems facing the eu in its quest for unity .
some have gone as far as to say that belgium 's crisis today is the eu 's crisis tomorrow .
" the argument that some use is : how can you possibly create a unified europe if you ca n't even bring a small country like belgium together ? " ' said peter bursens from the political science faculty at the university of antwerp .
" both instances have very similar problems , such as the need for more political integration , more cooperation and more trust . "
belgium and europe share similar challenges bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : affluent flanders resents supporting poorer wallonia the unwillingness to concede , which has been threatening to pull belgium apart , mirrors that which has been dogging the eu since its inception .
both have majority powers which once tolerated the minorities but have since grown tired of supporting and paying for these apparently ungrateful and selfish groups and have advocated at times for a parting of the ways .
both are faced with the challenges of combining centralization and decentralization , identity and solidarity , and creating a forum for very different opinions .
in the belgian political process , the obstacles stopping the two main groups facing those challenges together appear self-made .
rather than uniting , the flemish and walloon parties seem to be drifting further apart .
instead of joining together , free of the constraints of actual borders , minorities in the country are intent on building new barriers to keep them apart .
" in belgium , it is the flemish - and mainly only the regionalists , nationalists and extremists , i must add - who promote this divide , " bursens said .
" they have a strong history of fighting for the right to speak their own language , to have their own policies and governance .
they fear encroachment on that from the walloons in the south .
they are also responsible for opposing european integration initiatives .
they want to protect all they have achieved . "
embracing diversity can heal the rifts bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : premier verhofstadt is charged with making both sides see sense while the belgian process slides dangerously close to a separation , the european process is heading towards integration .
that , observers believe , is a reason for hope for both the stability of belgium and the future of europe .
" people have the wrong idea about europe , that we should all be one , " bursens said .
" that 's not the point .
diversity is what europe is all about ; diversity of identity and culture .
for all its differences , the eu works because the cost of it not working is too great .
the politicians always find a way because there is a will to make it work .
the same will happen with belgium .
it has to . "
political scientist kristine dekeyser added that belgium 's two separate public spheres could make people think that the country could never stand a chance .
" but people have been making belgium function for years , " she said .
" these are not new problems .
europe can learn from this .

historians have typically characterized palestinians collectively as hitler-supporters during the nazi regime .
but a german researcher has said that they were more concerned with relations with an other european country . any historical conversation in germany over palestine and national socialism usually turns to one name : grand mufti hajj amin al husseini .
the muslim leader was an anti-semite , a passionate follower of the nazis and moved to germany in 1941 to collaborate with hitler 's regime . however , in a recently published study , berlin-based historian rene wildangel has claimed husseini " was simply not representative " of his countrymen during that time . contrary to current studies " it 's not a question of whether he was an anti-semite or a collaborator - that 's relatively clear , " said wildangel .
" we have to consider the things that were happening in palestine and not just this one person . " much of the research conducted on relations between arab nations and the nazi regime , including a 2006 book by klaus-michael mallmann and martin cüppers titled " the crescent and the swastika : the third reich , the arabs , and palestine " -lrb- halbmond und hakenkreuz .
das dritte reich , die araber und palästina -rrb- , has reached the conclusion that only germany 's defeat in northern africa prevented " german-arab mass crime " against jews .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : wildangel 's book reached a different conclusion than most other research most of the historical research on the topic is based on german , british and israeli sources and neglects the palestinian perspective , which is why it has been taken for granted that the palestinians took the same pro-hitler stance as their leader , said wildangel . by examining how nazi germany was portrayed in palestinian newspapers and publications in the 1930s and 1940s , wildangel found a fascination about adolf hitler among palestinians . nazis were enemy of the enemy but the nazis ' positive reception had less to do with a general anti-semitic sentiment , concluded wildangel , and more to do with opposition to british colonial rule , which would last until 1948 .
nazi germany was , after all , britain 's enemy in the war . the palestinians who read newspapers were presented with arguments for and against nazi germany and well informed about the true aims of the nazi regime - and also that hitler 's racism extended well beyond the jews . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : not everyone thought like the grand mufti " they , in part , embraced anti-semitism and racism , but did not share the in eliminatory character of the nazi regime , " wildangel said of arab nationalists , adding that husayni 's ideological and political views frequently met with explicit opposition in the palestinian population . the tendency to represent palestinians as collective adherents of the nazis primarily has to do with the ongoing israeli-palestinian conflict that heated up after 1945 , said wildangel . history as a political weapon " the more intense the hate becomes in the middle east conflict , the more likely people are to convey this view of history , " he said .
" the israeli authors make reference to the mufti and the arabs refuse to deal with anti-semitism and the holocaust at all . " wildangel said he believes that shifting the blame and not dealing with the other side 's past only intensify the crisis .

will it become the new knut ? shunned by his mother , polar bear knut was saved from demise by care-taker thomas dörflein at the berlin zoo .
two polar bear babies at the nuremberg zoo were n't so lucky . when one zookeeper in nuremberg checked the cage of mama bear vilma on monday , he found no sign of the little ones .
dag encke , director of the zoo , said monday : " we presume she 's eaten them . " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : knut won hearts around the world the cubs may have been ill or dead already when vilma devoured them . " predators are known to eat their offspring when there 's something wrong , or when the mother knows she can not raise them properly , " encke told ap news agency . mixed bear signals the zoo apparently became aware of a change when keepers stopped hearing the howls of the cubs over the weekend , but they believed that meant vilma was taking care of her offspring well . but on monday , when she came out of her cave alone and paced the cage nervously , one keeper became alarmed and searched the stall . the german association for the protection of animals said the nuremberg zoo should have acted sooner . " we are against keeping and breeding polar bears in zoos , " the association 's head thomas schröder said , adding however , that a zoo has a responsibility once it takes on the task .
" that means : every animal has a right to life . " knut forged the path knut certainly can attest to that .
rejected by his mother as a baby , his keeper dörflein bottle-fed him in berlin .
since then , once-cute , now-killer knut has been living the high life of stardom , including a knock-out number of zoo visitors , television appearances and even book deals . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : other mama bear vera may have turned mean - or merciful , depending on your view animal protectionists have said the zoo had better keep a close eye on how a second bear named vera , who gave birth to a cub in december , handles her cub . zoo director encke on monday , though , was n't worried : " we going to stick to our policy , also with vera . "
that included not entering the bear 's den until at least six weeks after the birth since it could otherwise disturb the animals ' natural behavior - a policy prescribed by the european animal conservation and breeding program . a zoo spokesman on tuesday agreed , saying the keepers had acted " absolutely correctly " under the guidelines . but late tuesday afternoon , the zoo announced it would err on the side of caution , remove vera 's baby , and bottle-feed it like knut .
the zoo made the decision after observing how vera had brought out the cub from the den and tried to hide it in shrubbery . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : having just turned a year old , knut is n't so cute anymore nuremberg zoo 's deputy director helmut mägdefrau told ap news agency : " she 's completely nervous . "
vera was apparently disturbed by a camera team that had approached the den without permission . vera junior has since been separated from its mother , and appears to be in tip-top condition .

" we are against keeping and breeding polar bears in zoos , " the association 's head thomas schröder said , adding however , that a zoo has a responsibility once it takes on the task .

"
that included not entering the bear 's den until at least six weeks after the birth since it could otherwise disturb the animals ' natural behavior - a policy prescribed by the european animal conservation and breeding program . a zoo spokesman on tuesday agreed , saying the keepers had acted " absolutely correctly " under the guidelines . but late tuesday afternoon , the zoo announced it would err on the side of caution , remove vera 's baby , and bottle-feed it like knut .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de history -pipe- 08.01.2008 not all palestinians were pro-nazi , says german historian großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : was germany 's defeat in northern africa all that prevented " german-arab mass crime " ?
historians have typically characterized palestinians collectively as hitler-supporters during the nazi regime .

the legislature , elected in november , is to vote on a speaker and cabinet on wednesday . " the number one commitment of this government , and of all kosovo citizens , is to formalize kosovo as an independent , democratic state , " said thaci , whose ethnic albanian guerrilla army fought serb forces in 1998-1999 to end repression under the late serbian leader slobodan milosevic .

28 , the eu is expected to decide on law-enforcement missions to replace the un administration that has governed kosovo since 1999 . russia , which has adamantly refused to support independence for the predominantly albanian province , has held up calls for independence in the un security council .

cyprus , greece , spain , slovakia and romania , however , have expressed concern , fearing that independence for the province could set an example for other major ethnic minorities wanting to secede . a week after his country took over the rotating eu presidency , slovenian prime minister janez jansa indicated on monday in ljubljana that kosovo 's independence was inevitable . " for kosovo , it 's clear what will happen , it 's more a question of how to do it , " said jansa . talking with reporters , jansa recalled the brutality against ethnic albanians - which make up 90 percent of kosovo population of 2.2 million - under milosevic during the 1990s . " it 's not possible after all this " to force the people of kosovo to live with the serbs , he said .

paper ballots , at least , can be recounted , he added . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : without a paper trail , there 's no way to prove whether votes are counted correctly , the ccc said another spokesman for the ccc said that no voting computer in the world can fulfill all security requirements . other counties in hesse have chosen not to use the computerized voting system , citing financial or reliability reasons for their decision to revert back to paper ballots . during local elections in march 2006 , 13 communities in hesse employed a total of 306 voting computers , with around 180,000 citizens casting their votes via such machines . should the hesse state supreme court allow the use of the machines for this election , the prosecuting counsel for ccc said there were " dozens of volunteers who would raise objections against the ballot after the election .

the lion 's share of that sum reflects compensation worth 2 million euros paid by the dfb to first-division club hamburg in compensation for their unfairly losing a 2004 german cup match hoyzer officiated .
hoyzer later admitted to using his refereeing decisions to alter the course of that and one other cup match and around nine lower-division games .
he was sentenced to nearly two and a half years in prison for helping to commit fraud in november 2005 .

and that includes not only croatia and bosnia-herzegovina , but also serbia .
germany agrees . speaking during a meeting with top eu officials in the estate of brdo , near the capital ljubljana , slovenian prime minister janez jansa said that his government would assist balkan states joining the eu .
he added that he hoped membership talks would not be slowed down over the coming months .
" we need to find solutions that will stabilize the region in the long term , " jansa told reporters .
slovenia has close ties with the other balkan nations that used to form yugoslavia , including croatia and bosnia-herzogovina .
and dismissing objections from some quarters , slovenian foreign minister dimitrij rupel said serbia should be allowed to sign a stabilization and association agreement -lrb- saa -rrb- - a precursor of accession negotiations proper - with the eu " as soon as possible , possibly by the end of this month . "
several eu member states have argued that serbia should first prove its full cooperation with the international war crimes tribunal in the hague by arresting former general ratko mladic and other fugitives wanted for alleged crimes against humanity during the 1990s balkan wars .
but speaking after a meeting with his finnish counterpart in berlin on tuesday , german foreign minister frank-walter steinmeier also said that an saa could be signed with serbia as early as the end of january .
neighboring problems bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : serbia 's opposition to kosovan independence could be another wedge with the eu but slovenia may have to spend part of its presidency doing damage control .
many experts expect the potentially explosive situation in kosovo , serbia 's breakaway province , to keep slovenian officials busy over the coming weeks , on monday , the two largest political parties in the predominantly ethnic-albanian province agreed to form a coalition government tasked with declaring independence from belgrade .
the eu is later this month due to decide on sending a law-enforcing mission to replace a un administered system which has governed kosovo since 1999 , in spite of objections from serbia and russia .
slovenia is the first former communist country from eastern europe , as well as the first new eu member state , to assume the bloc 's presidency .
with a population of just two million , the country has to rely on the help of france , its much bigger successor in the eu presidency .
and observers in brussels say it risks by overshadowed .

and that includes not only croatia and bosnia-herzegovina , but also serbia .
germany agrees . speaking during a meeting with top eu officials in the estate of brdo , near the capital ljubljana , slovenian prime minister janez jansa said that his government would assist balkan states joining the eu .
he added that he hoped membership talks would not be slowed down over the coming months .
" we need to find solutions that will stabilize the region in the long term , " jansa told reporters .
slovenia has close ties with the other balkan nations that used to form yugoslavia , including croatia and bosnia-herzogovina .
and dismissing objections from some quarters , slovenian foreign minister dimitrij rupel said serbia should be allowed to sign a stabilization and association agreement -lrb- saa -rrb- - a precursor of accession negotiations proper - with the eu " as soon as possible , possibly by the end of this month . "
several eu member states have argued that serbia should first prove its full cooperation with the international war crimes tribunal in the hague by arresting former general ratko mladic and other fugitives wanted for alleged crimes against humanity during the 1990s balkan wars .
but speaking after a meeting with his finnish counterpart in berlin on tuesday , german foreign minister frank-walter steinmeier also said that an saa could be signed with serbia as early as the end of january .
neighboring problems bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : serbia 's opposition to kosovan independence could be another wedge with the eu but slovenia may have to spend part of its presidency doing damage control .
many experts expect the potentially explosive situation in kosovo , serbia 's breakaway province , to keep slovenian officials busy over the coming weeks , on monday , the two largest political parties in the predominantly ethnic-albanian province agreed to form a coalition government tasked with declaring independence from belgrade .
the eu is later this month due to decide on sending a law-enforcing mission to replace a un administered system which has governed kosovo since 1999 , in spite of objections from serbia and russia .
slovenia is the first former communist country from eastern europe , as well as the first new eu member state , to assume the bloc 's presidency .
with a population of just two million , the country has to rely on the help of france , its much bigger successor in the eu presidency .
and observers in brussels say it risks by overshadowed .
tellingly , france has already started publicizing its own agenda for when it becomes eu president on july 1 . dw staff -lrb- jc -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

the club has said the machines could be easily manipulated . eight different cities and districts have planned to use voting computers for the jan .

the computers are intended to replace paper ballots for for about 100,000 of the states 4.3 million voters . but one voter in hesse has taken the lead , along with members of the chaos computer club -lrb- ccc -rrb- , and filed an injunction with the hesse state supreme court against the use of voting computers in the forthcoming election . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : electronic voting machines were used in saxony-anhalt in 2002 ccc members said voting computers violate basic principles of electoral law by making it impossible to verify or recount ballots .

since 2006 , the dutch have gone back to voting on paper - after hackers from ccc and a dutch group exposed technical security and transparency flaws among nedap voting computers . while the hesse interior ministry has implemented what it calls " security measures " to protect computer voting vulnerabilities among esd1 and nsd2 models , which the state intends to employ , the computer organization said measures still do not address the fundamental problems with the voting machine system . dirk engling , a spokesman for the ccc , noted on the club 's web site one basic issue with the computer technology : " the voter does n't know if software or hardware has been manipulated . " " no checks and balances " furthermore , lacking a paper printout confirming the vote , there is no way of proving that the tally stored in the machine really corresponds to the votes cast .
paper ballots , at least , can be recounted , he added . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : without a paper trail , there 's no way to prove whether votes are counted correctly , the ccc said another spokesman for the ccc said that no voting computer in the world can fulfill all security requirements . other counties in hesse have chosen not to use the computerized voting system , citing financial or reliability reasons for their decision to revert back to paper ballots . during local elections in march 2006 , 13 communities in hesse employed a total of 306 voting computers , with around 180,000 citizens casting their votes via such machines . should the hesse state supreme court allow the use of the machines for this election , the prosecuting counsel for ccc said there were " dozens of volunteers who would raise objections against the ballot after the election .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de european union -pipe- 08.01.2008 belgian woes mirror europe 's expansion challenges großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : belgium is still struggling for unity but the country remains in one piece it can appear at times that the eu has forgotten the little things in pursuit of the bigger picture .
working for european unity is all well and good but how can it succeed when member states themselves are divided ? the widening of the schengen agreement at the end of 2007 not only opened up more of europe 's borders and welcomed nine more eu countries to the bloc 's free movement zone , it also represented another significant step in the european union 's quest for unity and inclusiveness .
as the travel restrictions between countries are eradicated , the eu project gets ever closer to its goal of a european super-state , a collection of countries all deciding on the fate of europe .
however , not everyone shares in the feeling of enthusiasm for such a body .
while schengen means freedom for some , its ultimate objective - to bring europe closer together - represents a threat to others .
many of those countries which oppose the increase in centralized power that the eu super-state would need to operate efficiently and credibly are concerned about the erosion of sovereignty .
others , like the czech republic 's president vaclav klaus , fear the dilution of culture and identity for those countries absorbed into the new whole .
while the opening of the borders between the czech republic and slovakia in december caused some to muse about a romantic return to a single czechoslovakia , klaus warned that such mergers may come with a high price .
" our identity must be cultivated and protected if we do not want , as so many times in the past , to lose our freedom , " he said .
the quest for a united states of europe also spreads a similar concern among the continent 's minorities .
the fight for statehood becomes harder for the likes of the catalans , basques , corsicans , flemings and walloons when the opponent is no longer just a country but the whole of the european union .
quest for autonomy undermines eu unity bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : it 's hard enough to keep all 27 eu nations together in turn , the desire for autonomy grows .
" as their countries lose sovereignty , all such minorities are encouraged to assert their identity through independence and statehood , " said kristine dekeyser , a political scientist and author on belgian politics .
" in the case of european minorities , given the incentive to increase their demands , their destabilizing actions begin to have a much wider effect .
agitating for independence ultimately puts a strain on the eu 's progress towards unity . "
the situation concerning the divided flemings and walloons of belgium , one made more poignant by the fact that they live side-by-side in the country which hosts the european seat of power , has been described by some observers as a microcosm of the problems facing the eu in its quest for unity .
some have gone as far as to say that belgium 's crisis today is the eu 's crisis tomorrow .
" the argument that some use is : how can you possibly create a unified europe if you ca n't even bring a small country like belgium together ? " ' said peter bursens from the political science faculty at the university of antwerp .
" both instances have very similar problems , such as the need for more political integration , more cooperation and more trust . "
belgium and europe share similar challenges bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : affluent flanders resents supporting poorer wallonia the unwillingness to concede , which has been threatening to pull belgium apart , mirrors that which has been dogging the eu since its inception .
both have majority powers which once tolerated the minorities but have since grown tired of supporting and paying for these apparently ungrateful and selfish groups and have advocated at times for a parting of the ways .
both are faced with the challenges of combining centralization and decentralization , identity and solidarity , and creating a forum for very different opinions .
in the belgian political process , the obstacles stopping the two main groups facing those challenges together appear self-made .
rather than uniting , the flemish and walloon parties seem to be drifting further apart .
instead of joining together , free of the constraints of actual borders , minorities in the country are intent on building new barriers to keep them apart .
" in belgium , it is the flemish - and mainly only the regionalists , nationalists and extremists , i must add - who promote this divide , " bursens said .
" they have a strong history of fighting for the right to speak their own language , to have their own policies and governance .
they fear encroachment on that from the walloons in the south .
they are also responsible for opposing european integration initiatives .
they want to protect all they have achieved . "
embracing diversity can heal the rifts bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : premier verhofstadt is charged with making both sides see sense while the belgian process slides dangerously close to a separation , the european process is heading towards integration .
that , observers believe , is a reason for hope for both the stability of belgium and the future of europe .
" people have the wrong idea about europe , that we should all be one , " bursens said .
" that 's not the point .
diversity is what europe is all about ; diversity of identity and culture .
for all its differences , the eu works because the cost of it not working is too great .
the politicians always find a way because there is a will to make it work .
the same will happen with belgium .
it has to . "
political scientist kristine dekeyser added that belgium 's two separate public spheres could make people think that the country could never stand a chance .
" but people have been making belgium function for years , " she said .
" these are not new problems .
europe can learn from this .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de european union -pipe- 08.01.2008 belgian woes mirror europe 's expansion challenges großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : belgium is still struggling for unity but the country remains in one piece it can appear at times that the eu has forgotten the little things in pursuit of the bigger picture .
working for european unity is all well and good but how can it succeed when member states themselves are divided ? the widening of the schengen agreement at the end of 2007 not only opened up more of europe 's borders and welcomed nine more eu countries to the bloc 's free movement zone , it also represented another significant step in the european union 's quest for unity and inclusiveness .
as the travel restrictions between countries are eradicated , the eu project gets ever closer to its goal of a european super-state , a collection of countries all deciding on the fate of europe .
however , not everyone shares in the feeling of enthusiasm for such a body .
while schengen means freedom for some , its ultimate objective - to bring europe closer together - represents a threat to others .
many of those countries which oppose the increase in centralized power that the eu super-state would need to operate efficiently and credibly are concerned about the erosion of sovereignty .
others , like the czech republic 's president vaclav klaus , fear the dilution of culture and identity for those countries absorbed into the new whole .
while the opening of the borders between the czech republic and slovakia in december caused some to muse about a romantic return to a single czechoslovakia , klaus warned that such mergers may come with a high price .
" our identity must be cultivated and protected if we do not want , as so many times in the past , to lose our freedom , " he said .
the quest for a united states of europe also spreads a similar concern among the continent 's minorities .
the fight for statehood becomes harder for the likes of the catalans , basques , corsicans , flemings and walloons when the opponent is no longer just a country but the whole of the european union .
quest for autonomy undermines eu unity bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : it 's hard enough to keep all 27 eu nations together in turn , the desire for autonomy grows .
" as their countries lose sovereignty , all such minorities are encouraged to assert their identity through independence and statehood , " said kristine dekeyser , a political scientist and author on belgian politics .
" in the case of european minorities , given the incentive to increase their demands , their destabilizing actions begin to have a much wider effect .
agitating for independence ultimately puts a strain on the eu 's progress towards unity . "
the situation concerning the divided flemings and walloons of belgium , one made more poignant by the fact that they live side-by-side in the country which hosts the european seat of power , has been described by some observers as a microcosm of the problems facing the eu in its quest for unity .
some have gone as far as to say that belgium 's crisis today is the eu 's crisis tomorrow .
" the argument that some use is : how can you possibly create a unified europe if you ca n't even bring a small country like belgium together ? " ' said peter bursens from the political science faculty at the university of antwerp .
" both instances have very similar problems , such as the need for more political integration , more cooperation and more trust . "
belgium and europe share similar challenges bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : affluent flanders resents supporting poorer wallonia the unwillingness to concede , which has been threatening to pull belgium apart , mirrors that which has been dogging the eu since its inception .
both have majority powers which once tolerated the minorities but have since grown tired of supporting and paying for these apparently ungrateful and selfish groups and have advocated at times for a parting of the ways .
both are faced with the challenges of combining centralization and decentralization , identity and solidarity , and creating a forum for very different opinions .
in the belgian political process , the obstacles stopping the two main groups facing those challenges together appear self-made .
rather than uniting , the flemish and walloon parties seem to be drifting further apart .
instead of joining together , free of the constraints of actual borders , minorities in the country are intent on building new barriers to keep them apart .
" in belgium , it is the flemish - and mainly only the regionalists , nationalists and extremists , i must add - who promote this divide , " bursens said .
" they have a strong history of fighting for the right to speak their own language , to have their own policies and governance .
they fear encroachment on that from the walloons in the south .
they are also responsible for opposing european integration initiatives .
they want to protect all they have achieved . "
embracing diversity can heal the rifts bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : premier verhofstadt is charged with making both sides see sense while the belgian process slides dangerously close to a separation , the european process is heading towards integration .
that , observers believe , is a reason for hope for both the stability of belgium and the future of europe .
" people have the wrong idea about europe , that we should all be one , " bursens said .
" that 's not the point .
diversity is what europe is all about ; diversity of identity and culture .
for all its differences , the eu works because the cost of it not working is too great .
the politicians always find a way because there is a will to make it work .
the same will happen with belgium .
it has to . "
political scientist kristine dekeyser added that belgium 's two separate public spheres could make people think that the country could never stand a chance .
" but people have been making belgium function for years , " she said .
" these are not new problems .
europe can learn from this .

will it become the new knut ? shunned by his mother , polar bear knut was saved from demise by care-taker thomas dörflein at the berlin zoo .
two polar bear babies at the nuremberg zoo were n't so lucky . when one zookeeper in nuremberg checked the cage of mama bear vilma on monday , he found no sign of the little ones .
dag encke , director of the zoo , said monday : " we presume she 's eaten them . " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : knut won hearts around the world the cubs may have been ill or dead already when vilma devoured them . " predators are known to eat their offspring when there 's something wrong , or when the mother knows she can not raise them properly , " encke told ap news agency . mixed bear signals the zoo apparently became aware of a change when keepers stopped hearing the howls of the cubs over the weekend , but they believed that meant vilma was taking care of her offspring well . but on monday , when she came out of her cave alone and paced the cage nervously , one keeper became alarmed and searched the stall . the german association for the protection of animals said the nuremberg zoo should have acted sooner . " we are against keeping and breeding polar bears in zoos , " the association 's head thomas schröder said , adding however , that a zoo has a responsibility once it takes on the task .

"
that included not entering the bear 's den until at least six weeks after the birth since it could otherwise disturb the animals ' natural behavior - a policy prescribed by the european animal conservation and breeding program . a zoo spokesman on tuesday agreed , saying the keepers had acted " absolutely correctly " under the guidelines . but late tuesday afternoon , the zoo announced it would err on the side of caution , remove vera 's baby , and bottle-feed it like knut .
the zoo made the decision after observing how vera had brought out the cub from the den and tried to hide it in shrubbery . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : having just turned a year old , knut is n't so cute anymore nuremberg zoo 's deputy director helmut mägdefrau told ap news agency : " she 's completely nervous .

that included not entering the bear 's den until at least six weeks after the birth since it could otherwise disturb the animals ' natural behavior - a policy prescribed by the european animal conservation and breeding program . a zoo spokesman on tuesday agreed , saying the keepers had acted " absolutely correctly " under the guidelines . but late tuesday afternoon , the zoo announced it would err on the side of caution , remove vera 's baby , and bottle-feed it like knut .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de european union -pipe- 08.01.2008 belgian woes mirror europe 's expansion challenges großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : belgium is still struggling for unity but the country remains in one piece it can appear at times that the eu has forgotten the little things in pursuit of the bigger picture .
working for european unity is all well and good but how can it succeed when member states themselves are divided ? the widening of the schengen agreement at the end of 2007 not only opened up more of europe 's borders and welcomed nine more eu countries to the bloc 's free movement zone , it also represented another significant step in the european union 's quest for unity and inclusiveness .
as the travel restrictions between countries are eradicated , the eu project gets ever closer to its goal of a european super-state , a collection of countries all deciding on the fate of europe .
however , not everyone shares in the feeling of enthusiasm for such a body .
while schengen means freedom for some , its ultimate objective - to bring europe closer together - represents a threat to others .
many of those countries which oppose the increase in centralized power that the eu super-state would need to operate efficiently and credibly are concerned about the erosion of sovereignty .
others , like the czech republic 's president vaclav klaus , fear the dilution of culture and identity for those countries absorbed into the new whole .
while the opening of the borders between the czech republic and slovakia in december caused some to muse about a romantic return to a single czechoslovakia , klaus warned that such mergers may come with a high price .
" our identity must be cultivated and protected if we do not want , as so many times in the past , to lose our freedom , " he said .
the quest for a united states of europe also spreads a similar concern among the continent 's minorities .
the fight for statehood becomes harder for the likes of the catalans , basques , corsicans , flemings and walloons when the opponent is no longer just a country but the whole of the european union .
quest for autonomy undermines eu unity bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : it 's hard enough to keep all 27 eu nations together in turn , the desire for autonomy grows .
" as their countries lose sovereignty , all such minorities are encouraged to assert their identity through independence and statehood , " said kristine dekeyser , a political scientist and author on belgian politics .
" in the case of european minorities , given the incentive to increase their demands , their destabilizing actions begin to have a much wider effect .
agitating for independence ultimately puts a strain on the eu 's progress towards unity . "
the situation concerning the divided flemings and walloons of belgium , one made more poignant by the fact that they live side-by-side in the country which hosts the european seat of power , has been described by some observers as a microcosm of the problems facing the eu in its quest for unity .
some have gone as far as to say that belgium 's crisis today is the eu 's crisis tomorrow .
" the argument that some use is : how can you possibly create a unified europe if you ca n't even bring a small country like belgium together ? " ' said peter bursens from the political science faculty at the university of antwerp .
" both instances have very similar problems , such as the need for more political integration , more cooperation and more trust . "
belgium and europe share similar challenges bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : affluent flanders resents supporting poorer wallonia the unwillingness to concede , which has been threatening to pull belgium apart , mirrors that which has been dogging the eu since its inception .
both have majority powers which once tolerated the minorities but have since grown tired of supporting and paying for these apparently ungrateful and selfish groups and have advocated at times for a parting of the ways .
both are faced with the challenges of combining centralization and decentralization , identity and solidarity , and creating a forum for very different opinions .
in the belgian political process , the obstacles stopping the two main groups facing those challenges together appear self-made .
rather than uniting , the flemish and walloon parties seem to be drifting further apart .
instead of joining together , free of the constraints of actual borders , minorities in the country are intent on building new barriers to keep them apart .
" in belgium , it is the flemish - and mainly only the regionalists , nationalists and extremists , i must add - who promote this divide , " bursens said .
" they have a strong history of fighting for the right to speak their own language , to have their own policies and governance .
they fear encroachment on that from the walloons in the south .
they are also responsible for opposing european integration initiatives .
they want to protect all they have achieved . "
embracing diversity can heal the rifts bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : premier verhofstadt is charged with making both sides see sense while the belgian process slides dangerously close to a separation , the european process is heading towards integration .
that , observers believe , is a reason for hope for both the stability of belgium and the future of europe .
" people have the wrong idea about europe , that we should all be one , " bursens said .
" that 's not the point .
diversity is what europe is all about ; diversity of identity and culture .
for all its differences , the eu works because the cost of it not working is too great .
the politicians always find a way because there is a will to make it work .
the same will happen with belgium .
it has to . "
political scientist kristine dekeyser added that belgium 's two separate public spheres could make people think that the country could never stand a chance .
" but people have been making belgium function for years , " she said .

europe can learn from this .

"
at their annual meeting in hilversum , netherlands , the directors of the bbc world service , deutsche welle , radio france internationale , radio netherlands worldwide , and the voice of america issued an unprecedented joint resolution denouncing what they termed as growing trends towards media restrictions and attacks on journalists in many of the countries to which they broadcast .
the resolution also states : “ especially alarming have been the attempts of some regimes to hinder or forbid local partner stations from broadcasting our radio and television programs through licensing and regulatory measures .
and there are more and more countries using jamming transmitters to interfere with radio broadcasts , as well as blocking or censoring the internet . ”
regardless of differing historical backgrounds , missions and experience , the five international broadcasters all have the goal of offering truthful and pluralistic news and information to people around the world .
in the resolution the directors also express their concerns about the “ grave and rising threats to the right to gather information and communicate it across national borders . ”
jan hoek , director general of radio netherlands worldwide , who currently chairs the group of five broadcasters , said : “ our most important objective is to inform people without access to diverse media sources and viewpoints , who lack reliable and independent information .
in a progressively polarized environment where the media in many countries are encountering fierce curbs on their freedom to publish , we need to stand together to meet the needs of those millions of audiences worldwide who have come to depend on us as a vital source of trustworthy information . ”
according to several press monitoring organizations , press freedom has been on the decline in many countries in recent years .
the paris-based reporters without borders has tracked an increase in the number of journalists killed at work each year since 2002 .
the five international broadcasters reach hundreds of millions weekly by radio , television , and the internet .
programs are produced in 60 languages and broadcast worldwide through thousands of affiliate radio stations , television channels and cable systems . january 8 , 2007 send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ? 9801 dw-tv europe live journal - news with in depth we 're sorry , due to legal issues this content can not be transmitted as live stream .

" silverton wind farm will be one of the largest in the world once it 's operational , with the potential for almost 1,000 megawatts of renewable energy capacity , " andrew durran , executive director of hamburg-based conergy 's australian subsidiary , epuron , told dpa . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : some unexpected perils to wind turbines the company said that construction of the wind farm could begin this year .
once in operation , it could meet 4.5 percent of electricity demand in australia 's most populous state , new south wales . durran said that construction could be completed within three years if demand is great enough ; otherwise , the farm would be completed in four to five years . could help meet australia 's climate goals the project is slated to cost around 1.43 billion euros -lrb- $ 2.1 billion -rrb- and could contribute to meeting the new labor government 's target of 20 percent of australia 's power needs being met by renewable sources by 2050 . currently , coal-powered stations generate more than 80 percent of electricity in australia , with the rest coming from hydro-power stations . according to project managers , four landowners near silverton , around 25 kilometers -lrb- 15 miles -rrb- from broken hill , in western new south wales , have agreed to host the installation .

its windswept , sparsely populated area lends itself to such a project . while critics commonly loathe wind mills as blights to the landscape and a menace to migrating birds , silverton 's " townspeople ... recognize the jobs and economic benefits from this project , " durran told dpa . germany has often been a pioneer in wind turbine engineering .

historians have typically characterized palestinians collectively as hitler-supporters during the nazi regime .
but a german researcher has said that they were more concerned with relations with an other european country . any historical conversation in germany over palestine and national socialism usually turns to one name : grand mufti hajj amin al husseini .
the muslim leader was an anti-semite , a passionate follower of the nazis and moved to germany in 1941 to collaborate with hitler 's regime . however , in a recently published study , berlin-based historian rene wildangel has claimed husseini " was simply not representative " of his countrymen during that time . contrary to current studies " it 's not a question of whether he was an anti-semite or a collaborator - that 's relatively clear , " said wildangel .
" we have to consider the things that were happening in palestine and not just this one person . " much of the research conducted on relations between arab nations and the nazi regime , including a 2006 book by klaus-michael mallmann and martin cüppers titled " the crescent and the swastika : the third reich , the arabs , and palestine " -lrb- halbmond und hakenkreuz .
das dritte reich , die araber und palästina -rrb- , has reached the conclusion that only germany 's defeat in northern africa prevented " german-arab mass crime " against jews .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : wildangel 's book reached a different conclusion than most other research most of the historical research on the topic is based on german , british and israeli sources and neglects the palestinian perspective , which is why it has been taken for granted that the palestinians took the same pro-hitler stance as their leader , said wildangel . by examining how nazi germany was portrayed in palestinian newspapers and publications in the 1930s and 1940s , wildangel found a fascination about adolf hitler among palestinians . nazis were enemy of the enemy but the nazis ' positive reception had less to do with a general anti-semitic sentiment , concluded wildangel , and more to do with opposition to british colonial rule , which would last until 1948 .
nazi germany was , after all , britain 's enemy in the war . the palestinians who read newspapers were presented with arguments for and against nazi germany and well informed about the true aims of the nazi regime - and also that hitler 's racism extended well beyond the jews . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : not everyone thought like the grand mufti " they , in part , embraced anti-semitism and racism , but did not share the in eliminatory character of the nazi regime , " wildangel said of arab nationalists , adding that husayni 's ideological and political views frequently met with explicit opposition in the palestinian population . the tendency to represent palestinians as collective adherents of the nazis primarily has to do with the ongoing israeli-palestinian conflict that heated up after 1945 , said wildangel . history as a political weapon " the more intense the hate becomes in the middle east conflict , the more likely people are to convey this view of history , " he said .
" the israeli authors make reference to the mufti and the arabs refuse to deal with anti-semitism and the holocaust at all . " wildangel said he believes that shifting the blame and not dealing with the other side 's past only intensify the crisis .

historians have typically characterized palestinians collectively as hitler-supporters during the nazi regime .
but a german researcher has said that they were more concerned with relations with an other european country . any historical conversation in germany over palestine and national socialism usually turns to one name : grand mufti hajj amin al husseini .
the muslim leader was an anti-semite , a passionate follower of the nazis and moved to germany in 1941 to collaborate with hitler 's regime . however , in a recently published study , berlin-based historian rene wildangel has claimed husseini " was simply not representative " of his countrymen during that time . contrary to current studies " it 's not a question of whether he was an anti-semite or a collaborator - that 's relatively clear , " said wildangel .
" we have to consider the things that were happening in palestine and not just this one person . " much of the research conducted on relations between arab nations and the nazi regime , including a 2006 book by klaus-michael mallmann and martin cüppers titled " the crescent and the swastika : the third reich , the arabs , and palestine " -lrb- halbmond und hakenkreuz .
das dritte reich , die araber und palästina -rrb- , has reached the conclusion that only germany 's defeat in northern africa prevented " german-arab mass crime " against jews .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : wildangel 's book reached a different conclusion than most other research most of the historical research on the topic is based on german , british and israeli sources and neglects the palestinian perspective , which is why it has been taken for granted that the palestinians took the same pro-hitler stance as their leader , said wildangel . by examining how nazi germany was portrayed in palestinian newspapers and publications in the 1930s and 1940s , wildangel found a fascination about adolf hitler among palestinians . nazis were enemy of the enemy but the nazis ' positive reception had less to do with a general anti-semitic sentiment , concluded wildangel , and more to do with opposition to british colonial rule , which would last until 1948 .
nazi germany was , after all , britain 's enemy in the war . the palestinians who read newspapers were presented with arguments for and against nazi germany and well informed about the true aims of the nazi regime - and also that hitler 's racism extended well beyond the jews . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : not everyone thought like the grand mufti " they , in part , embraced anti-semitism and racism , but did not share the in eliminatory character of the nazi regime , " wildangel said of arab nationalists , adding that husayni 's ideological and political views frequently met with explicit opposition in the palestinian population . the tendency to represent palestinians as collective adherents of the nazis primarily has to do with the ongoing israeli-palestinian conflict that heated up after 1945 , said wildangel . history as a political weapon " the more intense the hate becomes in the middle east conflict , the more likely people are to convey this view of history , " he said .
" the israeli authors make reference to the mufti and the arabs refuse to deal with anti-semitism and the holocaust at all . " wildangel said he believes that shifting the blame and not dealing with the other side 's past only intensify the crisis .

the club has said the machines could be easily manipulated . eight different cities and districts have planned to use voting computers for the jan .
27 state parliament election in hesse .
the computers are intended to replace paper ballots for for about 100,000 of the states 4.3 million voters . but one voter in hesse has taken the lead , along with members of the chaos computer club -lrb- ccc -rrb- , and filed an injunction with the hesse state supreme court against the use of voting computers in the forthcoming election . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : electronic voting machines were used in saxony-anhalt in 2002 ccc members said voting computers violate basic principles of electoral law by making it impossible to verify or recount ballots .
the hacker group also pointed to hard and software manipulation vulnerability among computer voting machines by the manufacturer nedap . the dutch reverted to paper past elections in the netherlands have shown that the machines can be tampered with .
since 2006 , the dutch have gone back to voting on paper - after hackers from ccc and a dutch group exposed technical security and transparency flaws among nedap voting computers . while the hesse interior ministry has implemented what it calls " security measures " to protect computer voting vulnerabilities among esd1 and nsd2 models , which the state intends to employ , the computer organization said measures still do not address the fundamental problems with the voting machine system . dirk engling , a spokesman for the ccc , noted on the club 's web site one basic issue with the computer technology : " the voter does n't know if software or hardware has been manipulated .

the club has said the machines could be easily manipulated . eight different cities and districts have planned to use voting computers for the jan .
27 state parliament election in hesse .
the computers are intended to replace paper ballots for for about 100,000 of the states 4.3 million voters . but one voter in hesse has taken the lead , along with members of the chaos computer club -lrb- ccc -rrb- , and filed an injunction with the hesse state supreme court against the use of voting computers in the forthcoming election . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : electronic voting machines were used in saxony-anhalt in 2002 ccc members said voting computers violate basic principles of electoral law by making it impossible to verify or recount ballots .
the hacker group also pointed to hard and software manipulation vulnerability among computer voting machines by the manufacturer nedap . the dutch reverted to paper past elections in the netherlands have shown that the machines can be tampered with .
since 2006 , the dutch have gone back to voting on paper - after hackers from ccc and a dutch group exposed technical security and transparency flaws among nedap voting computers . while the hesse interior ministry has implemented what it calls " security measures " to protect computer voting vulnerabilities among esd1 and nsd2 models , which the state intends to employ , the computer organization said measures still do not address the fundamental problems with the voting machine system . dirk engling , a spokesman for the ccc , noted on the club 's web site one basic issue with the computer technology : " the voter does n't know if software or hardware has been manipulated . " " no checks and balances " furthermore , lacking a paper printout confirming the vote , there is no way of proving that the tally stored in the machine really corresponds to the votes cast .
paper ballots , at least , can be recounted , he added . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : without a paper trail , there 's no way to prove whether votes are counted correctly , the ccc said another spokesman for the ccc said that no voting computer in the world can fulfill all security requirements . other counties in hesse have chosen not to use the computerized voting system , citing financial or reliability reasons for their decision to revert back to paper ballots . during local elections in march 2006 , 13 communities in hesse employed a total of 306 voting computers , with around 180,000 citizens casting their votes via such machines . should the hesse state supreme court allow the use of the machines for this election , the prosecuting counsel for ccc said there were " dozens of volunteers who would raise objections against the ballot after the election .

at their annual meeting in hilversum , netherlands , the directors of the bbc world service , deutsche welle , radio france internationale , radio netherlands worldwide , and the voice of america issued an unprecedented joint resolution denouncing what they termed as growing trends towards media restrictions and attacks on journalists in many of the countries to which they broadcast .
the resolution also states : “ especially alarming have been the attempts of some regimes to hinder or forbid local partner stations from broadcasting our radio and television programs through licensing and regulatory measures .
and there are more and more countries using jamming transmitters to interfere with radio broadcasts , as well as blocking or censoring the internet . ”
regardless of differing historical backgrounds , missions and experience , the five international broadcasters all have the goal of offering truthful and pluralistic news and information to people around the world .

jan hoek , director general of radio netherlands worldwide , who currently chairs the group of five broadcasters , said : “ our most important objective is to inform people without access to diverse media sources and viewpoints , who lack reliable and independent information .
in a progressively polarized environment where the media in many countries are encountering fierce curbs on their freedom to publish , we need to stand together to meet the needs of those millions of audiences worldwide who have come to depend on us as a vital source of trustworthy information . ”
according to several press monitoring organizations , press freedom has been on the decline in many countries in recent years .

and that includes not only croatia and bosnia-herzegovina , but also serbia .
germany agrees . speaking during a meeting with top eu officials in the estate of brdo , near the capital ljubljana , slovenian prime minister janez jansa said that his government would assist balkan states joining the eu .
he added that he hoped membership talks would not be slowed down over the coming months .
" we need to find solutions that will stabilize the region in the long term , " jansa told reporters .
slovenia has close ties with the other balkan nations that used to form yugoslavia , including croatia and bosnia-herzogovina .
and dismissing objections from some quarters , slovenian foreign minister dimitrij rupel said serbia should be allowed to sign a stabilization and association agreement -lrb- saa -rrb- - a precursor of accession negotiations proper - with the eu " as soon as possible , possibly by the end of this month . "
several eu member states have argued that serbia should first prove its full cooperation with the international war crimes tribunal in the hague by arresting former general ratko mladic and other fugitives wanted for alleged crimes against humanity during the 1990s balkan wars .
but speaking after a meeting with his finnish counterpart in berlin on tuesday , german foreign minister frank-walter steinmeier also said that an saa could be signed with serbia as early as the end of january .
neighboring problems bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : serbia 's opposition to kosovan independence could be another wedge with the eu but slovenia may have to spend part of its presidency doing damage control .
many experts expect the potentially explosive situation in kosovo , serbia 's breakaway province , to keep slovenian officials busy over the coming weeks , on monday , the two largest political parties in the predominantly ethnic-albanian province agreed to form a coalition government tasked with declaring independence from belgrade .
the eu is later this month due to decide on sending a law-enforcing mission to replace a un administered system which has governed kosovo since 1999 , in spite of objections from serbia and russia .
slovenia is the first former communist country from eastern europe , as well as the first new eu member state , to assume the bloc 's presidency .
with a population of just two million , the country has to rely on the help of france , its much bigger successor in the eu presidency .
and observers in brussels say it risks by overshadowed .

and that includes not only croatia and bosnia-herzegovina , but also serbia .
germany agrees . speaking during a meeting with top eu officials in the estate of brdo , near the capital ljubljana , slovenian prime minister janez jansa said that his government would assist balkan states joining the eu .
he added that he hoped membership talks would not be slowed down over the coming months .
" we need to find solutions that will stabilize the region in the long term , " jansa told reporters .
slovenia has close ties with the other balkan nations that used to form yugoslavia , including croatia and bosnia-herzogovina .
and dismissing objections from some quarters , slovenian foreign minister dimitrij rupel said serbia should be allowed to sign a stabilization and association agreement -lrb- saa -rrb- - a precursor of accession negotiations proper - with the eu " as soon as possible , possibly by the end of this month . "
several eu member states have argued that serbia should first prove its full cooperation with the international war crimes tribunal in the hague by arresting former general ratko mladic and other fugitives wanted for alleged crimes against humanity during the 1990s balkan wars .
but speaking after a meeting with his finnish counterpart in berlin on tuesday , german foreign minister frank-walter steinmeier also said that an saa could be signed with serbia as early as the end of january .

many experts expect the potentially explosive situation in kosovo , serbia 's breakaway province , to keep slovenian officials busy over the coming weeks , on monday , the two largest political parties in the predominantly ethnic-albanian province agreed to form a coalition government tasked with declaring independence from belgrade .
the eu is later this month due to decide on sending a law-enforcing mission to replace a un administered system which has governed kosovo since 1999 , in spite of objections from serbia and russia .
slovenia is the first former communist country from eastern europe , as well as the first new eu member state , to assume the bloc 's presidency .
with a population of just two million , the country has to rely on the help of france , its much bigger successor in the eu presidency .
and observers in brussels say it risks by overshadowed .

working for european unity is all well and good but how can it succeed when member states themselves are divided ? the widening of the schengen agreement at the end of 2007 not only opened up more of europe 's borders and welcomed nine more eu countries to the bloc 's free movement zone , it also represented another significant step in the european union 's quest for unity and inclusiveness .
as the travel restrictions between countries are eradicated , the eu project gets ever closer to its goal of a european super-state , a collection of countries all deciding on the fate of europe .
however , not everyone shares in the feeling of enthusiasm for such a body .
while schengen means freedom for some , its ultimate objective - to bring europe closer together - represents a threat to others .
many of those countries which oppose the increase in centralized power that the eu super-state would need to operate efficiently and credibly are concerned about the erosion of sovereignty .
others , like the czech republic 's president vaclav klaus , fear the dilution of culture and identity for those countries absorbed into the new whole .
while the opening of the borders between the czech republic and slovakia in december caused some to muse about a romantic return to a single czechoslovakia , klaus warned that such mergers may come with a high price .
" our identity must be cultivated and protected if we do not want , as so many times in the past , to lose our freedom , " he said .
the quest for a united states of europe also spreads a similar concern among the continent 's minorities .
the fight for statehood becomes harder for the likes of the catalans , basques , corsicans , flemings and walloons when the opponent is no longer just a country but the whole of the european union .

the situation concerning the divided flemings and walloons of belgium , one made more poignant by the fact that they live side-by-side in the country which hosts the european seat of power , has been described by some observers as a microcosm of the problems facing the eu in its quest for unity .
some have gone as far as to say that belgium 's crisis today is the eu 's crisis tomorrow .
" the argument that some use is : how can you possibly create a unified europe if you ca n't even bring a small country like belgium together ? " ' said peter bursens from the political science faculty at the university of antwerp .

and that includes not only croatia and bosnia-herzegovina , but also serbia .
germany agrees . speaking during a meeting with top eu officials in the estate of brdo , near the capital ljubljana , slovenian prime minister janez jansa said that his government would assist balkan states joining the eu .
he added that he hoped membership talks would not be slowed down over the coming months .
" we need to find solutions that will stabilize the region in the long term , " jansa told reporters .
slovenia has close ties with the other balkan nations that used to form yugoslavia , including croatia and bosnia-herzogovina .
and dismissing objections from some quarters , slovenian foreign minister dimitrij rupel said serbia should be allowed to sign a stabilization and association agreement -lrb- saa -rrb- - a precursor of accession negotiations proper - with the eu " as soon as possible , possibly by the end of this month . "
several eu member states have argued that serbia should first prove its full cooperation with the international war crimes tribunal in the hague by arresting former general ratko mladic and other fugitives wanted for alleged crimes against humanity during the 1990s balkan wars .
but speaking after a meeting with his finnish counterpart in berlin on tuesday , german foreign minister frank-walter steinmeier also said that an saa could be signed with serbia as early as the end of january .
neighboring problems bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : serbia 's opposition to kosovan independence could be another wedge with the eu but slovenia may have to spend part of its presidency doing damage control .
many experts expect the potentially explosive situation in kosovo , serbia 's breakaway province , to keep slovenian officials busy over the coming weeks , on monday , the two largest political parties in the predominantly ethnic-albanian province agreed to form a coalition government tasked with declaring independence from belgrade .
the eu is later this month due to decide on sending a law-enforcing mission to replace a un administered system which has governed kosovo since 1999 , in spite of objections from serbia and russia .
slovenia is the first former communist country from eastern europe , as well as the first new eu member state , to assume the bloc 's presidency .
with a population of just two million , the country has to rely on the help of france , its much bigger successor in the eu presidency .
and observers in brussels say it risks by overshadowed .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de european union -pipe- 08.01.2008 belgian woes mirror europe 's expansion challenges großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : belgium is still struggling for unity but the country remains in one piece it can appear at times that the eu has forgotten the little things in pursuit of the bigger picture .
working for european unity is all well and good but how can it succeed when member states themselves are divided ? the widening of the schengen agreement at the end of 2007 not only opened up more of europe 's borders and welcomed nine more eu countries to the bloc 's free movement zone , it also represented another significant step in the european union 's quest for unity and inclusiveness .
as the travel restrictions between countries are eradicated , the eu project gets ever closer to its goal of a european super-state , a collection of countries all deciding on the fate of europe .
however , not everyone shares in the feeling of enthusiasm for such a body .
while schengen means freedom for some , its ultimate objective - to bring europe closer together - represents a threat to others .
many of those countries which oppose the increase in centralized power that the eu super-state would need to operate efficiently and credibly are concerned about the erosion of sovereignty .
others , like the czech republic 's president vaclav klaus , fear the dilution of culture and identity for those countries absorbed into the new whole .
while the opening of the borders between the czech republic and slovakia in december caused some to muse about a romantic return to a single czechoslovakia , klaus warned that such mergers may come with a high price .
" our identity must be cultivated and protected if we do not want , as so many times in the past , to lose our freedom , " he said .
the quest for a united states of europe also spreads a similar concern among the continent 's minorities .
the fight for statehood becomes harder for the likes of the catalans , basques , corsicans , flemings and walloons when the opponent is no longer just a country but the whole of the european union .
quest for autonomy undermines eu unity bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : it 's hard enough to keep all 27 eu nations together in turn , the desire for autonomy grows .
" as their countries lose sovereignty , all such minorities are encouraged to assert their identity through independence and statehood , " said kristine dekeyser , a political scientist and author on belgian politics .
" in the case of european minorities , given the incentive to increase their demands , their destabilizing actions begin to have a much wider effect .
agitating for independence ultimately puts a strain on the eu 's progress towards unity . "
the situation concerning the divided flemings and walloons of belgium , one made more poignant by the fact that they live side-by-side in the country which hosts the european seat of power , has been described by some observers as a microcosm of the problems facing the eu in its quest for unity .
some have gone as far as to say that belgium 's crisis today is the eu 's crisis tomorrow .
" the argument that some use is : how can you possibly create a unified europe if you ca n't even bring a small country like belgium together ? " ' said peter bursens from the political science faculty at the university of antwerp .
" both instances have very similar problems , such as the need for more political integration , more cooperation and more trust . "
belgium and europe share similar challenges bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : affluent flanders resents supporting poorer wallonia the unwillingness to concede , which has been threatening to pull belgium apart , mirrors that which has been dogging the eu since its inception .
both have majority powers which once tolerated the minorities but have since grown tired of supporting and paying for these apparently ungrateful and selfish groups and have advocated at times for a parting of the ways .
both are faced with the challenges of combining centralization and decentralization , identity and solidarity , and creating a forum for very different opinions .
in the belgian political process , the obstacles stopping the two main groups facing those challenges together appear self-made .
rather than uniting , the flemish and walloon parties seem to be drifting further apart .
instead of joining together , free of the constraints of actual borders , minorities in the country are intent on building new barriers to keep them apart .
" in belgium , it is the flemish - and mainly only the regionalists , nationalists and extremists , i must add - who promote this divide , " bursens said .
" they have a strong history of fighting for the right to speak their own language , to have their own policies and governance .
they fear encroachment on that from the walloons in the south .
they are also responsible for opposing european integration initiatives .
they want to protect all they have achieved . "
embracing diversity can heal the rifts bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : premier verhofstadt is charged with making both sides see sense while the belgian process slides dangerously close to a separation , the european process is heading towards integration .
that , observers believe , is a reason for hope for both the stability of belgium and the future of europe .
" people have the wrong idea about europe , that we should all be one , " bursens said .
" that 's not the point .
diversity is what europe is all about ; diversity of identity and culture .
for all its differences , the eu works because the cost of it not working is too great .
the politicians always find a way because there is a will to make it work .
the same will happen with belgium .
it has to . "
political scientist kristine dekeyser added that belgium 's two separate public spheres could make people think that the country could never stand a chance .
" but people have been making belgium function for years , " she said .
" these are not new problems .
europe can learn from this .

the lion 's share of that sum reflects compensation worth 2 million euros paid by the dfb to first-division club hamburg in compensation for their unfairly losing a 2004 german cup match hoyzer officiated .

after being booted from soccer , the ref may end up in the poorhouse . the case , which gets underway in berlin on wednesday , jan .
9 , sees the dfb trying to recover 1.8 million euros -lrb- $ 2.2 million -rrb- in damages from hoyzer .
the lion 's share of that sum reflects compensation worth 2 million euros paid by the dfb to first-division club hamburg in compensation for their unfairly losing a 2004 german cup match hoyzer officiated .
hoyzer later admitted to using his refereeing decisions to alter the course of that and one other cup match and around nine lower-division games .
he was sentenced to nearly two and a half years in prison for helping to commit fraud in november 2005 .
the match-fixing scandal , which was spearheaded by a croatian betting mafia in berlin , was the worst such incident in german soccer in 30 years and dented the credibility of the sport .
not about the money bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : hoyzer has already lost a criminal case - now he 's on trial in civil court even if the lawsuit is successful , it 's highly unlikely that the dfb will be able to recoup the full amount from hoyzer , who 's currently still serving out his sentence .
" it 's not about whether we can get the money or not , " dfb president theo zwanziger said when the suit was filed two years ago .
" but it would be irresponsible not to try because the dfb has suffered a huge image and financial loss from mr. hoyzer . "
it is unclear how long the lawsuit might take , but the berlin court could render a verdict fairly quickly .
" it could be that we agree on further hearing dates on wednesday , " the court said in a statement .
" but it 's also possible that a decision or the date for a decision will be announced . "
hoyzer is not required to be in attendance at the trial and will likely be represented by his attorneys .

" when our presidency is over , i want europe to have an immigration policy , an energy policy , an environmental policy and a defense policy , " sarkozy said .
he said the negative side-effects of globalization on the world 's climate and the world economy made reforms unavoidable .
" do we seriously believe that our civilization can survive the mistakes of finance capitalism or global environmental destruction unscathed ? "
sarkozy asked .
" finance capital needs to be made morally responsible . "

since 2006 , the dutch have gone back to voting on paper - after hackers from ccc and a dutch group exposed technical security and transparency flaws among nedap voting computers . while the hesse interior ministry has implemented what it calls " security measures " to protect computer voting vulnerabilities among esd1 and nsd2 models , which the state intends to employ , the computer organization said measures still do not address the fundamental problems with the voting machine system . dirk engling , a spokesman for the ccc , noted on the club 's web site one basic issue with the computer technology : " the voter does n't know if software or hardware has been manipulated . " " no checks and balances " furthermore , lacking a paper printout confirming the vote , there is no way of proving that the tally stored in the machine really corresponds to the votes cast .
paper ballots , at least , can be recounted , he added . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : without a paper trail , there 's no way to prove whether votes are counted correctly , the ccc said another spokesman for the ccc said that no voting computer in the world can fulfill all security requirements . other counties in hesse have chosen not to use the computerized voting system , citing financial or reliability reasons for their decision to revert back to paper ballots . during local elections in march 2006 , 13 communities in hesse employed a total of 306 voting computers , with around 180,000 citizens casting their votes via such machines . should the hesse state supreme court allow the use of the machines for this election , the prosecuting counsel for ccc said there were " dozens of volunteers who would raise objections against the ballot after the election .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de history -pipe- 08.01.2008 not all palestinians were pro-nazi , says german historian großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : was germany 's defeat in northern africa all that prevented " german-arab mass crime " ?
historians have typically characterized palestinians collectively as hitler-supporters during the nazi regime .
but a german researcher has said that they were more concerned with relations with an other european country . any historical conversation in germany over palestine and national socialism usually turns to one name : grand mufti hajj amin al husseini .
the muslim leader was an anti-semite , a passionate follower of the nazis and moved to germany in 1941 to collaborate with hitler 's regime . however , in a recently published study , berlin-based historian rene wildangel has claimed husseini " was simply not representative " of his countrymen during that time . contrary to current studies " it 's not a question of whether he was an anti-semite or a collaborator - that 's relatively clear , " said wildangel .
" we have to consider the things that were happening in palestine and not just this one person . " much of the research conducted on relations between arab nations and the nazi regime , including a 2006 book by klaus-michael mallmann and martin cüppers titled " the crescent and the swastika : the third reich , the arabs , and palestine " -lrb- halbmond und hakenkreuz .

historians have typically characterized palestinians collectively as hitler-supporters during the nazi regime .
but a german researcher has said that they were more concerned with relations with an other european country . any historical conversation in germany over palestine and national socialism usually turns to one name : grand mufti hajj amin al husseini .
the muslim leader was an anti-semite , a passionate follower of the nazis and moved to germany in 1941 to collaborate with hitler 's regime . however , in a recently published study , berlin-based historian rene wildangel has claimed husseini " was simply not representative " of his countrymen during that time . contrary to current studies " it 's not a question of whether he was an anti-semite or a collaborator - that 's relatively clear , " said wildangel .
" we have to consider the things that were happening in palestine and not just this one person . " much of the research conducted on relations between arab nations and the nazi regime , including a 2006 book by klaus-michael mallmann and martin cüppers titled " the crescent and the swastika : the third reich , the arabs , and palestine " -lrb- halbmond und hakenkreuz .
das dritte reich , die araber und palästina -rrb- , has reached the conclusion that only germany 's defeat in northern africa prevented " german-arab mass crime " against jews .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : wildangel 's book reached a different conclusion than most other research most of the historical research on the topic is based on german , british and israeli sources and neglects the palestinian perspective , which is why it has been taken for granted that the palestinians took the same pro-hitler stance as their leader , said wildangel . by examining how nazi germany was portrayed in palestinian newspapers and publications in the 1930s and 1940s , wildangel found a fascination about adolf hitler among palestinians . nazis were enemy of the enemy but the nazis ' positive reception had less to do with a general anti-semitic sentiment , concluded wildangel , and more to do with opposition to british colonial rule , which would last until 1948 .
nazi germany was , after all , britain 's enemy in the war . the palestinians who read newspapers were presented with arguments for and against nazi germany and well informed about the true aims of the nazi regime - and also that hitler 's racism extended well beyond the jews . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : not everyone thought like the grand mufti " they , in part , embraced anti-semitism and racism , but did not share the in eliminatory character of the nazi regime , " wildangel said of arab nationalists , adding that husayni 's ideological and political views frequently met with explicit opposition in the palestinian population . the tendency to represent palestinians as collective adherents of the nazis primarily has to do with the ongoing israeli-palestinian conflict that heated up after 1945 , said wildangel . history as a political weapon " the more intense the hate becomes in the middle east conflict , the more likely people are to convey this view of history , " he said .
" the israeli authors make reference to the mufti and the arabs refuse to deal with anti-semitism and the holocaust at all . " wildangel said he believes that shifting the blame and not dealing with the other side 's past only intensify the crisis .
his latest book , available in german -lrb- " zwischen achse und mandatsmacht " -rrb- , is at least one effort to spur a two-sided discussion . sarah mersch -lrb- kjb -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

germany is bound to be happy with at least one of his proposals . sarkozy on tuesday , jan .

it was part of what he calls a " policy of civilization . "
having made the most headlines recently for his relationship with singer and former model carla bruni , sarkozy was clearly eager to re-establish some political gravitas in his speech in paris .
among a number of ambitious changes , he said the french government would be advocating enlarging the g8 club of the world 's leading industrialized nations to include china , india , south africa , mexico and brazil .
he also said paris wanted to see the united nations security council expanded to encompass permanent seats for germany , japan , india and a large african nation .
" you can not organize the world of the 21st century with the organization of the 20th , " sarkozy told journalists . " you ca n't deal with the world 's big questions without getting the opinion of at least one nation form africa , a continent with one billion people . "
sarkozy also called for reforms of the world bank and the international monetary fund .
eu agenda bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the sarkozy-bruni soap-opera romance has fascinated the french sarkozy also devoted a portion of his address to discussing his plans for the rotating eu presidency , which france takes over on july 1 .
" when our presidency is over , i want europe to have an immigration policy , an energy policy , an environmental policy and a defense policy , " sarkozy said .
he said the negative side-effects of globalization on the world 's climate and the world economy made reforms unavoidable .
" do we seriously believe that our civilization can survive the mistakes of finance capitalism or global environmental destruction unscathed ? "
sarkozy asked .
" finance capital needs to be made morally responsible . "
french voters will get their first chance to pass judgement on sarkozy 's " policy of civilization " in two months when they go to the polls for local elections . dw staff -lrb- jc -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

the legislature , elected in november , is to vote on a speaker and cabinet on wednesday . " the number one commitment of this government , and of all kosovo citizens , is to formalize kosovo as an independent , democratic state , " said thaci , whose ethnic albanian guerrilla army fought serb forces in 1998-1999 to end repression under the late serbian leader slobodan milosevic .

cyprus , greece , spain , slovakia and romania , however , have expressed concern , fearing that independence for the province could set an example for other major ethnic minorities wanting to secede . a week after his country took over the rotating eu presidency , slovenian prime minister janez jansa indicated on monday in ljubljana that kosovo 's independence was inevitable . " for kosovo , it 's clear what will happen , it 's more a question of how to do it , " said jansa . talking with reporters , jansa recalled the brutality against ethnic albanians - which make up 90 percent of kosovo population of 2.2 million - under milosevic during the 1990s . " it 's not possible after all this " to force the people of kosovo to live with the serbs , he said .

two polar bear babies at the nuremberg zoo were n't so lucky . when one zookeeper in nuremberg checked the cage of mama bear vilma on monday , he found no sign of the little ones .

"
that included not entering the bear 's den until at least six weeks after the birth since it could otherwise disturb the animals ' natural behavior - a policy prescribed by the european animal conservation and breeding program . a zoo spokesman on tuesday agreed , saying the keepers had acted " absolutely correctly " under the guidelines . but late tuesday afternoon , the zoo announced it would err on the side of caution , remove vera 's baby , and bottle-feed it like knut .
the zoo made the decision after observing how vera had brought out the cub from the den and tried to hide it in shrubbery . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : having just turned a year old , knut is n't so cute anymore nuremberg zoo 's deputy director helmut mägdefrau told ap news agency : " she 's completely nervous .

vera was apparently disturbed by a camera team that had approached the den without permission . vera junior has since been separated from its mother , and appears to be in tip-top condition .

working for european unity is all well and good but how can it succeed when member states themselves are divided ? the widening of the schengen agreement at the end of 2007 not only opened up more of europe 's borders and welcomed nine more eu countries to the bloc 's free movement zone , it also represented another significant step in the european union 's quest for unity and inclusiveness .
as the travel restrictions between countries are eradicated , the eu project gets ever closer to its goal of a european super-state , a collection of countries all deciding on the fate of europe .
however , not everyone shares in the feeling of enthusiasm for such a body .
while schengen means freedom for some , its ultimate objective - to bring europe closer together - represents a threat to others .
many of those countries which oppose the increase in centralized power that the eu super-state would need to operate efficiently and credibly are concerned about the erosion of sovereignty .
others , like the czech republic 's president vaclav klaus , fear the dilution of culture and identity for those countries absorbed into the new whole .
while the opening of the borders between the czech republic and slovakia in december caused some to muse about a romantic return to a single czechoslovakia , klaus warned that such mergers may come with a high price .
" our identity must be cultivated and protected if we do not want , as so many times in the past , to lose our freedom , " he said .
the quest for a united states of europe also spreads a similar concern among the continent 's minorities .
the fight for statehood becomes harder for the likes of the catalans , basques , corsicans , flemings and walloons when the opponent is no longer just a country but the whole of the european union .

the situation concerning the divided flemings and walloons of belgium , one made more poignant by the fact that they live side-by-side in the country which hosts the european seat of power , has been described by some observers as a microcosm of the problems facing the eu in its quest for unity .

both have majority powers which once tolerated the minorities but have since grown tired of supporting and paying for these apparently ungrateful and selfish groups and have advocated at times for a parting of the ways .
both are faced with the challenges of combining centralization and decentralization , identity and solidarity , and creating a forum for very different opinions .
in the belgian political process , the obstacles stopping the two main groups facing those challenges together appear self-made .

working for european unity is all well and good but how can it succeed when member states themselves are divided ? the widening of the schengen agreement at the end of 2007 not only opened up more of europe 's borders and welcomed nine more eu countries to the bloc 's free movement zone , it also represented another significant step in the european union 's quest for unity and inclusiveness .
as the travel restrictions between countries are eradicated , the eu project gets ever closer to its goal of a european super-state , a collection of countries all deciding on the fate of europe .
however , not everyone shares in the feeling of enthusiasm for such a body .
while schengen means freedom for some , its ultimate objective - to bring europe closer together - represents a threat to others .
many of those countries which oppose the increase in centralized power that the eu super-state would need to operate efficiently and credibly are concerned about the erosion of sovereignty .
others , like the czech republic 's president vaclav klaus , fear the dilution of culture and identity for those countries absorbed into the new whole .
while the opening of the borders between the czech republic and slovakia in december caused some to muse about a romantic return to a single czechoslovakia , klaus warned that such mergers may come with a high price .
" our identity must be cultivated and protected if we do not want , as so many times in the past , to lose our freedom , " he said .
the quest for a united states of europe also spreads a similar concern among the continent 's minorities .
the fight for statehood becomes harder for the likes of the catalans , basques , corsicans , flemings and walloons when the opponent is no longer just a country but the whole of the european union .
quest for autonomy undermines eu unity bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : it 's hard enough to keep all 27 eu nations together in turn , the desire for autonomy grows .
" as their countries lose sovereignty , all such minorities are encouraged to assert their identity through independence and statehood , " said kristine dekeyser , a political scientist and author on belgian politics .
" in the case of european minorities , given the incentive to increase their demands , their destabilizing actions begin to have a much wider effect .
agitating for independence ultimately puts a strain on the eu 's progress towards unity . "
the situation concerning the divided flemings and walloons of belgium , one made more poignant by the fact that they live side-by-side in the country which hosts the european seat of power , has been described by some observers as a microcosm of the problems facing the eu in its quest for unity .
some have gone as far as to say that belgium 's crisis today is the eu 's crisis tomorrow .
" the argument that some use is : how can you possibly create a unified europe if you ca n't even bring a small country like belgium together ? " ' said peter bursens from the political science faculty at the university of antwerp .
" both instances have very similar problems , such as the need for more political integration , more cooperation and more trust . "
belgium and europe share similar challenges bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : affluent flanders resents supporting poorer wallonia the unwillingness to concede , which has been threatening to pull belgium apart , mirrors that which has been dogging the eu since its inception .
both have majority powers which once tolerated the minorities but have since grown tired of supporting and paying for these apparently ungrateful and selfish groups and have advocated at times for a parting of the ways .
both are faced with the challenges of combining centralization and decentralization , identity and solidarity , and creating a forum for very different opinions .
in the belgian political process , the obstacles stopping the two main groups facing those challenges together appear self-made .
rather than uniting , the flemish and walloon parties seem to be drifting further apart .
instead of joining together , free of the constraints of actual borders , minorities in the country are intent on building new barriers to keep them apart .
" in belgium , it is the flemish - and mainly only the regionalists , nationalists and extremists , i must add - who promote this divide , " bursens said .
" they have a strong history of fighting for the right to speak their own language , to have their own policies and governance .
they fear encroachment on that from the walloons in the south .
they are also responsible for opposing european integration initiatives .
they want to protect all they have achieved . "
embracing diversity can heal the rifts bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : premier verhofstadt is charged with making both sides see sense while the belgian process slides dangerously close to a separation , the european process is heading towards integration .
that , observers believe , is a reason for hope for both the stability of belgium and the future of europe .
" people have the wrong idea about europe , that we should all be one , " bursens said .
" that 's not the point .
diversity is what europe is all about ; diversity of identity and culture .
for all its differences , the eu works because the cost of it not working is too great .
the politicians always find a way because there is a will to make it work .
the same will happen with belgium .
it has to . "
political scientist kristine dekeyser added that belgium 's two separate public spheres could make people think that the country could never stand a chance .
" but people have been making belgium function for years , " she said .
" these are not new problems .
europe can learn from this .

and that includes not only croatia and bosnia-herzegovina , but also serbia .
germany agrees . speaking during a meeting with top eu officials in the estate of brdo , near the capital ljubljana , slovenian prime minister janez jansa said that his government would assist balkan states joining the eu .
he added that he hoped membership talks would not be slowed down over the coming months .
" we need to find solutions that will stabilize the region in the long term , " jansa told reporters .
slovenia has close ties with the other balkan nations that used to form yugoslavia , including croatia and bosnia-herzogovina .
and dismissing objections from some quarters , slovenian foreign minister dimitrij rupel said serbia should be allowed to sign a stabilization and association agreement -lrb- saa -rrb- - a precursor of accession negotiations proper - with the eu " as soon as possible , possibly by the end of this month . "
several eu member states have argued that serbia should first prove its full cooperation with the international war crimes tribunal in the hague by arresting former general ratko mladic and other fugitives wanted for alleged crimes against humanity during the 1990s balkan wars .
but speaking after a meeting with his finnish counterpart in berlin on tuesday , german foreign minister frank-walter steinmeier also said that an saa could be signed with serbia as early as the end of january .

many experts expect the potentially explosive situation in kosovo , serbia 's breakaway province , to keep slovenian officials busy over the coming weeks , on monday , the two largest political parties in the predominantly ethnic-albanian province agreed to form a coalition government tasked with declaring independence from belgrade .
the eu is later this month due to decide on sending a law-enforcing mission to replace a un administered system which has governed kosovo since 1999 , in spite of objections from serbia and russia .
slovenia is the first former communist country from eastern europe , as well as the first new eu member state , to assume the bloc 's presidency .
with a population of just two million , the country has to rely on the help of france , its much bigger successor in the eu presidency .
and observers in brussels say it risks by overshadowed .

what goes around comes around .
with germany enacting more and more anti-smoking legislation , one entrepreneur decided he was fed up and fired three non-smokers for not lighting up . for german smokers these are trying times .
not only are they now prohibited from indulging their habit in the bars where they used to spend their evenings cuddling amidst the silver-blue haze .
they are also subjected to a constant barrage of crowing from self-righteous non-smokers .
but one small businessman , thomas j. , from the northern german town of büsum , is fighting the power .
the head of a 10-person internet-based computer-supply company has just gotten rid of three non-smoking employees .
" our non-smoking employees were of the opinion they had a right to smoke-free areas , " thomas j. told the daily hamburger morgenpost newspaper .
" my answer was to immediately hand them their walking papers .
smokers make for more even-headed , better employees at our company . "
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : water pipes are also an option for those concerned about their jobs part of the problem was that the trio of non-smokers did n't want to sit near their puffing peers at after-work social activities .
if you want a job with thomas j. , you 'd better get work on a 40-a-day habit .
" everyone 's always beating up on smokers , but now the shoe 's on the other foot , " thomas j. said .
" in any case , i 'm only hiring smokers in future . "
but thomas j. , who did n't want to give his full name to the press , may have drawn up his smoker-friendly workplace policy without considering the legal implications .
" if employees make use a right like health protection , they are n't allowed to be fired , " labor law expert malte masloff told the hamburger morgenpost .
" and unlike other laws concerning firings in small businesses , this rule also applies to firms with 10 workers or less . "
so thomas j. may have to put up with irritating non-smokers after all . dw staff -lrb- jc -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

the legislature , elected in november , is to vote on a speaker and cabinet on wednesday . " the number one commitment of this government , and of all kosovo citizens , is to formalize kosovo as an independent , democratic state , " said thaci , whose ethnic albanian guerrilla army fought serb forces in 1998-1999 to end repression under the late serbian leader slobodan milosevic .

historians have typically characterized palestinians collectively as hitler-supporters during the nazi regime .
but a german researcher has said that they were more concerned with relations with an other european country . any historical conversation in germany over palestine and national socialism usually turns to one name : grand mufti hajj amin al husseini .
the muslim leader was an anti-semite , a passionate follower of the nazis and moved to germany in 1941 to collaborate with hitler 's regime . however , in a recently published study , berlin-based historian rene wildangel has claimed husseini " was simply not representative " of his countrymen during that time . contrary to current studies " it 's not a question of whether he was an anti-semite or a collaborator - that 's relatively clear , " said wildangel .
" we have to consider the things that were happening in palestine and not just this one person . " much of the research conducted on relations between arab nations and the nazi regime , including a 2006 book by klaus-michael mallmann and martin cüppers titled " the crescent and the swastika : the third reich , the arabs , and palestine " -lrb- halbmond und hakenkreuz .
das dritte reich , die araber und palästina -rrb- , has reached the conclusion that only germany 's defeat in northern africa prevented " german-arab mass crime " against jews .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : wildangel 's book reached a different conclusion than most other research most of the historical research on the topic is based on german , british and israeli sources and neglects the palestinian perspective , which is why it has been taken for granted that the palestinians took the same pro-hitler stance as their leader , said wildangel . by examining how nazi germany was portrayed in palestinian newspapers and publications in the 1930s and 1940s , wildangel found a fascination about adolf hitler among palestinians . nazis were enemy of the enemy but the nazis ' positive reception had less to do with a general anti-semitic sentiment , concluded wildangel , and more to do with opposition to british colonial rule , which would last until 1948 .
nazi germany was , after all , britain 's enemy in the war . the palestinians who read newspapers were presented with arguments for and against nazi germany and well informed about the true aims of the nazi regime - and also that hitler 's racism extended well beyond the jews . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : not everyone thought like the grand mufti " they , in part , embraced anti-semitism and racism , but did not share the in eliminatory character of the nazi regime , " wildangel said of arab nationalists , adding that husayni 's ideological and political views frequently met with explicit opposition in the palestinian population . the tendency to represent palestinians as collective adherents of the nazis primarily has to do with the ongoing israeli-palestinian conflict that heated up after 1945 , said wildangel . history as a political weapon " the more intense the hate becomes in the middle east conflict , the more likely people are to convey this view of history , " he said .
" the israeli authors make reference to the mufti and the arabs refuse to deal with anti-semitism and the holocaust at all . " wildangel said he believes that shifting the blame and not dealing with the other side 's past only intensify the crisis .

working for european unity is all well and good but how can it succeed when member states themselves are divided ? the widening of the schengen agreement at the end of 2007 not only opened up more of europe 's borders and welcomed nine more eu countries to the bloc 's free movement zone , it also represented another significant step in the european union 's quest for unity and inclusiveness .
as the travel restrictions between countries are eradicated , the eu project gets ever closer to its goal of a european super-state , a collection of countries all deciding on the fate of europe .
however , not everyone shares in the feeling of enthusiasm for such a body .
while schengen means freedom for some , its ultimate objective - to bring europe closer together - represents a threat to others .
many of those countries which oppose the increase in centralized power that the eu super-state would need to operate efficiently and credibly are concerned about the erosion of sovereignty .
others , like the czech republic 's president vaclav klaus , fear the dilution of culture and identity for those countries absorbed into the new whole .
while the opening of the borders between the czech republic and slovakia in december caused some to muse about a romantic return to a single czechoslovakia , klaus warned that such mergers may come with a high price .
" our identity must be cultivated and protected if we do not want , as so many times in the past , to lose our freedom , " he said .
the quest for a united states of europe also spreads a similar concern among the continent 's minorities .
the fight for statehood becomes harder for the likes of the catalans , basques , corsicans , flemings and walloons when the opponent is no longer just a country but the whole of the european union .
quest for autonomy undermines eu unity bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : it 's hard enough to keep all 27 eu nations together in turn , the desire for autonomy grows .
" as their countries lose sovereignty , all such minorities are encouraged to assert their identity through independence and statehood , " said kristine dekeyser , a political scientist and author on belgian politics .
" in the case of european minorities , given the incentive to increase their demands , their destabilizing actions begin to have a much wider effect .
agitating for independence ultimately puts a strain on the eu 's progress towards unity . "
the situation concerning the divided flemings and walloons of belgium , one made more poignant by the fact that they live side-by-side in the country which hosts the european seat of power , has been described by some observers as a microcosm of the problems facing the eu in its quest for unity .
some have gone as far as to say that belgium 's crisis today is the eu 's crisis tomorrow .
" the argument that some use is : how can you possibly create a unified europe if you ca n't even bring a small country like belgium together ? " ' said peter bursens from the political science faculty at the university of antwerp .
" both instances have very similar problems , such as the need for more political integration , more cooperation and more trust . "
belgium and europe share similar challenges bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : affluent flanders resents supporting poorer wallonia the unwillingness to concede , which has been threatening to pull belgium apart , mirrors that which has been dogging the eu since its inception .
both have majority powers which once tolerated the minorities but have since grown tired of supporting and paying for these apparently ungrateful and selfish groups and have advocated at times for a parting of the ways .
both are faced with the challenges of combining centralization and decentralization , identity and solidarity , and creating a forum for very different opinions .
in the belgian political process , the obstacles stopping the two main groups facing those challenges together appear self-made .
rather than uniting , the flemish and walloon parties seem to be drifting further apart .
instead of joining together , free of the constraints of actual borders , minorities in the country are intent on building new barriers to keep them apart .
" in belgium , it is the flemish - and mainly only the regionalists , nationalists and extremists , i must add - who promote this divide , " bursens said .
" they have a strong history of fighting for the right to speak their own language , to have their own policies and governance .
they fear encroachment on that from the walloons in the south .
they are also responsible for opposing european integration initiatives .
they want to protect all they have achieved . "
embracing diversity can heal the rifts bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : premier verhofstadt is charged with making both sides see sense while the belgian process slides dangerously close to a separation , the european process is heading towards integration .
that , observers believe , is a reason for hope for both the stability of belgium and the future of europe .
" people have the wrong idea about europe , that we should all be one , " bursens said .
" that 's not the point .
diversity is what europe is all about ; diversity of identity and culture .
for all its differences , the eu works because the cost of it not working is too great .
the politicians always find a way because there is a will to make it work .
the same will happen with belgium .
it has to . "
political scientist kristine dekeyser added that belgium 's two separate public spheres could make people think that the country could never stand a chance .

working for european unity is all well and good but how can it succeed when member states themselves are divided ? the widening of the schengen agreement at the end of 2007 not only opened up more of europe 's borders and welcomed nine more eu countries to the bloc 's free movement zone , it also represented another significant step in the european union 's quest for unity and inclusiveness .
as the travel restrictions between countries are eradicated , the eu project gets ever closer to its goal of a european super-state , a collection of countries all deciding on the fate of europe .
however , not everyone shares in the feeling of enthusiasm for such a body .
while schengen means freedom for some , its ultimate objective - to bring europe closer together - represents a threat to others .
many of those countries which oppose the increase in centralized power that the eu super-state would need to operate efficiently and credibly are concerned about the erosion of sovereignty .
others , like the czech republic 's president vaclav klaus , fear the dilution of culture and identity for those countries absorbed into the new whole .
while the opening of the borders between the czech republic and slovakia in december caused some to muse about a romantic return to a single czechoslovakia , klaus warned that such mergers may come with a high price .
" our identity must be cultivated and protected if we do not want , as so many times in the past , to lose our freedom , " he said .
the quest for a united states of europe also spreads a similar concern among the continent 's minorities .

historians have typically characterized palestinians collectively as hitler-supporters during the nazi regime .
but a german researcher has said that they were more concerned with relations with an other european country . any historical conversation in germany over palestine and national socialism usually turns to one name : grand mufti hajj amin al husseini .
the muslim leader was an anti-semite , a passionate follower of the nazis and moved to germany in 1941 to collaborate with hitler 's regime . however , in a recently published study , berlin-based historian rene wildangel has claimed husseini " was simply not representative " of his countrymen during that time . contrary to current studies " it 's not a question of whether he was an anti-semite or a collaborator - that 's relatively clear , " said wildangel .
" we have to consider the things that were happening in palestine and not just this one person . " much of the research conducted on relations between arab nations and the nazi regime , including a 2006 book by klaus-michael mallmann and martin cüppers titled " the crescent and the swastika : the third reich , the arabs , and palestine " -lrb- halbmond und hakenkreuz .
das dritte reich , die araber und palästina -rrb- , has reached the conclusion that only germany 's defeat in northern africa prevented " german-arab mass crime " against jews .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : wildangel 's book reached a different conclusion than most other research most of the historical research on the topic is based on german , british and israeli sources and neglects the palestinian perspective , which is why it has been taken for granted that the palestinians took the same pro-hitler stance as their leader , said wildangel . by examining how nazi germany was portrayed in palestinian newspapers and publications in the 1930s and 1940s , wildangel found a fascination about adolf hitler among palestinians . nazis were enemy of the enemy but the nazis ' positive reception had less to do with a general anti-semitic sentiment , concluded wildangel , and more to do with opposition to british colonial rule , which would last until 1948 .
nazi germany was , after all , britain 's enemy in the war . the palestinians who read newspapers were presented with arguments for and against nazi germany and well informed about the true aims of the nazi regime - and also that hitler 's racism extended well beyond the jews . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : not everyone thought like the grand mufti " they , in part , embraced anti-semitism and racism , but did not share the in eliminatory character of the nazi regime , " wildangel said of arab nationalists , adding that husayni 's ideological and political views frequently met with explicit opposition in the palestinian population . the tendency to represent palestinians as collective adherents of the nazis primarily has to do with the ongoing israeli-palestinian conflict that heated up after 1945 , said wildangel . history as a political weapon " the more intense the hate becomes in the middle east conflict , the more likely people are to convey this view of history , " he said .
" the israeli authors make reference to the mufti and the arabs refuse to deal with anti-semitism and the holocaust at all . " wildangel said he believes that shifting the blame and not dealing with the other side 's past only intensify the crisis .

the club has said the machines could be easily manipulated . eight different cities and districts have planned to use voting computers for the jan .
27 state parliament election in hesse .
the computers are intended to replace paper ballots for for about 100,000 of the states 4.3 million voters . but one voter in hesse has taken the lead , along with members of the chaos computer club -lrb- ccc -rrb- , and filed an injunction with the hesse state supreme court against the use of voting computers in the forthcoming election . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : electronic voting machines were used in saxony-anhalt in 2002 ccc members said voting computers violate basic principles of electoral law by making it impossible to verify or recount ballots .
the hacker group also pointed to hard and software manipulation vulnerability among computer voting machines by the manufacturer nedap . the dutch reverted to paper past elections in the netherlands have shown that the machines can be tampered with .
since 2006 , the dutch have gone back to voting on paper - after hackers from ccc and a dutch group exposed technical security and transparency flaws among nedap voting computers . while the hesse interior ministry has implemented what it calls " security measures " to protect computer voting vulnerabilities among esd1 and nsd2 models , which the state intends to employ , the computer organization said measures still do not address the fundamental problems with the voting machine system . dirk engling , a spokesman for the ccc , noted on the club 's web site one basic issue with the computer technology : " the voter does n't know if software or hardware has been manipulated . " " no checks and balances " furthermore , lacking a paper printout confirming the vote , there is no way of proving that the tally stored in the machine really corresponds to the votes cast .
paper ballots , at least , can be recounted , he added . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : without a paper trail , there 's no way to prove whether votes are counted correctly , the ccc said another spokesman for the ccc said that no voting computer in the world can fulfill all security requirements . other counties in hesse have chosen not to use the computerized voting system , citing financial or reliability reasons for their decision to revert back to paper ballots . during local elections in march 2006 , 13 communities in hesse employed a total of 306 voting computers , with around 180,000 citizens casting their votes via such machines . should the hesse state supreme court allow the use of the machines for this election , the prosecuting counsel for ccc said there were " dozens of volunteers who would raise objections against the ballot after the election .

the club has said the machines could be easily manipulated . eight different cities and districts have planned to use voting computers for the jan .
27 state parliament election in hesse .
the computers are intended to replace paper ballots for for about 100,000 of the states 4.3 million voters . but one voter in hesse has taken the lead , along with members of the chaos computer club -lrb- ccc -rrb- , and filed an injunction with the hesse state supreme court against the use of voting computers in the forthcoming election . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : electronic voting machines were used in saxony-anhalt in 2002 ccc members said voting computers violate basic principles of electoral law by making it impossible to verify or recount ballots .
the hacker group also pointed to hard and software manipulation vulnerability among computer voting machines by the manufacturer nedap . the dutch reverted to paper past elections in the netherlands have shown that the machines can be tampered with .
since 2006 , the dutch have gone back to voting on paper - after hackers from ccc and a dutch group exposed technical security and transparency flaws among nedap voting computers . while the hesse interior ministry has implemented what it calls " security measures " to protect computer voting vulnerabilities among esd1 and nsd2 models , which the state intends to employ , the computer organization said measures still do not address the fundamental problems with the voting machine system . dirk engling , a spokesman for the ccc , noted on the club 's web site one basic issue with the computer technology : " the voter does n't know if software or hardware has been manipulated . " " no checks and balances " furthermore , lacking a paper printout confirming the vote , there is no way of proving that the tally stored in the machine really corresponds to the votes cast .
paper ballots , at least , can be recounted , he added . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : without a paper trail , there 's no way to prove whether votes are counted correctly , the ccc said another spokesman for the ccc said that no voting computer in the world can fulfill all security requirements . other counties in hesse have chosen not to use the computerized voting system , citing financial or reliability reasons for their decision to revert back to paper ballots . during local elections in march 2006 , 13 communities in hesse employed a total of 306 voting computers , with around 180,000 citizens casting their votes via such machines . should the hesse state supreme court allow the use of the machines for this election , the prosecuting counsel for ccc said there were " dozens of volunteers who would raise objections against the ballot after the election .

two polar bear babies at the nuremberg zoo were n't so lucky . when one zookeeper in nuremberg checked the cage of mama bear vilma on monday , he found no sign of the little ones .
dag encke , director of the zoo , said monday : " we presume she 's eaten them .

"
that included not entering the bear 's den until at least six weeks after the birth since it could otherwise disturb the animals ' natural behavior - a policy prescribed by the european animal conservation and breeding program . a zoo spokesman on tuesday agreed , saying the keepers had acted " absolutely correctly " under the guidelines . but late tuesday afternoon , the zoo announced it would err on the side of caution , remove vera 's baby , and bottle-feed it like knut .
the zoo made the decision after observing how vera had brought out the cub from the den and tried to hide it in shrubbery . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : having just turned a year old , knut is n't so cute anymore nuremberg zoo 's deputy director helmut mägdefrau told ap news agency : " she 's completely nervous .

two polar bear babies at the nuremberg zoo were n't so lucky . when one zookeeper in nuremberg checked the cage of mama bear vilma on monday , he found no sign of the little ones .
dag encke , director of the zoo , said monday : " we presume she 's eaten them . " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : knut won hearts around the world the cubs may have been ill or dead already when vilma devoured them . " predators are known to eat their offspring when there 's something wrong , or when the mother knows she can not raise them properly , " encke told ap news agency . mixed bear signals the zoo apparently became aware of a change when keepers stopped hearing the howls of the cubs over the weekend , but they believed that meant vilma was taking care of her offspring well . but on monday , when she came out of her cave alone and paced the cage nervously , one keeper became alarmed and searched the stall . the german association for the protection of animals said the nuremberg zoo should have acted sooner . " we are against keeping and breeding polar bears in zoos , " the association 's head thomas schröder said , adding however , that a zoo has a responsibility once it takes on the task .
" that means : every animal has a right to life . " knut forged the path knut certainly can attest to that .

"
that included not entering the bear 's den until at least six weeks after the birth since it could otherwise disturb the animals ' natural behavior - a policy prescribed by the european animal conservation and breeding program . a zoo spokesman on tuesday agreed , saying the keepers had acted " absolutely correctly " under the guidelines . but late tuesday afternoon , the zoo announced it would err on the side of caution , remove vera 's baby , and bottle-feed it like knut .
the zoo made the decision after observing how vera had brought out the cub from the den and tried to hide it in shrubbery . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : having just turned a year old , knut is n't so cute anymore nuremberg zoo 's deputy director helmut mägdefrau told ap news agency : " she 's completely nervous .

and there are more and more countries using jamming transmitters to interfere with radio broadcasts , as well as blocking or censoring the internet . ”
regardless of differing historical backgrounds , missions and experience , the five international broadcasters all have the goal of offering truthful and pluralistic news and information to people around the world .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de bundesliga -pipe- 08.01.2008 german soccer body sues match-fixing referee großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : hoyzer 's decisions effectively cost several teams important wins a court will hear a case between the german soccer federation -lrb- dfb -rrb- and robert hoyzer , a referee convicted of trying to fix matches .
after being booted from soccer , the ref may end up in the poorhouse . the case , which gets underway in berlin on wednesday , jan .
9 , sees the dfb trying to recover 1.8 million euros -lrb- $ 2.2 million -rrb- in damages from hoyzer .
the lion 's share of that sum reflects compensation worth 2 million euros paid by the dfb to first-division club hamburg in compensation for their unfairly losing a 2004 german cup match hoyzer officiated .
hoyzer later admitted to using his refereeing decisions to alter the course of that and one other cup match and around nine lower-division games .
he was sentenced to nearly two and a half years in prison for helping to commit fraud in november 2005 .
the match-fixing scandal , which was spearheaded by a croatian betting mafia in berlin , was the worst such incident in german soccer in 30 years and dented the credibility of the sport .
not about the money bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : hoyzer has already lost a criminal case - now he 's on trial in civil court even if the lawsuit is successful , it 's highly unlikely that the dfb will be able to recoup the full amount from hoyzer , who 's currently still serving out his sentence .
" it 's not about whether we can get the money or not , " dfb president theo zwanziger said when the suit was filed two years ago .
" but it would be irresponsible not to try because the dfb has suffered a huge image and financial loss from mr. hoyzer . "
it is unclear how long the lawsuit might take , but the berlin court could render a verdict fairly quickly .
" it could be that we agree on further hearing dates on wednesday , " the court said in a statement .
" but it 's also possible that a decision or the date for a decision will be announced . "
hoyzer is not required to be in attendance at the trial and will likely be represented by his attorneys .
the dfb has banned hoyzer from soccer for life . dw staff -lrb- jc -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

after being booted from soccer , the ref may end up in the poorhouse . the case , which gets underway in berlin on wednesday , jan .
9 , sees the dfb trying to recover 1.8 million euros -lrb- $ 2.2 million -rrb- in damages from hoyzer .
the lion 's share of that sum reflects compensation worth 2 million euros paid by the dfb to first-division club hamburg in compensation for their unfairly losing a 2004 german cup match hoyzer officiated .
hoyzer later admitted to using his refereeing decisions to alter the course of that and one other cup match and around nine lower-division games .
he was sentenced to nearly two and a half years in prison for helping to commit fraud in november 2005 .
the match-fixing scandal , which was spearheaded by a croatian betting mafia in berlin , was the worst such incident in german soccer in 30 years and dented the credibility of the sport .
not about the money bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : hoyzer has already lost a criminal case - now he 's on trial in civil court even if the lawsuit is successful , it 's highly unlikely that the dfb will be able to recoup the full amount from hoyzer , who 's currently still serving out his sentence .
" it 's not about whether we can get the money or not , " dfb president theo zwanziger said when the suit was filed two years ago .
" but it would be irresponsible not to try because the dfb has suffered a huge image and financial loss from mr. hoyzer . "
it is unclear how long the lawsuit might take , but the berlin court could render a verdict fairly quickly .
" it could be that we agree on further hearing dates on wednesday , " the court said in a statement .
" but it 's also possible that a decision or the date for a decision will be announced . "
hoyzer is not required to be in attendance at the trial and will likely be represented by his attorneys .
the dfb has banned hoyzer from soccer for life . dw staff -lrb- jc -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

and that includes not only croatia and bosnia-herzegovina , but also serbia .
germany agrees . speaking during a meeting with top eu officials in the estate of brdo , near the capital ljubljana , slovenian prime minister janez jansa said that his government would assist balkan states joining the eu .
he added that he hoped membership talks would not be slowed down over the coming months .
" we need to find solutions that will stabilize the region in the long term , " jansa told reporters .
slovenia has close ties with the other balkan nations that used to form yugoslavia , including croatia and bosnia-herzogovina .
and dismissing objections from some quarters , slovenian foreign minister dimitrij rupel said serbia should be allowed to sign a stabilization and association agreement -lrb- saa -rrb- - a precursor of accession negotiations proper - with the eu " as soon as possible , possibly by the end of this month . "
several eu member states have argued that serbia should first prove its full cooperation with the international war crimes tribunal in the hague by arresting former general ratko mladic and other fugitives wanted for alleged crimes against humanity during the 1990s balkan wars .
but speaking after a meeting with his finnish counterpart in berlin on tuesday , german foreign minister frank-walter steinmeier also said that an saa could be signed with serbia as early as the end of january .
neighboring problems bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : serbia 's opposition to kosovan independence could be another wedge with the eu but slovenia may have to spend part of its presidency doing damage control .
many experts expect the potentially explosive situation in kosovo , serbia 's breakaway province , to keep slovenian officials busy over the coming weeks , on monday , the two largest political parties in the predominantly ethnic-albanian province agreed to form a coalition government tasked with declaring independence from belgrade .
the eu is later this month due to decide on sending a law-enforcing mission to replace a un administered system which has governed kosovo since 1999 , in spite of objections from serbia and russia .
slovenia is the first former communist country from eastern europe , as well as the first new eu member state , to assume the bloc 's presidency .
with a population of just two million , the country has to rely on the help of france , its much bigger successor in the eu presidency .
and observers in brussels say it risks by overshadowed .

working for european unity is all well and good but how can it succeed when member states themselves are divided ? the widening of the schengen agreement at the end of 2007 not only opened up more of europe 's borders and welcomed nine more eu countries to the bloc 's free movement zone , it also represented another significant step in the european union 's quest for unity and inclusiveness .
as the travel restrictions between countries are eradicated , the eu project gets ever closer to its goal of a european super-state , a collection of countries all deciding on the fate of europe .
however , not everyone shares in the feeling of enthusiasm for such a body .
while schengen means freedom for some , its ultimate objective - to bring europe closer together - represents a threat to others .
many of those countries which oppose the increase in centralized power that the eu super-state would need to operate efficiently and credibly are concerned about the erosion of sovereignty .
others , like the czech republic 's president vaclav klaus , fear the dilution of culture and identity for those countries absorbed into the new whole .
while the opening of the borders between the czech republic and slovakia in december caused some to muse about a romantic return to a single czechoslovakia , klaus warned that such mergers may come with a high price .
" our identity must be cultivated and protected if we do not want , as so many times in the past , to lose our freedom , " he said .
the quest for a united states of europe also spreads a similar concern among the continent 's minorities .
the fight for statehood becomes harder for the likes of the catalans , basques , corsicans , flemings and walloons when the opponent is no longer just a country but the whole of the european union .
quest for autonomy undermines eu unity bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : it 's hard enough to keep all 27 eu nations together in turn , the desire for autonomy grows .
" as their countries lose sovereignty , all such minorities are encouraged to assert their identity through independence and statehood , " said kristine dekeyser , a political scientist and author on belgian politics .
" in the case of european minorities , given the incentive to increase their demands , their destabilizing actions begin to have a much wider effect .
agitating for independence ultimately puts a strain on the eu 's progress towards unity . "
the situation concerning the divided flemings and walloons of belgium , one made more poignant by the fact that they live side-by-side in the country which hosts the european seat of power , has been described by some observers as a microcosm of the problems facing the eu in its quest for unity .
some have gone as far as to say that belgium 's crisis today is the eu 's crisis tomorrow .
" the argument that some use is : how can you possibly create a unified europe if you ca n't even bring a small country like belgium together ? " ' said peter bursens from the political science faculty at the university of antwerp .
" both instances have very similar problems , such as the need for more political integration , more cooperation and more trust . "
belgium and europe share similar challenges bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : affluent flanders resents supporting poorer wallonia the unwillingness to concede , which has been threatening to pull belgium apart , mirrors that which has been dogging the eu since its inception .
both have majority powers which once tolerated the minorities but have since grown tired of supporting and paying for these apparently ungrateful and selfish groups and have advocated at times for a parting of the ways .
both are faced with the challenges of combining centralization and decentralization , identity and solidarity , and creating a forum for very different opinions .
in the belgian political process , the obstacles stopping the two main groups facing those challenges together appear self-made .
rather than uniting , the flemish and walloon parties seem to be drifting further apart .
instead of joining together , free of the constraints of actual borders , minorities in the country are intent on building new barriers to keep them apart .
" in belgium , it is the flemish - and mainly only the regionalists , nationalists and extremists , i must add - who promote this divide , " bursens said .
" they have a strong history of fighting for the right to speak their own language , to have their own policies and governance .
they fear encroachment on that from the walloons in the south .
they are also responsible for opposing european integration initiatives .
they want to protect all they have achieved . "
embracing diversity can heal the rifts bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : premier verhofstadt is charged with making both sides see sense while the belgian process slides dangerously close to a separation , the european process is heading towards integration .
that , observers believe , is a reason for hope for both the stability of belgium and the future of europe .
" people have the wrong idea about europe , that we should all be one , " bursens said .

for all its differences , the eu works because the cost of it not working is too great .

working for european unity is all well and good but how can it succeed when member states themselves are divided ? the widening of the schengen agreement at the end of 2007 not only opened up more of europe 's borders and welcomed nine more eu countries to the bloc 's free movement zone , it also represented another significant step in the european union 's quest for unity and inclusiveness .
as the travel restrictions between countries are eradicated , the eu project gets ever closer to its goal of a european super-state , a collection of countries all deciding on the fate of europe .
however , not everyone shares in the feeling of enthusiasm for such a body .
while schengen means freedom for some , its ultimate objective - to bring europe closer together - represents a threat to others .
many of those countries which oppose the increase in centralized power that the eu super-state would need to operate efficiently and credibly are concerned about the erosion of sovereignty .
others , like the czech republic 's president vaclav klaus , fear the dilution of culture and identity for those countries absorbed into the new whole .
while the opening of the borders between the czech republic and slovakia in december caused some to muse about a romantic return to a single czechoslovakia , klaus warned that such mergers may come with a high price .
" our identity must be cultivated and protected if we do not want , as so many times in the past , to lose our freedom , " he said .
the quest for a united states of europe also spreads a similar concern among the continent 's minorities .
the fight for statehood becomes harder for the likes of the catalans , basques , corsicans , flemings and walloons when the opponent is no longer just a country but the whole of the european union .
quest for autonomy undermines eu unity bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : it 's hard enough to keep all 27 eu nations together in turn , the desire for autonomy grows .
" as their countries lose sovereignty , all such minorities are encouraged to assert their identity through independence and statehood , " said kristine dekeyser , a political scientist and author on belgian politics .
" in the case of european minorities , given the incentive to increase their demands , their destabilizing actions begin to have a much wider effect .
agitating for independence ultimately puts a strain on the eu 's progress towards unity . "
the situation concerning the divided flemings and walloons of belgium , one made more poignant by the fact that they live side-by-side in the country which hosts the european seat of power , has been described by some observers as a microcosm of the problems facing the eu in its quest for unity .
some have gone as far as to say that belgium 's crisis today is the eu 's crisis tomorrow .
" the argument that some use is : how can you possibly create a unified europe if you ca n't even bring a small country like belgium together ? " ' said peter bursens from the political science faculty at the university of antwerp .
" both instances have very similar problems , such as the need for more political integration , more cooperation and more trust . "
belgium and europe share similar challenges bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : affluent flanders resents supporting poorer wallonia the unwillingness to concede , which has been threatening to pull belgium apart , mirrors that which has been dogging the eu since its inception .
both have majority powers which once tolerated the minorities but have since grown tired of supporting and paying for these apparently ungrateful and selfish groups and have advocated at times for a parting of the ways .
both are faced with the challenges of combining centralization and decentralization , identity and solidarity , and creating a forum for very different opinions .
in the belgian political process , the obstacles stopping the two main groups facing those challenges together appear self-made .
rather than uniting , the flemish and walloon parties seem to be drifting further apart .
instead of joining together , free of the constraints of actual borders , minorities in the country are intent on building new barriers to keep them apart .
" in belgium , it is the flemish - and mainly only the regionalists , nationalists and extremists , i must add - who promote this divide , " bursens said .
" they have a strong history of fighting for the right to speak their own language , to have their own policies and governance .
they fear encroachment on that from the walloons in the south .
they are also responsible for opposing european integration initiatives .
they want to protect all they have achieved . "
embracing diversity can heal the rifts bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : premier verhofstadt is charged with making both sides see sense while the belgian process slides dangerously close to a separation , the european process is heading towards integration .
that , observers believe , is a reason for hope for both the stability of belgium and the future of europe .
" people have the wrong idea about europe , that we should all be one , " bursens said .
" that 's not the point .
diversity is what europe is all about ; diversity of identity and culture .
for all its differences , the eu works because the cost of it not working is too great .
the politicians always find a way because there is a will to make it work .
the same will happen with belgium .
it has to . "
political scientist kristine dekeyser added that belgium 's two separate public spheres could make people think that the country could never stand a chance .
" but people have been making belgium function for years , " she said .
" these are not new problems .
europe can learn from this .
to turn that well-used question around : how can europe fail when a country as divisive as belgium can stay together ? " nick amies send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

and that includes not only croatia and bosnia-herzegovina , but also serbia .
germany agrees . speaking during a meeting with top eu officials in the estate of brdo , near the capital ljubljana , slovenian prime minister janez jansa said that his government would assist balkan states joining the eu .
he added that he hoped membership talks would not be slowed down over the coming months .
" we need to find solutions that will stabilize the region in the long term , " jansa told reporters .
slovenia has close ties with the other balkan nations that used to form yugoslavia , including croatia and bosnia-herzogovina .
and dismissing objections from some quarters , slovenian foreign minister dimitrij rupel said serbia should be allowed to sign a stabilization and association agreement -lrb- saa -rrb- - a precursor of accession negotiations proper - with the eu " as soon as possible , possibly by the end of this month . "
several eu member states have argued that serbia should first prove its full cooperation with the international war crimes tribunal in the hague by arresting former general ratko mladic and other fugitives wanted for alleged crimes against humanity during the 1990s balkan wars .
but speaking after a meeting with his finnish counterpart in berlin on tuesday , german foreign minister frank-walter steinmeier also said that an saa could be signed with serbia as early as the end of january .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de history -pipe- 08.01.2008 not all palestinians were pro-nazi , says german historian großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : was germany 's defeat in northern africa all that prevented " german-arab mass crime " ?
historians have typically characterized palestinians collectively as hitler-supporters during the nazi regime .
but a german researcher has said that they were more concerned with relations with an other european country . any historical conversation in germany over palestine and national socialism usually turns to one name : grand mufti hajj amin al husseini .
the muslim leader was an anti-semite , a passionate follower of the nazis and moved to germany in 1941 to collaborate with hitler 's regime . however , in a recently published study , berlin-based historian rene wildangel has claimed husseini " was simply not representative " of his countrymen during that time . contrary to current studies " it 's not a question of whether he was an anti-semite or a collaborator - that 's relatively clear , " said wildangel .
" we have to consider the things that were happening in palestine and not just this one person . " much of the research conducted on relations between arab nations and the nazi regime , including a 2006 book by klaus-michael mallmann and martin cüppers titled " the crescent and the swastika : the third reich , the arabs , and palestine " -lrb- halbmond und hakenkreuz .
das dritte reich , die araber und palästina -rrb- , has reached the conclusion that only germany 's defeat in northern africa prevented " german-arab mass crime " against jews .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : wildangel 's book reached a different conclusion than most other research most of the historical research on the topic is based on german , british and israeli sources and neglects the palestinian perspective , which is why it has been taken for granted that the palestinians took the same pro-hitler stance as their leader , said wildangel . by examining how nazi germany was portrayed in palestinian newspapers and publications in the 1930s and 1940s , wildangel found a fascination about adolf hitler among palestinians . nazis were enemy of the enemy but the nazis ' positive reception had less to do with a general anti-semitic sentiment , concluded wildangel , and more to do with opposition to british colonial rule , which would last until 1948 .
nazi germany was , after all , britain 's enemy in the war . the palestinians who read newspapers were presented with arguments for and against nazi germany and well informed about the true aims of the nazi regime - and also that hitler 's racism extended well beyond the jews . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : not everyone thought like the grand mufti " they , in part , embraced anti-semitism and racism , but did not share the in eliminatory character of the nazi regime , " wildangel said of arab nationalists , adding that husayni 's ideological and political views frequently met with explicit opposition in the palestinian population . the tendency to represent palestinians as collective adherents of the nazis primarily has to do with the ongoing israeli-palestinian conflict that heated up after 1945 , said wildangel . history as a political weapon " the more intense the hate becomes in the middle east conflict , the more likely people are to convey this view of history , " he said .
" the israeli authors make reference to the mufti and the arabs refuse to deal with anti-semitism and the holocaust at all . " wildangel said he believes that shifting the blame and not dealing with the other side 's past only intensify the crisis .

historians have typically characterized palestinians collectively as hitler-supporters during the nazi regime .
but a german researcher has said that they were more concerned with relations with an other european country . any historical conversation in germany over palestine and national socialism usually turns to one name : grand mufti hajj amin al husseini .
the muslim leader was an anti-semite , a passionate follower of the nazis and moved to germany in 1941 to collaborate with hitler 's regime . however , in a recently published study , berlin-based historian rene wildangel has claimed husseini " was simply not representative " of his countrymen during that time . contrary to current studies " it 's not a question of whether he was an anti-semite or a collaborator - that 's relatively clear , " said wildangel .
" we have to consider the things that were happening in palestine and not just this one person . " much of the research conducted on relations between arab nations and the nazi regime , including a 2006 book by klaus-michael mallmann and martin cüppers titled " the crescent and the swastika : the third reich , the arabs , and palestine " -lrb- halbmond und hakenkreuz .
das dritte reich , die araber und palästina -rrb- , has reached the conclusion that only germany 's defeat in northern africa prevented " german-arab mass crime " against jews .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : wildangel 's book reached a different conclusion than most other research most of the historical research on the topic is based on german , british and israeli sources and neglects the palestinian perspective , which is why it has been taken for granted that the palestinians took the same pro-hitler stance as their leader , said wildangel . by examining how nazi germany was portrayed in palestinian newspapers and publications in the 1930s and 1940s , wildangel found a fascination about adolf hitler among palestinians . nazis were enemy of the enemy but the nazis ' positive reception had less to do with a general anti-semitic sentiment , concluded wildangel , and more to do with opposition to british colonial rule , which would last until 1948 .
nazi germany was , after all , britain 's enemy in the war . the palestinians who read newspapers were presented with arguments for and against nazi germany and well informed about the true aims of the nazi regime - and also that hitler 's racism extended well beyond the jews . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : not everyone thought like the grand mufti " they , in part , embraced anti-semitism and racism , but did not share the in eliminatory character of the nazi regime , " wildangel said of arab nationalists , adding that husayni 's ideological and political views frequently met with explicit opposition in the palestinian population . the tendency to represent palestinians as collective adherents of the nazis primarily has to do with the ongoing israeli-palestinian conflict that heated up after 1945 , said wildangel . history as a political weapon " the more intense the hate becomes in the middle east conflict , the more likely people are to convey this view of history , " he said .
" the israeli authors make reference to the mufti and the arabs refuse to deal with anti-semitism and the holocaust at all . " wildangel said he believes that shifting the blame and not dealing with the other side 's past only intensify the crisis .

what goes around comes around .
with germany enacting more and more anti-smoking legislation , one entrepreneur decided he was fed up and fired three non-smokers for not lighting up . for german smokers these are trying times .
not only are they now prohibited from indulging their habit in the bars where they used to spend their evenings cuddling amidst the silver-blue haze .
they are also subjected to a constant barrage of crowing from self-righteous non-smokers .
but one small businessman , thomas j. , from the northern german town of büsum , is fighting the power .
the head of a 10-person internet-based computer-supply company has just gotten rid of three non-smoking employees .
" our non-smoking employees were of the opinion they had a right to smoke-free areas , " thomas j. told the daily hamburger morgenpost newspaper .
" my answer was to immediately hand them their walking papers .
smokers make for more even-headed , better employees at our company . "
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : water pipes are also an option for those concerned about their jobs part of the problem was that the trio of non-smokers did n't want to sit near their puffing peers at after-work social activities .
if you want a job with thomas j. , you 'd better get work on a 40-a-day habit .
" everyone 's always beating up on smokers , but now the shoe 's on the other foot , " thomas j. said .
" in any case , i 'm only hiring smokers in future . "
but thomas j. , who did n't want to give his full name to the press , may have drawn up his smoker-friendly workplace policy without considering the legal implications .
" if employees make use a right like health protection , they are n't allowed to be fired , " labor law expert malte masloff told the hamburger morgenpost .
" and unlike other laws concerning firings in small businesses , this rule also applies to firms with 10 workers or less . "
so thomas j. may have to put up with irritating non-smokers after all . dw staff -lrb- jc -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

what goes around comes around .
with germany enacting more and more anti-smoking legislation , one entrepreneur decided he was fed up and fired three non-smokers for not lighting up . for german smokers these are trying times .
not only are they now prohibited from indulging their habit in the bars where they used to spend their evenings cuddling amidst the silver-blue haze .
they are also subjected to a constant barrage of crowing from self-righteous non-smokers .
but one small businessman , thomas j. , from the northern german town of büsum , is fighting the power .
the head of a 10-person internet-based computer-supply company has just gotten rid of three non-smoking employees .
" our non-smoking employees were of the opinion they had a right to smoke-free areas , " thomas j. told the daily hamburger morgenpost newspaper .
" my answer was to immediately hand them their walking papers .
smokers make for more even-headed , better employees at our company . "
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : water pipes are also an option for those concerned about their jobs part of the problem was that the trio of non-smokers did n't want to sit near their puffing peers at after-work social activities .
if you want a job with thomas j. , you 'd better get work on a 40-a-day habit .
" everyone 's always beating up on smokers , but now the shoe 's on the other foot , " thomas j. said .
" in any case , i 'm only hiring smokers in future . "

" if employees make use a right like health protection , they are n't allowed to be fired , " labor law expert malte masloff told the hamburger morgenpost .
" and unlike other laws concerning firings in small businesses , this rule also applies to firms with 10 workers or less . "

that included not entering the bear 's den until at least six weeks after the birth since it could otherwise disturb the animals ' natural behavior - a policy prescribed by the european animal conservation and breeding program . a zoo spokesman on tuesday agreed , saying the keepers had acted " absolutely correctly " under the guidelines . but late tuesday afternoon , the zoo announced it would err on the side of caution , remove vera 's baby , and bottle-feed it like knut .

what goes around comes around .
with germany enacting more and more anti-smoking legislation , one entrepreneur decided he was fed up and fired three non-smokers for not lighting up . for german smokers these are trying times .
not only are they now prohibited from indulging their habit in the bars where they used to spend their evenings cuddling amidst the silver-blue haze .
they are also subjected to a constant barrage of crowing from self-righteous non-smokers .
but one small businessman , thomas j. , from the northern german town of büsum , is fighting the power .
the head of a 10-person internet-based computer-supply company has just gotten rid of three non-smoking employees .
" our non-smoking employees were of the opinion they had a right to smoke-free areas , " thomas j. told the daily hamburger morgenpost newspaper .
" my answer was to immediately hand them their walking papers .
smokers make for more even-headed , better employees at our company . "
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : water pipes are also an option for those concerned about their jobs part of the problem was that the trio of non-smokers did n't want to sit near their puffing peers at after-work social activities .
if you want a job with thomas j. , you 'd better get work on a 40-a-day habit .
" everyone 's always beating up on smokers , but now the shoe 's on the other foot , " thomas j. said .
" in any case , i 'm only hiring smokers in future . "
but thomas j. , who did n't want to give his full name to the press , may have drawn up his smoker-friendly workplace policy without considering the legal implications .
" if employees make use a right like health protection , they are n't allowed to be fired , " labor law expert malte masloff told the hamburger morgenpost .
" and unlike other laws concerning firings in small businesses , this rule also applies to firms with 10 workers or less . "
so thomas j. may have to put up with irritating non-smokers after all . dw staff -lrb- jc -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

after being booted from soccer , the ref may end up in the poorhouse . the case , which gets underway in berlin on wednesday , jan .
9 , sees the dfb trying to recover 1.8 million euros -lrb- $ 2.2 million -rrb- in damages from hoyzer .
the lion 's share of that sum reflects compensation worth 2 million euros paid by the dfb to first-division club hamburg in compensation for their unfairly losing a 2004 german cup match hoyzer officiated .
hoyzer later admitted to using his refereeing decisions to alter the course of that and one other cup match and around nine lower-division games .
he was sentenced to nearly two and a half years in prison for helping to commit fraud in november 2005 .
the match-fixing scandal , which was spearheaded by a croatian betting mafia in berlin , was the worst such incident in german soccer in 30 years and dented the credibility of the sport .
not about the money bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : hoyzer has already lost a criminal case - now he 's on trial in civil court even if the lawsuit is successful , it 's highly unlikely that the dfb will be able to recoup the full amount from hoyzer , who 's currently still serving out his sentence .
" it 's not about whether we can get the money or not , " dfb president theo zwanziger said when the suit was filed two years ago .
" but it would be irresponsible not to try because the dfb has suffered a huge image and financial loss from mr. hoyzer . "
it is unclear how long the lawsuit might take , but the berlin court could render a verdict fairly quickly .
" it could be that we agree on further hearing dates on wednesday , " the court said in a statement .
" but it 's also possible that a decision or the date for a decision will be announced . "
hoyzer is not required to be in attendance at the trial and will likely be represented by his attorneys .

will it become the new knut ? shunned by his mother , polar bear knut was saved from demise by care-taker thomas dörflein at the berlin zoo .
two polar bear babies at the nuremberg zoo were n't so lucky . when one zookeeper in nuremberg checked the cage of mama bear vilma on monday , he found no sign of the little ones .
dag encke , director of the zoo , said monday : " we presume she 's eaten them . " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : knut won hearts around the world the cubs may have been ill or dead already when vilma devoured them . " predators are known to eat their offspring when there 's something wrong , or when the mother knows she can not raise them properly , " encke told ap news agency . mixed bear signals the zoo apparently became aware of a change when keepers stopped hearing the howls of the cubs over the weekend , but they believed that meant vilma was taking care of her offspring well . but on monday , when she came out of her cave alone and paced the cage nervously , one keeper became alarmed and searched the stall . the german association for the protection of animals said the nuremberg zoo should have acted sooner . " we are against keeping and breeding polar bears in zoos , " the association 's head thomas schröder said , adding however , that a zoo has a responsibility once it takes on the task .
" that means : every animal has a right to life . " knut forged the path knut certainly can attest to that .
rejected by his mother as a baby , his keeper dörflein bottle-fed him in berlin .
since then , once-cute , now-killer knut has been living the high life of stardom , including a knock-out number of zoo visitors , television appearances and even book deals . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : other mama bear vera may have turned mean - or merciful , depending on your view animal protectionists have said the zoo had better keep a close eye on how a second bear named vera , who gave birth to a cub in december , handles her cub . zoo director encke on monday , though , was n't worried : " we going to stick to our policy , also with vera . "
that included not entering the bear 's den until at least six weeks after the birth since it could otherwise disturb the animals ' natural behavior - a policy prescribed by the european animal conservation and breeding program . a zoo spokesman on tuesday agreed , saying the keepers had acted " absolutely correctly " under the guidelines . but late tuesday afternoon , the zoo announced it would err on the side of caution , remove vera 's baby , and bottle-feed it like knut .
the zoo made the decision after observing how vera had brought out the cub from the den and tried to hide it in shrubbery . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : having just turned a year old , knut is n't so cute anymore nuremberg zoo 's deputy director helmut mägdefrau told ap news agency : " she 's completely nervous . "
vera was apparently disturbed by a camera team that had approached the den without permission . vera junior has since been separated from its mother , and appears to be in tip-top condition .

speaking at the consumer electronics show , paul otellini predicted mobile devices could soon " augment reality " by pulling data from the net in real time .
he said the industry was on the verge of creating a " new level of capability and usefulness to the internet " .
" it 's an internet that is proactive , predictive and context-aware . "
explaining that devices would be location-aware , and would access the internet over wimax wireless connections , he said : " instead of going to the internet , the internet comes to us .
" we need a ubiquitous , wireless broadband infrastructure .
eventually we will blanket the globe in wireless broadband connectivity . "
intel is backing wimax , one of a number of competing next-generation wireless technologies , such as long term evolution and hsdpa .
mr otellini said for this vision of the future to be fulfilled it would " require exponentially more powerful processors , using less and less power " .
chip development he said that breakthroughs in chip development were needed to solve the problem of faster chips requiring more power and becoming less efficient .
the intel chief executive said the firm had a roadmap for five more generations of chips , over the next 10 years .
" i have no doubt we will make all the breakthroughs necessary to make the five generations happen . "
he told bbc news : " intel , as a leader , has to advance the silicon technology every generation .
" our business model is one of very high risk : we dig a very big hole in the ground , spend three billion dollars to build a factory in it , which takes three years , to produce technology we have n't invented yet , to run products we have n't designed yet , for markets which do n't exist .
" we do that two or three times a year . "
he added : " everything we do has an inherent belief in technology . "
' no compromises ' at the show intel unveiled a range of new processors , including chips designed for so-called " mobile internet devices " .
the first machines to use the new chips , which are 25 % smaller than previous generations , are expected to hit the market later this year .
eventually we will blanket the globe in wireless broadband connectivity paul otellini " a mobile internet device is something that you carry around in your pocket , and can deliver the full internet , with no compromises , " he said .

one of the first devices to use the new menlo chips is a toshiba ultra mobile portable computer , which is capable of running microsoft 's processor-hungry vista operating system .
mr otellini said the obstacles were not just processing power , but also increased wireless access , an internet which can understand context and simpler computer interfaces , such as gesturing and visualisation .

speaking at the consumer electronics show , paul otellini predicted mobile devices could soon " augment reality " by pulling data from the net in real time .
he said the industry was on the verge of creating a " new level of capability and usefulness to the internet " .
" it 's an internet that is proactive , predictive and context-aware . "
explaining that devices would be location-aware , and would access the internet over wimax wireless connections , he said : " instead of going to the internet , the internet comes to us .
" we need a ubiquitous , wireless broadband infrastructure .
eventually we will blanket the globe in wireless broadband connectivity . "
intel is backing wimax , one of a number of competing next-generation wireless technologies , such as long term evolution and hsdpa .
mr otellini said for this vision of the future to be fulfilled it would " require exponentially more powerful processors , using less and less power " .
chip development he said that breakthroughs in chip development were needed to solve the problem of faster chips requiring more power and becoming less efficient .
the intel chief executive said the firm had a roadmap for five more generations of chips , over the next 10 years .
" i have no doubt we will make all the breakthroughs necessary to make the five generations happen . "
he told bbc news : " intel , as a leader , has to advance the silicon technology every generation .
" our business model is one of very high risk : we dig a very big hole in the ground , spend three billion dollars to build a factory in it , which takes three years , to produce technology we have n't invented yet , to run products we have n't designed yet , for markets which do n't exist .
" we do that two or three times a year . "
he added : " everything we do has an inherent belief in technology . "
' no compromises ' at the show intel unveiled a range of new processors , including chips designed for so-called " mobile internet devices " .
the first machines to use the new chips , which are 25 % smaller than previous generations , are expected to hit the market later this year .
eventually we will blanket the globe in wireless broadband connectivity paul otellini " a mobile internet device is something that you carry around in your pocket , and can deliver the full internet , with no compromises , " he said .
the first devices will be larger than a typical mobile phone but are expected to shrink in size by a factor of four within two years .
one of the first devices to use the new menlo chips is a toshiba ultra mobile portable computer , which is capable of running microsoft 's processor-hungry vista operating system .
mr otellini said the obstacles were not just processing power , but also increased wireless access , an internet which can understand context and simpler computer interfaces , such as gesturing and visualisation .

speaking at the consumer electronics show , paul otellini predicted mobile devices could soon " augment reality " by pulling data from the net in real time .
he said the industry was on the verge of creating a " new level of capability and usefulness to the internet " .
" it 's an internet that is proactive , predictive and context-aware . "
explaining that devices would be location-aware , and would access the internet over wimax wireless connections , he said : " instead of going to the internet , the internet comes to us .
" we need a ubiquitous , wireless broadband infrastructure .
eventually we will blanket the globe in wireless broadband connectivity . "
intel is backing wimax , one of a number of competing next-generation wireless technologies , such as long term evolution and hsdpa .
mr otellini said for this vision of the future to be fulfilled it would " require exponentially more powerful processors , using less and less power " .
chip development he said that breakthroughs in chip development were needed to solve the problem of faster chips requiring more power and becoming less efficient .
the intel chief executive said the firm had a roadmap for five more generations of chips , over the next 10 years .
" i have no doubt we will make all the breakthroughs necessary to make the five generations happen . "
he told bbc news : " intel , as a leader , has to advance the silicon technology every generation .
" our business model is one of very high risk : we dig a very big hole in the ground , spend three billion dollars to build a factory in it , which takes three years , to produce technology we have n't invented yet , to run products we have n't designed yet , for markets which do n't exist .
" we do that two or three times a year . "
he added : " everything we do has an inherent belief in technology . "
' no compromises ' at the show intel unveiled a range of new processors , including chips designed for so-called " mobile internet devices " .
the first machines to use the new chips , which are 25 % smaller than previous generations , are expected to hit the market later this year .
eventually we will blanket the globe in wireless broadband connectivity paul otellini " a mobile internet device is something that you carry around in your pocket , and can deliver the full internet , with no compromises , " he said .
the first devices will be larger than a typical mobile phone but are expected to shrink in size by a factor of four within two years .
one of the first devices to use the new menlo chips is a toshiba ultra mobile portable computer , which is capable of running microsoft 's processor-hungry vista operating system .
mr otellini said the obstacles were not just processing power , but also increased wireless access , an internet which can understand context and simpler computer interfaces , such as gesturing and visualisation .

the 86-year-old was rushed to hospital in the capital , jakarta , last week in critical condition .
doctors say he is suffering from anaemia and low blood pressure caused by heart and kidney problems .
suharto took power in 1966 and ruled indonesia with an iron fist for a total of 32 years .
he and his family deny reports that they stole billions of dollars while he was in power .
intensive care suharto was taken to hospital on 4 january and given dialysis for kidney problems , which led to some improvement .

" he is worse than yesterday ... he will need to remain in intensive care so he can be closely monitored , " he said .
" more fluid infiltrated his lungs and some blood was seen in his faeces and urine that prompted his haemoglobin to drop , " he said .
doctors have said that he needs a second pacemaker operation but that he is not well enough to undergo the surgery .
suharto has lived quietly in jakarta since being overthrown in 1998 amid political upheaval triggered by the asian financial crisis .
but although accused of embezzling huge sums from state funds during his three decades in power , his lawyers have always successfully pleaded that his failing health meant he should not stand trial .
suharto has been in and out of hospital in recent years with a series of health problems , including a stroke .

the 86-year-old was rushed to hospital in the capital , jakarta , last week in critical condition .
doctors say he is suffering from anaemia and low blood pressure caused by heart and kidney problems .
suharto took power in 1966 and ruled indonesia with an iron fist for a total of 32 years .
he and his family deny reports that they stole billions of dollars while he was in power .
intensive care suharto was taken to hospital on 4 january and given dialysis for kidney problems , which led to some improvement .
rise and fall of suharto born in java , june 1921 comes to power in 1965 after alleged communist coup attempt formally replaces sukarno as president in march 1967 modernisation programmes in the 70s and 80s raise living standards east timor invaded in late 1975 asian economic crisis of the 1990s hits indonesian economy spiralling prices and discontent force him to resign in may 1998 judges rule he is unfit to stand trial for corruption in 2000 transparency international says he tops the world all-time corruption table in march 2004 life in pictures but mardjo soebiandono , head of the medical team treating the former leader , said he had deteriorated again .
" he is worse than yesterday ... he will need to remain in intensive care so he can be closely monitored , " he said .
" more fluid infiltrated his lungs and some blood was seen in his faeces and urine that prompted his haemoglobin to drop , " he said .
doctors have said that he needs a second pacemaker operation but that he is not well enough to undergo the surgery .
suharto has lived quietly in jakarta since being overthrown in 1998 amid political upheaval triggered by the asian financial crisis .
but although accused of embezzling huge sums from state funds during his three decades in power , his lawyers have always successfully pleaded that his failing health meant he should not stand trial .
suharto has been in and out of hospital in recent years with a series of health problems , including a stroke .

the two rival camps have divided consumers since the two incompatible systems were launched .
but blu-ray supporters are touting the decision by warner bros to shift allegiance as a tipping point .
andy parsons , of the blu-ray disc association , said : " it 's much clearer to consumers now which of the formats is going to prevail . "
speaking at the consumer electronics show , in las vegas , he added : " we still have a little bit more work to do before we can say the format war is over . "
howard stringer , chief executive of sony , the creators of blu-ray , was also unwilling to declare outright victory .
" i never put up banners that say ' mission accomplished ' , " he said .
in north america , films on blu-ray disc are outselling those on hd dvd by more than two to one .
hd dvd , which is backed by microsoft and toshiba , now has support from only universal and paramount among the big film studios .
no-one from the hd dvd promotion group was available for comment after the organisation cancelled all press interviews at the show .
" nobody likes a format war - it 's not fun , it 's very time consuming and it confuses consumers , " said mr parsons .
the battle between hd dvd and blu-ray has echoes of the rivalry between betamax and vhs in the 1980s .
the cheaper format , vhs , prevailed while 20 years on it seems as though blu-ray , the more expensive system , is winning the race .
david bishop , president of sony pictures entertainment , said the warners ' decision was " a great message for consumers " .
mr bishop said the blu-ray camp would welcome any move by universal and paramount to shift formats .
" we 'd love to have them over and hopefully they will in the short term so we can act as a single industry . "
sony has been talking to retailers about the possibility of helping hd dvd owners who now wanted to move to blu-ray .
" we have n't had any meaningful dialogue as yet .
but it is something we have considered . "
kevin tsujihara , president of warner bros home entertainment group , said the decision to back blu-ray exclusively had been driven by consumers .
he said sales of the studio 's movies on blu-ray were outselling the same title on hd dvd by three to one .
he said that a disc unveiled by warner last year at ces which could hold both formats had been dropped because none of the other studios would support it .
" as a result retailers would not stock it , " he said .

speaking at the consumer electronics show , in las vegas , he added : " we still have a little bit more work to do before we can say the format war is over . "
howard stringer , chief executive of sony , the creators of blu-ray , was also unwilling to declare outright victory .
" i never put up banners that say ' mission accomplished ' , " he said .

no-one from the hd dvd promotion group was available for comment after the organisation cancelled all press interviews at the show .
" nobody likes a format war - it 's not fun , it 's very time consuming and it confuses consumers , " said mr parsons .
the battle between hd dvd and blu-ray has echoes of the rivalry between betamax and vhs in the 1980s .
the cheaper format , vhs , prevailed while 20 years on it seems as though blu-ray , the more expensive system , is winning the race .
david bishop , president of sony pictures entertainment , said the warners ' decision was " a great message for consumers " .
mr bishop said the blu-ray camp would welcome any move by universal and paramount to shift formats .
" we 'd love to have them over and hopefully they will in the short term so we can act as a single industry . "

" we have n't had any meaningful dialogue as yet .
but it is something we have considered . "
kevin tsujihara , president of warner bros home entertainment group , said the decision to back blu-ray exclusively had been driven by consumers .
he said sales of the studio 's movies on blu-ray were outselling the same title on hd dvd by three to one .
he said that a disc unveiled by warner last year at ces which could hold both formats had been dropped because none of the other studios would support it .
" as a result retailers would not stock it , " he said .

pojaman shinawatra was arrested on arrival , but released on bail after appearing at the supreme court .
with her husband , she faces two sets of charges related to alleged violation of stock-trading laws and a land sale .
her return comes as the people power party , which backs mr thaksin , works to form a government after winning the most seats in last month 's election .
in the first polls since the military coup of september 2006 , the ppp fell short of an outright majority and is seeking to form a coalition with smaller parties .
but 65 of its winning candidates now face investigation over possible voting fraud , prompting party leader samak sundaravej to accuse coup leaders of sabotaging his efforts to form a government .
court appearance mr thaksin , a telecommunications billionaire , and his wife have been living outside thailand since the military seized power , accusing him of corruption and abuse of power .
mr thaksin has said he will return once a government is in place last year , thai courts issued arrest warrants for the couple in connection with two financial cases .
one relates to the purchase of a plot of land in central bangkok , the second to an alleged attempt to conceal assets , violating the stock-trading law .
the couple deny any wrongdoing and say the charges against them are politically motivated .
in a statement on monday issued via her lawyer , pojaman said that she was " willing to fight the case in court in accordance with the judicial system " .
arriving in bangkok , she was handed an arrest warrant by waiting police , who took her straight to the supreme court for a hearing related to the real estate deal .
there she was released on bail of 5m baht -lrb- $ 149,000 , £ 75,600 -rrb- and ordered not to leave the country .
pojaman shinawatra has always been seen as her husband 's closest political and business partner , and some analysts see her return as an attempt to prepare the way for mr thaksin 's eventual homecoming .
mr thaksin remains overseas , but says he plans to return to thailand by april , once a new government is in power .
the new parliament is due to convene on 22 january , but as yet no government has been formed .

the harvard medical school team said the risk was particularly high for those who also had high blood pressure .
writing in the journal circulation , they said correcting vitamin d deficiency could be beneficial .
a british heart foundation spokeswoman said more information was needed on how the vitamin affected heart health .
blood pressure link vitamin d is mainly obtained from exposure to the sun , as well as from certain foods such as oily fish and eggs .
there are concerns that many people , including the elderly , pregnant women and those who wear all-concealing clothing do not get enough of the vitamin .
a lack of the nutrient , already known to cause weakened bones , has also been linked to multiple sclerosis and rheumatoid arthritis .
vitamins are easy to administer and in general have few toxic effects dr thomas wang , harvard medical school the us study , which began in 1996 , looked at over 1,700 people with an average age of 59 .
their vitamin d levels were tested and they were then monitored for up to seven years .
those with low levels of vitamin d in their blood , below 15 nanograms per millilitre -lrb- ng / ml -rrb- , had twice the risk of a heart attack , heart failure or a stroke compared to those with higher levels -lrb- above 15ng / ml -rrb- .
the highest incidence of cardiovascular disease was seen in those with high blood pressure and low vitamin d levels .
overall , 28 % of individuals had levels of vitamin d below 15 ng / ml .
only 10 % had levels above 30 ng / ml - considered ideal for bone health .
the researchers say that because receptors for vitamin d are found in heart muscle and blood vessel lining , low levels could be a contributing factor in heart disease .
uncertainty but dr thomas wang , who led the research , added : " what has n't been proven yet is that vitamin d deficiency actually causes increased risk of cardiovascular disease .
" this would require a large randomised trial to show whether correcting the vitamin d deficiency would result in a reduction in cardiovascular risk . "
other studies looking at using different vitamins to benefit heart health have not shown positive results .
but dr wang said : " just because other vitamins have n't succeeded does n't preclude the possibility of finding vitamins that might prevent cardiovascular disease .
" vitamins are easy to administer and in general have few toxic effects . "
june davison , cardiac nurse at the british heart foundation said : " this study suggests an association with vitamin d deficiency and an increased risk of heart and circulatory disease .
" however , the reasons as to why this happens are uncertain and further research is needed to understand the mechanisms behind this . "

the harvard medical school team said the risk was particularly high for those who also had high blood pressure .
writing in the journal circulation , they said correcting vitamin d deficiency could be beneficial .
a british heart foundation spokeswoman said more information was needed on how the vitamin affected heart health .
blood pressure link vitamin d is mainly obtained from exposure to the sun , as well as from certain foods such as oily fish and eggs .
there are concerns that many people , including the elderly , pregnant women and those who wear all-concealing clothing do not get enough of the vitamin .
a lack of the nutrient , already known to cause weakened bones , has also been linked to multiple sclerosis and rheumatoid arthritis .
vitamins are easy to administer and in general have few toxic effects dr thomas wang , harvard medical school the us study , which began in 1996 , looked at over 1,700 people with an average age of 59 .
their vitamin d levels were tested and they were then monitored for up to seven years .
those with low levels of vitamin d in their blood , below 15 nanograms per millilitre -lrb- ng / ml -rrb- , had twice the risk of a heart attack , heart failure or a stroke compared to those with higher levels -lrb- above 15ng / ml -rrb- .
the highest incidence of cardiovascular disease was seen in those with high blood pressure and low vitamin d levels .
overall , 28 % of individuals had levels of vitamin d below 15 ng / ml .
only 10 % had levels above 30 ng / ml - considered ideal for bone health .
the researchers say that because receptors for vitamin d are found in heart muscle and blood vessel lining , low levels could be a contributing factor in heart disease .
uncertainty but dr thomas wang , who led the research , added : " what has n't been proven yet is that vitamin d deficiency actually causes increased risk of cardiovascular disease .
" this would require a large randomised trial to show whether correcting the vitamin d deficiency would result in a reduction in cardiovascular risk . "
other studies looking at using different vitamins to benefit heart health have not shown positive results .
but dr wang said : " just because other vitamins have n't succeeded does n't preclude the possibility of finding vitamins that might prevent cardiovascular disease .
" vitamins are easy to administer and in general have few toxic effects . "
june davison , cardiac nurse at the british heart foundation said : " this study suggests an association with vitamin d deficiency and an increased risk of heart and circulatory disease .
" however , the reasons as to why this happens are uncertain and further research is needed to understand the mechanisms behind this . "

the uk brewer 's comments came as it submitted a claim to an arbitration tribunal , which will decide if s & n can acquire carlsberg 's 50 % stake in bbh .
s & n is currently fighting a takeover approach from heineken and carlsberg .
s & n says carlsberg 's involvement in the bid move breaches the joint deal on bbh and allows it to buy carlsberg out .
carlsberg has previously said that s & n 's claims on bbh had " no merit " .
bitter battle the heineken-carlsberg consortium has made a 750p-a-share approach for s & n , an offer that the uk brewer has rejected as " wholly inadequate " .
the uk 's takeover panel has issued a deadline of 21 january for the heineken-carlsberg group to make a formal bid .
if the consortium is successful in its bid for s & n , carlsberg plans to take full control of bbh .
however , s & n is taking carlsberg to court in sweden , arguing that by taking part in the bid approach it has triggered a clause in the bbh agreement that allows the wronged party to buy out the other firm 's shares in bbh at a fair market price .
in its submission to the court , s & n also said that taking full control of bbh would allow it to enjoy cost and revenue benefits of £ 100m a year .
a decision on the issue is due by 3 july .

the role of the undecided voter has rarely , if ever , seemed so important .
and as the new hampshire primary gets under way , those voters will have the power to make or break campaigns .
among the most prized are the independents , who make up as many as four in 10 of total voters and can choose to vote in either the democratic or republican race .
a majority of them are expected to opt for the former .
desperate to woo them , the presidential candidates for both parties criss-crossed the state on the last full day of campaigning , racking up almost 50 events between them .
and the new hampshire voters , aware of their important status as first in the us to hold their presidential primary election , turned out in their droves to hear them .
jane and joe edmonds were among several dozen people to wait in a slush-covered square in keene to hear john mccain , who is enjoying a late lead in the republican polls .
" we 're here because we are undecided , " said mr edmonds , an airline pilot , 38 .
" i 'm leaning towards mccain and rudy giuliani - i go back and forth a bit . "
standing near them , marci cooke , from westmoreland , had been at a barack obama rally on sunday night but wanted to see senator mccain too before making up her mind .
" i 'm always interested to hear what everyone has to say because i 'm from new hampshire , " she said .
" i 'm probably going to vote for obama but i 'm not quite sure . "
show of emotion senator obama , riding a wave of momentum from his win in the iowa caucuses last week , has packed out school gyms and auditoriums in new hampshire .
emotion surfaced as mrs clinton campaigned his supporters have planted many of the banners that dot the banks of snow beside the state 's tree-lined roads and cluster at every road junction .
the latest polls gave him a several-point lead over rival hillary clinton , who slipped back after leading in the state for months .
she sought to fight back in the four days since her disappointment in iowa with a feisty debate appearance at the weekend and a string of well-attended events of her own .
but the moment likely to dominate headlines from the final day of campaigning was a rare show of emotion from the former first lady .
asked by a woman at a breakfast meeting in a portsmouth cafe how she kept going each day , mrs clinton 's voice faltered and her eyes appeared to well up .
" i just do n't want to see us fall backward as a nation , " she replied .
" i mean , this is very personal for me .
not just political .
i see what 's happening .
we have to reverse it . "
a few hours later , and it was time for laughter at a rally at salem high school , where two young male hecklers were ejected after repeatedly shouting : " iron my shirt ! "
" oh , the remnants of sexism , alive and well , " responded mrs clinton , adding that it demonstrated her mission to break through " the highest and hardest glass ceiling " .
outsider " change " has become the word of the moment , with many of the candidates tweaking their campaign speeches to pick up on the mood from iowa 's caucuses .
but it remains unclear whose brand of change will prove the most popular .
mr obama , who if elected would become the first black american president , has campaigned on a platform of " change we can believe in " and extolled the power of hope .
this is a pretty historic time and this is when new hampshire gets to shine chris gagnon john edwards supporter republican mitt romney , who came second in iowa to former arkansas governor mike huckabee , has presented himself in new hampshire as someone who can bring change as a washington outsider .
meanwhile , mrs clinton has spoken of offering change with experience .
john edwards , who pipped her to second place in iowa , embarked on his second 36-hour non-stop campaign stint in as many weeks with a promise that he would bring change by taking on special interest groups in washington .
mr mccain , who beat george w bush in the new hampshire primary back in 2000 , in turn said he would " bring about change " as he pledged " to do the hard things " if elected .
he made seven campaign stops on monday , in a state where he has held more than 100 town hall meetings and has revived a campaign which stumbled badly in the summer .
doubts rival mr huckabee , whose win in iowa has been attributed largely to his appeal to a christian evangelical base , has rejigged his message to focus on a more populist line in new hampshire .
he appeared with celebrity sidekick chuck norris in the state capital , concord , to sample a lunchtime " huckaburger " , having attracted big crowds to a pancake breakfast earlier .
mike huckabee is hoping to capitalise on his iowa success former new york mayor rudy giuliani , whose campaign strategy involves focusing on later primaries in large states like florida , also made a swing through new hampshire .
while considered strong on national issues , his support for abortion rights and his three marriages still trouble many social conservatives .
among them is christine mckinley , from nashua , who said she was attracted to both mr giuliani and mr romney because of their business backgrounds - but had some doubts .
" some time between now and tomorrow i will be making a decision , " she said .
" one thing that concerns me is that there is not as strong a background of family ideals for giuliani .
i have no concerns that mitt romney would embarrass us in the white house . "
' retail politics the candidates , who also include democrats bill richardson and dennis kucinich and republican ron paul , will continue to make last-minute appeals as voters go to the polls .
people in the tiny hamlet of dixville notch have already decided meanwhile , their campaign teams and volunteers will be focused on a get-out-the-vote operation that is the culmination of months of door-knocking , phone calls and hard graft .
they will be all too aware that the undecided voters may change their minds about who to support even as they enter the polling booths .
after all , in new hampshire , where " retail politics " - as the candidates ' face-to-face connection with the voters is known - is all important , loyalties can swiftly change .
three weeks ago , 32-year-old chris gagnon from manchester thought he would back mr obama - but having been impressed when he heard mr edwards speak , he volunteered for his campaign instead .
" this is a pretty historic time and this is when new hampshire gets to shine , " he said , explaining his and others ' willingness to give up their free time .
" we are at the centre of the world for a little bit - it 's unique for a small state .
a lot of people in new hampshire are proud and we would never want to lose this first primary . "
whether the state lives up to its reputation of picking the eventual winners of the party nominations - and the election - remains to be seen .
but there 's no doubting its commitment to the process of democracy .

the role of the undecided voter has rarely , if ever , seemed so important .
and as the new hampshire primary gets under way , those voters will have the power to make or break campaigns .
among the most prized are the independents , who make up as many as four in 10 of total voters and can choose to vote in either the democratic or republican race .
a majority of them are expected to opt for the former .
desperate to woo them , the presidential candidates for both parties criss-crossed the state on the last full day of campaigning , racking up almost 50 events between them .
and the new hampshire voters , aware of their important status as first in the us to hold their presidential primary election , turned out in their droves to hear them .
jane and joe edmonds were among several dozen people to wait in a slush-covered square in keene to hear john mccain , who is enjoying a late lead in the republican polls .
" we 're here because we are undecided , " said mr edmonds , an airline pilot , 38 .
" i 'm leaning towards mccain and rudy giuliani - i go back and forth a bit . "
standing near them , marci cooke , from westmoreland , had been at a barack obama rally on sunday night but wanted to see senator mccain too before making up her mind .
" i 'm always interested to hear what everyone has to say because i 'm from new hampshire , " she said .
" i 'm probably going to vote for obama but i 'm not quite sure . "
show of emotion senator obama , riding a wave of momentum from his win in the iowa caucuses last week , has packed out school gyms and auditoriums in new hampshire .
emotion surfaced as mrs clinton campaigned his supporters have planted many of the banners that dot the banks of snow beside the state 's tree-lined roads and cluster at every road junction .
the latest polls gave him a several-point lead over rival hillary clinton , who slipped back after leading in the state for months .
she sought to fight back in the four days since her disappointment in iowa with a feisty debate appearance at the weekend and a string of well-attended events of her own .
but the moment likely to dominate headlines from the final day of campaigning was a rare show of emotion from the former first lady .
asked by a woman at a breakfast meeting in a portsmouth cafe how she kept going each day , mrs clinton 's voice faltered and her eyes appeared to well up .
" i just do n't want to see us fall backward as a nation , " she replied .
" i mean , this is very personal for me .
not just political .
i see what 's happening .
we have to reverse it . "
a few hours later , and it was time for laughter at a rally at salem high school , where two young male hecklers were ejected after repeatedly shouting : " iron my shirt ! "
" oh , the remnants of sexism , alive and well , " responded mrs clinton , adding that it demonstrated her mission to break through " the highest and hardest glass ceiling " .
outsider " change " has become the word of the moment , with many of the candidates tweaking their campaign speeches to pick up on the mood from iowa 's caucuses .
but it remains unclear whose brand of change will prove the most popular .
mr obama , who if elected would become the first black american president , has campaigned on a platform of " change we can believe in " and extolled the power of hope .
this is a pretty historic time and this is when new hampshire gets to shine chris gagnon john edwards supporter republican mitt romney , who came second in iowa to former arkansas governor mike huckabee , has presented himself in new hampshire as someone who can bring change as a washington outsider .
meanwhile , mrs clinton has spoken of offering change with experience .
john edwards , who pipped her to second place in iowa , embarked on his second 36-hour non-stop campaign stint in as many weeks with a promise that he would bring change by taking on special interest groups in washington .
mr mccain , who beat george w bush in the new hampshire primary back in 2000 , in turn said he would " bring about change " as he pledged " to do the hard things " if elected .
he made seven campaign stops on monday , in a state where he has held more than 100 town hall meetings and has revived a campaign which stumbled badly in the summer .
doubts rival mr huckabee , whose win in iowa has been attributed largely to his appeal to a christian evangelical base , has rejigged his message to focus on a more populist line in new hampshire .
he appeared with celebrity sidekick chuck norris in the state capital , concord , to sample a lunchtime " huckaburger " , having attracted big crowds to a pancake breakfast earlier .
mike huckabee is hoping to capitalise on his iowa success former new york mayor rudy giuliani , whose campaign strategy involves focusing on later primaries in large states like florida , also made a swing through new hampshire .
while considered strong on national issues , his support for abortion rights and his three marriages still trouble many social conservatives .
among them is christine mckinley , from nashua , who said she was attracted to both mr giuliani and mr romney because of their business backgrounds - but had some doubts .
" some time between now and tomorrow i will be making a decision , " she said .
" one thing that concerns me is that there is not as strong a background of family ideals for giuliani .
i have no concerns that mitt romney would embarrass us in the white house . "
' retail politics the candidates , who also include democrats bill richardson and dennis kucinich and republican ron paul , will continue to make last-minute appeals as voters go to the polls .
people in the tiny hamlet of dixville notch have already decided meanwhile , their campaign teams and volunteers will be focused on a get-out-the-vote operation that is the culmination of months of door-knocking , phone calls and hard graft .
they will be all too aware that the undecided voters may change their minds about who to support even as they enter the polling booths .
after all , in new hampshire , where " retail politics " - as the candidates ' face-to-face connection with the voters is known - is all important , loyalties can swiftly change .
three weeks ago , 32-year-old chris gagnon from manchester thought he would back mr obama - but having been impressed when he heard mr edwards speak , he volunteered for his campaign instead .
" this is a pretty historic time and this is when new hampshire gets to shine , " he said , explaining his and others ' willingness to give up their free time .
" we are at the centre of the world for a little bit - it 's unique for a small state .
a lot of people in new hampshire are proud and we would never want to lose this first primary . "
whether the state lives up to its reputation of picking the eventual winners of the party nominations - and the election - remains to be seen .
but there 's no doubting its commitment to the process of democracy .
