program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de sports -pipe- 15.02.2008 german basketball struggles for sponsors , recognition großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : some say the sport will succeed when children discover its beauty despite growing interest among youth , german basketball is struggling , with club-player membership down and pro teams fighting for survival .
but aficionados say it 's the system , not the sport , that 's at fault . just over a decade ago , things were looking up for basketball in germany .
at the 1992 olympics in barcelona , coverage focused on the us " dream team , " which featured an assembly of all-time b-ball greats including michael jordan , magic johnson , larry bird and charles barkley .
just a year later , the german men 's team caused a sensation when it won the european championship on its home turf . mirroring the sport 's wild growth across the atlantic at the time , hoops began mushrooming on playgrounds and schoolyards around the country - giving german kids their first opportunity to dribble a ball outside a gym .
in addition , lifestyle companies like nike and adidas took to sponsoring streetball tournaments in the bigger cities . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the mavericks ' nowitzki was 2007 mvp the era marked a high point in popularity for basketball in germany , when the number of people officially registered to play in basketball clubs reached around 200,000 , said dirk kaiser , spokesman for the german pro-basketball league , bundesliga basketball -lrb- bbl -rrb- . earlier start - but no follow-through but it seems a few summers flirting with a sport rooted deeply in us culture were not enough to win the undying love of soccer-mad germans . today , the number of registered players has receded to around 193,000 , although kaiser estimates about three to four times as many people - " potentially a million " - play streetball or in unregistered pickup games around the country . as a spectator sport , basketball is somewhere around third or fourth place , alongside ice hockey but well behind handball -lrb- number two -rrb- and miles out of the league of soccer , germany 's all-encompassing sports monolith . despite kids getting in touch with the sport at a much younger age than they used to , germany 's basketball federation " is n't doing a good job " of getting kids to go on to play in the clubs , said andre voigt , editor in chief of the german basketball magazine five .
in germany , competitive sports are much more closely tied to clubs than to schools . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : greece were euro champs , germany second , in 2005 " there are always polls of kids and their interests that show a great deal of interest in basketball .
often it even beats soccer .
but they are n't going on to play later , " voigt said .
" it 's a complex problem . " one major aspect of the problem is the lack of a strong domestic league with national basketball stars . " it 's obvious that kids interested in basketball today know more about the nba players than they do about the guys who play here , " voigt said . german-player quote - high enough ? in 2005 , the bbl tried to improve the situation by ruling that at least three of the 12 players on the roster have to be germans .
voigt called the quota " kind of low , " saying that court time in the pro leagues is necessary for germans to develop enough home-grown talent to field good national teams for european championships .
otherwise germany could n't hold its own against more basketball oriented countries like greece or spain . but more worrisome than keeping german players active , is the question of how to keep the teams alive at all . earlier this month , the cologne 99ers announced bankruptcy , despite a string of successes .
the move came after the team 's corporate sponsor , rhineenergie , pulled its support and a private financier failed to come through with enough cash to carry the team . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : is there life after bankruptcy in basketball ?
likewise , pharmaceutical giant bayer announced it would cease funding any pro teams except soccer , leaving its giants basketball players searching for a new owner .
and teams in ulm and giessen are both facing shaky futures because of sponsorship problems .
catch-22 sponsorship debacle the problem of sponsorship is , in fact , a tricky one .
sponsors see sports teams as a marketing vehicle , ideally to reach television audience .
but german free tv does n't carry league basketball play ; it is found either on pay channels or the internet .
so big sponsors drop out , pulling support from the teams , in turn weakening the sport , which then lowers the chances of having a strong following . and the cycle continues .
german national team coach dirk bauermann told the european basketball association , fiba , that the tv issue is " a huge concern . "
" if we do n't find ways to get in free television , we 're going to continue to lose sponsors , " he told the fiba web site .
it would be a " tragedy " if the league were to lose such established winning clubs as leverkusen and köln , he said .
' they 've got to go after the kids ' five 's voigt acknowledged that the tv coverage situation is a problem , but thinks that a little time , and some smart moves by german basketball organizations , could fix things in the long run .
" i do n't think the basketball associations should be trying to sway 20- and 30-year olds .
they 've got to go after the kids .
they have to go into the schools and grab the seven and eight year olds , and let them know how beautiful the sport is , " voigt said .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : cologne 's team was doing well when its support got pulled " if we get kids to play in bigger numbers than now , then we 'll generate better players , more viewers , get more people engaged , and more sponsors , " he added .
" this will take more than two or three years .
but it 's the only way to improve the situation in the long run . "
missing the boat on nowitzki ?
some critics say top basketball officials are missing a golden opportunity to win converts by failing to adequately exploit germany 's most important basketball resource : dirk nowitzki .
nowitzki , a seven-foot -lrb- 2.1-meter -rrb- power forward for the us national basketball association 's dallas mavericks , was voted the league 's most valuable player in 2007 .
germany should be making more of the fact that the man nicknamed the " bavarian bomber " was born and bred in wuerzburg , voigt said .
" he is the last global sports icon we have , now that boris becker left tennis and michael schumacher left racing , " said voigt .
" everyone knows about him - that 's he 's very tall , a great athlete , and he earns a lot of money . "
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : in summer , nowitzki plays for the german national team nowitzki does come to germany in the summers , to play for the german national team at the european championships , which are run under the aegis of the german basketball federation -lrb- dbb -rrb- .
the biggest problem with making him a full-time ambassador for basketball in germany is time , bbl 's kaiser said .
" there 's only so much he can do in a couple of months , and he has to be careful not to do too much .
i think the german basketball federation does as much with him as they can , " he said . jennifer abramsohn send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

15 . " the german government today accepted mr. zumwinkel 's offer to resign , " chancellor angela merkel told reporters in berlin .
" i consider this to be in unavoidable step considering what has happened . " zumwinkel , who is suspected of evading 1 million euros -lrb- $ 1.5 million -rrb- worth of taxes through a foundation in liechtenstein , also stepped down from his position on the supervisory board of deutsche telekom , the government spokesmen indicated . " in a large number of cases , key personalities from our country sought to avoid their duty of solidarity via taxation by practicing fiscal evasion to liechtenstein , " a finance ministry spokesman told reporters the daily sueddeutsche zeitung said in editions to appear saturday that some 3.4 billion euros was involved . albig urged those involved to file corrected returns detailing their tax evasion - a device known as " self-reporting " under german law and aimed at allowing offenders to reduce possible penalties . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the future looks bleak the financial times deutschland wrote that it was unlikely that zumwinkel would take a seat on the deutsche post group 's supervisory board , as would normally have been the case when his contract expired in november .
he has been head of deutsche post for 18 years . corporate elite under scrutiny the issue of tax breaks , massive salaries and corporate " extras " for high-powered german executives has come to a head in recent months , with increasing numbers of politicians joining in the growing public furor over the perceived immunity and privileges enjoyed by the country 's business elite . the german population , which places a high value on social and financial probity , was already shocked last year by scandals at two industrial titans , the engineering giant siemens and the biggest european car maker , volkswagen . german finance minister peer steinbrueck admitted the investigation was damaging the already shaky state of public confidence . " the moral damage is considerable - just as it was with his dealing with his share options , " steinbrueck told a group of journalists on his way into parliament . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : after being held by police , zumwinkel was later released in a controversial move , zumwinkel sold 200,000 share options worth 2.24 million euros in december just after deutsche post 's share price rose following a deal to introduce a minimum wage that would affect lower-cost rivals .
he later said his actions were a regrettable mistake . " if the public has something like this as a role model then they 'll start having doubts about this economic and social system , " steinbrueck added .
" i did n't think this was possible . " peter struck , the leader of the social democratic parliamentary faction , added : " when someone has so much money and nevertheless believes there is a need to hide money from the state , then a lot of people will believe there is a lack of justice .
the ordinary taxpayer has to pay his taxes to the tax office . " merkel 's spokesman , ulrich wilhelm , said the chancellor regretted the fact that zumwinkel had not made a public statement on his position since police raided his home and office at dawn on thursday . wilhelm said the highly publicized scandal would be discussed when merkel meets liechtenstein prime minister otmar halser on wednesday . german police searched zumwinkel 's villa in western cologne and deutsche post 's headquarters in bonn as the tax probe became public . the chief executive was taken under police escort from his home in the upmarket marienburg part of cologne to the prosecutors ' office in the city of bochum some five hours after the raids .
investigators also removed boxes from the house . after zumwinkel had posted what prosecutors described as " a not inconsiderable bond , " an arrest warrant was lifted and he was allowed to leave . investigation may unearth other big names bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : whose tax returns will be next to come under scrutiny ?
the business daily handelsblatt said the raids were part of a series of probes into tax evasion totaling around 10 million euros deposited in liechtenstein , the principality bordering switzerland and austria , and that other raids would follow across germany . hundreds of suspects had been uncovered by investigating the activities of lgt , a liechtenstein bank .
" we 've cracked the whole bank , " one investigator told handelsblatt . there is speculation that more of germany 's rich and powerful business leaders may be involved . lgt spokesman bernd junkers in liechtenstein told reuters that the bank , controlled by the principality 's princely family , had taken note of the handelsblatt report but could not comment in detail further . from savior to pariah bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the tower that klaus built the longest-serving chief of a dax company , the frankfurt blue-chip index , zumwinkel was credited with transforming the postal service into a world leader in logistics , with more than half a million employees , and a german leader in retail banking via its extensive postbank network . but he had also been sharply criticized for selling the large stock holding after the imposition of a minimum wage for postal workers boosted deutsche post shares last year following a fight for the unprecedented german legislation , which , in effect , protected deutsche post from lower-cost competition . dw staff -lrb- nda -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

steinmeier entrusted the job to erler . the nuts and bolts of power-sharing erler 's task was to explain the workings of merkel 's grand coalition between her center-right christian democrats and the social democrats , of which the minister is a member . " my visit was a surprise to all , " erler told german daily sueddeutsche zeitung on the last day of his mission .
" but then everyone was really interested and had a lot of questions . " erler said his job was to explain the complicated arithmetic underlying the power-sharing model in germany and how such a consensus-based system worked .
germany 's grand coalition came into being after federal elections in 2005 , ending two months of political uncertainty after merkel 's conservatives won a wafer-thin majority . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : erler said it kenyans need to see if the german political model could be adapted for nairobi " my job was to present the model so that the kenyans can see if a similar system could work for them , " erler said .
the minister had also brought along an english version of germany 's coalition agreement with him so that the kenyans could spend time studying it . though berlin has never had to deal with the levels of violence that followed kenya 's election last month , the grand coalition model is considered a useful one in deadlocked political situations .
erler is expected to back in berlin by friday . no quick answers to kenya 's problems kenya went through weeks of violence after kibaki 's party claimed victory in a dec .
27 poll that observers said was hugely flawed by rigging .
the crisis is estimated to have killed 1,000 people and made more than 300,000 homeless .
the turmoil has shattered kenya 's image as one of africa 's most stable democracies . experts have said that annan is impatient for progress and in favor of holding a new election and some form of shared government . kibaki and odinga have already missed a mid-february deadline set by annan to reach a political agreement .
the former un chief had said he wanted underlying problems including land and wealth disparities tackled in a year . annan said friday that an agreement that would put an end to political chaos was " very close " and added that he hoped that the " last difficult and frightening " step would be taken next week . other than annan , however , few expect kenya 's political deadlock to be resolved swiftly , saying the two sides have yet to strike a deal on the most contentious issue - the structure of the government . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : kibaki , center , shakes hands with opposition leader raila odinga , right , analysts have pointed out that division of cabinet and civil service jobs would likely be a source of wrangling between kibaki and odinga as well issues such as reforming the constitution and a new electoral law . " a power-sharing system in which the principal participants are deeply suspicious of each other is difficult enough to manage , " kenyan political columnist , macharia gaitho told news agency reuters . in a bid to shore up annan 's mission , us president george w. bush this week said secretary of state condoleezza rice will head to kenya to tell its leaders there must be a return to democracy . dw staff -lrb- sp -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de opinion -pipe- 15.02.2008 opinion : kenya solutions threaten to repeat historical mistakes großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the proposals put forward by former un secretary general kofi annan to stabilize kenya may focus on cooperation and compromise , but the real roots of the problem are being ignored , said dw guest commentator allan duncan . a month has passed since the current troubles in kenya began and some sense of normality is now returning to the country ; people are returning to work , schools are reopening and the rush hour traffic jams are coming back .
all this , of course , is mainly within the capital of nairobi .
the rest of the country remains in a state of fear of reprisal killings , police brutality and the overpowering dread that this is not the last time this will happen in this country .
the daily beheadings , burnings and rapes of people caught in the wrong ethnic region of the country have - as far as reporting is concerned - almost come to an end .
however , a number of eyewitness stories that i have been told still tell of random killings by both civilian-formed militias as well as by the police themselves .
this can only make one fear that the real number of deaths within the country , currently estimated around 1,000 , falls extremely short .
against this backdrop of returning normality and the low-level conflicts and killings pervasive within the rest of the country , outside of nairobi and mombassa , the kofi annan-sponsored reconciliation talks have been taking place and have made remarkably rapid and relatively painless progress towards resolving the crisis .
the real test of this ' almost resolution ' is yet to come along with kenya 's greatest ordeal : the challenging of its idea of nationhood , reconciliation and , above all , its humanity .
there is every chance that the annan discussions will lead to a short-term solution to the electoral crisis of last year and a power-sharing government of national unity , or some other form of interim government , will be formed and posts suitably allocated to the various aggrieved parties .
however , a number of critical issues from the past - and for the future - raise fundamental questions about the stability of any potential interim government and the real prospects for peace and stability within the country .
raila odinga , the losing presidential candidate from the december elections and main protagonist within the current crisis , has already been in a coalition once before with mwai kibaki , the current president of kenya .
that time the coalition was made through common cause and mutual agreement rather than being resentfully forced through .
even so , the partnership between odinga and kibaki lasted only a matter of months prior to odinga withdrawing from the government over accusations of betrayals of faith on previous agreements on power-sharing .
this shared history does not bode well for the stability of the government to come .
and it could be expected that the 10th parliament , which is just forming , will be precarious at best , with various people and parties just biding their time and resources until the next fight for ultimate control .
if any real , lasting peace is to be achieved in kenya , serious constitutional review will need to take place that allows for a fairer and devolved system of government .
the constitution has been revised several times over the last few decades , most of which applied to the consolidation of power within the presidency and the ruling party .
however , a constitutional review was carried out during the last two parliaments , with wide-spread consultations and formal deliberations , which , in the end , came to nothing .
as a result , the concentration of power remains with the presidency .
one of the main problems with the previous attempt to revise and reinvigorate the constitution was the insistence that the changes should be open to a public referendum .
although there was some civic education carried out during this previous process , the time and information required by constituents to make an informed decision on issues as complex as constitutional amendments , when they have been completely and actively excluded from the process of governance for the history of the country , was both immense and very time consuming .
neither of which was taken into account during the process .
the vote in the end became a protest against the sitting government rather than on any real understanding and appreciation of the content of the amendments , much in the same way as the french voted on the eu constitution .
the balkanization of the country stemming from the post-election violence will only exacerbate this issue , with a growing body of people rejecting their kenyan identity in favor of tribal allegiances and support for the politicians that represent that tribe .
a growing number of middle-class families are taking their children out of the boarding schools around nairobi and moving them back to their home areas , where protection is more assured when things go wrong .
this , along with middle-class houses in nairobi being threatened during the previous riots in the city because they were owned by the " wrong tribe " as perceived by the passing hordes as they streamed out of the slums deep inside the city , only accentuates this perception of an " us and them " mentality within the country .
the annan process and the coalition government have talked about the need for constitutional reform again as part of the longer-term assurance of stability within the country .
if these issues of the growing fractionalization and tribalism of the country , combined with the poor civic education process on the core issues of the constitutional reform process , are not resolved , then any voting in a referendum can only be , at best , based on what their political leaders tell them is best or worst for their tribe alone .
this can only be exacerbated by the inherent instability of the upcoming interim government as tribal priorities and past resentments form the major part of the daily operations of the parliament .
so what are the prospects for peace in kenya ?
slim at best .
the next year will be the defining period , where the country either finds its purpose again to come out of this as a stronger more cohesive nation or it slips further into the quagmire of tribal chauvinism and towards a dictatorship or a failed state .
i hope for the former , but i 'm not holding my breath .

but aficionados say it 's the system , not the sport , that 's at fault . just over a decade ago , things were looking up for basketball in germany .
at the 1992 olympics in barcelona , coverage focused on the us " dream team , " which featured an assembly of all-time b-ball greats including michael jordan , magic johnson , larry bird and charles barkley .
just a year later , the german men 's team caused a sensation when it won the european championship on its home turf . mirroring the sport 's wild growth across the atlantic at the time , hoops began mushrooming on playgrounds and schoolyards around the country - giving german kids their first opportunity to dribble a ball outside a gym .
in addition , lifestyle companies like nike and adidas took to sponsoring streetball tournaments in the bigger cities . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the mavericks ' nowitzki was 2007 mvp the era marked a high point in popularity for basketball in germany , when the number of people officially registered to play in basketball clubs reached around 200,000 , said dirk kaiser , spokesman for the german pro-basketball league , bundesliga basketball -lrb- bbl -rrb- . earlier start - but no follow-through but it seems a few summers flirting with a sport rooted deeply in us culture were not enough to win the undying love of soccer-mad germans . today , the number of registered players has receded to around 193,000 , although kaiser estimates about three to four times as many people - " potentially a million " - play streetball or in unregistered pickup games around the country . as a spectator sport , basketball is somewhere around third or fourth place , alongside ice hockey but well behind handball -lrb- number two -rrb- and miles out of the league of soccer , germany 's all-encompassing sports monolith . despite kids getting in touch with the sport at a much younger age than they used to , germany 's basketball federation " is n't doing a good job " of getting kids to go on to play in the clubs , said andre voigt , editor in chief of the german basketball magazine five .
in germany , competitive sports are much more closely tied to clubs than to schools . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : greece were euro champs , germany second , in 2005 " there are always polls of kids and their interests that show a great deal of interest in basketball .
often it even beats soccer .
but they are n't going on to play later , " voigt said .
" it 's a complex problem . " one major aspect of the problem is the lack of a strong domestic league with national basketball stars . " it 's obvious that kids interested in basketball today know more about the nba players than they do about the guys who play here , " voigt said . german-player quote - high enough ? in 2005 , the bbl tried to improve the situation by ruling that at least three of the 12 players on the roster have to be germans .
voigt called the quota " kind of low , " saying that court time in the pro leagues is necessary for germans to develop enough home-grown talent to field good national teams for european championships .
otherwise germany could n't hold its own against more basketball oriented countries like greece or spain . but more worrisome than keeping german players active , is the question of how to keep the teams alive at all . earlier this month , the cologne 99ers announced bankruptcy , despite a string of successes .
the move came after the team 's corporate sponsor , rhineenergie , pulled its support and a private financier failed to come through with enough cash to carry the team . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : is there life after bankruptcy in basketball ?
likewise , pharmaceutical giant bayer announced it would cease funding any pro teams except soccer , leaving its giants basketball players searching for a new owner .
and teams in ulm and giessen are both facing shaky futures because of sponsorship problems .
catch-22 sponsorship debacle the problem of sponsorship is , in fact , a tricky one .
sponsors see sports teams as a marketing vehicle , ideally to reach television audience .
but german free tv does n't carry league basketball play ; it is found either on pay channels or the internet .
so big sponsors drop out , pulling support from the teams , in turn weakening the sport , which then lowers the chances of having a strong following . and the cycle continues .
german national team coach dirk bauermann told the european basketball association , fiba , that the tv issue is " a huge concern . "
" if we do n't find ways to get in free television , we 're going to continue to lose sponsors , " he told the fiba web site .
it would be a " tragedy " if the league were to lose such established winning clubs as leverkusen and köln , he said .
' they 've got to go after the kids ' five 's voigt acknowledged that the tv coverage situation is a problem , but thinks that a little time , and some smart moves by german basketball organizations , could fix things in the long run .
" i do n't think the basketball associations should be trying to sway 20- and 30-year olds .
they 've got to go after the kids .
they have to go into the schools and grab the seven and eight year olds , and let them know how beautiful the sport is , " voigt said .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : cologne 's team was doing well when its support got pulled " if we get kids to play in bigger numbers than now , then we 'll generate better players , more viewers , get more people engaged , and more sponsors , " he added .
" this will take more than two or three years .
but it 's the only way to improve the situation in the long run . "
missing the boat on nowitzki ?
some critics say top basketball officials are missing a golden opportunity to win converts by failing to adequately exploit germany 's most important basketball resource : dirk nowitzki .
nowitzki , a seven-foot -lrb- 2.1-meter -rrb- power forward for the us national basketball association 's dallas mavericks , was voted the league 's most valuable player in 2007 .
germany should be making more of the fact that the man nicknamed the " bavarian bomber " was born and bred in wuerzburg , voigt said .
" he is the last global sports icon we have , now that boris becker left tennis and michael schumacher left racing , " said voigt .
" everyone knows about him - that 's he 's very tall , a great athlete , and he earns a lot of money . "
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : in summer , nowitzki plays for the german national team nowitzki does come to germany in the summers , to play for the german national team at the european championships , which are run under the aegis of the german basketball federation -lrb- dbb -rrb- .
the biggest problem with making him a full-time ambassador for basketball in germany is time , bbl 's kaiser said .
" there 's only so much he can do in a couple of months , and he has to be careful not to do too much .
i think the german basketball federation does as much with him as they can , " he said . jennifer abramsohn send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de sports -pipe- 15.02.2008 german basketball struggles for sponsors , recognition großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : some say the sport will succeed when children discover its beauty despite growing interest among youth , german basketball is struggling , with club-player membership down and pro teams fighting for survival .
but aficionados say it 's the system , not the sport , that 's at fault . just over a decade ago , things were looking up for basketball in germany .
at the 1992 olympics in barcelona , coverage focused on the us " dream team , " which featured an assembly of all-time b-ball greats including michael jordan , magic johnson , larry bird and charles barkley .
just a year later , the german men 's team caused a sensation when it won the european championship on its home turf . mirroring the sport 's wild growth across the atlantic at the time , hoops began mushrooming on playgrounds and schoolyards around the country - giving german kids their first opportunity to dribble a ball outside a gym .
in addition , lifestyle companies like nike and adidas took to sponsoring streetball tournaments in the bigger cities . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the mavericks ' nowitzki was 2007 mvp the era marked a high point in popularity for basketball in germany , when the number of people officially registered to play in basketball clubs reached around 200,000 , said dirk kaiser , spokesman for the german pro-basketball league , bundesliga basketball -lrb- bbl -rrb- . earlier start - but no follow-through but it seems a few summers flirting with a sport rooted deeply in us culture were not enough to win the undying love of soccer-mad germans . today , the number of registered players has receded to around 193,000 , although kaiser estimates about three to four times as many people - " potentially a million " - play streetball or in unregistered pickup games around the country . as a spectator sport , basketball is somewhere around third or fourth place , alongside ice hockey but well behind handball -lrb- number two -rrb- and miles out of the league of soccer , germany 's all-encompassing sports monolith . despite kids getting in touch with the sport at a much younger age than they used to , germany 's basketball federation " is n't doing a good job " of getting kids to go on to play in the clubs , said andre voigt , editor in chief of the german basketball magazine five .
in germany , competitive sports are much more closely tied to clubs than to schools . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : greece were euro champs , germany second , in 2005 " there are always polls of kids and their interests that show a great deal of interest in basketball .
often it even beats soccer .
but they are n't going on to play later , " voigt said .
" it 's a complex problem . " one major aspect of the problem is the lack of a strong domestic league with national basketball stars . " it 's obvious that kids interested in basketball today know more about the nba players than they do about the guys who play here , " voigt said . german-player quote - high enough ? in 2005 , the bbl tried to improve the situation by ruling that at least three of the 12 players on the roster have to be germans .
voigt called the quota " kind of low , " saying that court time in the pro leagues is necessary for germans to develop enough home-grown talent to field good national teams for european championships .
otherwise germany could n't hold its own against more basketball oriented countries like greece or spain . but more worrisome than keeping german players active , is the question of how to keep the teams alive at all . earlier this month , the cologne 99ers announced bankruptcy , despite a string of successes .
the move came after the team 's corporate sponsor , rhineenergie , pulled its support and a private financier failed to come through with enough cash to carry the team . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : is there life after bankruptcy in basketball ?
likewise , pharmaceutical giant bayer announced it would cease funding any pro teams except soccer , leaving its giants basketball players searching for a new owner .
and teams in ulm and giessen are both facing shaky futures because of sponsorship problems .
catch-22 sponsorship debacle the problem of sponsorship is , in fact , a tricky one .
sponsors see sports teams as a marketing vehicle , ideally to reach television audience .
but german free tv does n't carry league basketball play ; it is found either on pay channels or the internet .
so big sponsors drop out , pulling support from the teams , in turn weakening the sport , which then lowers the chances of having a strong following . and the cycle continues .
german national team coach dirk bauermann told the european basketball association , fiba , that the tv issue is " a huge concern . "
" if we do n't find ways to get in free television , we 're going to continue to lose sponsors , " he told the fiba web site .
it would be a " tragedy " if the league were to lose such established winning clubs as leverkusen and köln , he said .
' they 've got to go after the kids ' five 's voigt acknowledged that the tv coverage situation is a problem , but thinks that a little time , and some smart moves by german basketball organizations , could fix things in the long run .
" i do n't think the basketball associations should be trying to sway 20- and 30-year olds .
they 've got to go after the kids .
they have to go into the schools and grab the seven and eight year olds , and let them know how beautiful the sport is , " voigt said .

but it 's the only way to improve the situation in the long run . "
missing the boat on nowitzki ?
some critics say top basketball officials are missing a golden opportunity to win converts by failing to adequately exploit germany 's most important basketball resource : dirk nowitzki .
nowitzki , a seven-foot -lrb- 2.1-meter -rrb- power forward for the us national basketball association 's dallas mavericks , was voted the league 's most valuable player in 2007 .
germany should be making more of the fact that the man nicknamed the " bavarian bomber " was born and bred in wuerzburg , voigt said .
" he is the last global sports icon we have , now that boris becker left tennis and michael schumacher left racing , " said voigt .
" everyone knows about him - that 's he 's very tall , a great athlete , and he earns a lot of money . "
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : in summer , nowitzki plays for the german national team nowitzki does come to germany in the summers , to play for the german national team at the european championships , which are run under the aegis of the german basketball federation -lrb- dbb -rrb- .
the biggest problem with making him a full-time ambassador for basketball in germany is time , bbl 's kaiser said .
" there 's only so much he can do in a couple of months , and he has to be careful not to do too much .
i think the german basketball federation does as much with him as they can , " he said . jennifer abramsohn send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

hamburg and bremen looked best in their matches . while sv hamburg and werder bremen won their matches , bayern munich and bayer leverkusen drew away from home and nuremberg lost on a single goal . hamburg came out 3-1 winners at fc zurich on thursday , feb .
14 , in their first-leg match of the tournament 's knock-out stage . a first-half goal by david jarolim and second-half strikes from ivica olic and piotr trochowski put hamburg on the road to a comfortable victory . hamburg lost dutch midfielder rafael van der vaart who limped off with an ankle injury in the 33rd minute to be replaced by jose guerrero . the peru striker then set up the opening two goals in the 33rd and 67th minutes and earned the foul which led to trochowski scoring with a direct free-kick in the 77th . zurich notched a consolation three minutes from time when a shot by andres vasquez was fumbled onto the inside of the post by keeper frank rost and irish referee alan kelly ruled the ball had crossed the line . bremen waltz to a comfortable win werder bremen enjoyed a 3-0 home win over portugal 's braga in their opening knock-out round match on wednesday . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : bremen cruised to a win against the portuguese goalkeeper tim wiese saved two penalties while first-half goals from naldo and daniel jensen and a penalty by hugo almeida sealed a comfortable win for the german side . naldo put bremen in front after just four minutes with a long-range shot before wiese saved a roland linz spot kick to maintain bremen 's lead . jensen doubled werder 's advantage on 27 minutes with a shot from outside the penalty area before wiese once again saved a penalty , this time from jorginho nine minutes later .
almeida completed the scoring with virtually the last kick of the game after joao pereira handled in the area . " when we get penalties we have to convert them , " said braga 's linz afterwards .
" now it will be really tough for us in the return leg . " bayern struggle to keep scots in check bundesliga leaders bayern munich twice came from behind to draw 2-2 with scottish side aberdeen .
goals from miroslav klose and hamit altintop put bayern into a strong position for the return leg in munich next week . however the four-time european champions were made to fight all the way by a spirited aberdeen side depleted by injuries . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : klose helped bayern stay in touch with aberdeen " it 's quite normal that when you play internationally - a team like aberdeen can play above themselves , " bayern coach ottmar hitzfeld said .
" a 2-2 draw away from home in europe used to be like a victory .
we never think about losing in munich . " aberdeen were hoping to repeat a quarter-final win over the bundesliga leaders 25 years ago on their way to lifting the european cup winners ' cup . they took a surprise lead in the 24th minute when josh walker rifled in a shot from more than 20 meters . bayern had already missed chances , but klose made no mistake with a shot on the turn into the roof of the net five minutes later . aberdeen went back in front when sone aluko beat michael rensing - in goal for the flu-ridden oliver kahn - with a low shot from inside the area three minutes before half-time . bayern again leveled after a ze roberto cross struck alan maybury on the arm and spanish referee eduardo iturralde gonzalez awarded a penalty .
altintop 's 54th-minute spot-kick was parried by jamie langfield but the turkey international followed up to make sure at the second chance . nuremberg and leverkusen face harder tasks nuremberg slipped to a 1-0 defeat to portugal 's benfica in lisbon on wednesday , sunk by ariza makukula 's 43rd-minute winner . it was the first game in charge for thomas von heesen , who replaced the sacked hans meyer on monday . also on wednesday , bayer leverkusen earned a goalless draw at turkish side galatasaray . dw staff -lrb- nda -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

three previous rounds of voting last week failed , prompting feverish negotiations and pressure from both camps on lawmakers to switch sides . svejnar , 55 , said he had no regrets after a fiercely fought contest in which he portrayed himself as candidate of " change . " " even if i was not elected , it was not for nothing , " svejnar said . an economics graduate and a political veteran , klaus was prime minister from 1992 to 1997 and parliamentary speaker from 1998 to 2002 . he remains known for his conservative credentials , emphasizing the importance of traditional values during the campaign . " if you do not want to respect our thousands of year old civilization , its christian values and emphasis on the traditional family and respect for each individual life , do not vote for me , " he had said . strong euroskeptic a fierce euroskeptic who is opposed to any transfer of powers from nation states to the eu , klaus has also stirred controversy by challenging the dangers of global warming . however , european commission president jose manuel barroso was swift to congratulate klaus on his victory .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de afghanistan -pipe- 15.02.2008 germany to discuss increasing troops in afghanistan großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : germans want to focus on humanitarian projects germany seems likely to increase the number of troops it is willing to send to afghanistan .
but concern is mounting that the nato mission could fail entirely . german chancellor angela merkel 's government will begin discussing the future role of germany in afghanistan next week .
and speculation abounds that the government plans to increase the number of troops in afghanistan when the current mandate runs out in october .
one member of parliament who requested anonymity told reuters that top politicians in the germany 's ruling coalition will begin discussing changes to the current mission next week .
it was not clear whether or by how much the number of troops would increase .
" it 's too early to speculate on what a new mandate might look like , " guenter gloser , a minister of state in the german foreign ministry , said .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : germany has said it wo n't send more troops media reports have speculated that germany could send 500 to 1,000 additional soldiers and could also increase the geographical area where they are deployed within afghanistan .
the government has denied these reports .
germany 's existing mandate allows for up to 3,500 soldiers to work out of the relatively peaceful northern part of the country .
berlin is under pressure from the united states and other nato allies to take a more active role in the southern part of the country .
germany recently promised about 200 combat troops as part of a quick response force .
limited mandate many european countries have been reluctant to commit more troops to the mission in afghanistan .
at a nato meeting in vilnius last week france , romania , poland and norway signaled they could increase their participation .
yet this was hardly the level of support hoped for by the us .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : german public opinion is strongly anti-war more than six years have passed since the us brought down the taliban regime in an effort to put an end to al qaeda .
while the taliban has been ousted from power , it remains strong , particularly in the south of the country where it controls many roads and runs its own checkpoints .
nato 's international security assistance force -lrb- isaf -rrb- has quadrupled to 43,000 troops in four years .
us undersecretary of state nicholas burns said in a speech earlier this week that nine of nato 's members were carrying 95 percent of the burden in afghanistan .
nato needs all help it can get yet isaf lacks troops and equipment which is " hurting military efforts to defeat the enemy , " burns said .
" nato never fought a ground war until the afghanistan war , " burns said .
" nato 's future is so much on the line . "
britain 's paddy ashdown , a former united nations envoy to bosnia who withdrew as a " super envoy " to afghanistan , said defeat is a possibility for nato .
forces there are in disarray and the security situation is deteriorating , ashdown wrote in a financial times opinion piece published wednesday , feb .
13 .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : there have been calls for better coordination britain feels maxed out with 7,800 troops in afghanistan and 4,500 in iraq .
canada and the netherlands , which also have troops in southern afghanistan , have suffered too many casualties and have domestic resistance to increasing troops .
that has increased pressure on france and germany , neither of which has troops in the south .
it 's thought that merkel and france 's nicolas sarkozy will want to bring promises of additional troops to a nato summit in bucharest in april .
" super envoy " badly needed the us 's burns also said it was necessary for the un to speedily appoint a strong " super envoy " with a centralized mandate .
a " super envoy " would coordinate military , aid and development activities which are seen as important to counter insurgency .
ashdown withdrew his name after afghan president hamid karzai opposed the appointment .
un and nato sources expect it to take weeks to find a viable substitute . dw staff -lrb- th -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

otherwise , things could get ugly . the resignation serves as a confession : klaus zumwinkel realized that he could not remain ceo of one of germany 's largest companies and decided to face the consequences .
he did n't have a choice . it goes without saying that he has to give up his position at the top if he funneled money into liechtenstein 's tax paradise and did n't report the interest he 'd earned .
it 's called tax evasion . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : technically , he 's considered innocent until found guilty in a court of law or until he has made a formal confession , but it 's becoming more and more apparent that the evidence collected so far is just the tip of the iceberg . post chief is one of many several hundred wealthy germans , some of them celebrities , have also invested money in liechtenstein and hidden it from the german tax authorities .
now they have a big problem , too . klaus zumwinkel himself became the tip of the iceberg when the other tax evaders came under the radar of the public prosecutor 's office .
the alpine principality 's tax saving model is not quite as secure as many had thought .
the secrets at the large baronial bank have been cracked and officials have known for months who has money there and how much - including in the so-called family endowments . now the investigations have begun .
over the next few weeks , police and public prosecutors will pay visits to many of the tax evaders .
zumwinkel is merely the first of many . sympathy is not in order .
we 're not talking about the poorest of the poor but mainly about people who , even after properly paying their taxes , could still afford a hot lunch . greed conquered reason zumwinkel is n't the only one asking how it could come to this .
the answer is simple : greed was stronger than reason .
zumwinkel certainly did n't need to do what he did .
as the head of deutsche post , he not only collected an annual salary of 3.5 million euros -lrb- $ 5.1 million -rrb- but had also inherited a large sum of money at a young age . he would be wealthy even if he had paid the taxes he owed , just slightly less wealthy .
that 's also true of most of the others who will soon receive visits from the authorities .
none of them is poor ; rather they 're among the richest members of society - of the very society that made it possible for them to become as affluent as they are . if they have any brains at all , they should come out of hiding as soon as possible .
the german tax authorities are n't interested in punishment or even revenge - they just want the tax money owed to them .
that means that those who turn themselves in to the tax office and pay the missing taxes with interest before they 're investigated will get off without penalty . fine is least of the worries the tax evaders that do n't do this will have to face the full rigor of the law - and rightly so .
it 's always the wealthier part of society that complains about high taxes and takes advantage of every opportunity to reduce their own tax burden , either by legal means or illegally via liechtenstein . zumwinkel 's case - and the many more cases that are likely to follow in the coming weeks - shows what the outcome can be .
his reputation is ruined , his job has been lost and a hefty penalty is looming .

otherwise , things could get ugly . the resignation serves as a confession : klaus zumwinkel realized that he could not remain ceo of one of germany 's largest companies and decided to face the consequences .
he did n't have a choice . it goes without saying that he has to give up his position at the top if he funneled money into liechtenstein 's tax paradise and did n't report the interest he 'd earned .
it 's called tax evasion . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : technically , he 's considered innocent until found guilty in a court of law or until he has made a formal confession , but it 's becoming more and more apparent that the evidence collected so far is just the tip of the iceberg . post chief is one of many several hundred wealthy germans , some of them celebrities , have also invested money in liechtenstein and hidden it from the german tax authorities .

the answer is simple : greed was stronger than reason .
zumwinkel certainly did n't need to do what he did .
as the head of deutsche post , he not only collected an annual salary of 3.5 million euros -lrb- $ 5.1 million -rrb- but had also inherited a large sum of money at a young age . he would be wealthy even if he had paid the taxes he owed , just slightly less wealthy .

the german tax authorities are n't interested in punishment or even revenge - they just want the tax money owed to them .
that means that those who turn themselves in to the tax office and pay the missing taxes with interest before they 're investigated will get off without penalty . fine is least of the worries the tax evaders that do n't do this will have to face the full rigor of the law - and rightly so .
it 's always the wealthier part of society that complains about high taxes and takes advantage of every opportunity to reduce their own tax burden , either by legal means or illegally via liechtenstein . zumwinkel 's case - and the many more cases that are likely to follow in the coming weeks - shows what the outcome can be .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de diplomacy -pipe- 15.02.2008 kenya considers german coalition to resolve political crisis großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : post-election violence has claimed the lives of an estimated 1,000 kenyans kofi annan , chief mediator between kenya 's feuding parties , has asked a german politician to explain the workings of berlin 's left-right coalition as a possible power-sharing model to break kenya 's political deadlock . closeted in a safari lodge in the tsavo national park in kenya to focus on ways to search for peace , kenya 's president mwai kibaki and opposition leader raila odinga had a surprise visitor this week - a high-ranking politician from german chancellor angela merkel 's grand coalition . gernot erler , germany 's deputy foreign minister , was secretly flown in to kenya at the request of kofi annan , former un secretary-general who is mediating between kenya 's warring factions to resolve a crisis sparked by kibaki 's disputed re-election last december . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : annan has brought odinga and kibaki to the negotiating table annan had turned to german foreign minister frank-walter steinmeier to ask for an expert to assist in talks between kibaki 's party of national unity -lrb- pnu -rrb- and odinga 's orange democratic movement -lrb- odm -rrb- .
steinmeier entrusted the job to erler . the nuts and bolts of power-sharing erler 's task was to explain the workings of merkel 's grand coalition between her center-right christian democrats and the social democrats , of which the minister is a member . " my visit was a surprise to all , " erler told german daily sueddeutsche zeitung on the last day of his mission .
" but then everyone was really interested and had a lot of questions . " erler said his job was to explain the complicated arithmetic underlying the power-sharing model in germany and how such a consensus-based system worked .
germany 's grand coalition came into being after federal elections in 2005 , ending two months of political uncertainty after merkel 's conservatives won a wafer-thin majority . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : erler said it kenyans need to see if the german political model could be adapted for nairobi " my job was to present the model so that the kenyans can see if a similar system could work for them , " erler said .
the minister had also brought along an english version of germany 's coalition agreement with him so that the kenyans could spend time studying it . though berlin has never had to deal with the levels of violence that followed kenya 's election last month , the grand coalition model is considered a useful one in deadlocked political situations .
erler is expected to back in berlin by friday . no quick answers to kenya 's problems kenya went through weeks of violence after kibaki 's party claimed victory in a dec .
27 poll that observers said was hugely flawed by rigging .
the crisis is estimated to have killed 1,000 people and made more than 300,000 homeless .
the turmoil has shattered kenya 's image as one of africa 's most stable democracies . experts have said that annan is impatient for progress and in favor of holding a new election and some form of shared government . kibaki and odinga have already missed a mid-february deadline set by annan to reach a political agreement .
the former un chief had said he wanted underlying problems including land and wealth disparities tackled in a year . annan said friday that an agreement that would put an end to political chaos was " very close " and added that he hoped that the " last difficult and frightening " step would be taken next week . other than annan , however , few expect kenya 's political deadlock to be resolved swiftly , saying the two sides have yet to strike a deal on the most contentious issue - the structure of the government . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : kibaki , center , shakes hands with opposition leader raila odinga , right , analysts have pointed out that division of cabinet and civil service jobs would likely be a source of wrangling between kibaki and odinga as well issues such as reforming the constitution and a new electoral law . " a power-sharing system in which the principal participants are deeply suspicious of each other is difficult enough to manage , " kenyan political columnist , macharia gaitho told news agency reuters . in a bid to shore up annan 's mission , us president george w. bush this week said secretary of state condoleezza rice will head to kenya to tell its leaders there must be a return to democracy . dw staff -lrb- sp -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

otherwise , things could get ugly . the resignation serves as a confession : klaus zumwinkel realized that he could not remain ceo of one of germany 's largest companies and decided to face the consequences .
he did n't have a choice . it goes without saying that he has to give up his position at the top if he funneled money into liechtenstein 's tax paradise and did n't report the interest he 'd earned .
it 's called tax evasion . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : technically , he 's considered innocent until found guilty in a court of law or until he has made a formal confession , but it 's becoming more and more apparent that the evidence collected so far is just the tip of the iceberg . post chief is one of many several hundred wealthy germans , some of them celebrities , have also invested money in liechtenstein and hidden it from the german tax authorities .

15 . " the german government today accepted mr. zumwinkel 's offer to resign , " chancellor angela merkel told reporters in berlin .
" i consider this to be in unavoidable step considering what has happened . " zumwinkel , who is suspected of evading 1 million euros -lrb- $ 1.5 million -rrb- worth of taxes through a foundation in liechtenstein , also stepped down from his position on the supervisory board of deutsche telekom , the government spokesmen indicated . " in a large number of cases , key personalities from our country sought to avoid their duty of solidarity via taxation by practicing fiscal evasion to liechtenstein , " a finance ministry spokesman told reporters the daily sueddeutsche zeitung said in editions to appear saturday that some 3.4 billion euros was involved . albig urged those involved to file corrected returns detailing their tax evasion - a device known as " self-reporting " under german law and aimed at allowing offenders to reduce possible penalties . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the future looks bleak the financial times deutschland wrote that it was unlikely that zumwinkel would take a seat on the deutsche post group 's supervisory board , as would normally have been the case when his contract expired in november .
he has been head of deutsche post for 18 years . corporate elite under scrutiny the issue of tax breaks , massive salaries and corporate " extras " for high-powered german executives has come to a head in recent months , with increasing numbers of politicians joining in the growing public furor over the perceived immunity and privileges enjoyed by the country 's business elite . the german population , which places a high value on social and financial probity , was already shocked last year by scandals at two industrial titans , the engineering giant siemens and the biggest european car maker , volkswagen . german finance minister peer steinbrueck admitted the investigation was damaging the already shaky state of public confidence . " the moral damage is considerable - just as it was with his dealing with his share options , " steinbrueck told a group of journalists on his way into parliament . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : after being held by police , zumwinkel was later released in a controversial move , zumwinkel sold 200,000 share options worth 2.24 million euros in december just after deutsche post 's share price rose following a deal to introduce a minimum wage that would affect lower-cost rivals .
he later said his actions were a regrettable mistake . " if the public has something like this as a role model then they 'll start having doubts about this economic and social system , " steinbrueck added .
" i did n't think this was possible . " peter struck , the leader of the social democratic parliamentary faction , added : " when someone has so much money and nevertheless believes there is a need to hide money from the state , then a lot of people will believe there is a lack of justice .
the ordinary taxpayer has to pay his taxes to the tax office . " merkel 's spokesman , ulrich wilhelm , said the chancellor regretted the fact that zumwinkel had not made a public statement on his position since police raided his home and office at dawn on thursday . wilhelm said the highly publicized scandal would be discussed when merkel meets liechtenstein prime minister otmar halser on wednesday . german police searched zumwinkel 's villa in western cologne and deutsche post 's headquarters in bonn as the tax probe became public . the chief executive was taken under police escort from his home in the upmarket marienburg part of cologne to the prosecutors ' office in the city of bochum some five hours after the raids .
investigators also removed boxes from the house . after zumwinkel had posted what prosecutors described as " a not inconsiderable bond , " an arrest warrant was lifted and he was allowed to leave . investigation may unearth other big names bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : whose tax returns will be next to come under scrutiny ?
the business daily handelsblatt said the raids were part of a series of probes into tax evasion totaling around 10 million euros deposited in liechtenstein , the principality bordering switzerland and austria , and that other raids would follow across germany . hundreds of suspects had been uncovered by investigating the activities of lgt , a liechtenstein bank .
" we 've cracked the whole bank , " one investigator told handelsblatt . there is speculation that more of germany 's rich and powerful business leaders may be involved . lgt spokesman bernd junkers in liechtenstein told reuters that the bank , controlled by the principality 's princely family , had taken note of the handelsblatt report but could not comment in detail further . from savior to pariah bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the tower that klaus built the longest-serving chief of a dax company , the frankfurt blue-chip index , zumwinkel was credited with transforming the postal service into a world leader in logistics , with more than half a million employees , and a german leader in retail banking via its extensive postbank network . but he had also been sharply criticized for selling the large stock holding after the imposition of a minimum wage for postal workers boosted deutsche post shares last year following a fight for the unprecedented german legislation , which , in effect , protected deutsche post from lower-cost competition . dw staff -lrb- nda -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

at the 1992 olympics in barcelona , coverage focused on the us " dream team , " which featured an assembly of all-time b-ball greats including michael jordan , magic johnson , larry bird and charles barkley .
just a year later , the german men 's team caused a sensation when it won the european championship on its home turf . mirroring the sport 's wild growth across the atlantic at the time , hoops began mushrooming on playgrounds and schoolyards around the country - giving german kids their first opportunity to dribble a ball outside a gym .
in addition , lifestyle companies like nike and adidas took to sponsoring streetball tournaments in the bigger cities . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the mavericks ' nowitzki was 2007 mvp the era marked a high point in popularity for basketball in germany , when the number of people officially registered to play in basketball clubs reached around 200,000 , said dirk kaiser , spokesman for the german pro-basketball league , bundesliga basketball -lrb- bbl -rrb- . earlier start - but no follow-through but it seems a few summers flirting with a sport rooted deeply in us culture were not enough to win the undying love of soccer-mad germans . today , the number of registered players has receded to around 193,000 , although kaiser estimates about three to four times as many people - " potentially a million " - play streetball or in unregistered pickup games around the country . as a spectator sport , basketball is somewhere around third or fourth place , alongside ice hockey but well behind handball -lrb- number two -rrb- and miles out of the league of soccer , germany 's all-encompassing sports monolith . despite kids getting in touch with the sport at a much younger age than they used to , germany 's basketball federation " is n't doing a good job " of getting kids to go on to play in the clubs , said andre voigt , editor in chief of the german basketball magazine five .
in germany , competitive sports are much more closely tied to clubs than to schools . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : greece were euro champs , germany second , in 2005 " there are always polls of kids and their interests that show a great deal of interest in basketball .
often it even beats soccer .
but they are n't going on to play later , " voigt said .
" it 's a complex problem . " one major aspect of the problem is the lack of a strong domestic league with national basketball stars . " it 's obvious that kids interested in basketball today know more about the nba players than they do about the guys who play here , " voigt said . german-player quote - high enough ? in 2005 , the bbl tried to improve the situation by ruling that at least three of the 12 players on the roster have to be germans .
voigt called the quota " kind of low , " saying that court time in the pro leagues is necessary for germans to develop enough home-grown talent to field good national teams for european championships .
otherwise germany could n't hold its own against more basketball oriented countries like greece or spain . but more worrisome than keeping german players active , is the question of how to keep the teams alive at all . earlier this month , the cologne 99ers announced bankruptcy , despite a string of successes .
the move came after the team 's corporate sponsor , rhineenergie , pulled its support and a private financier failed to come through with enough cash to carry the team . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : is there life after bankruptcy in basketball ?
likewise , pharmaceutical giant bayer announced it would cease funding any pro teams except soccer , leaving its giants basketball players searching for a new owner .
and teams in ulm and giessen are both facing shaky futures because of sponsorship problems .
catch-22 sponsorship debacle the problem of sponsorship is , in fact , a tricky one .
sponsors see sports teams as a marketing vehicle , ideally to reach television audience .
but german free tv does n't carry league basketball play ; it is found either on pay channels or the internet .
so big sponsors drop out , pulling support from the teams , in turn weakening the sport , which then lowers the chances of having a strong following . and the cycle continues .
german national team coach dirk bauermann told the european basketball association , fiba , that the tv issue is " a huge concern . "
" if we do n't find ways to get in free television , we 're going to continue to lose sponsors , " he told the fiba web site .
it would be a " tragedy " if the league were to lose such established winning clubs as leverkusen and köln , he said .
' they 've got to go after the kids ' five 's voigt acknowledged that the tv coverage situation is a problem , but thinks that a little time , and some smart moves by german basketball organizations , could fix things in the long run .
" i do n't think the basketball associations should be trying to sway 20- and 30-year olds .
they 've got to go after the kids .
they have to go into the schools and grab the seven and eight year olds , and let them know how beautiful the sport is , " voigt said .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : cologne 's team was doing well when its support got pulled " if we get kids to play in bigger numbers than now , then we 'll generate better players , more viewers , get more people engaged , and more sponsors , " he added .
" this will take more than two or three years .
but it 's the only way to improve the situation in the long run . "

nowitzki , a seven-foot -lrb- 2.1-meter -rrb- power forward for the us national basketball association 's dallas mavericks , was voted the league 's most valuable player in 2007 .
germany should be making more of the fact that the man nicknamed the " bavarian bomber " was born and bred in wuerzburg , voigt said .
" he is the last global sports icon we have , now that boris becker left tennis and michael schumacher left racing , " said voigt .

catch-22 sponsorship debacle the problem of sponsorship is , in fact , a tricky one .
sponsors see sports teams as a marketing vehicle , ideally to reach television audience .

so big sponsors drop out , pulling support from the teams , in turn weakening the sport , which then lowers the chances of having a strong following . and the cycle continues .
german national team coach dirk bauermann told the european basketball association , fiba , that the tv issue is " a huge concern . "
" if we do n't find ways to get in free television , we 're going to continue to lose sponsors , " he told the fiba web site .
it would be a " tragedy " if the league were to lose such established winning clubs as leverkusen and köln , he said .

" i do n't think the basketball associations should be trying to sway 20- and 30-year olds .
they 've got to go after the kids .
they have to go into the schools and grab the seven and eight year olds , and let them know how beautiful the sport is , " voigt said .

but it 's the only way to improve the situation in the long run . "
missing the boat on nowitzki ?
some critics say top basketball officials are missing a golden opportunity to win converts by failing to adequately exploit germany 's most important basketball resource : dirk nowitzki .
nowitzki , a seven-foot -lrb- 2.1-meter -rrb- power forward for the us national basketball association 's dallas mavericks , was voted the league 's most valuable player in 2007 .
germany should be making more of the fact that the man nicknamed the " bavarian bomber " was born and bred in wuerzburg , voigt said .
" he is the last global sports icon we have , now that boris becker left tennis and michael schumacher left racing , " said voigt .
" everyone knows about him - that 's he 's very tall , a great athlete , and he earns a lot of money . "

in addition , lifestyle companies like nike and adidas took to sponsoring streetball tournaments in the bigger cities . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the mavericks ' nowitzki was 2007 mvp the era marked a high point in popularity for basketball in germany , when the number of people officially registered to play in basketball clubs reached around 200,000 , said dirk kaiser , spokesman for the german pro-basketball league , bundesliga basketball -lrb- bbl -rrb- . earlier start - but no follow-through but it seems a few summers flirting with a sport rooted deeply in us culture were not enough to win the undying love of soccer-mad germans . today , the number of registered players has receded to around 193,000 , although kaiser estimates about three to four times as many people - " potentially a million " - play streetball or in unregistered pickup games around the country . as a spectator sport , basketball is somewhere around third or fourth place , alongside ice hockey but well behind handball -lrb- number two -rrb- and miles out of the league of soccer , germany 's all-encompassing sports monolith . despite kids getting in touch with the sport at a much younger age than they used to , germany 's basketball federation " is n't doing a good job " of getting kids to go on to play in the clubs , said andre voigt , editor in chief of the german basketball magazine five .
in germany , competitive sports are much more closely tied to clubs than to schools . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : greece were euro champs , germany second , in 2005 " there are always polls of kids and their interests that show a great deal of interest in basketball .
often it even beats soccer .
but they are n't going on to play later , " voigt said .
" it 's a complex problem . " one major aspect of the problem is the lack of a strong domestic league with national basketball stars . " it 's obvious that kids interested in basketball today know more about the nba players than they do about the guys who play here , " voigt said . german-player quote - high enough ? in 2005 , the bbl tried to improve the situation by ruling that at least three of the 12 players on the roster have to be germans .
voigt called the quota " kind of low , " saying that court time in the pro leagues is necessary for germans to develop enough home-grown talent to field good national teams for european championships .
otherwise germany could n't hold its own against more basketball oriented countries like greece or spain . but more worrisome than keeping german players active , is the question of how to keep the teams alive at all . earlier this month , the cologne 99ers announced bankruptcy , despite a string of successes .
the move came after the team 's corporate sponsor , rhineenergie , pulled its support and a private financier failed to come through with enough cash to carry the team . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : is there life after bankruptcy in basketball ?
likewise , pharmaceutical giant bayer announced it would cease funding any pro teams except soccer , leaving its giants basketball players searching for a new owner .
and teams in ulm and giessen are both facing shaky futures because of sponsorship problems .
catch-22 sponsorship debacle the problem of sponsorship is , in fact , a tricky one .
sponsors see sports teams as a marketing vehicle , ideally to reach television audience .
but german free tv does n't carry league basketball play ; it is found either on pay channels or the internet .
so big sponsors drop out , pulling support from the teams , in turn weakening the sport , which then lowers the chances of having a strong following . and the cycle continues .
german national team coach dirk bauermann told the european basketball association , fiba , that the tv issue is " a huge concern . "
" if we do n't find ways to get in free television , we 're going to continue to lose sponsors , " he told the fiba web site .
it would be a " tragedy " if the league were to lose such established winning clubs as leverkusen and köln , he said .
' they 've got to go after the kids ' five 's voigt acknowledged that the tv coverage situation is a problem , but thinks that a little time , and some smart moves by german basketball organizations , could fix things in the long run .
" i do n't think the basketball associations should be trying to sway 20- and 30-year olds .
they 've got to go after the kids .
they have to go into the schools and grab the seven and eight year olds , and let them know how beautiful the sport is , " voigt said .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : cologne 's team was doing well when its support got pulled " if we get kids to play in bigger numbers than now , then we 'll generate better players , more viewers , get more people engaged , and more sponsors , " he added .
" this will take more than two or three years .
but it 's the only way to improve the situation in the long run . "
missing the boat on nowitzki ?
some critics say top basketball officials are missing a golden opportunity to win converts by failing to adequately exploit germany 's most important basketball resource : dirk nowitzki .
nowitzki , a seven-foot -lrb- 2.1-meter -rrb- power forward for the us national basketball association 's dallas mavericks , was voted the league 's most valuable player in 2007 .
germany should be making more of the fact that the man nicknamed the " bavarian bomber " was born and bred in wuerzburg , voigt said .
" he is the last global sports icon we have , now that boris becker left tennis and michael schumacher left racing , " said voigt .
" everyone knows about him - that 's he 's very tall , a great athlete , and he earns a lot of money . "
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : in summer , nowitzki plays for the german national team nowitzki does come to germany in the summers , to play for the german national team at the european championships , which are run under the aegis of the german basketball federation -lrb- dbb -rrb- .
the biggest problem with making him a full-time ambassador for basketball in germany is time , bbl 's kaiser said .
" there 's only so much he can do in a couple of months , and he has to be careful not to do too much .
i think the german basketball federation does as much with him as they can , " he said . jennifer abramsohn send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

all this , of course , is mainly within the capital of nairobi .
the rest of the country remains in a state of fear of reprisal killings , police brutality and the overpowering dread that this is not the last time this will happen in this country .
the daily beheadings , burnings and rapes of people caught in the wrong ethnic region of the country have - as far as reporting is concerned - almost come to an end .
however , a number of eyewitness stories that i have been told still tell of random killings by both civilian-formed militias as well as by the police themselves .
this can only make one fear that the real number of deaths within the country , currently estimated around 1,000 , falls extremely short .
against this backdrop of returning normality and the low-level conflicts and killings pervasive within the rest of the country , outside of nairobi and mombassa , the kofi annan-sponsored reconciliation talks have been taking place and have made remarkably rapid and relatively painless progress towards resolving the crisis .
the real test of this ' almost resolution ' is yet to come along with kenya 's greatest ordeal : the challenging of its idea of nationhood , reconciliation and , above all , its humanity .
there is every chance that the annan discussions will lead to a short-term solution to the electoral crisis of last year and a power-sharing government of national unity , or some other form of interim government , will be formed and posts suitably allocated to the various aggrieved parties .
however , a number of critical issues from the past - and for the future - raise fundamental questions about the stability of any potential interim government and the real prospects for peace and stability within the country .
raila odinga , the losing presidential candidate from the december elections and main protagonist within the current crisis , has already been in a coalition once before with mwai kibaki , the current president of kenya .
that time the coalition was made through common cause and mutual agreement rather than being resentfully forced through .
even so , the partnership between odinga and kibaki lasted only a matter of months prior to odinga withdrawing from the government over accusations of betrayals of faith on previous agreements on power-sharing .
this shared history does not bode well for the stability of the government to come .
and it could be expected that the 10th parliament , which is just forming , will be precarious at best , with various people and parties just biding their time and resources until the next fight for ultimate control .
if any real , lasting peace is to be achieved in kenya , serious constitutional review will need to take place that allows for a fairer and devolved system of government .
the constitution has been revised several times over the last few decades , most of which applied to the consolidation of power within the presidency and the ruling party .
however , a constitutional review was carried out during the last two parliaments , with wide-spread consultations and formal deliberations , which , in the end , came to nothing .
as a result , the concentration of power remains with the presidency .
one of the main problems with the previous attempt to revise and reinvigorate the constitution was the insistence that the changes should be open to a public referendum .
although there was some civic education carried out during this previous process , the time and information required by constituents to make an informed decision on issues as complex as constitutional amendments , when they have been completely and actively excluded from the process of governance for the history of the country , was both immense and very time consuming .
neither of which was taken into account during the process .
the vote in the end became a protest against the sitting government rather than on any real understanding and appreciation of the content of the amendments , much in the same way as the french voted on the eu constitution .
the balkanization of the country stemming from the post-election violence will only exacerbate this issue , with a growing body of people rejecting their kenyan identity in favor of tribal allegiances and support for the politicians that represent that tribe .
a growing number of middle-class families are taking their children out of the boarding schools around nairobi and moving them back to their home areas , where protection is more assured when things go wrong .
this , along with middle-class houses in nairobi being threatened during the previous riots in the city because they were owned by the " wrong tribe " as perceived by the passing hordes as they streamed out of the slums deep inside the city , only accentuates this perception of an " us and them " mentality within the country .
the annan process and the coalition government have talked about the need for constitutional reform again as part of the longer-term assurance of stability within the country .
if these issues of the growing fractionalization and tribalism of the country , combined with the poor civic education process on the core issues of the constitutional reform process , are not resolved , then any voting in a referendum can only be , at best , based on what their political leaders tell them is best or worst for their tribe alone .
this can only be exacerbated by the inherent instability of the upcoming interim government as tribal priorities and past resentments form the major part of the daily operations of the parliament .
so what are the prospects for peace in kenya ?
slim at best .
the next year will be the defining period , where the country either finds its purpose again to come out of this as a stronger more cohesive nation or it slips further into the quagmire of tribal chauvinism and towards a dictatorship or a failed state .
i hope for the former , but i 'm not holding my breath .

and it could be expected that the 10th parliament , which is just forming , will be precarious at best , with various people and parties just biding their time and resources until the next fight for ultimate control .
if any real , lasting peace is to be achieved in kenya , serious constitutional review will need to take place that allows for a fairer and devolved system of government .
the constitution has been revised several times over the last few decades , most of which applied to the consolidation of power within the presidency and the ruling party .
however , a constitutional review was carried out during the last two parliaments , with wide-spread consultations and formal deliberations , which , in the end , came to nothing .
as a result , the concentration of power remains with the presidency .
one of the main problems with the previous attempt to revise and reinvigorate the constitution was the insistence that the changes should be open to a public referendum .
although there was some civic education carried out during this previous process , the time and information required by constituents to make an informed decision on issues as complex as constitutional amendments , when they have been completely and actively excluded from the process of governance for the history of the country , was both immense and very time consuming .
neither of which was taken into account during the process .
the vote in the end became a protest against the sitting government rather than on any real understanding and appreciation of the content of the amendments , much in the same way as the french voted on the eu constitution .
the balkanization of the country stemming from the post-election violence will only exacerbate this issue , with a growing body of people rejecting their kenyan identity in favor of tribal allegiances and support for the politicians that represent that tribe .
a growing number of middle-class families are taking their children out of the boarding schools around nairobi and moving them back to their home areas , where protection is more assured when things go wrong .
this , along with middle-class houses in nairobi being threatened during the previous riots in the city because they were owned by the " wrong tribe " as perceived by the passing hordes as they streamed out of the slums deep inside the city , only accentuates this perception of an " us and them " mentality within the country .
the annan process and the coalition government have talked about the need for constitutional reform again as part of the longer-term assurance of stability within the country .
if these issues of the growing fractionalization and tribalism of the country , combined with the poor civic education process on the core issues of the constitutional reform process , are not resolved , then any voting in a referendum can only be , at best , based on what their political leaders tell them is best or worst for their tribe alone .
this can only be exacerbated by the inherent instability of the upcoming interim government as tribal priorities and past resentments form the major part of the daily operations of the parliament .
so what are the prospects for peace in kenya ?
slim at best .
the next year will be the defining period , where the country either finds its purpose again to come out of this as a stronger more cohesive nation or it slips further into the quagmire of tribal chauvinism and towards a dictatorship or a failed state .
i hope for the former , but i 'm not holding my breath .

all this , of course , is mainly within the capital of nairobi .
the rest of the country remains in a state of fear of reprisal killings , police brutality and the overpowering dread that this is not the last time this will happen in this country .
the daily beheadings , burnings and rapes of people caught in the wrong ethnic region of the country have - as far as reporting is concerned - almost come to an end .
however , a number of eyewitness stories that i have been told still tell of random killings by both civilian-formed militias as well as by the police themselves .
this can only make one fear that the real number of deaths within the country , currently estimated around 1,000 , falls extremely short .
against this backdrop of returning normality and the low-level conflicts and killings pervasive within the rest of the country , outside of nairobi and mombassa , the kofi annan-sponsored reconciliation talks have been taking place and have made remarkably rapid and relatively painless progress towards resolving the crisis .
the real test of this ' almost resolution ' is yet to come along with kenya 's greatest ordeal : the challenging of its idea of nationhood , reconciliation and , above all , its humanity .
there is every chance that the annan discussions will lead to a short-term solution to the electoral crisis of last year and a power-sharing government of national unity , or some other form of interim government , will be formed and posts suitably allocated to the various aggrieved parties .
however , a number of critical issues from the past - and for the future - raise fundamental questions about the stability of any potential interim government and the real prospects for peace and stability within the country .
raila odinga , the losing presidential candidate from the december elections and main protagonist within the current crisis , has already been in a coalition once before with mwai kibaki , the current president of kenya .
that time the coalition was made through common cause and mutual agreement rather than being resentfully forced through .
even so , the partnership between odinga and kibaki lasted only a matter of months prior to odinga withdrawing from the government over accusations of betrayals of faith on previous agreements on power-sharing .

15 . " the german government today accepted mr. zumwinkel 's offer to resign , " chancellor angela merkel told reporters in berlin .
" i consider this to be in unavoidable step considering what has happened . " zumwinkel , who is suspected of evading 1 million euros -lrb- $ 1.5 million -rrb- worth of taxes through a foundation in liechtenstein , also stepped down from his position on the supervisory board of deutsche telekom , the government spokesmen indicated . " in a large number of cases , key personalities from our country sought to avoid their duty of solidarity via taxation by practicing fiscal evasion to liechtenstein , " a finance ministry spokesman told reporters the daily sueddeutsche zeitung said in editions to appear saturday that some 3.4 billion euros was involved . albig urged those involved to file corrected returns detailing their tax evasion - a device known as " self-reporting " under german law and aimed at allowing offenders to reduce possible penalties . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the future looks bleak the financial times deutschland wrote that it was unlikely that zumwinkel would take a seat on the deutsche post group 's supervisory board , as would normally have been the case when his contract expired in november .
he has been head of deutsche post for 18 years . corporate elite under scrutiny the issue of tax breaks , massive salaries and corporate " extras " for high-powered german executives has come to a head in recent months , with increasing numbers of politicians joining in the growing public furor over the perceived immunity and privileges enjoyed by the country 's business elite . the german population , which places a high value on social and financial probity , was already shocked last year by scandals at two industrial titans , the engineering giant siemens and the biggest european car maker , volkswagen . german finance minister peer steinbrueck admitted the investigation was damaging the already shaky state of public confidence . " the moral damage is considerable - just as it was with his dealing with his share options , " steinbrueck told a group of journalists on his way into parliament . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : after being held by police , zumwinkel was later released in a controversial move , zumwinkel sold 200,000 share options worth 2.24 million euros in december just after deutsche post 's share price rose following a deal to introduce a minimum wage that would affect lower-cost rivals .
he later said his actions were a regrettable mistake . " if the public has something like this as a role model then they 'll start having doubts about this economic and social system , " steinbrueck added .
" i did n't think this was possible . " peter struck , the leader of the social democratic parliamentary faction , added : " when someone has so much money and nevertheless believes there is a need to hide money from the state , then a lot of people will believe there is a lack of justice .
the ordinary taxpayer has to pay his taxes to the tax office . " merkel 's spokesman , ulrich wilhelm , said the chancellor regretted the fact that zumwinkel had not made a public statement on his position since police raided his home and office at dawn on thursday . wilhelm said the highly publicized scandal would be discussed when merkel meets liechtenstein prime minister otmar halser on wednesday . german police searched zumwinkel 's villa in western cologne and deutsche post 's headquarters in bonn as the tax probe became public . the chief executive was taken under police escort from his home in the upmarket marienburg part of cologne to the prosecutors ' office in the city of bochum some five hours after the raids .
investigators also removed boxes from the house . after zumwinkel had posted what prosecutors described as " a not inconsiderable bond , " an arrest warrant was lifted and he was allowed to leave . investigation may unearth other big names bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : whose tax returns will be next to come under scrutiny ?

good food does n't just keep the crew fit but also improves their motivation , the esa said . in keeping with that principle , the astronauts had requested stronger flavors and more soups and meat dishes because life on the sterile space station diminished the sense of smell and taste . taking his inspiration from southern germany 's hearty cuisine , wohlfahrt has concocted a special space menu .
for starters , there 's a potato soup with chunks of black pudding followed by filet of veal and vegetables in a balsamic vinegar sauce , accompanied by a puree of white beans .
the delectable-sounding meal is rounded by a compote of black forest plums with an aniseed sauce for dessert . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : it 's difficult to taste much in this position and sterile surroundings alas , the region 's famous wines wo n't make it on to the menu since alcohol is banned on the iss .
instead , there will be juice in a powder form that the crew will need to dilute with water .
the elaborate grub will be filled in metal jars and the first load will be shot into space in march next year . wohlfahrt , 52 , however , wo n't be serving the food himself .
" no thanks .

otherwise , things could get ugly . the resignation serves as a confession : klaus zumwinkel realized that he could not remain ceo of one of germany 's largest companies and decided to face the consequences .
he did n't have a choice . it goes without saying that he has to give up his position at the top if he funneled money into liechtenstein 's tax paradise and did n't report the interest he 'd earned .
it 's called tax evasion . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : technically , he 's considered innocent until found guilty in a court of law or until he has made a formal confession , but it 's becoming more and more apparent that the evidence collected so far is just the tip of the iceberg . post chief is one of many several hundred wealthy germans , some of them celebrities , have also invested money in liechtenstein and hidden it from the german tax authorities .
now they have a big problem , too . klaus zumwinkel himself became the tip of the iceberg when the other tax evaders came under the radar of the public prosecutor 's office .
the alpine principality 's tax saving model is not quite as secure as many had thought .
the secrets at the large baronial bank have been cracked and officials have known for months who has money there and how much - including in the so-called family endowments . now the investigations have begun .
over the next few weeks , police and public prosecutors will pay visits to many of the tax evaders .
zumwinkel is merely the first of many . sympathy is not in order .
we 're not talking about the poorest of the poor but mainly about people who , even after properly paying their taxes , could still afford a hot lunch . greed conquered reason zumwinkel is n't the only one asking how it could come to this .
the answer is simple : greed was stronger than reason .
zumwinkel certainly did n't need to do what he did .
as the head of deutsche post , he not only collected an annual salary of 3.5 million euros -lrb- $ 5.1 million -rrb- but had also inherited a large sum of money at a young age . he would be wealthy even if he had paid the taxes he owed , just slightly less wealthy .
that 's also true of most of the others who will soon receive visits from the authorities .
none of them is poor ; rather they 're among the richest members of society - of the very society that made it possible for them to become as affluent as they are . if they have any brains at all , they should come out of hiding as soon as possible .
the german tax authorities are n't interested in punishment or even revenge - they just want the tax money owed to them .
that means that those who turn themselves in to the tax office and pay the missing taxes with interest before they 're investigated will get off without penalty . fine is least of the worries the tax evaders that do n't do this will have to face the full rigor of the law - and rightly so .
it 's always the wealthier part of society that complains about high taxes and takes advantage of every opportunity to reduce their own tax burden , either by legal means or illegally via liechtenstein . zumwinkel 's case - and the many more cases that are likely to follow in the coming weeks - shows what the outcome can be .
his reputation is ruined , his job has been lost and a hefty penalty is looming .
he and the others can consider themselves lucky if they get off with merely a fine and not a prison sentence . karl zawadzky is dw-radio 's business editor -lrb- kjb -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de opinion -pipe- 15.02.2008 opinion : kenya solutions threaten to repeat historical mistakes großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the proposals put forward by former un secretary general kofi annan to stabilize kenya may focus on cooperation and compromise , but the real roots of the problem are being ignored , said dw guest commentator allan duncan . a month has passed since the current troubles in kenya began and some sense of normality is now returning to the country ; people are returning to work , schools are reopening and the rush hour traffic jams are coming back .
all this , of course , is mainly within the capital of nairobi .
the rest of the country remains in a state of fear of reprisal killings , police brutality and the overpowering dread that this is not the last time this will happen in this country .
the daily beheadings , burnings and rapes of people caught in the wrong ethnic region of the country have - as far as reporting is concerned - almost come to an end .
however , a number of eyewitness stories that i have been told still tell of random killings by both civilian-formed militias as well as by the police themselves .
this can only make one fear that the real number of deaths within the country , currently estimated around 1,000 , falls extremely short .
against this backdrop of returning normality and the low-level conflicts and killings pervasive within the rest of the country , outside of nairobi and mombassa , the kofi annan-sponsored reconciliation talks have been taking place and have made remarkably rapid and relatively painless progress towards resolving the crisis .
the real test of this ' almost resolution ' is yet to come along with kenya 's greatest ordeal : the challenging of its idea of nationhood , reconciliation and , above all , its humanity .
there is every chance that the annan discussions will lead to a short-term solution to the electoral crisis of last year and a power-sharing government of national unity , or some other form of interim government , will be formed and posts suitably allocated to the various aggrieved parties .
however , a number of critical issues from the past - and for the future - raise fundamental questions about the stability of any potential interim government and the real prospects for peace and stability within the country .
raila odinga , the losing presidential candidate from the december elections and main protagonist within the current crisis , has already been in a coalition once before with mwai kibaki , the current president of kenya .
that time the coalition was made through common cause and mutual agreement rather than being resentfully forced through .
even so , the partnership between odinga and kibaki lasted only a matter of months prior to odinga withdrawing from the government over accusations of betrayals of faith on previous agreements on power-sharing .
this shared history does not bode well for the stability of the government to come .
and it could be expected that the 10th parliament , which is just forming , will be precarious at best , with various people and parties just biding their time and resources until the next fight for ultimate control .
if any real , lasting peace is to be achieved in kenya , serious constitutional review will need to take place that allows for a fairer and devolved system of government .
the constitution has been revised several times over the last few decades , most of which applied to the consolidation of power within the presidency and the ruling party .
however , a constitutional review was carried out during the last two parliaments , with wide-spread consultations and formal deliberations , which , in the end , came to nothing .
as a result , the concentration of power remains with the presidency .
one of the main problems with the previous attempt to revise and reinvigorate the constitution was the insistence that the changes should be open to a public referendum .
although there was some civic education carried out during this previous process , the time and information required by constituents to make an informed decision on issues as complex as constitutional amendments , when they have been completely and actively excluded from the process of governance for the history of the country , was both immense and very time consuming .
neither of which was taken into account during the process .
the vote in the end became a protest against the sitting government rather than on any real understanding and appreciation of the content of the amendments , much in the same way as the french voted on the eu constitution .
the balkanization of the country stemming from the post-election violence will only exacerbate this issue , with a growing body of people rejecting their kenyan identity in favor of tribal allegiances and support for the politicians that represent that tribe .
a growing number of middle-class families are taking their children out of the boarding schools around nairobi and moving them back to their home areas , where protection is more assured when things go wrong .
this , along with middle-class houses in nairobi being threatened during the previous riots in the city because they were owned by the " wrong tribe " as perceived by the passing hordes as they streamed out of the slums deep inside the city , only accentuates this perception of an " us and them " mentality within the country .
the annan process and the coalition government have talked about the need for constitutional reform again as part of the longer-term assurance of stability within the country .
if these issues of the growing fractionalization and tribalism of the country , combined with the poor civic education process on the core issues of the constitutional reform process , are not resolved , then any voting in a referendum can only be , at best , based on what their political leaders tell them is best or worst for their tribe alone .
this can only be exacerbated by the inherent instability of the upcoming interim government as tribal priorities and past resentments form the major part of the daily operations of the parliament .
so what are the prospects for peace in kenya ?
slim at best .
the next year will be the defining period , where the country either finds its purpose again to come out of this as a stronger more cohesive nation or it slips further into the quagmire of tribal chauvinism and towards a dictatorship or a failed state .
i hope for the former , but i 'm not holding my breath .

but concern is mounting that the nato mission could fail entirely . german chancellor angela merkel 's government will begin discussing the future role of germany in afghanistan next week .
and speculation abounds that the government plans to increase the number of troops in afghanistan when the current mandate runs out in october .
one member of parliament who requested anonymity told reuters that top politicians in the germany 's ruling coalition will begin discussing changes to the current mission next week .
it was not clear whether or by how much the number of troops would increase .
" it 's too early to speculate on what a new mandate might look like , " guenter gloser , a minister of state in the german foreign ministry , said .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : germany has said it wo n't send more troops media reports have speculated that germany could send 500 to 1,000 additional soldiers and could also increase the geographical area where they are deployed within afghanistan .
the government has denied these reports .
germany 's existing mandate allows for up to 3,500 soldiers to work out of the relatively peaceful northern part of the country .
berlin is under pressure from the united states and other nato allies to take a more active role in the southern part of the country .
germany recently promised about 200 combat troops as part of a quick response force .
limited mandate many european countries have been reluctant to commit more troops to the mission in afghanistan .
at a nato meeting in vilnius last week france , romania , poland and norway signaled they could increase their participation .
yet this was hardly the level of support hoped for by the us .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : german public opinion is strongly anti-war more than six years have passed since the us brought down the taliban regime in an effort to put an end to al qaeda .
while the taliban has been ousted from power , it remains strong , particularly in the south of the country where it controls many roads and runs its own checkpoints .
nato 's international security assistance force -lrb- isaf -rrb- has quadrupled to 43,000 troops in four years .
us undersecretary of state nicholas burns said in a speech earlier this week that nine of nato 's members were carrying 95 percent of the burden in afghanistan .
nato needs all help it can get yet isaf lacks troops and equipment which is " hurting military efforts to defeat the enemy , " burns said .
" nato never fought a ground war until the afghanistan war , " burns said .
" nato 's future is so much on the line . "
britain 's paddy ashdown , a former united nations envoy to bosnia who withdrew as a " super envoy " to afghanistan , said defeat is a possibility for nato .
forces there are in disarray and the security situation is deteriorating , ashdown wrote in a financial times opinion piece published wednesday , feb .

bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : there have been calls for better coordination britain feels maxed out with 7,800 troops in afghanistan and 4,500 in iraq .
canada and the netherlands , which also have troops in southern afghanistan , have suffered too many casualties and have domestic resistance to increasing troops .
that has increased pressure on france and germany , neither of which has troops in the south .
it 's thought that merkel and france 's nicolas sarkozy will want to bring promises of additional troops to a nato summit in bucharest in april .
" super envoy " badly needed the us 's burns also said it was necessary for the un to speedily appoint a strong " super envoy " with a centralized mandate .
a " super envoy " would coordinate military , aid and development activities which are seen as important to counter insurgency .
ashdown withdrew his name after afghan president hamid karzai opposed the appointment .
un and nato sources expect it to take weeks to find a viable substitute . dw staff -lrb- th -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

otherwise , things could get ugly . the resignation serves as a confession : klaus zumwinkel realized that he could not remain ceo of one of germany 's largest companies and decided to face the consequences .
he did n't have a choice . it goes without saying that he has to give up his position at the top if he funneled money into liechtenstein 's tax paradise and did n't report the interest he 'd earned .
it 's called tax evasion . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : technically , he 's considered innocent until found guilty in a court of law or until he has made a formal confession , but it 's becoming more and more apparent that the evidence collected so far is just the tip of the iceberg . post chief is one of many several hundred wealthy germans , some of them celebrities , have also invested money in liechtenstein and hidden it from the german tax authorities .
now they have a big problem , too . klaus zumwinkel himself became the tip of the iceberg when the other tax evaders came under the radar of the public prosecutor 's office .
the alpine principality 's tax saving model is not quite as secure as many had thought .
the secrets at the large baronial bank have been cracked and officials have known for months who has money there and how much - including in the so-called family endowments . now the investigations have begun .
over the next few weeks , police and public prosecutors will pay visits to many of the tax evaders .
zumwinkel is merely the first of many . sympathy is not in order .
we 're not talking about the poorest of the poor but mainly about people who , even after properly paying their taxes , could still afford a hot lunch . greed conquered reason zumwinkel is n't the only one asking how it could come to this .
the answer is simple : greed was stronger than reason .
zumwinkel certainly did n't need to do what he did .
as the head of deutsche post , he not only collected an annual salary of 3.5 million euros -lrb- $ 5.1 million -rrb- but had also inherited a large sum of money at a young age . he would be wealthy even if he had paid the taxes he owed , just slightly less wealthy .
that 's also true of most of the others who will soon receive visits from the authorities .
none of them is poor ; rather they 're among the richest members of society - of the very society that made it possible for them to become as affluent as they are . if they have any brains at all , they should come out of hiding as soon as possible .
the german tax authorities are n't interested in punishment or even revenge - they just want the tax money owed to them .
that means that those who turn themselves in to the tax office and pay the missing taxes with interest before they 're investigated will get off without penalty . fine is least of the worries the tax evaders that do n't do this will have to face the full rigor of the law - and rightly so .
it 's always the wealthier part of society that complains about high taxes and takes advantage of every opportunity to reduce their own tax burden , either by legal means or illegally via liechtenstein . zumwinkel 's case - and the many more cases that are likely to follow in the coming weeks - shows what the outcome can be .
his reputation is ruined , his job has been lost and a hefty penalty is looming .
he and the others can consider themselves lucky if they get off with merely a fine and not a prison sentence . karl zawadzky is dw-radio 's business editor -lrb- kjb -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

hamburg and bremen looked best in their matches . while sv hamburg and werder bremen won their matches , bayern munich and bayer leverkusen drew away from home and nuremberg lost on a single goal . hamburg came out 3-1 winners at fc zurich on thursday , feb .
14 , in their first-leg match of the tournament 's knock-out stage . a first-half goal by david jarolim and second-half strikes from ivica olic and piotr trochowski put hamburg on the road to a comfortable victory . hamburg lost dutch midfielder rafael van der vaart who limped off with an ankle injury in the 33rd minute to be replaced by jose guerrero . the peru striker then set up the opening two goals in the 33rd and 67th minutes and earned the foul which led to trochowski scoring with a direct free-kick in the 77th . zurich notched a consolation three minutes from time when a shot by andres vasquez was fumbled onto the inside of the post by keeper frank rost and irish referee alan kelly ruled the ball had crossed the line . bremen waltz to a comfortable win werder bremen enjoyed a 3-0 home win over portugal 's braga in their opening knock-out round match on wednesday . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : bremen cruised to a win against the portuguese goalkeeper tim wiese saved two penalties while first-half goals from naldo and daniel jensen and a penalty by hugo almeida sealed a comfortable win for the german side . naldo put bremen in front after just four minutes with a long-range shot before wiese saved a roland linz spot kick to maintain bremen 's lead . jensen doubled werder 's advantage on 27 minutes with a shot from outside the penalty area before wiese once again saved a penalty , this time from jorginho nine minutes later .
almeida completed the scoring with virtually the last kick of the game after joao pereira handled in the area . " when we get penalties we have to convert them , " said braga 's linz afterwards .
" now it will be really tough for us in the return leg . " bayern struggle to keep scots in check bundesliga leaders bayern munich twice came from behind to draw 2-2 with scottish side aberdeen .
goals from miroslav klose and hamit altintop put bayern into a strong position for the return leg in munich next week . however the four-time european champions were made to fight all the way by a spirited aberdeen side depleted by injuries . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : klose helped bayern stay in touch with aberdeen " it 's quite normal that when you play internationally - a team like aberdeen can play above themselves , " bayern coach ottmar hitzfeld said .
" a 2-2 draw away from home in europe used to be like a victory .
we never think about losing in munich . " aberdeen were hoping to repeat a quarter-final win over the bundesliga leaders 25 years ago on their way to lifting the european cup winners ' cup . they took a surprise lead in the 24th minute when josh walker rifled in a shot from more than 20 meters . bayern had already missed chances , but klose made no mistake with a shot on the turn into the roof of the net five minutes later . aberdeen went back in front when sone aluko beat michael rensing - in goal for the flu-ridden oliver kahn - with a low shot from inside the area three minutes before half-time . bayern again leveled after a ze roberto cross struck alan maybury on the arm and spanish referee eduardo iturralde gonzalez awarded a penalty .
altintop 's 54th-minute spot-kick was parried by jamie langfield but the turkey international followed up to make sure at the second chance . nuremberg and leverkusen face harder tasks nuremberg slipped to a 1-0 defeat to portugal 's benfica in lisbon on wednesday , sunk by ariza makukula 's 43rd-minute winner . it was the first game in charge for thomas von heesen , who replaced the sacked hans meyer on monday . also on wednesday , bayer leverkusen earned a goalless draw at turkish side galatasaray . dw staff -lrb- nda -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

but aficionados say it 's the system , not the sport , that 's at fault . just over a decade ago , things were looking up for basketball in germany .
at the 1992 olympics in barcelona , coverage focused on the us " dream team , " which featured an assembly of all-time b-ball greats including michael jordan , magic johnson , larry bird and charles barkley .
just a year later , the german men 's team caused a sensation when it won the european championship on its home turf . mirroring the sport 's wild growth across the atlantic at the time , hoops began mushrooming on playgrounds and schoolyards around the country - giving german kids their first opportunity to dribble a ball outside a gym .
in addition , lifestyle companies like nike and adidas took to sponsoring streetball tournaments in the bigger cities . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the mavericks ' nowitzki was 2007 mvp the era marked a high point in popularity for basketball in germany , when the number of people officially registered to play in basketball clubs reached around 200,000 , said dirk kaiser , spokesman for the german pro-basketball league , bundesliga basketball -lrb- bbl -rrb- . earlier start - but no follow-through but it seems a few summers flirting with a sport rooted deeply in us culture were not enough to win the undying love of soccer-mad germans . today , the number of registered players has receded to around 193,000 , although kaiser estimates about three to four times as many people - " potentially a million " - play streetball or in unregistered pickup games around the country . as a spectator sport , basketball is somewhere around third or fourth place , alongside ice hockey but well behind handball -lrb- number two -rrb- and miles out of the league of soccer , germany 's all-encompassing sports monolith . despite kids getting in touch with the sport at a much younger age than they used to , germany 's basketball federation " is n't doing a good job " of getting kids to go on to play in the clubs , said andre voigt , editor in chief of the german basketball magazine five .
in germany , competitive sports are much more closely tied to clubs than to schools . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : greece were euro champs , germany second , in 2005 " there are always polls of kids and their interests that show a great deal of interest in basketball .
often it even beats soccer .
but they are n't going on to play later , " voigt said .
" it 's a complex problem . " one major aspect of the problem is the lack of a strong domestic league with national basketball stars . " it 's obvious that kids interested in basketball today know more about the nba players than they do about the guys who play here , " voigt said . german-player quote - high enough ? in 2005 , the bbl tried to improve the situation by ruling that at least three of the 12 players on the roster have to be germans .
voigt called the quota " kind of low , " saying that court time in the pro leagues is necessary for germans to develop enough home-grown talent to field good national teams for european championships .
otherwise germany could n't hold its own against more basketball oriented countries like greece or spain . but more worrisome than keeping german players active , is the question of how to keep the teams alive at all . earlier this month , the cologne 99ers announced bankruptcy , despite a string of successes .
the move came after the team 's corporate sponsor , rhineenergie , pulled its support and a private financier failed to come through with enough cash to carry the team . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : is there life after bankruptcy in basketball ?
likewise , pharmaceutical giant bayer announced it would cease funding any pro teams except soccer , leaving its giants basketball players searching for a new owner .
and teams in ulm and giessen are both facing shaky futures because of sponsorship problems .
catch-22 sponsorship debacle the problem of sponsorship is , in fact , a tricky one .
sponsors see sports teams as a marketing vehicle , ideally to reach television audience .
but german free tv does n't carry league basketball play ; it is found either on pay channels or the internet .
so big sponsors drop out , pulling support from the teams , in turn weakening the sport , which then lowers the chances of having a strong following . and the cycle continues .
german national team coach dirk bauermann told the european basketball association , fiba , that the tv issue is " a huge concern . "
" if we do n't find ways to get in free television , we 're going to continue to lose sponsors , " he told the fiba web site .
it would be a " tragedy " if the league were to lose such established winning clubs as leverkusen and köln , he said .
' they 've got to go after the kids ' five 's voigt acknowledged that the tv coverage situation is a problem , but thinks that a little time , and some smart moves by german basketball organizations , could fix things in the long run .
" i do n't think the basketball associations should be trying to sway 20- and 30-year olds .
they 've got to go after the kids .
they have to go into the schools and grab the seven and eight year olds , and let them know how beautiful the sport is , " voigt said .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : cologne 's team was doing well when its support got pulled " if we get kids to play in bigger numbers than now , then we 'll generate better players , more viewers , get more people engaged , and more sponsors , " he added .
" this will take more than two or three years .
but it 's the only way to improve the situation in the long run . "
missing the boat on nowitzki ?
some critics say top basketball officials are missing a golden opportunity to win converts by failing to adequately exploit germany 's most important basketball resource : dirk nowitzki .
nowitzki , a seven-foot -lrb- 2.1-meter -rrb- power forward for the us national basketball association 's dallas mavericks , was voted the league 's most valuable player in 2007 .
germany should be making more of the fact that the man nicknamed the " bavarian bomber " was born and bred in wuerzburg , voigt said .
" he is the last global sports icon we have , now that boris becker left tennis and michael schumacher left racing , " said voigt .
" everyone knows about him - that 's he 's very tall , a great athlete , and he earns a lot of money . "
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : in summer , nowitzki plays for the german national team nowitzki does come to germany in the summers , to play for the german national team at the european championships , which are run under the aegis of the german basketball federation -lrb- dbb -rrb- .
the biggest problem with making him a full-time ambassador for basketball in germany is time , bbl 's kaiser said .
" there 's only so much he can do in a couple of months , and he has to be careful not to do too much .

sponsors see sports teams as a marketing vehicle , ideally to reach television audience .
but german free tv does n't carry league basketball play ; it is found either on pay channels or the internet .
so big sponsors drop out , pulling support from the teams , in turn weakening the sport , which then lowers the chances of having a strong following . and the cycle continues .
german national team coach dirk bauermann told the european basketball association , fiba , that the tv issue is " a huge concern . "
" if we do n't find ways to get in free television , we 're going to continue to lose sponsors , " he told the fiba web site .
it would be a " tragedy " if the league were to lose such established winning clubs as leverkusen and köln , he said .

" i do n't think the basketball associations should be trying to sway 20- and 30-year olds .

but it 's the only way to improve the situation in the long run . "
missing the boat on nowitzki ?
some critics say top basketball officials are missing a golden opportunity to win converts by failing to adequately exploit germany 's most important basketball resource : dirk nowitzki .
nowitzki , a seven-foot -lrb- 2.1-meter -rrb- power forward for the us national basketball association 's dallas mavericks , was voted the league 's most valuable player in 2007 .
germany should be making more of the fact that the man nicknamed the " bavarian bomber " was born and bred in wuerzburg , voigt said .
" he is the last global sports icon we have , now that boris becker left tennis and michael schumacher left racing , " said voigt .

steinmeier entrusted the job to erler . the nuts and bolts of power-sharing erler 's task was to explain the workings of merkel 's grand coalition between her center-right christian democrats and the social democrats , of which the minister is a member . " my visit was a surprise to all , " erler told german daily sueddeutsche zeitung on the last day of his mission .
" but then everyone was really interested and had a lot of questions . " erler said his job was to explain the complicated arithmetic underlying the power-sharing model in germany and how such a consensus-based system worked .
germany 's grand coalition came into being after federal elections in 2005 , ending two months of political uncertainty after merkel 's conservatives won a wafer-thin majority . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : erler said it kenyans need to see if the german political model could be adapted for nairobi " my job was to present the model so that the kenyans can see if a similar system could work for them , " erler said .
the minister had also brought along an english version of germany 's coalition agreement with him so that the kenyans could spend time studying it . though berlin has never had to deal with the levels of violence that followed kenya 's election last month , the grand coalition model is considered a useful one in deadlocked political situations .
erler is expected to back in berlin by friday . no quick answers to kenya 's problems kenya went through weeks of violence after kibaki 's party claimed victory in a dec .
27 poll that observers said was hugely flawed by rigging .
the crisis is estimated to have killed 1,000 people and made more than 300,000 homeless .
the turmoil has shattered kenya 's image as one of africa 's most stable democracies . experts have said that annan is impatient for progress and in favor of holding a new election and some form of shared government . kibaki and odinga have already missed a mid-february deadline set by annan to reach a political agreement .
the former un chief had said he wanted underlying problems including land and wealth disparities tackled in a year . annan said friday that an agreement that would put an end to political chaos was " very close " and added that he hoped that the " last difficult and frightening " step would be taken next week . other than annan , however , few expect kenya 's political deadlock to be resolved swiftly , saying the two sides have yet to strike a deal on the most contentious issue - the structure of the government . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : kibaki , center , shakes hands with opposition leader raila odinga , right , analysts have pointed out that division of cabinet and civil service jobs would likely be a source of wrangling between kibaki and odinga as well issues such as reforming the constitution and a new electoral law . " a power-sharing system in which the principal participants are deeply suspicious of each other is difficult enough to manage , " kenyan political columnist , macharia gaitho told news agency reuters . in a bid to shore up annan 's mission , us president george w. bush this week said secretary of state condoleezza rice will head to kenya to tell its leaders there must be a return to democracy . dw staff -lrb- sp -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de taxes -pipe- 15.02.2008 opinion : wealthy tax evaders should fess up großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : germany 's other affluent tax evaders should avoid the fate of deutsche post ceo klaus zumwinkel and turn themselves in to authorities , said dw 's karl zawadzky .
otherwise , things could get ugly . the resignation serves as a confession : klaus zumwinkel realized that he could not remain ceo of one of germany 's largest companies and decided to face the consequences .
he did n't have a choice . it goes without saying that he has to give up his position at the top if he funneled money into liechtenstein 's tax paradise and did n't report the interest he 'd earned .
it 's called tax evasion . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : technically , he 's considered innocent until found guilty in a court of law or until he has made a formal confession , but it 's becoming more and more apparent that the evidence collected so far is just the tip of the iceberg . post chief is one of many several hundred wealthy germans , some of them celebrities , have also invested money in liechtenstein and hidden it from the german tax authorities .
now they have a big problem , too . klaus zumwinkel himself became the tip of the iceberg when the other tax evaders came under the radar of the public prosecutor 's office .
the alpine principality 's tax saving model is not quite as secure as many had thought .
the secrets at the large baronial bank have been cracked and officials have known for months who has money there and how much - including in the so-called family endowments . now the investigations have begun .
over the next few weeks , police and public prosecutors will pay visits to many of the tax evaders .
zumwinkel is merely the first of many . sympathy is not in order .
we 're not talking about the poorest of the poor but mainly about people who , even after properly paying their taxes , could still afford a hot lunch . greed conquered reason zumwinkel is n't the only one asking how it could come to this .
the answer is simple : greed was stronger than reason .
zumwinkel certainly did n't need to do what he did .
as the head of deutsche post , he not only collected an annual salary of 3.5 million euros -lrb- $ 5.1 million -rrb- but had also inherited a large sum of money at a young age . he would be wealthy even if he had paid the taxes he owed , just slightly less wealthy .
that 's also true of most of the others who will soon receive visits from the authorities .
none of them is poor ; rather they 're among the richest members of society - of the very society that made it possible for them to become as affluent as they are . if they have any brains at all , they should come out of hiding as soon as possible .
the german tax authorities are n't interested in punishment or even revenge - they just want the tax money owed to them .
that means that those who turn themselves in to the tax office and pay the missing taxes with interest before they 're investigated will get off without penalty . fine is least of the worries the tax evaders that do n't do this will have to face the full rigor of the law - and rightly so .
it 's always the wealthier part of society that complains about high taxes and takes advantage of every opportunity to reduce their own tax burden , either by legal means or illegally via liechtenstein . zumwinkel 's case - and the many more cases that are likely to follow in the coming weeks - shows what the outcome can be .
his reputation is ruined , his job has been lost and a hefty penalty is looming .
he and the others can consider themselves lucky if they get off with merely a fine and not a prison sentence . karl zawadzky is dw-radio 's business editor -lrb- kjb -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

but aficionados say it 's the system , not the sport , that 's at fault . just over a decade ago , things were looking up for basketball in germany .
at the 1992 olympics in barcelona , coverage focused on the us " dream team , " which featured an assembly of all-time b-ball greats including michael jordan , magic johnson , larry bird and charles barkley .
just a year later , the german men 's team caused a sensation when it won the european championship on its home turf . mirroring the sport 's wild growth across the atlantic at the time , hoops began mushrooming on playgrounds and schoolyards around the country - giving german kids their first opportunity to dribble a ball outside a gym .
in addition , lifestyle companies like nike and adidas took to sponsoring streetball tournaments in the bigger cities . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the mavericks ' nowitzki was 2007 mvp the era marked a high point in popularity for basketball in germany , when the number of people officially registered to play in basketball clubs reached around 200,000 , said dirk kaiser , spokesman for the german pro-basketball league , bundesliga basketball -lrb- bbl -rrb- . earlier start - but no follow-through but it seems a few summers flirting with a sport rooted deeply in us culture were not enough to win the undying love of soccer-mad germans . today , the number of registered players has receded to around 193,000 , although kaiser estimates about three to four times as many people - " potentially a million " - play streetball or in unregistered pickup games around the country . as a spectator sport , basketball is somewhere around third or fourth place , alongside ice hockey but well behind handball -lrb- number two -rrb- and miles out of the league of soccer , germany 's all-encompassing sports monolith . despite kids getting in touch with the sport at a much younger age than they used to , germany 's basketball federation " is n't doing a good job " of getting kids to go on to play in the clubs , said andre voigt , editor in chief of the german basketball magazine five .

" it 's a complex problem . " one major aspect of the problem is the lack of a strong domestic league with national basketball stars . " it 's obvious that kids interested in basketball today know more about the nba players than they do about the guys who play here , " voigt said . german-player quote - high enough ? in 2005 , the bbl tried to improve the situation by ruling that at least three of the 12 players on the roster have to be germans .
voigt called the quota " kind of low , " saying that court time in the pro leagues is necessary for germans to develop enough home-grown talent to field good national teams for european championships .
otherwise germany could n't hold its own against more basketball oriented countries like greece or spain . but more worrisome than keeping german players active , is the question of how to keep the teams alive at all . earlier this month , the cologne 99ers announced bankruptcy , despite a string of successes .
the move came after the team 's corporate sponsor , rhineenergie , pulled its support and a private financier failed to come through with enough cash to carry the team . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : is there life after bankruptcy in basketball ?

and teams in ulm and giessen are both facing shaky futures because of sponsorship problems .
catch-22 sponsorship debacle the problem of sponsorship is , in fact , a tricky one .
sponsors see sports teams as a marketing vehicle , ideally to reach television audience .
but german free tv does n't carry league basketball play ; it is found either on pay channels or the internet .
so big sponsors drop out , pulling support from the teams , in turn weakening the sport , which then lowers the chances of having a strong following . and the cycle continues .
german national team coach dirk bauermann told the european basketball association , fiba , that the tv issue is " a huge concern . "
" if we do n't find ways to get in free television , we 're going to continue to lose sponsors , " he told the fiba web site .
it would be a " tragedy " if the league were to lose such established winning clubs as leverkusen and köln , he said .
' they 've got to go after the kids ' five 's voigt acknowledged that the tv coverage situation is a problem , but thinks that a little time , and some smart moves by german basketball organizations , could fix things in the long run .
" i do n't think the basketball associations should be trying to sway 20- and 30-year olds .
they 've got to go after the kids .
they have to go into the schools and grab the seven and eight year olds , and let them know how beautiful the sport is , " voigt said .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : cologne 's team was doing well when its support got pulled " if we get kids to play in bigger numbers than now , then we 'll generate better players , more viewers , get more people engaged , and more sponsors , " he added .
" this will take more than two or three years .
but it 's the only way to improve the situation in the long run . "
missing the boat on nowitzki ?
some critics say top basketball officials are missing a golden opportunity to win converts by failing to adequately exploit germany 's most important basketball resource : dirk nowitzki .
nowitzki , a seven-foot -lrb- 2.1-meter -rrb- power forward for the us national basketball association 's dallas mavericks , was voted the league 's most valuable player in 2007 .
germany should be making more of the fact that the man nicknamed the " bavarian bomber " was born and bred in wuerzburg , voigt said .
" he is the last global sports icon we have , now that boris becker left tennis and michael schumacher left racing , " said voigt .
" everyone knows about him - that 's he 's very tall , a great athlete , and he earns a lot of money . "

hamburg and bremen looked best in their matches . while sv hamburg and werder bremen won their matches , bayern munich and bayer leverkusen drew away from home and nuremberg lost on a single goal . hamburg came out 3-1 winners at fc zurich on thursday , feb .
14 , in their first-leg match of the tournament 's knock-out stage . a first-half goal by david jarolim and second-half strikes from ivica olic and piotr trochowski put hamburg on the road to a comfortable victory . hamburg lost dutch midfielder rafael van der vaart who limped off with an ankle injury in the 33rd minute to be replaced by jose guerrero . the peru striker then set up the opening two goals in the 33rd and 67th minutes and earned the foul which led to trochowski scoring with a direct free-kick in the 77th . zurich notched a consolation three minutes from time when a shot by andres vasquez was fumbled onto the inside of the post by keeper frank rost and irish referee alan kelly ruled the ball had crossed the line . bremen waltz to a comfortable win werder bremen enjoyed a 3-0 home win over portugal 's braga in their opening knock-out round match on wednesday . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : bremen cruised to a win against the portuguese goalkeeper tim wiese saved two penalties while first-half goals from naldo and daniel jensen and a penalty by hugo almeida sealed a comfortable win for the german side . naldo put bremen in front after just four minutes with a long-range shot before wiese saved a roland linz spot kick to maintain bremen 's lead . jensen doubled werder 's advantage on 27 minutes with a shot from outside the penalty area before wiese once again saved a penalty , this time from jorginho nine minutes later .
almeida completed the scoring with virtually the last kick of the game after joao pereira handled in the area . " when we get penalties we have to convert them , " said braga 's linz afterwards .
" now it will be really tough for us in the return leg . " bayern struggle to keep scots in check bundesliga leaders bayern munich twice came from behind to draw 2-2 with scottish side aberdeen .
goals from miroslav klose and hamit altintop put bayern into a strong position for the return leg in munich next week . however the four-time european champions were made to fight all the way by a spirited aberdeen side depleted by injuries . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : klose helped bayern stay in touch with aberdeen " it 's quite normal that when you play internationally - a team like aberdeen can play above themselves , " bayern coach ottmar hitzfeld said .
" a 2-2 draw away from home in europe used to be like a victory .
we never think about losing in munich . " aberdeen were hoping to repeat a quarter-final win over the bundesliga leaders 25 years ago on their way to lifting the european cup winners ' cup . they took a surprise lead in the 24th minute when josh walker rifled in a shot from more than 20 meters . bayern had already missed chances , but klose made no mistake with a shot on the turn into the roof of the net five minutes later . aberdeen went back in front when sone aluko beat michael rensing - in goal for the flu-ridden oliver kahn - with a low shot from inside the area three minutes before half-time . bayern again leveled after a ze roberto cross struck alan maybury on the arm and spanish referee eduardo iturralde gonzalez awarded a penalty .
altintop 's 54th-minute spot-kick was parried by jamie langfield but the turkey international followed up to make sure at the second chance . nuremberg and leverkusen face harder tasks nuremberg slipped to a 1-0 defeat to portugal 's benfica in lisbon on wednesday , sunk by ariza makukula 's 43rd-minute winner . it was the first game in charge for thomas von heesen , who replaced the sacked hans meyer on monday . also on wednesday , bayer leverkusen earned a goalless draw at turkish side galatasaray . dw staff -lrb- nda -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

otherwise , things could get ugly . the resignation serves as a confession : klaus zumwinkel realized that he could not remain ceo of one of germany 's largest companies and decided to face the consequences .
he did n't have a choice . it goes without saying that he has to give up his position at the top if he funneled money into liechtenstein 's tax paradise and did n't report the interest he 'd earned .
it 's called tax evasion . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : technically , he 's considered innocent until found guilty in a court of law or until he has made a formal confession , but it 's becoming more and more apparent that the evidence collected so far is just the tip of the iceberg . post chief is one of many several hundred wealthy germans , some of them celebrities , have also invested money in liechtenstein and hidden it from the german tax authorities .
now they have a big problem , too . klaus zumwinkel himself became the tip of the iceberg when the other tax evaders came under the radar of the public prosecutor 's office .
the alpine principality 's tax saving model is not quite as secure as many had thought .
the secrets at the large baronial bank have been cracked and officials have known for months who has money there and how much - including in the so-called family endowments . now the investigations have begun .
over the next few weeks , police and public prosecutors will pay visits to many of the tax evaders .
zumwinkel is merely the first of many . sympathy is not in order .
we 're not talking about the poorest of the poor but mainly about people who , even after properly paying their taxes , could still afford a hot lunch . greed conquered reason zumwinkel is n't the only one asking how it could come to this .
the answer is simple : greed was stronger than reason .
zumwinkel certainly did n't need to do what he did .
as the head of deutsche post , he not only collected an annual salary of 3.5 million euros -lrb- $ 5.1 million -rrb- but had also inherited a large sum of money at a young age . he would be wealthy even if he had paid the taxes he owed , just slightly less wealthy .
that 's also true of most of the others who will soon receive visits from the authorities .
none of them is poor ; rather they 're among the richest members of society - of the very society that made it possible for them to become as affluent as they are . if they have any brains at all , they should come out of hiding as soon as possible .
the german tax authorities are n't interested in punishment or even revenge - they just want the tax money owed to them .
that means that those who turn themselves in to the tax office and pay the missing taxes with interest before they 're investigated will get off without penalty . fine is least of the worries the tax evaders that do n't do this will have to face the full rigor of the law - and rightly so .
it 's always the wealthier part of society that complains about high taxes and takes advantage of every opportunity to reduce their own tax burden , either by legal means or illegally via liechtenstein . zumwinkel 's case - and the many more cases that are likely to follow in the coming weeks - shows what the outcome can be .
his reputation is ruined , his job has been lost and a hefty penalty is looming .
he and the others can consider themselves lucky if they get off with merely a fine and not a prison sentence . karl zawadzky is dw-radio 's business editor -lrb- kjb -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

but concern is mounting that the nato mission could fail entirely . german chancellor angela merkel 's government will begin discussing the future role of germany in afghanistan next week .
and speculation abounds that the government plans to increase the number of troops in afghanistan when the current mandate runs out in october .
one member of parliament who requested anonymity told reuters that top politicians in the germany 's ruling coalition will begin discussing changes to the current mission next week .
it was not clear whether or by how much the number of troops would increase .
" it 's too early to speculate on what a new mandate might look like , " guenter gloser , a minister of state in the german foreign ministry , said .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : germany has said it wo n't send more troops media reports have speculated that germany could send 500 to 1,000 additional soldiers and could also increase the geographical area where they are deployed within afghanistan .
the government has denied these reports .
germany 's existing mandate allows for up to 3,500 soldiers to work out of the relatively peaceful northern part of the country .
berlin is under pressure from the united states and other nato allies to take a more active role in the southern part of the country .
germany recently promised about 200 combat troops as part of a quick response force .
limited mandate many european countries have been reluctant to commit more troops to the mission in afghanistan .
at a nato meeting in vilnius last week france , romania , poland and norway signaled they could increase their participation .
yet this was hardly the level of support hoped for by the us .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : german public opinion is strongly anti-war more than six years have passed since the us brought down the taliban regime in an effort to put an end to al qaeda .
while the taliban has been ousted from power , it remains strong , particularly in the south of the country where it controls many roads and runs its own checkpoints .
nato 's international security assistance force -lrb- isaf -rrb- has quadrupled to 43,000 troops in four years .
us undersecretary of state nicholas burns said in a speech earlier this week that nine of nato 's members were carrying 95 percent of the burden in afghanistan .
nato needs all help it can get yet isaf lacks troops and equipment which is " hurting military efforts to defeat the enemy , " burns said .
" nato never fought a ground war until the afghanistan war , " burns said .
" nato 's future is so much on the line . "
britain 's paddy ashdown , a former united nations envoy to bosnia who withdrew as a " super envoy " to afghanistan , said defeat is a possibility for nato .
forces there are in disarray and the security situation is deteriorating , ashdown wrote in a financial times opinion piece published wednesday , feb .
13 .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : there have been calls for better coordination britain feels maxed out with 7,800 troops in afghanistan and 4,500 in iraq .
canada and the netherlands , which also have troops in southern afghanistan , have suffered too many casualties and have domestic resistance to increasing troops .
that has increased pressure on france and germany , neither of which has troops in the south .
it 's thought that merkel and france 's nicolas sarkozy will want to bring promises of additional troops to a nato summit in bucharest in april .
" super envoy " badly needed the us 's burns also said it was necessary for the un to speedily appoint a strong " super envoy " with a centralized mandate .
a " super envoy " would coordinate military , aid and development activities which are seen as important to counter insurgency .
ashdown withdrew his name after afghan president hamid karzai opposed the appointment .
un and nato sources expect it to take weeks to find a viable substitute . dw staff -lrb- th -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

hamburg and bremen looked best in their matches . while sv hamburg and werder bremen won their matches , bayern munich and bayer leverkusen drew away from home and nuremberg lost on a single goal . hamburg came out 3-1 winners at fc zurich on thursday , feb .
14 , in their first-leg match of the tournament 's knock-out stage . a first-half goal by david jarolim and second-half strikes from ivica olic and piotr trochowski put hamburg on the road to a comfortable victory . hamburg lost dutch midfielder rafael van der vaart who limped off with an ankle injury in the 33rd minute to be replaced by jose guerrero . the peru striker then set up the opening two goals in the 33rd and 67th minutes and earned the foul which led to trochowski scoring with a direct free-kick in the 77th . zurich notched a consolation three minutes from time when a shot by andres vasquez was fumbled onto the inside of the post by keeper frank rost and irish referee alan kelly ruled the ball had crossed the line . bremen waltz to a comfortable win werder bremen enjoyed a 3-0 home win over portugal 's braga in their opening knock-out round match on wednesday . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : bremen cruised to a win against the portuguese goalkeeper tim wiese saved two penalties while first-half goals from naldo and daniel jensen and a penalty by hugo almeida sealed a comfortable win for the german side . naldo put bremen in front after just four minutes with a long-range shot before wiese saved a roland linz spot kick to maintain bremen 's lead . jensen doubled werder 's advantage on 27 minutes with a shot from outside the penalty area before wiese once again saved a penalty , this time from jorginho nine minutes later .
almeida completed the scoring with virtually the last kick of the game after joao pereira handled in the area . " when we get penalties we have to convert them , " said braga 's linz afterwards .
" now it will be really tough for us in the return leg . " bayern struggle to keep scots in check bundesliga leaders bayern munich twice came from behind to draw 2-2 with scottish side aberdeen .
goals from miroslav klose and hamit altintop put bayern into a strong position for the return leg in munich next week . however the four-time european champions were made to fight all the way by a spirited aberdeen side depleted by injuries . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : klose helped bayern stay in touch with aberdeen " it 's quite normal that when you play internationally - a team like aberdeen can play above themselves , " bayern coach ottmar hitzfeld said .
" a 2-2 draw away from home in europe used to be like a victory .
we never think about losing in munich . " aberdeen were hoping to repeat a quarter-final win over the bundesliga leaders 25 years ago on their way to lifting the european cup winners ' cup . they took a surprise lead in the 24th minute when josh walker rifled in a shot from more than 20 meters . bayern had already missed chances , but klose made no mistake with a shot on the turn into the roof of the net five minutes later . aberdeen went back in front when sone aluko beat michael rensing - in goal for the flu-ridden oliver kahn - with a low shot from inside the area three minutes before half-time . bayern again leveled after a ze roberto cross struck alan maybury on the arm and spanish referee eduardo iturralde gonzalez awarded a penalty .
altintop 's 54th-minute spot-kick was parried by jamie langfield but the turkey international followed up to make sure at the second chance . nuremberg and leverkusen face harder tasks nuremberg slipped to a 1-0 defeat to portugal 's benfica in lisbon on wednesday , sunk by ariza makukula 's 43rd-minute winner . it was the first game in charge for thomas von heesen , who replaced the sacked hans meyer on monday . also on wednesday , bayer leverkusen earned a goalless draw at turkish side galatasaray . dw staff -lrb- nda -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

but concern is mounting that the nato mission could fail entirely . german chancellor angela merkel 's government will begin discussing the future role of germany in afghanistan next week .
and speculation abounds that the government plans to increase the number of troops in afghanistan when the current mandate runs out in october .
one member of parliament who requested anonymity told reuters that top politicians in the germany 's ruling coalition will begin discussing changes to the current mission next week .
it was not clear whether or by how much the number of troops would increase .
" it 's too early to speculate on what a new mandate might look like , " guenter gloser , a minister of state in the german foreign ministry , said .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : germany has said it wo n't send more troops media reports have speculated that germany could send 500 to 1,000 additional soldiers and could also increase the geographical area where they are deployed within afghanistan .
the government has denied these reports .
germany 's existing mandate allows for up to 3,500 soldiers to work out of the relatively peaceful northern part of the country .
berlin is under pressure from the united states and other nato allies to take a more active role in the southern part of the country .
germany recently promised about 200 combat troops as part of a quick response force .
limited mandate many european countries have been reluctant to commit more troops to the mission in afghanistan .
at a nato meeting in vilnius last week france , romania , poland and norway signaled they could increase their participation .
yet this was hardly the level of support hoped for by the us .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : german public opinion is strongly anti-war more than six years have passed since the us brought down the taliban regime in an effort to put an end to al qaeda .
while the taliban has been ousted from power , it remains strong , particularly in the south of the country where it controls many roads and runs its own checkpoints .
nato 's international security assistance force -lrb- isaf -rrb- has quadrupled to 43,000 troops in four years .
us undersecretary of state nicholas burns said in a speech earlier this week that nine of nato 's members were carrying 95 percent of the burden in afghanistan .
nato needs all help it can get yet isaf lacks troops and equipment which is " hurting military efforts to defeat the enemy , " burns said .
" nato never fought a ground war until the afghanistan war , " burns said .
" nato 's future is so much on the line . "
britain 's paddy ashdown , a former united nations envoy to bosnia who withdrew as a " super envoy " to afghanistan , said defeat is a possibility for nato .
forces there are in disarray and the security situation is deteriorating , ashdown wrote in a financial times opinion piece published wednesday , feb .
13 .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : there have been calls for better coordination britain feels maxed out with 7,800 troops in afghanistan and 4,500 in iraq .
canada and the netherlands , which also have troops in southern afghanistan , have suffered too many casualties and have domestic resistance to increasing troops .
that has increased pressure on france and germany , neither of which has troops in the south .
it 's thought that merkel and france 's nicolas sarkozy will want to bring promises of additional troops to a nato summit in bucharest in april .
" super envoy " badly needed the us 's burns also said it was necessary for the un to speedily appoint a strong " super envoy " with a centralized mandate .
a " super envoy " would coordinate military , aid and development activities which are seen as important to counter insurgency .
ashdown withdrew his name after afghan president hamid karzai opposed the appointment .

germany 's existing mandate allows for up to 3,500 soldiers to work out of the relatively peaceful northern part of the country .
berlin is under pressure from the united states and other nato allies to take a more active role in the southern part of the country .
germany recently promised about 200 combat troops as part of a quick response force .
limited mandate many european countries have been reluctant to commit more troops to the mission in afghanistan .
at a nato meeting in vilnius last week france , romania , poland and norway signaled they could increase their participation .
yet this was hardly the level of support hoped for by the us .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : german public opinion is strongly anti-war more than six years have passed since the us brought down the taliban regime in an effort to put an end to al qaeda .
while the taliban has been ousted from power , it remains strong , particularly in the south of the country where it controls many roads and runs its own checkpoints .
nato 's international security assistance force -lrb- isaf -rrb- has quadrupled to 43,000 troops in four years .
us undersecretary of state nicholas burns said in a speech earlier this week that nine of nato 's members were carrying 95 percent of the burden in afghanistan .
nato needs all help it can get yet isaf lacks troops and equipment which is " hurting military efforts to defeat the enemy , " burns said .
" nato never fought a ground war until the afghanistan war , " burns said .
" nato 's future is so much on the line . "
britain 's paddy ashdown , a former united nations envoy to bosnia who withdrew as a " super envoy " to afghanistan , said defeat is a possibility for nato .
forces there are in disarray and the security situation is deteriorating , ashdown wrote in a financial times opinion piece published wednesday , feb .
13 .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : there have been calls for better coordination britain feels maxed out with 7,800 troops in afghanistan and 4,500 in iraq .
canada and the netherlands , which also have troops in southern afghanistan , have suffered too many casualties and have domestic resistance to increasing troops .
that has increased pressure on france and germany , neither of which has troops in the south .
it 's thought that merkel and france 's nicolas sarkozy will want to bring promises of additional troops to a nato summit in bucharest in april .
" super envoy " badly needed the us 's burns also said it was necessary for the un to speedily appoint a strong " super envoy " with a centralized mandate .
a " super envoy " would coordinate military , aid and development activities which are seen as important to counter insurgency .
ashdown withdrew his name after afghan president hamid karzai opposed the appointment .
un and nato sources expect it to take weeks to find a viable substitute . dw staff -lrb- th -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de taxes -pipe- 15.02.2008 opinion : wealthy tax evaders should fess up großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : germany 's other affluent tax evaders should avoid the fate of deutsche post ceo klaus zumwinkel and turn themselves in to authorities , said dw 's karl zawadzky .
otherwise , things could get ugly . the resignation serves as a confession : klaus zumwinkel realized that he could not remain ceo of one of germany 's largest companies and decided to face the consequences .
he did n't have a choice . it goes without saying that he has to give up his position at the top if he funneled money into liechtenstein 's tax paradise and did n't report the interest he 'd earned .
it 's called tax evasion . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : technically , he 's considered innocent until found guilty in a court of law or until he has made a formal confession , but it 's becoming more and more apparent that the evidence collected so far is just the tip of the iceberg . post chief is one of many several hundred wealthy germans , some of them celebrities , have also invested money in liechtenstein and hidden it from the german tax authorities .
now they have a big problem , too . klaus zumwinkel himself became the tip of the iceberg when the other tax evaders came under the radar of the public prosecutor 's office .
the alpine principality 's tax saving model is not quite as secure as many had thought .
the secrets at the large baronial bank have been cracked and officials have known for months who has money there and how much - including in the so-called family endowments . now the investigations have begun .
over the next few weeks , police and public prosecutors will pay visits to many of the tax evaders .
zumwinkel is merely the first of many . sympathy is not in order .
we 're not talking about the poorest of the poor but mainly about people who , even after properly paying their taxes , could still afford a hot lunch . greed conquered reason zumwinkel is n't the only one asking how it could come to this .
the answer is simple : greed was stronger than reason .
zumwinkel certainly did n't need to do what he did .
as the head of deutsche post , he not only collected an annual salary of 3.5 million euros -lrb- $ 5.1 million -rrb- but had also inherited a large sum of money at a young age . he would be wealthy even if he had paid the taxes he owed , just slightly less wealthy .
that 's also true of most of the others who will soon receive visits from the authorities .
none of them is poor ; rather they 're among the richest members of society - of the very society that made it possible for them to become as affluent as they are . if they have any brains at all , they should come out of hiding as soon as possible .
the german tax authorities are n't interested in punishment or even revenge - they just want the tax money owed to them .
that means that those who turn themselves in to the tax office and pay the missing taxes with interest before they 're investigated will get off without penalty . fine is least of the worries the tax evaders that do n't do this will have to face the full rigor of the law - and rightly so .
it 's always the wealthier part of society that complains about high taxes and takes advantage of every opportunity to reduce their own tax burden , either by legal means or illegally via liechtenstein . zumwinkel 's case - and the many more cases that are likely to follow in the coming weeks - shows what the outcome can be .
his reputation is ruined , his job has been lost and a hefty penalty is looming .
he and the others can consider themselves lucky if they get off with merely a fine and not a prison sentence . karl zawadzky is dw-radio 's business editor -lrb- kjb -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de taxes -pipe- 15.02.2008 opinion : wealthy tax evaders should fess up großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : germany 's other affluent tax evaders should avoid the fate of deutsche post ceo klaus zumwinkel and turn themselves in to authorities , said dw 's karl zawadzky .
otherwise , things could get ugly . the resignation serves as a confession : klaus zumwinkel realized that he could not remain ceo of one of germany 's largest companies and decided to face the consequences .
he did n't have a choice . it goes without saying that he has to give up his position at the top if he funneled money into liechtenstein 's tax paradise and did n't report the interest he 'd earned .
it 's called tax evasion . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : technically , he 's considered innocent until found guilty in a court of law or until he has made a formal confession , but it 's becoming more and more apparent that the evidence collected so far is just the tip of the iceberg . post chief is one of many several hundred wealthy germans , some of them celebrities , have also invested money in liechtenstein and hidden it from the german tax authorities .
now they have a big problem , too . klaus zumwinkel himself became the tip of the iceberg when the other tax evaders came under the radar of the public prosecutor 's office .
the alpine principality 's tax saving model is not quite as secure as many had thought .
the secrets at the large baronial bank have been cracked and officials have known for months who has money there and how much - including in the so-called family endowments . now the investigations have begun .
over the next few weeks , police and public prosecutors will pay visits to many of the tax evaders .
zumwinkel is merely the first of many . sympathy is not in order .
we 're not talking about the poorest of the poor but mainly about people who , even after properly paying their taxes , could still afford a hot lunch . greed conquered reason zumwinkel is n't the only one asking how it could come to this .
the answer is simple : greed was stronger than reason .
zumwinkel certainly did n't need to do what he did .
as the head of deutsche post , he not only collected an annual salary of 3.5 million euros -lrb- $ 5.1 million -rrb- but had also inherited a large sum of money at a young age . he would be wealthy even if he had paid the taxes he owed , just slightly less wealthy .
that 's also true of most of the others who will soon receive visits from the authorities .
none of them is poor ; rather they 're among the richest members of society - of the very society that made it possible for them to become as affluent as they are . if they have any brains at all , they should come out of hiding as soon as possible .
the german tax authorities are n't interested in punishment or even revenge - they just want the tax money owed to them .
that means that those who turn themselves in to the tax office and pay the missing taxes with interest before they 're investigated will get off without penalty . fine is least of the worries the tax evaders that do n't do this will have to face the full rigor of the law - and rightly so .
it 's always the wealthier part of society that complains about high taxes and takes advantage of every opportunity to reduce their own tax burden , either by legal means or illegally via liechtenstein . zumwinkel 's case - and the many more cases that are likely to follow in the coming weeks - shows what the outcome can be .
his reputation is ruined , his job has been lost and a hefty penalty is looming .
he and the others can consider themselves lucky if they get off with merely a fine and not a prison sentence . karl zawadzky is dw-radio 's business editor -lrb- kjb -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

but concern is mounting that the nato mission could fail entirely . german chancellor angela merkel 's government will begin discussing the future role of germany in afghanistan next week .
and speculation abounds that the government plans to increase the number of troops in afghanistan when the current mandate runs out in october .
one member of parliament who requested anonymity told reuters that top politicians in the germany 's ruling coalition will begin discussing changes to the current mission next week .
it was not clear whether or by how much the number of troops would increase .
" it 's too early to speculate on what a new mandate might look like , " guenter gloser , a minister of state in the german foreign ministry , said .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : germany has said it wo n't send more troops media reports have speculated that germany could send 500 to 1,000 additional soldiers and could also increase the geographical area where they are deployed within afghanistan .
the government has denied these reports .
germany 's existing mandate allows for up to 3,500 soldiers to work out of the relatively peaceful northern part of the country .
berlin is under pressure from the united states and other nato allies to take a more active role in the southern part of the country .
germany recently promised about 200 combat troops as part of a quick response force .
limited mandate many european countries have been reluctant to commit more troops to the mission in afghanistan .
at a nato meeting in vilnius last week france , romania , poland and norway signaled they could increase their participation .
yet this was hardly the level of support hoped for by the us .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : german public opinion is strongly anti-war more than six years have passed since the us brought down the taliban regime in an effort to put an end to al qaeda .
while the taliban has been ousted from power , it remains strong , particularly in the south of the country where it controls many roads and runs its own checkpoints .
nato 's international security assistance force -lrb- isaf -rrb- has quadrupled to 43,000 troops in four years .
us undersecretary of state nicholas burns said in a speech earlier this week that nine of nato 's members were carrying 95 percent of the burden in afghanistan .
nato needs all help it can get yet isaf lacks troops and equipment which is " hurting military efforts to defeat the enemy , " burns said .
" nato never fought a ground war until the afghanistan war , " burns said .
" nato 's future is so much on the line . "
britain 's paddy ashdown , a former united nations envoy to bosnia who withdrew as a " super envoy " to afghanistan , said defeat is a possibility for nato .
forces there are in disarray and the security situation is deteriorating , ashdown wrote in a financial times opinion piece published wednesday , feb .
13 .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : there have been calls for better coordination britain feels maxed out with 7,800 troops in afghanistan and 4,500 in iraq .
canada and the netherlands , which also have troops in southern afghanistan , have suffered too many casualties and have domestic resistance to increasing troops .
that has increased pressure on france and germany , neither of which has troops in the south .
it 's thought that merkel and france 's nicolas sarkozy will want to bring promises of additional troops to a nato summit in bucharest in april .
" super envoy " badly needed the us 's burns also said it was necessary for the un to speedily appoint a strong " super envoy " with a centralized mandate .
a " super envoy " would coordinate military , aid and development activities which are seen as important to counter insurgency .
ashdown withdrew his name after afghan president hamid karzai opposed the appointment .

some lawmakers even received bullets in the post . " the division of our political scene must not become a brake on our way forward , " klaus said after the vote .
" i will be the president of all citizens . " fiercely fought campaign klaus was nominated by the rightwing civic democrat party -lrb- ods -rrb- , which he founded , and which has been led since 2002 by mirek topolanek , the czech prime minister .

15 . " the german government today accepted mr. zumwinkel 's offer to resign , " chancellor angela merkel told reporters in berlin .
" i consider this to be in unavoidable step considering what has happened . " zumwinkel , who is suspected of evading 1 million euros -lrb- $ 1.5 million -rrb- worth of taxes through a foundation in liechtenstein , also stepped down from his position on the supervisory board of deutsche telekom , the government spokesmen indicated . " in a large number of cases , key personalities from our country sought to avoid their duty of solidarity via taxation by practicing fiscal evasion to liechtenstein , " a finance ministry spokesman told reporters the daily sueddeutsche zeitung said in editions to appear saturday that some 3.4 billion euros was involved . albig urged those involved to file corrected returns detailing their tax evasion - a device known as " self-reporting " under german law and aimed at allowing offenders to reduce possible penalties . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the future looks bleak the financial times deutschland wrote that it was unlikely that zumwinkel would take a seat on the deutsche post group 's supervisory board , as would normally have been the case when his contract expired in november .
he has been head of deutsche post for 18 years . corporate elite under scrutiny the issue of tax breaks , massive salaries and corporate " extras " for high-powered german executives has come to a head in recent months , with increasing numbers of politicians joining in the growing public furor over the perceived immunity and privileges enjoyed by the country 's business elite . the german population , which places a high value on social and financial probity , was already shocked last year by scandals at two industrial titans , the engineering giant siemens and the biggest european car maker , volkswagen . german finance minister peer steinbrueck admitted the investigation was damaging the already shaky state of public confidence . " the moral damage is considerable - just as it was with his dealing with his share options , " steinbrueck told a group of journalists on his way into parliament . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : after being held by police , zumwinkel was later released in a controversial move , zumwinkel sold 200,000 share options worth 2.24 million euros in december just after deutsche post 's share price rose following a deal to introduce a minimum wage that would affect lower-cost rivals .
he later said his actions were a regrettable mistake . " if the public has something like this as a role model then they 'll start having doubts about this economic and social system , " steinbrueck added .
" i did n't think this was possible . " peter struck , the leader of the social democratic parliamentary faction , added : " when someone has so much money and nevertheless believes there is a need to hide money from the state , then a lot of people will believe there is a lack of justice .
the ordinary taxpayer has to pay his taxes to the tax office . " merkel 's spokesman , ulrich wilhelm , said the chancellor regretted the fact that zumwinkel had not made a public statement on his position since police raided his home and office at dawn on thursday . wilhelm said the highly publicized scandal would be discussed when merkel meets liechtenstein prime minister otmar halser on wednesday . german police searched zumwinkel 's villa in western cologne and deutsche post 's headquarters in bonn as the tax probe became public . the chief executive was taken under police escort from his home in the upmarket marienburg part of cologne to the prosecutors ' office in the city of bochum some five hours after the raids .
investigators also removed boxes from the house . after zumwinkel had posted what prosecutors described as " a not inconsiderable bond , " an arrest warrant was lifted and he was allowed to leave . investigation may unearth other big names bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : whose tax returns will be next to come under scrutiny ?
the business daily handelsblatt said the raids were part of a series of probes into tax evasion totaling around 10 million euros deposited in liechtenstein , the principality bordering switzerland and austria , and that other raids would follow across germany . hundreds of suspects had been uncovered by investigating the activities of lgt , a liechtenstein bank .
" we 've cracked the whole bank , " one investigator told handelsblatt . there is speculation that more of germany 's rich and powerful business leaders may be involved . lgt spokesman bernd junkers in liechtenstein told reuters that the bank , controlled by the principality 's princely family , had taken note of the handelsblatt report but could not comment in detail further . from savior to pariah bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the tower that klaus built the longest-serving chief of a dax company , the frankfurt blue-chip index , zumwinkel was credited with transforming the postal service into a world leader in logistics , with more than half a million employees , and a german leader in retail banking via its extensive postbank network . but he had also been sharply criticized for selling the large stock holding after the imposition of a minimum wage for postal workers boosted deutsche post shares last year following a fight for the unprecedented german legislation , which , in effect , protected deutsche post from lower-cost competition . dw staff -lrb- nda -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

otherwise , things could get ugly . the resignation serves as a confession : klaus zumwinkel realized that he could not remain ceo of one of germany 's largest companies and decided to face the consequences .
he did n't have a choice . it goes without saying that he has to give up his position at the top if he funneled money into liechtenstein 's tax paradise and did n't report the interest he 'd earned .
it 's called tax evasion . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : technically , he 's considered innocent until found guilty in a court of law or until he has made a formal confession , but it 's becoming more and more apparent that the evidence collected so far is just the tip of the iceberg . post chief is one of many several hundred wealthy germans , some of them celebrities , have also invested money in liechtenstein and hidden it from the german tax authorities .
now they have a big problem , too . klaus zumwinkel himself became the tip of the iceberg when the other tax evaders came under the radar of the public prosecutor 's office .
the alpine principality 's tax saving model is not quite as secure as many had thought .
the secrets at the large baronial bank have been cracked and officials have known for months who has money there and how much - including in the so-called family endowments . now the investigations have begun .
over the next few weeks , police and public prosecutors will pay visits to many of the tax evaders .
zumwinkel is merely the first of many . sympathy is not in order .
we 're not talking about the poorest of the poor but mainly about people who , even after properly paying their taxes , could still afford a hot lunch . greed conquered reason zumwinkel is n't the only one asking how it could come to this .
the answer is simple : greed was stronger than reason .
zumwinkel certainly did n't need to do what he did .
as the head of deutsche post , he not only collected an annual salary of 3.5 million euros -lrb- $ 5.1 million -rrb- but had also inherited a large sum of money at a young age . he would be wealthy even if he had paid the taxes he owed , just slightly less wealthy .
that 's also true of most of the others who will soon receive visits from the authorities .
none of them is poor ; rather they 're among the richest members of society - of the very society that made it possible for them to become as affluent as they are . if they have any brains at all , they should come out of hiding as soon as possible .
the german tax authorities are n't interested in punishment or even revenge - they just want the tax money owed to them .
that means that those who turn themselves in to the tax office and pay the missing taxes with interest before they 're investigated will get off without penalty . fine is least of the worries the tax evaders that do n't do this will have to face the full rigor of the law - and rightly so .
it 's always the wealthier part of society that complains about high taxes and takes advantage of every opportunity to reduce their own tax burden , either by legal means or illegally via liechtenstein . zumwinkel 's case - and the many more cases that are likely to follow in the coming weeks - shows what the outcome can be .
his reputation is ruined , his job has been lost and a hefty penalty is looming .

otherwise , things could get ugly . the resignation serves as a confession : klaus zumwinkel realized that he could not remain ceo of one of germany 's largest companies and decided to face the consequences .
he did n't have a choice . it goes without saying that he has to give up his position at the top if he funneled money into liechtenstein 's tax paradise and did n't report the interest he 'd earned .
it 's called tax evasion . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : technically , he 's considered innocent until found guilty in a court of law or until he has made a formal confession , but it 's becoming more and more apparent that the evidence collected so far is just the tip of the iceberg . post chief is one of many several hundred wealthy germans , some of them celebrities , have also invested money in liechtenstein and hidden it from the german tax authorities .
now they have a big problem , too . klaus zumwinkel himself became the tip of the iceberg when the other tax evaders came under the radar of the public prosecutor 's office .
the alpine principality 's tax saving model is not quite as secure as many had thought .
the secrets at the large baronial bank have been cracked and officials have known for months who has money there and how much - including in the so-called family endowments . now the investigations have begun .
over the next few weeks , police and public prosecutors will pay visits to many of the tax evaders .
zumwinkel is merely the first of many . sympathy is not in order .
we 're not talking about the poorest of the poor but mainly about people who , even after properly paying their taxes , could still afford a hot lunch . greed conquered reason zumwinkel is n't the only one asking how it could come to this .
the answer is simple : greed was stronger than reason .
zumwinkel certainly did n't need to do what he did .
as the head of deutsche post , he not only collected an annual salary of 3.5 million euros -lrb- $ 5.1 million -rrb- but had also inherited a large sum of money at a young age . he would be wealthy even if he had paid the taxes he owed , just slightly less wealthy .
that 's also true of most of the others who will soon receive visits from the authorities .
none of them is poor ; rather they 're among the richest members of society - of the very society that made it possible for them to become as affluent as they are . if they have any brains at all , they should come out of hiding as soon as possible .
the german tax authorities are n't interested in punishment or even revenge - they just want the tax money owed to them .
that means that those who turn themselves in to the tax office and pay the missing taxes with interest before they 're investigated will get off without penalty . fine is least of the worries the tax evaders that do n't do this will have to face the full rigor of the law - and rightly so .
it 's always the wealthier part of society that complains about high taxes and takes advantage of every opportunity to reduce their own tax burden , either by legal means or illegally via liechtenstein . zumwinkel 's case - and the many more cases that are likely to follow in the coming weeks - shows what the outcome can be .
his reputation is ruined , his job has been lost and a hefty penalty is looming .
he and the others can consider themselves lucky if they get off with merely a fine and not a prison sentence . karl zawadzky is dw-radio 's business editor -lrb- kjb -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

all this , of course , is mainly within the capital of nairobi .
the rest of the country remains in a state of fear of reprisal killings , police brutality and the overpowering dread that this is not the last time this will happen in this country .
the daily beheadings , burnings and rapes of people caught in the wrong ethnic region of the country have - as far as reporting is concerned - almost come to an end .
however , a number of eyewitness stories that i have been told still tell of random killings by both civilian-formed militias as well as by the police themselves .
this can only make one fear that the real number of deaths within the country , currently estimated around 1,000 , falls extremely short .
against this backdrop of returning normality and the low-level conflicts and killings pervasive within the rest of the country , outside of nairobi and mombassa , the kofi annan-sponsored reconciliation talks have been taking place and have made remarkably rapid and relatively painless progress towards resolving the crisis .
the real test of this ' almost resolution ' is yet to come along with kenya 's greatest ordeal : the challenging of its idea of nationhood , reconciliation and , above all , its humanity .
there is every chance that the annan discussions will lead to a short-term solution to the electoral crisis of last year and a power-sharing government of national unity , or some other form of interim government , will be formed and posts suitably allocated to the various aggrieved parties .
however , a number of critical issues from the past - and for the future - raise fundamental questions about the stability of any potential interim government and the real prospects for peace and stability within the country .
raila odinga , the losing presidential candidate from the december elections and main protagonist within the current crisis , has already been in a coalition once before with mwai kibaki , the current president of kenya .
that time the coalition was made through common cause and mutual agreement rather than being resentfully forced through .
even so , the partnership between odinga and kibaki lasted only a matter of months prior to odinga withdrawing from the government over accusations of betrayals of faith on previous agreements on power-sharing .
this shared history does not bode well for the stability of the government to come .
and it could be expected that the 10th parliament , which is just forming , will be precarious at best , with various people and parties just biding their time and resources until the next fight for ultimate control .
if any real , lasting peace is to be achieved in kenya , serious constitutional review will need to take place that allows for a fairer and devolved system of government .
the constitution has been revised several times over the last few decades , most of which applied to the consolidation of power within the presidency and the ruling party .
however , a constitutional review was carried out during the last two parliaments , with wide-spread consultations and formal deliberations , which , in the end , came to nothing .
as a result , the concentration of power remains with the presidency .
one of the main problems with the previous attempt to revise and reinvigorate the constitution was the insistence that the changes should be open to a public referendum .
although there was some civic education carried out during this previous process , the time and information required by constituents to make an informed decision on issues as complex as constitutional amendments , when they have been completely and actively excluded from the process of governance for the history of the country , was both immense and very time consuming .
neither of which was taken into account during the process .
the vote in the end became a protest against the sitting government rather than on any real understanding and appreciation of the content of the amendments , much in the same way as the french voted on the eu constitution .
the balkanization of the country stemming from the post-election violence will only exacerbate this issue , with a growing body of people rejecting their kenyan identity in favor of tribal allegiances and support for the politicians that represent that tribe .
a growing number of middle-class families are taking their children out of the boarding schools around nairobi and moving them back to their home areas , where protection is more assured when things go wrong .
this , along with middle-class houses in nairobi being threatened during the previous riots in the city because they were owned by the " wrong tribe " as perceived by the passing hordes as they streamed out of the slums deep inside the city , only accentuates this perception of an " us and them " mentality within the country .
the annan process and the coalition government have talked about the need for constitutional reform again as part of the longer-term assurance of stability within the country .
if these issues of the growing fractionalization and tribalism of the country , combined with the poor civic education process on the core issues of the constitutional reform process , are not resolved , then any voting in a referendum can only be , at best , based on what their political leaders tell them is best or worst for their tribe alone .
this can only be exacerbated by the inherent instability of the upcoming interim government as tribal priorities and past resentments form the major part of the daily operations of the parliament .
so what are the prospects for peace in kenya ?
slim at best .
the next year will be the defining period , where the country either finds its purpose again to come out of this as a stronger more cohesive nation or it slips further into the quagmire of tribal chauvinism and towards a dictatorship or a failed state .
i hope for the former , but i 'm not holding my breath .

however , a constitutional review was carried out during the last two parliaments , with wide-spread consultations and formal deliberations , which , in the end , came to nothing .
as a result , the concentration of power remains with the presidency .
one of the main problems with the previous attempt to revise and reinvigorate the constitution was the insistence that the changes should be open to a public referendum .
although there was some civic education carried out during this previous process , the time and information required by constituents to make an informed decision on issues as complex as constitutional amendments , when they have been completely and actively excluded from the process of governance for the history of the country , was both immense and very time consuming .
neither of which was taken into account during the process .
the vote in the end became a protest against the sitting government rather than on any real understanding and appreciation of the content of the amendments , much in the same way as the french voted on the eu constitution .
the balkanization of the country stemming from the post-election violence will only exacerbate this issue , with a growing body of people rejecting their kenyan identity in favor of tribal allegiances and support for the politicians that represent that tribe .
a growing number of middle-class families are taking their children out of the boarding schools around nairobi and moving them back to their home areas , where protection is more assured when things go wrong .
this , along with middle-class houses in nairobi being threatened during the previous riots in the city because they were owned by the " wrong tribe " as perceived by the passing hordes as they streamed out of the slums deep inside the city , only accentuates this perception of an " us and them " mentality within the country .
the annan process and the coalition government have talked about the need for constitutional reform again as part of the longer-term assurance of stability within the country .
if these issues of the growing fractionalization and tribalism of the country , combined with the poor civic education process on the core issues of the constitutional reform process , are not resolved , then any voting in a referendum can only be , at best , based on what their political leaders tell them is best or worst for their tribe alone .
this can only be exacerbated by the inherent instability of the upcoming interim government as tribal priorities and past resentments form the major part of the daily operations of the parliament .
so what are the prospects for peace in kenya ?
slim at best .
the next year will be the defining period , where the country either finds its purpose again to come out of this as a stronger more cohesive nation or it slips further into the quagmire of tribal chauvinism and towards a dictatorship or a failed state .

all this , of course , is mainly within the capital of nairobi .
the rest of the country remains in a state of fear of reprisal killings , police brutality and the overpowering dread that this is not the last time this will happen in this country .
the daily beheadings , burnings and rapes of people caught in the wrong ethnic region of the country have - as far as reporting is concerned - almost come to an end .
however , a number of eyewitness stories that i have been told still tell of random killings by both civilian-formed militias as well as by the police themselves .
this can only make one fear that the real number of deaths within the country , currently estimated around 1,000 , falls extremely short .
against this backdrop of returning normality and the low-level conflicts and killings pervasive within the rest of the country , outside of nairobi and mombassa , the kofi annan-sponsored reconciliation talks have been taking place and have made remarkably rapid and relatively painless progress towards resolving the crisis .
the real test of this ' almost resolution ' is yet to come along with kenya 's greatest ordeal : the challenging of its idea of nationhood , reconciliation and , above all , its humanity .
there is every chance that the annan discussions will lead to a short-term solution to the electoral crisis of last year and a power-sharing government of national unity , or some other form of interim government , will be formed and posts suitably allocated to the various aggrieved parties .
however , a number of critical issues from the past - and for the future - raise fundamental questions about the stability of any potential interim government and the real prospects for peace and stability within the country .
raila odinga , the losing presidential candidate from the december elections and main protagonist within the current crisis , has already been in a coalition once before with mwai kibaki , the current president of kenya .
that time the coalition was made through common cause and mutual agreement rather than being resentfully forced through .
even so , the partnership between odinga and kibaki lasted only a matter of months prior to odinga withdrawing from the government over accusations of betrayals of faith on previous agreements on power-sharing .
this shared history does not bode well for the stability of the government to come .
and it could be expected that the 10th parliament , which is just forming , will be precarious at best , with various people and parties just biding their time and resources until the next fight for ultimate control .
if any real , lasting peace is to be achieved in kenya , serious constitutional review will need to take place that allows for a fairer and devolved system of government .

" nato never fought a ground war until the afghanistan war , " burns said .
" nato 's future is so much on the line . "
britain 's paddy ashdown , a former united nations envoy to bosnia who withdrew as a " super envoy " to afghanistan , said defeat is a possibility for nato .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de sports -pipe- 15.02.2008 german basketball struggles for sponsors , recognition großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : some say the sport will succeed when children discover its beauty despite growing interest among youth , german basketball is struggling , with club-player membership down and pro teams fighting for survival .
but aficionados say it 's the system , not the sport , that 's at fault . just over a decade ago , things were looking up for basketball in germany .
at the 1992 olympics in barcelona , coverage focused on the us " dream team , " which featured an assembly of all-time b-ball greats including michael jordan , magic johnson , larry bird and charles barkley .
just a year later , the german men 's team caused a sensation when it won the european championship on its home turf . mirroring the sport 's wild growth across the atlantic at the time , hoops began mushrooming on playgrounds and schoolyards around the country - giving german kids their first opportunity to dribble a ball outside a gym .
in addition , lifestyle companies like nike and adidas took to sponsoring streetball tournaments in the bigger cities . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the mavericks ' nowitzki was 2007 mvp the era marked a high point in popularity for basketball in germany , when the number of people officially registered to play in basketball clubs reached around 200,000 , said dirk kaiser , spokesman for the german pro-basketball league , bundesliga basketball -lrb- bbl -rrb- . earlier start - but no follow-through but it seems a few summers flirting with a sport rooted deeply in us culture were not enough to win the undying love of soccer-mad germans . today , the number of registered players has receded to around 193,000 , although kaiser estimates about three to four times as many people - " potentially a million " - play streetball or in unregistered pickup games around the country . as a spectator sport , basketball is somewhere around third or fourth place , alongside ice hockey but well behind handball -lrb- number two -rrb- and miles out of the league of soccer , germany 's all-encompassing sports monolith . despite kids getting in touch with the sport at a much younger age than they used to , germany 's basketball federation " is n't doing a good job " of getting kids to go on to play in the clubs , said andre voigt , editor in chief of the german basketball magazine five .
in germany , competitive sports are much more closely tied to clubs than to schools . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : greece were euro champs , germany second , in 2005 " there are always polls of kids and their interests that show a great deal of interest in basketball .
often it even beats soccer .
but they are n't going on to play later , " voigt said .
" it 's a complex problem . " one major aspect of the problem is the lack of a strong domestic league with national basketball stars . " it 's obvious that kids interested in basketball today know more about the nba players than they do about the guys who play here , " voigt said . german-player quote - high enough ? in 2005 , the bbl tried to improve the situation by ruling that at least three of the 12 players on the roster have to be germans .
voigt called the quota " kind of low , " saying that court time in the pro leagues is necessary for germans to develop enough home-grown talent to field good national teams for european championships .
otherwise germany could n't hold its own against more basketball oriented countries like greece or spain . but more worrisome than keeping german players active , is the question of how to keep the teams alive at all . earlier this month , the cologne 99ers announced bankruptcy , despite a string of successes .
the move came after the team 's corporate sponsor , rhineenergie , pulled its support and a private financier failed to come through with enough cash to carry the team . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : is there life after bankruptcy in basketball ?
likewise , pharmaceutical giant bayer announced it would cease funding any pro teams except soccer , leaving its giants basketball players searching for a new owner .
and teams in ulm and giessen are both facing shaky futures because of sponsorship problems .
catch-22 sponsorship debacle the problem of sponsorship is , in fact , a tricky one .
sponsors see sports teams as a marketing vehicle , ideally to reach television audience .
but german free tv does n't carry league basketball play ; it is found either on pay channels or the internet .
so big sponsors drop out , pulling support from the teams , in turn weakening the sport , which then lowers the chances of having a strong following . and the cycle continues .
german national team coach dirk bauermann told the european basketball association , fiba , that the tv issue is " a huge concern . "
" if we do n't find ways to get in free television , we 're going to continue to lose sponsors , " he told the fiba web site .
it would be a " tragedy " if the league were to lose such established winning clubs as leverkusen and köln , he said .
' they 've got to go after the kids ' five 's voigt acknowledged that the tv coverage situation is a problem , but thinks that a little time , and some smart moves by german basketball organizations , could fix things in the long run .
" i do n't think the basketball associations should be trying to sway 20- and 30-year olds .
they 've got to go after the kids .
they have to go into the schools and grab the seven and eight year olds , and let them know how beautiful the sport is , " voigt said .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : cologne 's team was doing well when its support got pulled " if we get kids to play in bigger numbers than now , then we 'll generate better players , more viewers , get more people engaged , and more sponsors , " he added .
" this will take more than two or three years .
but it 's the only way to improve the situation in the long run . "
missing the boat on nowitzki ?
some critics say top basketball officials are missing a golden opportunity to win converts by failing to adequately exploit germany 's most important basketball resource : dirk nowitzki .
nowitzki , a seven-foot -lrb- 2.1-meter -rrb- power forward for the us national basketball association 's dallas mavericks , was voted the league 's most valuable player in 2007 .
germany should be making more of the fact that the man nicknamed the " bavarian bomber " was born and bred in wuerzburg , voigt said .
" he is the last global sports icon we have , now that boris becker left tennis and michael schumacher left racing , " said voigt .
" everyone knows about him - that 's he 's very tall , a great athlete , and he earns a lot of money . "
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : in summer , nowitzki plays for the german national team nowitzki does come to germany in the summers , to play for the german national team at the european championships , which are run under the aegis of the german basketball federation -lrb- dbb -rrb- .
the biggest problem with making him a full-time ambassador for basketball in germany is time , bbl 's kaiser said .
" there 's only so much he can do in a couple of months , and he has to be careful not to do too much .
i think the german basketball federation does as much with him as they can , " he said . jennifer abramsohn send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

just a year later , the german men 's team caused a sensation when it won the european championship on its home turf . mirroring the sport 's wild growth across the atlantic at the time , hoops began mushrooming on playgrounds and schoolyards around the country - giving german kids their first opportunity to dribble a ball outside a gym .

otherwise germany could n't hold its own against more basketball oriented countries like greece or spain . but more worrisome than keeping german players active , is the question of how to keep the teams alive at all . earlier this month , the cologne 99ers announced bankruptcy , despite a string of successes .

catch-22 sponsorship debacle the problem of sponsorship is , in fact , a tricky one .
sponsors see sports teams as a marketing vehicle , ideally to reach television audience .

so big sponsors drop out , pulling support from the teams , in turn weakening the sport , which then lowers the chances of having a strong following . and the cycle continues .
german national team coach dirk bauermann told the european basketball association , fiba , that the tv issue is " a huge concern . "
" if we do n't find ways to get in free television , we 're going to continue to lose sponsors , " he told the fiba web site .
it would be a " tragedy " if the league were to lose such established winning clubs as leverkusen and köln , he said .
' they 've got to go after the kids ' five 's voigt acknowledged that the tv coverage situation is a problem , but thinks that a little time , and some smart moves by german basketball organizations , could fix things in the long run .
" i do n't think the basketball associations should be trying to sway 20- and 30-year olds .
they 've got to go after the kids .
they have to go into the schools and grab the seven and eight year olds , and let them know how beautiful the sport is , " voigt said .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : cologne 's team was doing well when its support got pulled " if we get kids to play in bigger numbers than now , then we 'll generate better players , more viewers , get more people engaged , and more sponsors , " he added .
" this will take more than two or three years .
but it 's the only way to improve the situation in the long run . "
missing the boat on nowitzki ?
some critics say top basketball officials are missing a golden opportunity to win converts by failing to adequately exploit germany 's most important basketball resource : dirk nowitzki .
nowitzki , a seven-foot -lrb- 2.1-meter -rrb- power forward for the us national basketball association 's dallas mavericks , was voted the league 's most valuable player in 2007 .
germany should be making more of the fact that the man nicknamed the " bavarian bomber " was born and bred in wuerzburg , voigt said .
" he is the last global sports icon we have , now that boris becker left tennis and michael schumacher left racing , " said voigt .
" everyone knows about him - that 's he 's very tall , a great athlete , and he earns a lot of money . "

but aficionados say it 's the system , not the sport , that 's at fault . just over a decade ago , things were looking up for basketball in germany .
at the 1992 olympics in barcelona , coverage focused on the us " dream team , " which featured an assembly of all-time b-ball greats including michael jordan , magic johnson , larry bird and charles barkley .
just a year later , the german men 's team caused a sensation when it won the european championship on its home turf . mirroring the sport 's wild growth across the atlantic at the time , hoops began mushrooming on playgrounds and schoolyards around the country - giving german kids their first opportunity to dribble a ball outside a gym .

but they are n't going on to play later , " voigt said .

" it 's obvious that kids interested in basketball today know more about the nba players than they do about the guys who play here , " voigt said . german-player quote - high enough ? in 2005 , the bbl tried to improve the situation by ruling that at least three of the 12 players on the roster have to be germans .
voigt called the quota " kind of low , " saying that court time in the pro leagues is necessary for germans to develop enough home-grown talent to field good national teams for european championships .
otherwise germany could n't hold its own against more basketball oriented countries like greece or spain . but more worrisome than keeping german players active , is the question of how to keep the teams alive at all . earlier this month , the cologne 99ers announced bankruptcy , despite a string of successes .
the move came after the team 's corporate sponsor , rhineenergie , pulled its support and a private financier failed to come through with enough cash to carry the team . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : is there life after bankruptcy in basketball ?
likewise , pharmaceutical giant bayer announced it would cease funding any pro teams except soccer , leaving its giants basketball players searching for a new owner .
and teams in ulm and giessen are both facing shaky futures because of sponsorship problems .
catch-22 sponsorship debacle the problem of sponsorship is , in fact , a tricky one .
sponsors see sports teams as a marketing vehicle , ideally to reach television audience .
but german free tv does n't carry league basketball play ; it is found either on pay channels or the internet .
so big sponsors drop out , pulling support from the teams , in turn weakening the sport , which then lowers the chances of having a strong following . and the cycle continues .
german national team coach dirk bauermann told the european basketball association , fiba , that the tv issue is " a huge concern . "
" if we do n't find ways to get in free television , we 're going to continue to lose sponsors , " he told the fiba web site .
it would be a " tragedy " if the league were to lose such established winning clubs as leverkusen and köln , he said .
' they 've got to go after the kids ' five 's voigt acknowledged that the tv coverage situation is a problem , but thinks that a little time , and some smart moves by german basketball organizations , could fix things in the long run .
" i do n't think the basketball associations should be trying to sway 20- and 30-year olds .
they 've got to go after the kids .
they have to go into the schools and grab the seven and eight year olds , and let them know how beautiful the sport is , " voigt said .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : cologne 's team was doing well when its support got pulled " if we get kids to play in bigger numbers than now , then we 'll generate better players , more viewers , get more people engaged , and more sponsors , " he added .
" this will take more than two or three years .
but it 's the only way to improve the situation in the long run . "
missing the boat on nowitzki ?
some critics say top basketball officials are missing a golden opportunity to win converts by failing to adequately exploit germany 's most important basketball resource : dirk nowitzki .
nowitzki , a seven-foot -lrb- 2.1-meter -rrb- power forward for the us national basketball association 's dallas mavericks , was voted the league 's most valuable player in 2007 .
germany should be making more of the fact that the man nicknamed the " bavarian bomber " was born and bred in wuerzburg , voigt said .
" he is the last global sports icon we have , now that boris becker left tennis and michael schumacher left racing , " said voigt .
" everyone knows about him - that 's he 's very tall , a great athlete , and he earns a lot of money . "

15 . " the german government today accepted mr. zumwinkel 's offer to resign , " chancellor angela merkel told reporters in berlin .
" i consider this to be in unavoidable step considering what has happened . " zumwinkel , who is suspected of evading 1 million euros -lrb- $ 1.5 million -rrb- worth of taxes through a foundation in liechtenstein , also stepped down from his position on the supervisory board of deutsche telekom , the government spokesmen indicated . " in a large number of cases , key personalities from our country sought to avoid their duty of solidarity via taxation by practicing fiscal evasion to liechtenstein , " a finance ministry spokesman told reporters the daily sueddeutsche zeitung said in editions to appear saturday that some 3.4 billion euros was involved . albig urged those involved to file corrected returns detailing their tax evasion - a device known as " self-reporting " under german law and aimed at allowing offenders to reduce possible penalties . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the future looks bleak the financial times deutschland wrote that it was unlikely that zumwinkel would take a seat on the deutsche post group 's supervisory board , as would normally have been the case when his contract expired in november .
he has been head of deutsche post for 18 years . corporate elite under scrutiny the issue of tax breaks , massive salaries and corporate " extras " for high-powered german executives has come to a head in recent months , with increasing numbers of politicians joining in the growing public furor over the perceived immunity and privileges enjoyed by the country 's business elite . the german population , which places a high value on social and financial probity , was already shocked last year by scandals at two industrial titans , the engineering giant siemens and the biggest european car maker , volkswagen . german finance minister peer steinbrueck admitted the investigation was damaging the already shaky state of public confidence . " the moral damage is considerable - just as it was with his dealing with his share options , " steinbrueck told a group of journalists on his way into parliament . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : after being held by police , zumwinkel was later released in a controversial move , zumwinkel sold 200,000 share options worth 2.24 million euros in december just after deutsche post 's share price rose following a deal to introduce a minimum wage that would affect lower-cost rivals .
he later said his actions were a regrettable mistake . " if the public has something like this as a role model then they 'll start having doubts about this economic and social system , " steinbrueck added .
" i did n't think this was possible . " peter struck , the leader of the social democratic parliamentary faction , added : " when someone has so much money and nevertheless believes there is a need to hide money from the state , then a lot of people will believe there is a lack of justice .
the ordinary taxpayer has to pay his taxes to the tax office . " merkel 's spokesman , ulrich wilhelm , said the chancellor regretted the fact that zumwinkel had not made a public statement on his position since police raided his home and office at dawn on thursday . wilhelm said the highly publicized scandal would be discussed when merkel meets liechtenstein prime minister otmar halser on wednesday . german police searched zumwinkel 's villa in western cologne and deutsche post 's headquarters in bonn as the tax probe became public . the chief executive was taken under police escort from his home in the upmarket marienburg part of cologne to the prosecutors ' office in the city of bochum some five hours after the raids .
investigators also removed boxes from the house . after zumwinkel had posted what prosecutors described as " a not inconsiderable bond , " an arrest warrant was lifted and he was allowed to leave . investigation may unearth other big names bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : whose tax returns will be next to come under scrutiny ?
the business daily handelsblatt said the raids were part of a series of probes into tax evasion totaling around 10 million euros deposited in liechtenstein , the principality bordering switzerland and austria , and that other raids would follow across germany . hundreds of suspects had been uncovered by investigating the activities of lgt , a liechtenstein bank .
" we 've cracked the whole bank , " one investigator told handelsblatt . there is speculation that more of germany 's rich and powerful business leaders may be involved . lgt spokesman bernd junkers in liechtenstein told reuters that the bank , controlled by the principality 's princely family , had taken note of the handelsblatt report but could not comment in detail further . from savior to pariah bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the tower that klaus built the longest-serving chief of a dax company , the frankfurt blue-chip index , zumwinkel was credited with transforming the postal service into a world leader in logistics , with more than half a million employees , and a german leader in retail banking via its extensive postbank network . but he had also been sharply criticized for selling the large stock holding after the imposition of a minimum wage for postal workers boosted deutsche post shares last year following a fight for the unprecedented german legislation , which , in effect , protected deutsche post from lower-cost competition . dw staff -lrb- nda -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

we never think about losing in munich . " aberdeen were hoping to repeat a quarter-final win over the bundesliga leaders 25 years ago on their way to lifting the european cup winners ' cup . they took a surprise lead in the 24th minute when josh walker rifled in a shot from more than 20 meters . bayern had already missed chances , but klose made no mistake with a shot on the turn into the roof of the net five minutes later . aberdeen went back in front when sone aluko beat michael rensing - in goal for the flu-ridden oliver kahn - with a low shot from inside the area three minutes before half-time . bayern again leveled after a ze roberto cross struck alan maybury on the arm and spanish referee eduardo iturralde gonzalez awarded a penalty .

steinmeier entrusted the job to erler . the nuts and bolts of power-sharing erler 's task was to explain the workings of merkel 's grand coalition between her center-right christian democrats and the social democrats , of which the minister is a member . " my visit was a surprise to all , " erler told german daily sueddeutsche zeitung on the last day of his mission .
" but then everyone was really interested and had a lot of questions . " erler said his job was to explain the complicated arithmetic underlying the power-sharing model in germany and how such a consensus-based system worked .
germany 's grand coalition came into being after federal elections in 2005 , ending two months of political uncertainty after merkel 's conservatives won a wafer-thin majority . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : erler said it kenyans need to see if the german political model could be adapted for nairobi " my job was to present the model so that the kenyans can see if a similar system could work for them , " erler said .
the minister had also brought along an english version of germany 's coalition agreement with him so that the kenyans could spend time studying it . though berlin has never had to deal with the levels of violence that followed kenya 's election last month , the grand coalition model is considered a useful one in deadlocked political situations .
erler is expected to back in berlin by friday . no quick answers to kenya 's problems kenya went through weeks of violence after kibaki 's party claimed victory in a dec .
27 poll that observers said was hugely flawed by rigging .
the crisis is estimated to have killed 1,000 people and made more than 300,000 homeless .
the turmoil has shattered kenya 's image as one of africa 's most stable democracies . experts have said that annan is impatient for progress and in favor of holding a new election and some form of shared government . kibaki and odinga have already missed a mid-february deadline set by annan to reach a political agreement .
the former un chief had said he wanted underlying problems including land and wealth disparities tackled in a year . annan said friday that an agreement that would put an end to political chaos was " very close " and added that he hoped that the " last difficult and frightening " step would be taken next week . other than annan , however , few expect kenya 's political deadlock to be resolved swiftly , saying the two sides have yet to strike a deal on the most contentious issue - the structure of the government . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : kibaki , center , shakes hands with opposition leader raila odinga , right , analysts have pointed out that division of cabinet and civil service jobs would likely be a source of wrangling between kibaki and odinga as well issues such as reforming the constitution and a new electoral law . " a power-sharing system in which the principal participants are deeply suspicious of each other is difficult enough to manage , " kenyan political columnist , macharia gaitho told news agency reuters . in a bid to shore up annan 's mission , us president george w. bush this week said secretary of state condoleezza rice will head to kenya to tell its leaders there must be a return to democracy . dw staff -lrb- sp -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

three previous rounds of voting last week failed , prompting feverish negotiations and pressure from both camps on lawmakers to switch sides . svejnar , 55 , said he had no regrets after a fiercely fought contest in which he portrayed himself as candidate of " change . " " even if i was not elected , it was not for nothing , " svejnar said . an economics graduate and a political veteran , klaus was prime minister from 1992 to 1997 and parliamentary speaker from 1998 to 2002 . he remains known for his conservative credentials , emphasizing the importance of traditional values during the campaign . " if you do not want to respect our thousands of year old civilization , its christian values and emphasis on the traditional family and respect for each individual life , do not vote for me , " he had said . strong euroskeptic a fierce euroskeptic who is opposed to any transfer of powers from nation states to the eu , klaus has also stirred controversy by challenging the dangers of global warming . however , european commission president jose manuel barroso was swift to congratulate klaus on his victory . " i hope for your commitment to our joint effort in preserving the european values and tackling the challenges europe faces today , " barroso said in a message to him . the czech republic takes over the bloc 's rotating eu presidency in the first half of 2009 . dw staff -lrb- sp -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de opinion -pipe- 15.02.2008 opinion : kenya solutions threaten to repeat historical mistakes großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the proposals put forward by former un secretary general kofi annan to stabilize kenya may focus on cooperation and compromise , but the real roots of the problem are being ignored , said dw guest commentator allan duncan . a month has passed since the current troubles in kenya began and some sense of normality is now returning to the country ; people are returning to work , schools are reopening and the rush hour traffic jams are coming back .
all this , of course , is mainly within the capital of nairobi .
the rest of the country remains in a state of fear of reprisal killings , police brutality and the overpowering dread that this is not the last time this will happen in this country .
the daily beheadings , burnings and rapes of people caught in the wrong ethnic region of the country have - as far as reporting is concerned - almost come to an end .
however , a number of eyewitness stories that i have been told still tell of random killings by both civilian-formed militias as well as by the police themselves .
this can only make one fear that the real number of deaths within the country , currently estimated around 1,000 , falls extremely short .
against this backdrop of returning normality and the low-level conflicts and killings pervasive within the rest of the country , outside of nairobi and mombassa , the kofi annan-sponsored reconciliation talks have been taking place and have made remarkably rapid and relatively painless progress towards resolving the crisis .
the real test of this ' almost resolution ' is yet to come along with kenya 's greatest ordeal : the challenging of its idea of nationhood , reconciliation and , above all , its humanity .
there is every chance that the annan discussions will lead to a short-term solution to the electoral crisis of last year and a power-sharing government of national unity , or some other form of interim government , will be formed and posts suitably allocated to the various aggrieved parties .
however , a number of critical issues from the past - and for the future - raise fundamental questions about the stability of any potential interim government and the real prospects for peace and stability within the country .
raila odinga , the losing presidential candidate from the december elections and main protagonist within the current crisis , has already been in a coalition once before with mwai kibaki , the current president of kenya .
that time the coalition was made through common cause and mutual agreement rather than being resentfully forced through .
even so , the partnership between odinga and kibaki lasted only a matter of months prior to odinga withdrawing from the government over accusations of betrayals of faith on previous agreements on power-sharing .
this shared history does not bode well for the stability of the government to come .
and it could be expected that the 10th parliament , which is just forming , will be precarious at best , with various people and parties just biding their time and resources until the next fight for ultimate control .
if any real , lasting peace is to be achieved in kenya , serious constitutional review will need to take place that allows for a fairer and devolved system of government .
the constitution has been revised several times over the last few decades , most of which applied to the consolidation of power within the presidency and the ruling party .
however , a constitutional review was carried out during the last two parliaments , with wide-spread consultations and formal deliberations , which , in the end , came to nothing .
as a result , the concentration of power remains with the presidency .
one of the main problems with the previous attempt to revise and reinvigorate the constitution was the insistence that the changes should be open to a public referendum .
although there was some civic education carried out during this previous process , the time and information required by constituents to make an informed decision on issues as complex as constitutional amendments , when they have been completely and actively excluded from the process of governance for the history of the country , was both immense and very time consuming .
neither of which was taken into account during the process .
the vote in the end became a protest against the sitting government rather than on any real understanding and appreciation of the content of the amendments , much in the same way as the french voted on the eu constitution .
the balkanization of the country stemming from the post-election violence will only exacerbate this issue , with a growing body of people rejecting their kenyan identity in favor of tribal allegiances and support for the politicians that represent that tribe .
a growing number of middle-class families are taking their children out of the boarding schools around nairobi and moving them back to their home areas , where protection is more assured when things go wrong .
this , along with middle-class houses in nairobi being threatened during the previous riots in the city because they were owned by the " wrong tribe " as perceived by the passing hordes as they streamed out of the slums deep inside the city , only accentuates this perception of an " us and them " mentality within the country .
the annan process and the coalition government have talked about the need for constitutional reform again as part of the longer-term assurance of stability within the country .
if these issues of the growing fractionalization and tribalism of the country , combined with the poor civic education process on the core issues of the constitutional reform process , are not resolved , then any voting in a referendum can only be , at best , based on what their political leaders tell them is best or worst for their tribe alone .
this can only be exacerbated by the inherent instability of the upcoming interim government as tribal priorities and past resentments form the major part of the daily operations of the parliament .
so what are the prospects for peace in kenya ?
slim at best .
the next year will be the defining period , where the country either finds its purpose again to come out of this as a stronger more cohesive nation or it slips further into the quagmire of tribal chauvinism and towards a dictatorship or a failed state .
i hope for the former , but i 'm not holding my breath .

us undersecretary of state nicholas burns said in a speech earlier this week that nine of nato 's members were carrying 95 percent of the burden in afghanistan .

canada and the netherlands , which also have troops in southern afghanistan , have suffered too many casualties and have domestic resistance to increasing troops .
that has increased pressure on france and germany , neither of which has troops in the south .
it 's thought that merkel and france 's nicolas sarkozy will want to bring promises of additional troops to a nato summit in bucharest in april .
" super envoy " badly needed the us 's burns also said it was necessary for the un to speedily appoint a strong " super envoy " with a centralized mandate .
a " super envoy " would coordinate military , aid and development activities which are seen as important to counter insurgency .
ashdown withdrew his name after afghan president hamid karzai opposed the appointment .

german national team coach dirk bauermann told the european basketball association , fiba , that the tv issue is " a huge concern . "
" if we do n't find ways to get in free television , we 're going to continue to lose sponsors , " he told the fiba web site .

" i do n't think the basketball associations should be trying to sway 20- and 30-year olds .
they 've got to go after the kids .
they have to go into the schools and grab the seven and eight year olds , and let them know how beautiful the sport is , " voigt said .

missing the boat on nowitzki ?
some critics say top basketball officials are missing a golden opportunity to win converts by failing to adequately exploit germany 's most important basketball resource : dirk nowitzki .
nowitzki , a seven-foot -lrb- 2.1-meter -rrb- power forward for the us national basketball association 's dallas mavericks , was voted the league 's most valuable player in 2007 .
germany should be making more of the fact that the man nicknamed the " bavarian bomber " was born and bred in wuerzburg , voigt said .
" he is the last global sports icon we have , now that boris becker left tennis and michael schumacher left racing , " said voigt .

germany should be making more of the fact that the man nicknamed the " bavarian bomber " was born and bred in wuerzburg , voigt said .
" he is the last global sports icon we have , now that boris becker left tennis and michael schumacher left racing , " said voigt .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de sports -pipe- 15.02.2008 german basketball struggles for sponsors , recognition großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : some say the sport will succeed when children discover its beauty despite growing interest among youth , german basketball is struggling , with club-player membership down and pro teams fighting for survival .
but aficionados say it 's the system , not the sport , that 's at fault . just over a decade ago , things were looking up for basketball in germany .
at the 1992 olympics in barcelona , coverage focused on the us " dream team , " which featured an assembly of all-time b-ball greats including michael jordan , magic johnson , larry bird and charles barkley .
just a year later , the german men 's team caused a sensation when it won the european championship on its home turf . mirroring the sport 's wild growth across the atlantic at the time , hoops began mushrooming on playgrounds and schoolyards around the country - giving german kids their first opportunity to dribble a ball outside a gym .
in addition , lifestyle companies like nike and adidas took to sponsoring streetball tournaments in the bigger cities . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the mavericks ' nowitzki was 2007 mvp the era marked a high point in popularity for basketball in germany , when the number of people officially registered to play in basketball clubs reached around 200,000 , said dirk kaiser , spokesman for the german pro-basketball league , bundesliga basketball -lrb- bbl -rrb- . earlier start - but no follow-through but it seems a few summers flirting with a sport rooted deeply in us culture were not enough to win the undying love of soccer-mad germans . today , the number of registered players has receded to around 193,000 , although kaiser estimates about three to four times as many people - " potentially a million " - play streetball or in unregistered pickup games around the country . as a spectator sport , basketball is somewhere around third or fourth place , alongside ice hockey but well behind handball -lrb- number two -rrb- and miles out of the league of soccer , germany 's all-encompassing sports monolith . despite kids getting in touch with the sport at a much younger age than they used to , germany 's basketball federation " is n't doing a good job " of getting kids to go on to play in the clubs , said andre voigt , editor in chief of the german basketball magazine five .
in germany , competitive sports are much more closely tied to clubs than to schools . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : greece were euro champs , germany second , in 2005 " there are always polls of kids and their interests that show a great deal of interest in basketball .
often it even beats soccer .
but they are n't going on to play later , " voigt said .
" it 's a complex problem . " one major aspect of the problem is the lack of a strong domestic league with national basketball stars . " it 's obvious that kids interested in basketball today know more about the nba players than they do about the guys who play here , " voigt said . german-player quote - high enough ? in 2005 , the bbl tried to improve the situation by ruling that at least three of the 12 players on the roster have to be germans .
voigt called the quota " kind of low , " saying that court time in the pro leagues is necessary for germans to develop enough home-grown talent to field good national teams for european championships .
otherwise germany could n't hold its own against more basketball oriented countries like greece or spain . but more worrisome than keeping german players active , is the question of how to keep the teams alive at all . earlier this month , the cologne 99ers announced bankruptcy , despite a string of successes .
the move came after the team 's corporate sponsor , rhineenergie , pulled its support and a private financier failed to come through with enough cash to carry the team . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : is there life after bankruptcy in basketball ?
likewise , pharmaceutical giant bayer announced it would cease funding any pro teams except soccer , leaving its giants basketball players searching for a new owner .
and teams in ulm and giessen are both facing shaky futures because of sponsorship problems .
catch-22 sponsorship debacle the problem of sponsorship is , in fact , a tricky one .
sponsors see sports teams as a marketing vehicle , ideally to reach television audience .
but german free tv does n't carry league basketball play ; it is found either on pay channels or the internet .
so big sponsors drop out , pulling support from the teams , in turn weakening the sport , which then lowers the chances of having a strong following . and the cycle continues .
german national team coach dirk bauermann told the european basketball association , fiba , that the tv issue is " a huge concern . "
" if we do n't find ways to get in free television , we 're going to continue to lose sponsors , " he told the fiba web site .
it would be a " tragedy " if the league were to lose such established winning clubs as leverkusen and köln , he said .
' they 've got to go after the kids ' five 's voigt acknowledged that the tv coverage situation is a problem , but thinks that a little time , and some smart moves by german basketball organizations , could fix things in the long run .
" i do n't think the basketball associations should be trying to sway 20- and 30-year olds .
they 've got to go after the kids .
they have to go into the schools and grab the seven and eight year olds , and let them know how beautiful the sport is , " voigt said .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : cologne 's team was doing well when its support got pulled " if we get kids to play in bigger numbers than now , then we 'll generate better players , more viewers , get more people engaged , and more sponsors , " he added .
" this will take more than two or three years .
but it 's the only way to improve the situation in the long run . "

steinmeier entrusted the job to erler . the nuts and bolts of power-sharing erler 's task was to explain the workings of merkel 's grand coalition between her center-right christian democrats and the social democrats , of which the minister is a member . " my visit was a surprise to all , " erler told german daily sueddeutsche zeitung on the last day of his mission .
" but then everyone was really interested and had a lot of questions . " erler said his job was to explain the complicated arithmetic underlying the power-sharing model in germany and how such a consensus-based system worked .
germany 's grand coalition came into being after federal elections in 2005 , ending two months of political uncertainty after merkel 's conservatives won a wafer-thin majority . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : erler said it kenyans need to see if the german political model could be adapted for nairobi " my job was to present the model so that the kenyans can see if a similar system could work for them , " erler said .
the minister had also brought along an english version of germany 's coalition agreement with him so that the kenyans could spend time studying it . though berlin has never had to deal with the levels of violence that followed kenya 's election last month , the grand coalition model is considered a useful one in deadlocked political situations .
erler is expected to back in berlin by friday . no quick answers to kenya 's problems kenya went through weeks of violence after kibaki 's party claimed victory in a dec .
27 poll that observers said was hugely flawed by rigging .
the crisis is estimated to have killed 1,000 people and made more than 300,000 homeless .
the turmoil has shattered kenya 's image as one of africa 's most stable democracies . experts have said that annan is impatient for progress and in favor of holding a new election and some form of shared government . kibaki and odinga have already missed a mid-february deadline set by annan to reach a political agreement .
the former un chief had said he wanted underlying problems including land and wealth disparities tackled in a year . annan said friday that an agreement that would put an end to political chaos was " very close " and added that he hoped that the " last difficult and frightening " step would be taken next week . other than annan , however , few expect kenya 's political deadlock to be resolved swiftly , saying the two sides have yet to strike a deal on the most contentious issue - the structure of the government . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : kibaki , center , shakes hands with opposition leader raila odinga , right , analysts have pointed out that division of cabinet and civil service jobs would likely be a source of wrangling between kibaki and odinga as well issues such as reforming the constitution and a new electoral law . " a power-sharing system in which the principal participants are deeply suspicious of each other is difficult enough to manage , " kenyan political columnist , macharia gaitho told news agency reuters . in a bid to shore up annan 's mission , us president george w. bush this week said secretary of state condoleezza rice will head to kenya to tell its leaders there must be a return to democracy . dw staff -lrb- sp -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

otherwise , things could get ugly . the resignation serves as a confession : klaus zumwinkel realized that he could not remain ceo of one of germany 's largest companies and decided to face the consequences .
he did n't have a choice . it goes without saying that he has to give up his position at the top if he funneled money into liechtenstein 's tax paradise and did n't report the interest he 'd earned .
it 's called tax evasion . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : technically , he 's considered innocent until found guilty in a court of law or until he has made a formal confession , but it 's becoming more and more apparent that the evidence collected so far is just the tip of the iceberg . post chief is one of many several hundred wealthy germans , some of them celebrities , have also invested money in liechtenstein and hidden it from the german tax authorities .
now they have a big problem , too . klaus zumwinkel himself became the tip of the iceberg when the other tax evaders came under the radar of the public prosecutor 's office .
the alpine principality 's tax saving model is not quite as secure as many had thought .
the secrets at the large baronial bank have been cracked and officials have known for months who has money there and how much - including in the so-called family endowments . now the investigations have begun .
over the next few weeks , police and public prosecutors will pay visits to many of the tax evaders .
zumwinkel is merely the first of many . sympathy is not in order .
we 're not talking about the poorest of the poor but mainly about people who , even after properly paying their taxes , could still afford a hot lunch . greed conquered reason zumwinkel is n't the only one asking how it could come to this .
the answer is simple : greed was stronger than reason .
zumwinkel certainly did n't need to do what he did .
as the head of deutsche post , he not only collected an annual salary of 3.5 million euros -lrb- $ 5.1 million -rrb- but had also inherited a large sum of money at a young age . he would be wealthy even if he had paid the taxes he owed , just slightly less wealthy .
that 's also true of most of the others who will soon receive visits from the authorities .
none of them is poor ; rather they 're among the richest members of society - of the very society that made it possible for them to become as affluent as they are . if they have any brains at all , they should come out of hiding as soon as possible .
the german tax authorities are n't interested in punishment or even revenge - they just want the tax money owed to them .
that means that those who turn themselves in to the tax office and pay the missing taxes with interest before they 're investigated will get off without penalty . fine is least of the worries the tax evaders that do n't do this will have to face the full rigor of the law - and rightly so .
it 's always the wealthier part of society that complains about high taxes and takes advantage of every opportunity to reduce their own tax burden , either by legal means or illegally via liechtenstein . zumwinkel 's case - and the many more cases that are likely to follow in the coming weeks - shows what the outcome can be .
his reputation is ruined , his job has been lost and a hefty penalty is looming .

otherwise , things could get ugly . the resignation serves as a confession : klaus zumwinkel realized that he could not remain ceo of one of germany 's largest companies and decided to face the consequences .
he did n't have a choice . it goes without saying that he has to give up his position at the top if he funneled money into liechtenstein 's tax paradise and did n't report the interest he 'd earned .
it 's called tax evasion . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : technically , he 's considered innocent until found guilty in a court of law or until he has made a formal confession , but it 's becoming more and more apparent that the evidence collected so far is just the tip of the iceberg . post chief is one of many several hundred wealthy germans , some of them celebrities , have also invested money in liechtenstein and hidden it from the german tax authorities .
now they have a big problem , too . klaus zumwinkel himself became the tip of the iceberg when the other tax evaders came under the radar of the public prosecutor 's office .
the alpine principality 's tax saving model is not quite as secure as many had thought .
the secrets at the large baronial bank have been cracked and officials have known for months who has money there and how much - including in the so-called family endowments . now the investigations have begun .
over the next few weeks , police and public prosecutors will pay visits to many of the tax evaders .
zumwinkel is merely the first of many . sympathy is not in order .
we 're not talking about the poorest of the poor but mainly about people who , even after properly paying their taxes , could still afford a hot lunch . greed conquered reason zumwinkel is n't the only one asking how it could come to this .
the answer is simple : greed was stronger than reason .
zumwinkel certainly did n't need to do what he did .
as the head of deutsche post , he not only collected an annual salary of 3.5 million euros -lrb- $ 5.1 million -rrb- but had also inherited a large sum of money at a young age . he would be wealthy even if he had paid the taxes he owed , just slightly less wealthy .

some lawmakers even received bullets in the post . " the division of our political scene must not become a brake on our way forward , " klaus said after the vote .
" i will be the president of all citizens . " fiercely fought campaign klaus was nominated by the rightwing civic democrat party -lrb- ods -rrb- , which he founded , and which has been led since 2002 by mirek topolanek , the czech prime minister .

three previous rounds of voting last week failed , prompting feverish negotiations and pressure from both camps on lawmakers to switch sides . svejnar , 55 , said he had no regrets after a fiercely fought contest in which he portrayed himself as candidate of " change . " " even if i was not elected , it was not for nothing , " svejnar said . an economics graduate and a political veteran , klaus was prime minister from 1992 to 1997 and parliamentary speaker from 1998 to 2002 . he remains known for his conservative credentials , emphasizing the importance of traditional values during the campaign . " if you do not want to respect our thousands of year old civilization , its christian values and emphasis on the traditional family and respect for each individual life , do not vote for me , " he had said . strong euroskeptic a fierce euroskeptic who is opposed to any transfer of powers from nation states to the eu , klaus has also stirred controversy by challenging the dangers of global warming . however , european commission president jose manuel barroso was swift to congratulate klaus on his victory .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de sports -pipe- 15.02.2008 german basketball struggles for sponsors , recognition großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : some say the sport will succeed when children discover its beauty despite growing interest among youth , german basketball is struggling , with club-player membership down and pro teams fighting for survival .
but aficionados say it 's the system , not the sport , that 's at fault . just over a decade ago , things were looking up for basketball in germany .
at the 1992 olympics in barcelona , coverage focused on the us " dream team , " which featured an assembly of all-time b-ball greats including michael jordan , magic johnson , larry bird and charles barkley .
just a year later , the german men 's team caused a sensation when it won the european championship on its home turf . mirroring the sport 's wild growth across the atlantic at the time , hoops began mushrooming on playgrounds and schoolyards around the country - giving german kids their first opportunity to dribble a ball outside a gym .
in addition , lifestyle companies like nike and adidas took to sponsoring streetball tournaments in the bigger cities . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the mavericks ' nowitzki was 2007 mvp the era marked a high point in popularity for basketball in germany , when the number of people officially registered to play in basketball clubs reached around 200,000 , said dirk kaiser , spokesman for the german pro-basketball league , bundesliga basketball -lrb- bbl -rrb- . earlier start - but no follow-through but it seems a few summers flirting with a sport rooted deeply in us culture were not enough to win the undying love of soccer-mad germans . today , the number of registered players has receded to around 193,000 , although kaiser estimates about three to four times as many people - " potentially a million " - play streetball or in unregistered pickup games around the country . as a spectator sport , basketball is somewhere around third or fourth place , alongside ice hockey but well behind handball -lrb- number two -rrb- and miles out of the league of soccer , germany 's all-encompassing sports monolith . despite kids getting in touch with the sport at a much younger age than they used to , germany 's basketball federation " is n't doing a good job " of getting kids to go on to play in the clubs , said andre voigt , editor in chief of the german basketball magazine five .
in germany , competitive sports are much more closely tied to clubs than to schools . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : greece were euro champs , germany second , in 2005 " there are always polls of kids and their interests that show a great deal of interest in basketball .
often it even beats soccer .
but they are n't going on to play later , " voigt said .
" it 's a complex problem . " one major aspect of the problem is the lack of a strong domestic league with national basketball stars . " it 's obvious that kids interested in basketball today know more about the nba players than they do about the guys who play here , " voigt said . german-player quote - high enough ? in 2005 , the bbl tried to improve the situation by ruling that at least three of the 12 players on the roster have to be germans .
voigt called the quota " kind of low , " saying that court time in the pro leagues is necessary for germans to develop enough home-grown talent to field good national teams for european championships .
otherwise germany could n't hold its own against more basketball oriented countries like greece or spain . but more worrisome than keeping german players active , is the question of how to keep the teams alive at all . earlier this month , the cologne 99ers announced bankruptcy , despite a string of successes .
the move came after the team 's corporate sponsor , rhineenergie , pulled its support and a private financier failed to come through with enough cash to carry the team . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : is there life after bankruptcy in basketball ?
likewise , pharmaceutical giant bayer announced it would cease funding any pro teams except soccer , leaving its giants basketball players searching for a new owner .
and teams in ulm and giessen are both facing shaky futures because of sponsorship problems .
catch-22 sponsorship debacle the problem of sponsorship is , in fact , a tricky one .
sponsors see sports teams as a marketing vehicle , ideally to reach television audience .
but german free tv does n't carry league basketball play ; it is found either on pay channels or the internet .
so big sponsors drop out , pulling support from the teams , in turn weakening the sport , which then lowers the chances of having a strong following . and the cycle continues .
german national team coach dirk bauermann told the european basketball association , fiba , that the tv issue is " a huge concern . "
" if we do n't find ways to get in free television , we 're going to continue to lose sponsors , " he told the fiba web site .
it would be a " tragedy " if the league were to lose such established winning clubs as leverkusen and köln , he said .
' they 've got to go after the kids ' five 's voigt acknowledged that the tv coverage situation is a problem , but thinks that a little time , and some smart moves by german basketball organizations , could fix things in the long run .
" i do n't think the basketball associations should be trying to sway 20- and 30-year olds .
they 've got to go after the kids .
they have to go into the schools and grab the seven and eight year olds , and let them know how beautiful the sport is , " voigt said .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : cologne 's team was doing well when its support got pulled " if we get kids to play in bigger numbers than now , then we 'll generate better players , more viewers , get more people engaged , and more sponsors , " he added .
" this will take more than two or three years .
but it 's the only way to improve the situation in the long run . "
missing the boat on nowitzki ?
some critics say top basketball officials are missing a golden opportunity to win converts by failing to adequately exploit germany 's most important basketball resource : dirk nowitzki .
nowitzki , a seven-foot -lrb- 2.1-meter -rrb- power forward for the us national basketball association 's dallas mavericks , was voted the league 's most valuable player in 2007 .
germany should be making more of the fact that the man nicknamed the " bavarian bomber " was born and bred in wuerzburg , voigt said .
" he is the last global sports icon we have , now that boris becker left tennis and michael schumacher left racing , " said voigt .
" everyone knows about him - that 's he 's very tall , a great athlete , and he earns a lot of money . "
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : in summer , nowitzki plays for the german national team nowitzki does come to germany in the summers , to play for the german national team at the european championships , which are run under the aegis of the german basketball federation -lrb- dbb -rrb- .
the biggest problem with making him a full-time ambassador for basketball in germany is time , bbl 's kaiser said .
" there 's only so much he can do in a couple of months , and he has to be careful not to do too much .
i think the german basketball federation does as much with him as they can , " he said . jennifer abramsohn send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

" nato never fought a ground war until the afghanistan war , " burns said .
" nato 's future is so much on the line . "
britain 's paddy ashdown , a former united nations envoy to bosnia who withdrew as a " super envoy " to afghanistan , said defeat is a possibility for nato .

otherwise , things could get ugly . the resignation serves as a confession : klaus zumwinkel realized that he could not remain ceo of one of germany 's largest companies and decided to face the consequences .
he did n't have a choice . it goes without saying that he has to give up his position at the top if he funneled money into liechtenstein 's tax paradise and did n't report the interest he 'd earned .
it 's called tax evasion . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : technically , he 's considered innocent until found guilty in a court of law or until he has made a formal confession , but it 's becoming more and more apparent that the evidence collected so far is just the tip of the iceberg . post chief is one of many several hundred wealthy germans , some of them celebrities , have also invested money in liechtenstein and hidden it from the german tax authorities .
now they have a big problem , too . klaus zumwinkel himself became the tip of the iceberg when the other tax evaders came under the radar of the public prosecutor 's office .
the alpine principality 's tax saving model is not quite as secure as many had thought .
the secrets at the large baronial bank have been cracked and officials have known for months who has money there and how much - including in the so-called family endowments . now the investigations have begun .
over the next few weeks , police and public prosecutors will pay visits to many of the tax evaders .
zumwinkel is merely the first of many . sympathy is not in order .
we 're not talking about the poorest of the poor but mainly about people who , even after properly paying their taxes , could still afford a hot lunch . greed conquered reason zumwinkel is n't the only one asking how it could come to this .
the answer is simple : greed was stronger than reason .
zumwinkel certainly did n't need to do what he did .
as the head of deutsche post , he not only collected an annual salary of 3.5 million euros -lrb- $ 5.1 million -rrb- but had also inherited a large sum of money at a young age . he would be wealthy even if he had paid the taxes he owed , just slightly less wealthy .
that 's also true of most of the others who will soon receive visits from the authorities .
none of them is poor ; rather they 're among the richest members of society - of the very society that made it possible for them to become as affluent as they are . if they have any brains at all , they should come out of hiding as soon as possible .
the german tax authorities are n't interested in punishment or even revenge - they just want the tax money owed to them .
that means that those who turn themselves in to the tax office and pay the missing taxes with interest before they 're investigated will get off without penalty . fine is least of the worries the tax evaders that do n't do this will have to face the full rigor of the law - and rightly so .
it 's always the wealthier part of society that complains about high taxes and takes advantage of every opportunity to reduce their own tax burden , either by legal means or illegally via liechtenstein . zumwinkel 's case - and the many more cases that are likely to follow in the coming weeks - shows what the outcome can be .

hamburg and bremen looked best in their matches . while sv hamburg and werder bremen won their matches , bayern munich and bayer leverkusen drew away from home and nuremberg lost on a single goal . hamburg came out 3-1 winners at fc zurich on thursday , feb .
14 , in their first-leg match of the tournament 's knock-out stage . a first-half goal by david jarolim and second-half strikes from ivica olic and piotr trochowski put hamburg on the road to a comfortable victory . hamburg lost dutch midfielder rafael van der vaart who limped off with an ankle injury in the 33rd minute to be replaced by jose guerrero . the peru striker then set up the opening two goals in the 33rd and 67th minutes and earned the foul which led to trochowski scoring with a direct free-kick in the 77th . zurich notched a consolation three minutes from time when a shot by andres vasquez was fumbled onto the inside of the post by keeper frank rost and irish referee alan kelly ruled the ball had crossed the line . bremen waltz to a comfortable win werder bremen enjoyed a 3-0 home win over portugal 's braga in their opening knock-out round match on wednesday . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : bremen cruised to a win against the portuguese goalkeeper tim wiese saved two penalties while first-half goals from naldo and daniel jensen and a penalty by hugo almeida sealed a comfortable win for the german side . naldo put bremen in front after just four minutes with a long-range shot before wiese saved a roland linz spot kick to maintain bremen 's lead . jensen doubled werder 's advantage on 27 minutes with a shot from outside the penalty area before wiese once again saved a penalty , this time from jorginho nine minutes later .
almeida completed the scoring with virtually the last kick of the game after joao pereira handled in the area . " when we get penalties we have to convert them , " said braga 's linz afterwards .
" now it will be really tough for us in the return leg . " bayern struggle to keep scots in check bundesliga leaders bayern munich twice came from behind to draw 2-2 with scottish side aberdeen .
goals from miroslav klose and hamit altintop put bayern into a strong position for the return leg in munich next week . however the four-time european champions were made to fight all the way by a spirited aberdeen side depleted by injuries . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : klose helped bayern stay in touch with aberdeen " it 's quite normal that when you play internationally - a team like aberdeen can play above themselves , " bayern coach ottmar hitzfeld said .
" a 2-2 draw away from home in europe used to be like a victory .
we never think about losing in munich . " aberdeen were hoping to repeat a quarter-final win over the bundesliga leaders 25 years ago on their way to lifting the european cup winners ' cup . they took a surprise lead in the 24th minute when josh walker rifled in a shot from more than 20 meters . bayern had already missed chances , but klose made no mistake with a shot on the turn into the roof of the net five minutes later . aberdeen went back in front when sone aluko beat michael rensing - in goal for the flu-ridden oliver kahn - with a low shot from inside the area three minutes before half-time . bayern again leveled after a ze roberto cross struck alan maybury on the arm and spanish referee eduardo iturralde gonzalez awarded a penalty .
altintop 's 54th-minute spot-kick was parried by jamie langfield but the turkey international followed up to make sure at the second chance . nuremberg and leverkusen face harder tasks nuremberg slipped to a 1-0 defeat to portugal 's benfica in lisbon on wednesday , sunk by ariza makukula 's 43rd-minute winner . it was the first game in charge for thomas von heesen , who replaced the sacked hans meyer on monday . also on wednesday , bayer leverkusen earned a goalless draw at turkish side galatasaray . dw staff -lrb- nda -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

but even this seasoned chef and recipient of three stars by the michelin restaurant guides to europe was probably not prepared for his latest cooking contract - it came all the way from space . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : wohlfahrt has the equivalent of a nobel prize for cooking wohlfahrt 's fancy " schwarzwaldstube " restaurant in baiersbronn in the western state of baden-wuerttemberg is to provide meals for astronauts aboard the international space station -lrb- iss -rrb- starting next year . the european space agency -lrb- esa -rrb- , co-owner of the orbiting laboratory complex , which recommended wohlfahrt , said the iss astronauts had so far been nourishing themselves on russian and american nosh .
good food does n't just keep the crew fit but also improves their motivation , the esa said . in keeping with that principle , the astronauts had requested stronger flavors and more soups and meat dishes because life on the sterile space station diminished the sense of smell and taste . taking his inspiration from southern germany 's hearty cuisine , wohlfahrt has concocted a special space menu .
for starters , there 's a potato soup with chunks of black pudding followed by filet of veal and vegetables in a balsamic vinegar sauce , accompanied by a puree of white beans .
the delectable-sounding meal is rounded by a compote of black forest plums with an aniseed sauce for dessert . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : it 's difficult to taste much in this position and sterile surroundings alas , the region 's famous wines wo n't make it on to the menu since alcohol is banned on the iss .
instead , there will be juice in a powder form that the crew will need to dilute with water .
the elaborate grub will be filled in metal jars and the first load will be shot into space in march next year . wohlfahrt , 52 , however , wo n't be serving the food himself .
" no thanks .
i prefer to keep my feet on the ground , " he 's reported to have said . dw staff -lrb- sp -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

otherwise , things could get ugly . the resignation serves as a confession : klaus zumwinkel realized that he could not remain ceo of one of germany 's largest companies and decided to face the consequences .
he did n't have a choice . it goes without saying that he has to give up his position at the top if he funneled money into liechtenstein 's tax paradise and did n't report the interest he 'd earned .
it 's called tax evasion . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : technically , he 's considered innocent until found guilty in a court of law or until he has made a formal confession , but it 's becoming more and more apparent that the evidence collected so far is just the tip of the iceberg . post chief is one of many several hundred wealthy germans , some of them celebrities , have also invested money in liechtenstein and hidden it from the german tax authorities .

the alpine principality 's tax saving model is not quite as secure as many had thought .
the secrets at the large baronial bank have been cracked and officials have known for months who has money there and how much - including in the so-called family endowments . now the investigations have begun .

zumwinkel is merely the first of many . sympathy is not in order .
we 're not talking about the poorest of the poor but mainly about people who , even after properly paying their taxes , could still afford a hot lunch . greed conquered reason zumwinkel is n't the only one asking how it could come to this .
the answer is simple : greed was stronger than reason .
zumwinkel certainly did n't need to do what he did .
as the head of deutsche post , he not only collected an annual salary of 3.5 million euros -lrb- $ 5.1 million -rrb- but had also inherited a large sum of money at a young age . he would be wealthy even if he had paid the taxes he owed , just slightly less wealthy .

none of them is poor ; rather they 're among the richest members of society - of the very society that made it possible for them to become as affluent as they are . if they have any brains at all , they should come out of hiding as soon as possible .
the german tax authorities are n't interested in punishment or even revenge - they just want the tax money owed to them .
that means that those who turn themselves in to the tax office and pay the missing taxes with interest before they 're investigated will get off without penalty . fine is least of the worries the tax evaders that do n't do this will have to face the full rigor of the law - and rightly so .
it 's always the wealthier part of society that complains about high taxes and takes advantage of every opportunity to reduce their own tax burden , either by legal means or illegally via liechtenstein . zumwinkel 's case - and the many more cases that are likely to follow in the coming weeks - shows what the outcome can be .

15 . " the german government today accepted mr. zumwinkel 's offer to resign , " chancellor angela merkel told reporters in berlin .
" i consider this to be in unavoidable step considering what has happened . " zumwinkel , who is suspected of evading 1 million euros -lrb- $ 1.5 million -rrb- worth of taxes through a foundation in liechtenstein , also stepped down from his position on the supervisory board of deutsche telekom , the government spokesmen indicated . " in a large number of cases , key personalities from our country sought to avoid their duty of solidarity via taxation by practicing fiscal evasion to liechtenstein , " a finance ministry spokesman told reporters the daily sueddeutsche zeitung said in editions to appear saturday that some 3.4 billion euros was involved . albig urged those involved to file corrected returns detailing their tax evasion - a device known as " self-reporting " under german law and aimed at allowing offenders to reduce possible penalties . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the future looks bleak the financial times deutschland wrote that it was unlikely that zumwinkel would take a seat on the deutsche post group 's supervisory board , as would normally have been the case when his contract expired in november .
he has been head of deutsche post for 18 years . corporate elite under scrutiny the issue of tax breaks , massive salaries and corporate " extras " for high-powered german executives has come to a head in recent months , with increasing numbers of politicians joining in the growing public furor over the perceived immunity and privileges enjoyed by the country 's business elite . the german population , which places a high value on social and financial probity , was already shocked last year by scandals at two industrial titans , the engineering giant siemens and the biggest european car maker , volkswagen . german finance minister peer steinbrueck admitted the investigation was damaging the already shaky state of public confidence . " the moral damage is considerable - just as it was with his dealing with his share options , " steinbrueck told a group of journalists on his way into parliament . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : after being held by police , zumwinkel was later released in a controversial move , zumwinkel sold 200,000 share options worth 2.24 million euros in december just after deutsche post 's share price rose following a deal to introduce a minimum wage that would affect lower-cost rivals .
he later said his actions were a regrettable mistake . " if the public has something like this as a role model then they 'll start having doubts about this economic and social system , " steinbrueck added .
" i did n't think this was possible . " peter struck , the leader of the social democratic parliamentary faction , added : " when someone has so much money and nevertheless believes there is a need to hide money from the state , then a lot of people will believe there is a lack of justice .
the ordinary taxpayer has to pay his taxes to the tax office . " merkel 's spokesman , ulrich wilhelm , said the chancellor regretted the fact that zumwinkel had not made a public statement on his position since police raided his home and office at dawn on thursday . wilhelm said the highly publicized scandal would be discussed when merkel meets liechtenstein prime minister otmar halser on wednesday . german police searched zumwinkel 's villa in western cologne and deutsche post 's headquarters in bonn as the tax probe became public . the chief executive was taken under police escort from his home in the upmarket marienburg part of cologne to the prosecutors ' office in the city of bochum some five hours after the raids .
investigators also removed boxes from the house . after zumwinkel had posted what prosecutors described as " a not inconsiderable bond , " an arrest warrant was lifted and he was allowed to leave . investigation may unearth other big names bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : whose tax returns will be next to come under scrutiny ?

at the 1992 olympics in barcelona , coverage focused on the us " dream team , " which featured an assembly of all-time b-ball greats including michael jordan , magic johnson , larry bird and charles barkley .
just a year later , the german men 's team caused a sensation when it won the european championship on its home turf . mirroring the sport 's wild growth across the atlantic at the time , hoops began mushrooming on playgrounds and schoolyards around the country - giving german kids their first opportunity to dribble a ball outside a gym .
in addition , lifestyle companies like nike and adidas took to sponsoring streetball tournaments in the bigger cities . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the mavericks ' nowitzki was 2007 mvp the era marked a high point in popularity for basketball in germany , when the number of people officially registered to play in basketball clubs reached around 200,000 , said dirk kaiser , spokesman for the german pro-basketball league , bundesliga basketball -lrb- bbl -rrb- . earlier start - but no follow-through but it seems a few summers flirting with a sport rooted deeply in us culture were not enough to win the undying love of soccer-mad germans . today , the number of registered players has receded to around 193,000 , although kaiser estimates about three to four times as many people - " potentially a million " - play streetball or in unregistered pickup games around the country . as a spectator sport , basketball is somewhere around third or fourth place , alongside ice hockey but well behind handball -lrb- number two -rrb- and miles out of the league of soccer , germany 's all-encompassing sports monolith . despite kids getting in touch with the sport at a much younger age than they used to , germany 's basketball federation " is n't doing a good job " of getting kids to go on to play in the clubs , said andre voigt , editor in chief of the german basketball magazine five .
in germany , competitive sports are much more closely tied to clubs than to schools . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : greece were euro champs , germany second , in 2005 " there are always polls of kids and their interests that show a great deal of interest in basketball .
often it even beats soccer .
but they are n't going on to play later , " voigt said .
" it 's a complex problem . " one major aspect of the problem is the lack of a strong domestic league with national basketball stars . " it 's obvious that kids interested in basketball today know more about the nba players than they do about the guys who play here , " voigt said . german-player quote - high enough ? in 2005 , the bbl tried to improve the situation by ruling that at least three of the 12 players on the roster have to be germans .
voigt called the quota " kind of low , " saying that court time in the pro leagues is necessary for germans to develop enough home-grown talent to field good national teams for european championships .
otherwise germany could n't hold its own against more basketball oriented countries like greece or spain . but more worrisome than keeping german players active , is the question of how to keep the teams alive at all . earlier this month , the cologne 99ers announced bankruptcy , despite a string of successes .
the move came after the team 's corporate sponsor , rhineenergie , pulled its support and a private financier failed to come through with enough cash to carry the team . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : is there life after bankruptcy in basketball ?
likewise , pharmaceutical giant bayer announced it would cease funding any pro teams except soccer , leaving its giants basketball players searching for a new owner .
and teams in ulm and giessen are both facing shaky futures because of sponsorship problems .
catch-22 sponsorship debacle the problem of sponsorship is , in fact , a tricky one .
sponsors see sports teams as a marketing vehicle , ideally to reach television audience .
but german free tv does n't carry league basketball play ; it is found either on pay channels or the internet .
so big sponsors drop out , pulling support from the teams , in turn weakening the sport , which then lowers the chances of having a strong following . and the cycle continues .
german national team coach dirk bauermann told the european basketball association , fiba , that the tv issue is " a huge concern . "
" if we do n't find ways to get in free television , we 're going to continue to lose sponsors , " he told the fiba web site .
it would be a " tragedy " if the league were to lose such established winning clubs as leverkusen and köln , he said .
' they 've got to go after the kids ' five 's voigt acknowledged that the tv coverage situation is a problem , but thinks that a little time , and some smart moves by german basketball organizations , could fix things in the long run .
" i do n't think the basketball associations should be trying to sway 20- and 30-year olds .
they 've got to go after the kids .
they have to go into the schools and grab the seven and eight year olds , and let them know how beautiful the sport is , " voigt said .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : cologne 's team was doing well when its support got pulled " if we get kids to play in bigger numbers than now , then we 'll generate better players , more viewers , get more people engaged , and more sponsors , " he added .
" this will take more than two or three years .
but it 's the only way to improve the situation in the long run . "
missing the boat on nowitzki ?
some critics say top basketball officials are missing a golden opportunity to win converts by failing to adequately exploit germany 's most important basketball resource : dirk nowitzki .
nowitzki , a seven-foot -lrb- 2.1-meter -rrb- power forward for the us national basketball association 's dallas mavericks , was voted the league 's most valuable player in 2007 .
germany should be making more of the fact that the man nicknamed the " bavarian bomber " was born and bred in wuerzburg , voigt said .
" he is the last global sports icon we have , now that boris becker left tennis and michael schumacher left racing , " said voigt .
" everyone knows about him - that 's he 's very tall , a great athlete , and he earns a lot of money . "

the biggest problem with making him a full-time ambassador for basketball in germany is time , bbl 's kaiser said .

sponsors see sports teams as a marketing vehicle , ideally to reach television audience .

german national team coach dirk bauermann told the european basketball association , fiba , that the tv issue is " a huge concern . "
" if we do n't find ways to get in free television , we 're going to continue to lose sponsors , " he told the fiba web site .
it would be a " tragedy " if the league were to lose such established winning clubs as leverkusen and köln , he said .

" i do n't think the basketball associations should be trying to sway 20- and 30-year olds .

but it 's the only way to improve the situation in the long run . "
missing the boat on nowitzki ?
some critics say top basketball officials are missing a golden opportunity to win converts by failing to adequately exploit germany 's most important basketball resource : dirk nowitzki .
nowitzki , a seven-foot -lrb- 2.1-meter -rrb- power forward for the us national basketball association 's dallas mavericks , was voted the league 's most valuable player in 2007 .
germany should be making more of the fact that the man nicknamed the " bavarian bomber " was born and bred in wuerzburg , voigt said .
" he is the last global sports icon we have , now that boris becker left tennis and michael schumacher left racing , " said voigt .

in addition , lifestyle companies like nike and adidas took to sponsoring streetball tournaments in the bigger cities . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the mavericks ' nowitzki was 2007 mvp the era marked a high point in popularity for basketball in germany , when the number of people officially registered to play in basketball clubs reached around 200,000 , said dirk kaiser , spokesman for the german pro-basketball league , bundesliga basketball -lrb- bbl -rrb- . earlier start - but no follow-through but it seems a few summers flirting with a sport rooted deeply in us culture were not enough to win the undying love of soccer-mad germans . today , the number of registered players has receded to around 193,000 , although kaiser estimates about three to four times as many people - " potentially a million " - play streetball or in unregistered pickup games around the country . as a spectator sport , basketball is somewhere around third or fourth place , alongside ice hockey but well behind handball -lrb- number two -rrb- and miles out of the league of soccer , germany 's all-encompassing sports monolith . despite kids getting in touch with the sport at a much younger age than they used to , germany 's basketball federation " is n't doing a good job " of getting kids to go on to play in the clubs , said andre voigt , editor in chief of the german basketball magazine five .
in germany , competitive sports are much more closely tied to clubs than to schools . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : greece were euro champs , germany second , in 2005 " there are always polls of kids and their interests that show a great deal of interest in basketball .
often it even beats soccer .
but they are n't going on to play later , " voigt said .
" it 's a complex problem . " one major aspect of the problem is the lack of a strong domestic league with national basketball stars . " it 's obvious that kids interested in basketball today know more about the nba players than they do about the guys who play here , " voigt said . german-player quote - high enough ? in 2005 , the bbl tried to improve the situation by ruling that at least three of the 12 players on the roster have to be germans .
voigt called the quota " kind of low , " saying that court time in the pro leagues is necessary for germans to develop enough home-grown talent to field good national teams for european championships .
otherwise germany could n't hold its own against more basketball oriented countries like greece or spain . but more worrisome than keeping german players active , is the question of how to keep the teams alive at all . earlier this month , the cologne 99ers announced bankruptcy , despite a string of successes .
the move came after the team 's corporate sponsor , rhineenergie , pulled its support and a private financier failed to come through with enough cash to carry the team . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : is there life after bankruptcy in basketball ?
likewise , pharmaceutical giant bayer announced it would cease funding any pro teams except soccer , leaving its giants basketball players searching for a new owner .
and teams in ulm and giessen are both facing shaky futures because of sponsorship problems .
catch-22 sponsorship debacle the problem of sponsorship is , in fact , a tricky one .
sponsors see sports teams as a marketing vehicle , ideally to reach television audience .
but german free tv does n't carry league basketball play ; it is found either on pay channels or the internet .
so big sponsors drop out , pulling support from the teams , in turn weakening the sport , which then lowers the chances of having a strong following . and the cycle continues .
german national team coach dirk bauermann told the european basketball association , fiba , that the tv issue is " a huge concern . "
" if we do n't find ways to get in free television , we 're going to continue to lose sponsors , " he told the fiba web site .
it would be a " tragedy " if the league were to lose such established winning clubs as leverkusen and köln , he said .
' they 've got to go after the kids ' five 's voigt acknowledged that the tv coverage situation is a problem , but thinks that a little time , and some smart moves by german basketball organizations , could fix things in the long run .
" i do n't think the basketball associations should be trying to sway 20- and 30-year olds .
they 've got to go after the kids .
they have to go into the schools and grab the seven and eight year olds , and let them know how beautiful the sport is , " voigt said .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : cologne 's team was doing well when its support got pulled " if we get kids to play in bigger numbers than now , then we 'll generate better players , more viewers , get more people engaged , and more sponsors , " he added .
" this will take more than two or three years .
but it 's the only way to improve the situation in the long run . "
missing the boat on nowitzki ?
some critics say top basketball officials are missing a golden opportunity to win converts by failing to adequately exploit germany 's most important basketball resource : dirk nowitzki .
nowitzki , a seven-foot -lrb- 2.1-meter -rrb- power forward for the us national basketball association 's dallas mavericks , was voted the league 's most valuable player in 2007 .
germany should be making more of the fact that the man nicknamed the " bavarian bomber " was born and bred in wuerzburg , voigt said .
" he is the last global sports icon we have , now that boris becker left tennis and michael schumacher left racing , " said voigt .
" everyone knows about him - that 's he 's very tall , a great athlete , and he earns a lot of money . "

15 . " the german government today accepted mr. zumwinkel 's offer to resign , " chancellor angela merkel told reporters in berlin .
" i consider this to be in unavoidable step considering what has happened . " zumwinkel , who is suspected of evading 1 million euros -lrb- $ 1.5 million -rrb- worth of taxes through a foundation in liechtenstein , also stepped down from his position on the supervisory board of deutsche telekom , the government spokesmen indicated . " in a large number of cases , key personalities from our country sought to avoid their duty of solidarity via taxation by practicing fiscal evasion to liechtenstein , " a finance ministry spokesman told reporters the daily sueddeutsche zeitung said in editions to appear saturday that some 3.4 billion euros was involved . albig urged those involved to file corrected returns detailing their tax evasion - a device known as " self-reporting " under german law and aimed at allowing offenders to reduce possible penalties . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the future looks bleak the financial times deutschland wrote that it was unlikely that zumwinkel would take a seat on the deutsche post group 's supervisory board , as would normally have been the case when his contract expired in november .
he has been head of deutsche post for 18 years . corporate elite under scrutiny the issue of tax breaks , massive salaries and corporate " extras " for high-powered german executives has come to a head in recent months , with increasing numbers of politicians joining in the growing public furor over the perceived immunity and privileges enjoyed by the country 's business elite . the german population , which places a high value on social and financial probity , was already shocked last year by scandals at two industrial titans , the engineering giant siemens and the biggest european car maker , volkswagen . german finance minister peer steinbrueck admitted the investigation was damaging the already shaky state of public confidence . " the moral damage is considerable - just as it was with his dealing with his share options , " steinbrueck told a group of journalists on his way into parliament . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : after being held by police , zumwinkel was later released in a controversial move , zumwinkel sold 200,000 share options worth 2.24 million euros in december just after deutsche post 's share price rose following a deal to introduce a minimum wage that would affect lower-cost rivals .
he later said his actions were a regrettable mistake . " if the public has something like this as a role model then they 'll start having doubts about this economic and social system , " steinbrueck added .
" i did n't think this was possible . " peter struck , the leader of the social democratic parliamentary faction , added : " when someone has so much money and nevertheless believes there is a need to hide money from the state , then a lot of people will believe there is a lack of justice .
the ordinary taxpayer has to pay his taxes to the tax office . " merkel 's spokesman , ulrich wilhelm , said the chancellor regretted the fact that zumwinkel had not made a public statement on his position since police raided his home and office at dawn on thursday . wilhelm said the highly publicized scandal would be discussed when merkel meets liechtenstein prime minister otmar halser on wednesday . german police searched zumwinkel 's villa in western cologne and deutsche post 's headquarters in bonn as the tax probe became public . the chief executive was taken under police escort from his home in the upmarket marienburg part of cologne to the prosecutors ' office in the city of bochum some five hours after the raids .
investigators also removed boxes from the house . after zumwinkel had posted what prosecutors described as " a not inconsiderable bond , " an arrest warrant was lifted and he was allowed to leave . investigation may unearth other big names bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : whose tax returns will be next to come under scrutiny ?
the business daily handelsblatt said the raids were part of a series of probes into tax evasion totaling around 10 million euros deposited in liechtenstein , the principality bordering switzerland and austria , and that other raids would follow across germany . hundreds of suspects had been uncovered by investigating the activities of lgt , a liechtenstein bank .
" we 've cracked the whole bank , " one investigator told handelsblatt . there is speculation that more of germany 's rich and powerful business leaders may be involved . lgt spokesman bernd junkers in liechtenstein told reuters that the bank , controlled by the principality 's princely family , had taken note of the handelsblatt report but could not comment in detail further . from savior to pariah bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the tower that klaus built the longest-serving chief of a dax company , the frankfurt blue-chip index , zumwinkel was credited with transforming the postal service into a world leader in logistics , with more than half a million employees , and a german leader in retail banking via its extensive postbank network . but he had also been sharply criticized for selling the large stock holding after the imposition of a minimum wage for postal workers boosted deutsche post shares last year following a fight for the unprecedented german legislation , which , in effect , protected deutsche post from lower-cost competition . dw staff -lrb- nda -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

although 76 % of women start out breastfeeding , this falls to 50 % by six weeks - and one in four by six months .
the scientific advisory committee on nutrition said rates had improved , but more awareness of the health risks of not breastfeeding was needed .
the government said a breastfeeding helpline had been set up to offer practical support and information .
the latest recommendations from the committee were based on the infant feeding survey from 2005 .
however , there is also a need for midwives to be given the time to talk to , advise and support mothers with breastfeeding frances day-stirk , royal college of midwives the survey , which has been carried out every five years since 1975 , also found that well-educated , professional women aged over 30 who were first-time mothers were the most likely group to breastfeed .
committee members said there were several areas for improvement .
they said few parents delay the introduction of solids to around six months of age , as recommended , and that labels on commercial weaning foods should be changed to reflect this advice .
antenatal and postnatal services needed to be more accessible for hard-to-reach groups , the report warned .
in addition , breastfeeding advice and support should be widely available and all health care providers should receive proper training in how to help women who want to breastfeed , the report said .
the committee also called for the provision of adequate infant feeding facilities in the workplace and in public places .
advice studies have shown that breastfed babies are less likely to become obese in later childhood and that breastfeeding can prevent mothers having health problems later in life .
official advice is to breastfeed exclusively up to the age of six months before the addition of solid foods .
the department of health has promised £ 150,000 a year for a national breastfeeding helpline as part of its aim to make breastfeeding " the norm " .
public health minister dawn primarolo said the helpline would provide information about breastfeeding and promote and help to sustain breastfeeding by mothers who often encounter problems during the early weeks .
" when it comes to feeding babies , breast is best .
" our challenge is to help new mums , who choose to breastfeed , through those early difficult weeks and months . "
sue ashmore , programme director for unicef uk baby friendly initiative , said : " there is a great deal of evidence to show that mothers who receive support from someone who believes they can successfully breastfeed continue to breastfeed for longer . "
frances day-stirk , a director of the royal college of midwives , said the helpline was welcome and overdue .
" however , there is also a need for midwives to be given the time to talk to , advise and support mothers with breastfeeding .
" there are simply not enough of them at the moment to enable them to do this effectively . "

thousands of women are trafficked into marriage in india each year instead , she ended up trapped in a small flat in south-west london .
she had unwittingly stepped into a trap laid by a trafficker , becoming a commodity in what campaigners say is the world 's fastest growing illegal trade - in people .
yet when penny agreed to meet the agent , introduced to her by a friend , she was unaware that human trafficking even existed .
" i did n't think about the consequences .
i just took the opportunity to get out of the country , " penny said .
which countries are people trafficked from ?
" i had never heard what trafficking was all about until i was here .
i did n't know anything about it at all . "
profitable trade penny 's story is just one of many that remain hidden .
the un estimates that some 2.5 million people are in forced labour at any given time , as a result of trafficking .
i was under his control - mentally , physically - i was under his control .
i could n't even sneeze without him knowing penny , trafficking survivor " we do n't know much about the size of the iceberg that lies beneath , " admitted antonio mario costa , head of the united nations office on drugs and crime -lrb- unodc -rrb- .
" like any other market - and it is a perverse kind of market - there is a supply in terms of people who are duped , coerced or tricked , and a demand , people who may be buying the sort of commodities we are talking about .
and there is the act of connecting the supply and demand - those who do the trafficking , " he said .
minors are particularly at risk of working in exploitative conditions the un says governments have fallen behind on commitments to tackle the problem and has called a conference in vienna this week to urge more concerted action .
while 116 out of 192 un member states have ratified an anti-trafficking protocol , which came into force in 2005 , some governments still do not have any legislation in place .
a few of the member states who have not yet even signed the convention include countries identified by unodc as having a high number of people trafficked from them - such as india and pakistan .
japan too , which scores " very high " as a destination country , has yet to sign the international accord .
ruth dearnley of the coalition of campaigning groups , stop the traffik , says human trafficking has never been a top priority for the international community .
" enforcement agencies have always focused on the drugs and arms trade but this is the fastest growing global crime , " she said .
" if you make money out of illegal products then , in some ways , people are an easier product than drugs and arms . "
estimates - which are notoriously difficult to calculate - put the profits of the industry at $ 31.6bn -lrb- £ 16bn ; 21.6bn euros -rrb- per year , making it the third largest shadow economy - after drugs and arms .
locked up penny was told the journey to the uk would set her back £ 1,000 pounds -lrb- $ 1,968 ; 1,347 euros -rrb- .
but the fact that she did n't have the sum was n't a problem .
she was told she would be given both a place to stay and a job when she arrived , enabling her to pay the money back .
if you make money out of illegal products then , in some ways , people are an easier product than drugs and arms ruth dearnley , stop the traffik but the reality was very different .
" i ended up going with him to his place , " she said .
" i stayed with him that day .
after four days he came on to me and started demanding sex .
i refused , i did n't think that was the kind of deal i had with him . "
" he forced himself on to me , started raping me .
from that day , for about two weeks , it would just be daily . "
soon , he brought men with him and penny was forced to have sex with them too .
low priority once , she tried to escape , but he tracked her down and beat her badly , locking her in the flat .
by the end , she remembers : " i was under his control - mentally , physically , i was under his control .
i could n't even sneeze without him knowing . "
trafficking in numbers 52 % of those recruiting victims are men 49 % of profit generated in industrialised economies most trafficked people aged 18-24 1.2m children trafficked per year source : ungift un global initiative to fight human trafficking even once someone has managed to escape the traffickers ' trap , british campaigners say authorities are far more concerned about their status as an illegal immigrant , than as a trafficked person .
penny , for example - repeatedly imprisoned for not having the right paperwork - is convinced the man who trafficked her is still plying his trade , unmolested by the authorities .
" the policeman said , ' it 's not him , it 's you we have to deal with , " ' she said .
" i told them his address .
they had everything .
they were n't interested . "
nimble fingers crystal amiss , of london 's black women 's rape action project , said that frequently women 's accounts of being trafficked are ignored when they emerge from the underworld and seek asylum .
children - sometimes trafficked - are used to untangle fishing nets " the priority is to stop people coming into the country .
they are determined to have robust immigration controls and it is very easy to target people who have to work clandestinely , " she said .
it is not just the sex industry that is fed by traffickers , though the un estimates that 43 % of those trafficked are used for forced commercial sexual exploitation .
workers are also exploited in the international textile , food and drink industries , often in the developing world , mr costa says .
campaigners say , for example , that an estimated 12,000 children are still employed in the ivory coast 's cocoa plantations .
hundreds are sold by their parents to work underwater for fishermen on ghana 's lake volta , where their nimble fingers untangle trapped nets .
the final and common link at the end of a long and complex chain , mr costa says , is exploitation .
" what counts mostly is the exploitation that takes place at several points along the chain as the human trafficking takes place and that is repetitive and prolonged .
that is where most of the violence takes place . "

ex-servicemen and women should be retrained as teachers to bring military style discipline to tough inner city schools , a think tank has said .
the government is being urged to adopt a us-style programme returning former soldiers , sailors and airmen to school .
the centre for policy studies says ex-soldiers could have a profound effect on discipline and learning .
the conservatives are backing the idea , saying children need order and role models for self-discipline .
a report by think tanks says the fact that ex-soldiers had a macho image could help engender respect - particularly among boys .
the troops to teachers -lrb- t3 -rrb- programme in the us retrains soldiers with a minimum of 10 years ' experience , and a degree , as fully certificated teachers .
those with lower qualifications are retrained as vocational teachers .
some 16,000 service personnel have qualified as teachers since t3 was set up in the us in 1994 .
whether we like it or not , children from more deprived neighbourhoods often respond to raw physical power centre for policy studies report the report said the programme had been an " outstanding success " , with some 88 % remaining in the profession three years after they qualified .
this compared to the usual retention rate for teachers in the us of 50 % after five years .
the report suggested ex-servicemen could have a particularly strong effect on discipline and learning .
" this is not merely because ex-servicemen are sure of their own moral authority .
" they are not intimidated by adrenaline-fuelled adolescents : they have , unlike most teachers , been there before , " it added .
it also argued that the perception that these teachers had been in a " macho profession " would be well-received by inner city children .
" whether we like it or not , children from more deprived neighbourhoods often respond to raw physical power , " it added .
' terrific boost ' chief of defence staff lord guthrie said knife crime , drugs and violence were reported daily in the inner cities .
he said the t3 programme was a " possible answer " that had been shown to work in the us .
" this will not , of course , solve all the problems of the inner city .
but it will help , " he said .
" it will provide youths with role models who understand discipline and self-restraint at the time in their lives when they need it most .
and it will be a terrific boost for our armed services . "
children , particularly in the worst schools , desperately need order and role models for self-discipline michael gove , shadow children 's secretary the charity skill force is already running a similar programme with 35 teams across 200 schools in england , scotland and wales , and the report says it could be expanded with government help .
shadow children 's secretary michael gove said helping soldiers retrain as teachers would be great for our schools .
" many british schools need a change of culture because they face real problems with violence and bad behaviour .
" children , particularly in the worst schools , desperately need order and role models for self-discipline . "
a department for children , schools and families spokesman said : " we know that professionals with industry experience can make really inspirational teachers and we are always looking to recruit teachers who have skills in other fields . "
the ministry of defence said it was already working with the department for children , schools and families on a scheme to encourage more ex-military personnel to consider secondary-level teaching .
a spokesman said help and advice on pursuing a career in education formed part of the resettlement package for service leavers .
we invited your comments .
here is a selection of your responses i am a former soldier who gained a 2:1 after leaving the army .
while some servicemen may make good instructors -lrb- not teachers -rrb- the majority are the ' monkey see monkey do ' types with limited intelligence and communications skills .
they know the ' what ' but rarely the ' why ' or ' how ' .
however , there may be a role for them in maintaining discipline within schools rather than have police based within the school as has already started happpening .
jon p , portsmouth i went to a school with cadets and so met ex-military people who worked either as teachers or in other roles within the school .
provided the right people are selected for the job -lrb- let 's face it - just being in the forces does not automatically make you a good teacher ! -rrb- it could be great .
half the battle in the classroom for any teacher is winning respect .
in my experience , good army officers are perfectly capable of acheiving this .
on paper it sounds a good idea , but it needs to be very carefully handled .
i wish this project every success , as anything that will truly benefit troubled schools is welcome in my opinion .
jen , ipswich if the yoof of today could actually take military discipline , it might be an improvement .
more likely , the ' hardcases ' would be wanting to fight the teachers .
perhaps their parents should be in class as well .
but surely our civil liberty friends will be bleating that you can not shout at them .
remembering - with fondness - my instructors from bassingbourn barracks , they would make mincemeat of the lot of them .
but it has to come from within - the army is voluntary , you expect what you will get .
school is compulsory ...
voice of the voyager , gloucester i am astonished at this proposal .
it seems as if ' toughness ' is the qualification that is perceived as the quality required for teaching now .
have n't we yet learned that violence or the threat of it does not work ?
having taught in an exclusion unit in southern england for a number of years , i can attest that many of the exclusions who attended the unit were boys who had suffered violence at the hands of their military fathers who obviously believed that threatening their offspring was the best way to control them .
indeed , whole military families of children were excluded from school .
i visited one family of five boys to give home tuition .
all were excluded from school for violent and uncontrollable behaviour .
mother was illiterate and sat in on reading lessons .
father tried to maintain discipline with his fists and complained to me that the more he tried to get the boys to behave , the worse they became .
enid anderson , st coulitz , france when i came out the raf in 1992 with an hnc in electronics -lrb- i now have a degree if that matters -rrb- i was being interviewed by my local job centre and was offered the chance to train as a teacher .
there was no way i would then or now accept the job as i do not have the temperament to deal with todays children .
they are frightened of and respect nothing and would n't waste my time and energy trying to teach them .
until the government gives back the ability for teachers to punish unruly children then this very sad state of affairs will continue .

ex-servicemen and women should be retrained as teachers to bring military style discipline to tough inner city schools , a think tank has said .
the government is being urged to adopt a us-style programme returning former soldiers , sailors and airmen to school .
the centre for policy studies says ex-soldiers could have a profound effect on discipline and learning .
the conservatives are backing the idea , saying children need order and role models for self-discipline .
a report by think tanks says the fact that ex-soldiers had a macho image could help engender respect - particularly among boys .
the troops to teachers -lrb- t3 -rrb- programme in the us retrains soldiers with a minimum of 10 years ' experience , and a degree , as fully certificated teachers .
those with lower qualifications are retrained as vocational teachers .
some 16,000 service personnel have qualified as teachers since t3 was set up in the us in 1994 .
whether we like it or not , children from more deprived neighbourhoods often respond to raw physical power centre for policy studies report the report said the programme had been an " outstanding success " , with some 88 % remaining in the profession three years after they qualified .
this compared to the usual retention rate for teachers in the us of 50 % after five years .
the report suggested ex-servicemen could have a particularly strong effect on discipline and learning .
" this is not merely because ex-servicemen are sure of their own moral authority .
" they are not intimidated by adrenaline-fuelled adolescents : they have , unlike most teachers , been there before , " it added .
it also argued that the perception that these teachers had been in a " macho profession " would be well-received by inner city children .
" whether we like it or not , children from more deprived neighbourhoods often respond to raw physical power , " it added .
' terrific boost ' chief of defence staff lord guthrie said knife crime , drugs and violence were reported daily in the inner cities .
he said the t3 programme was a " possible answer " that had been shown to work in the us .
" this will not , of course , solve all the problems of the inner city .
but it will help , " he said .
" it will provide youths with role models who understand discipline and self-restraint at the time in their lives when they need it most .
and it will be a terrific boost for our armed services . "
children , particularly in the worst schools , desperately need order and role models for self-discipline michael gove , shadow children 's secretary the charity skill force is already running a similar programme with 35 teams across 200 schools in england , scotland and wales , and the report says it could be expanded with government help .
shadow children 's secretary michael gove said helping soldiers retrain as teachers would be great for our schools .
" many british schools need a change of culture because they face real problems with violence and bad behaviour .
" children , particularly in the worst schools , desperately need order and role models for self-discipline . "
a department for children , schools and families spokesman said : " we know that professionals with industry experience can make really inspirational teachers and we are always looking to recruit teachers who have skills in other fields . "
the ministry of defence said it was already working with the department for children , schools and families on a scheme to encourage more ex-military personnel to consider secondary-level teaching .
a spokesman said help and advice on pursuing a career in education formed part of the resettlement package for service leavers .

half the battle in the classroom for any teacher is winning respect .

on paper it sounds a good idea , but it needs to be very carefully handled .

voice of the voyager , gloucester i am astonished at this proposal .
it seems as if ' toughness ' is the qualification that is perceived as the quality required for teaching now .
have n't we yet learned that violence or the threat of it does not work ?
having taught in an exclusion unit in southern england for a number of years , i can attest that many of the exclusions who attended the unit were boys who had suffered violence at the hands of their military fathers who obviously believed that threatening their offspring was the best way to control them .
indeed , whole military families of children were excluded from school .
i visited one family of five boys to give home tuition .
all were excluded from school for violent and uncontrollable behaviour .
mother was illiterate and sat in on reading lessons .

there was no way i would then or now accept the job as i do not have the temperament to deal with todays children .

ex-servicemen and women should be retrained as teachers to bring military style discipline to tough inner city schools , a think tank has said .
the government is being urged to adopt a us-style programme returning former soldiers , sailors and airmen to school .
the centre for policy studies says ex-soldiers could have a profound effect on discipline and learning .
the conservatives are backing the idea , saying children need order and role models for self-discipline .
a report by think tanks says the fact that ex-soldiers had a macho image could help engender respect - particularly among boys .
the troops to teachers -lrb- t3 -rrb- programme in the us retrains soldiers with a minimum of 10 years ' experience , and a degree , as fully certificated teachers .
those with lower qualifications are retrained as vocational teachers .
some 16,000 service personnel have qualified as teachers since t3 was set up in the us in 1994 .
whether we like it or not , children from more deprived neighbourhoods often respond to raw physical power centre for policy studies report the report said the programme had been an " outstanding success " , with some 88 % remaining in the profession three years after they qualified .
this compared to the usual retention rate for teachers in the us of 50 % after five years .
the report suggested ex-servicemen could have a particularly strong effect on discipline and learning .
" this is not merely because ex-servicemen are sure of their own moral authority .
" they are not intimidated by adrenaline-fuelled adolescents : they have , unlike most teachers , been there before , " it added .
it also argued that the perception that these teachers had been in a " macho profession " would be well-received by inner city children .
" whether we like it or not , children from more deprived neighbourhoods often respond to raw physical power , " it added .
' terrific boost ' chief of defence staff lord guthrie said knife crime , drugs and violence were reported daily in the inner cities .
he said the t3 programme was a " possible answer " that had been shown to work in the us .
" this will not , of course , solve all the problems of the inner city .
but it will help , " he said .
" it will provide youths with role models who understand discipline and self-restraint at the time in their lives when they need it most .
and it will be a terrific boost for our armed services . "
children , particularly in the worst schools , desperately need order and role models for self-discipline michael gove , shadow children 's secretary the charity skill force is already running a similar programme with 35 teams across 200 schools in england , scotland and wales , and the report says it could be expanded with government help .
shadow children 's secretary michael gove said helping soldiers retrain as teachers would be great for our schools .
" many british schools need a change of culture because they face real problems with violence and bad behaviour .
" children , particularly in the worst schools , desperately need order and role models for self-discipline . "
a department for children , schools and families spokesman said : " we know that professionals with industry experience can make really inspirational teachers and we are always looking to recruit teachers who have skills in other fields . "
the ministry of defence said it was already working with the department for children , schools and families on a scheme to encourage more ex-military personnel to consider secondary-level teaching .
a spokesman said help and advice on pursuing a career in education formed part of the resettlement package for service leavers .

jon p , portsmouth i went to a school with cadets and so met ex-military people who worked either as teachers or in other roles within the school .
provided the right people are selected for the job -lrb- let 's face it - just being in the forces does not automatically make you a good teacher ! -rrb- it could be great .
half the battle in the classroom for any teacher is winning respect .
in my experience , good army officers are perfectly capable of acheiving this .
on paper it sounds a good idea , but it needs to be very carefully handled .
i wish this project every success , as anything that will truly benefit troubled schools is welcome in my opinion .

school is compulsory ...
voice of the voyager , gloucester i am astonished at this proposal .
it seems as if ' toughness ' is the qualification that is perceived as the quality required for teaching now .
have n't we yet learned that violence or the threat of it does not work ?
having taught in an exclusion unit in southern england for a number of years , i can attest that many of the exclusions who attended the unit were boys who had suffered violence at the hands of their military fathers who obviously believed that threatening their offspring was the best way to control them .
indeed , whole military families of children were excluded from school .
i visited one family of five boys to give home tuition .
all were excluded from school for violent and uncontrollable behaviour .
mother was illiterate and sat in on reading lessons .
father tried to maintain discipline with his fists and complained to me that the more he tried to get the boys to behave , the worse they became .

there was no way i would then or now accept the job as i do not have the temperament to deal with todays children .

ex-servicemen and women should be retrained as teachers to bring military style discipline to tough inner city schools , a think tank has said .
the government is being urged to adopt a us-style programme returning former soldiers , sailors and airmen to school .
the centre for policy studies says ex-soldiers could have a profound effect on discipline and learning .
the conservatives are backing the idea , saying children need order and role models for self-discipline .
a report by think tanks says the fact that ex-soldiers had a macho image could help engender respect - particularly among boys .
the troops to teachers -lrb- t3 -rrb- programme in the us retrains soldiers with a minimum of 10 years ' experience , and a degree , as fully certificated teachers .
those with lower qualifications are retrained as vocational teachers .
some 16,000 service personnel have qualified as teachers since t3 was set up in the us in 1994 .
whether we like it or not , children from more deprived neighbourhoods often respond to raw physical power centre for policy studies report the report said the programme had been an " outstanding success " , with some 88 % remaining in the profession three years after they qualified .
this compared to the usual retention rate for teachers in the us of 50 % after five years .
the report suggested ex-servicemen could have a particularly strong effect on discipline and learning .
" this is not merely because ex-servicemen are sure of their own moral authority .
" they are not intimidated by adrenaline-fuelled adolescents : they have , unlike most teachers , been there before , " it added .
it also argued that the perception that these teachers had been in a " macho profession " would be well-received by inner city children .
" whether we like it or not , children from more deprived neighbourhoods often respond to raw physical power , " it added .
' terrific boost ' chief of defence staff lord guthrie said knife crime , drugs and violence were reported daily in the inner cities .
he said the t3 programme was a " possible answer " that had been shown to work in the us .
" this will not , of course , solve all the problems of the inner city .
but it will help , " he said .
" it will provide youths with role models who understand discipline and self-restraint at the time in their lives when they need it most .
and it will be a terrific boost for our armed services . "
children , particularly in the worst schools , desperately need order and role models for self-discipline michael gove , shadow children 's secretary the charity skill force is already running a similar programme with 35 teams across 200 schools in england , scotland and wales , and the report says it could be expanded with government help .
shadow children 's secretary michael gove said helping soldiers retrain as teachers would be great for our schools .
" many british schools need a change of culture because they face real problems with violence and bad behaviour .
" children , particularly in the worst schools , desperately need order and role models for self-discipline . "
a department for children , schools and families spokesman said : " we know that professionals with industry experience can make really inspirational teachers and we are always looking to recruit teachers who have skills in other fields . "
the ministry of defence said it was already working with the department for children , schools and families on a scheme to encourage more ex-military personnel to consider secondary-level teaching .
a spokesman said help and advice on pursuing a career in education formed part of the resettlement package for service leavers .

half the battle in the classroom for any teacher is winning respect .
in my experience , good army officers are perfectly capable of acheiving this .
on paper it sounds a good idea , but it needs to be very carefully handled .
i wish this project every success , as anything that will truly benefit troubled schools is welcome in my opinion .

voice of the voyager , gloucester i am astonished at this proposal .
it seems as if ' toughness ' is the qualification that is perceived as the quality required for teaching now .
have n't we yet learned that violence or the threat of it does not work ?
having taught in an exclusion unit in southern england for a number of years , i can attest that many of the exclusions who attended the unit were boys who had suffered violence at the hands of their military fathers who obviously believed that threatening their offspring was the best way to control them .
indeed , whole military families of children were excluded from school .
i visited one family of five boys to give home tuition .
all were excluded from school for violent and uncontrollable behaviour .
mother was illiterate and sat in on reading lessons .

there was no way i would then or now accept the job as i do not have the temperament to deal with todays children .

ex-servicemen and women should be retrained as teachers to bring military style discipline to tough inner city schools , a think tank has said .
the government is being urged to adopt a us-style programme returning former soldiers , sailors and airmen to school .
the centre for policy studies says ex-soldiers could have a profound effect on discipline and learning .
the conservatives are backing the idea , saying children need order and role models for self-discipline .
a report by think tanks says the fact that ex-soldiers had a macho image could help engender respect - particularly among boys .
the troops to teachers -lrb- t3 -rrb- programme in the us retrains soldiers with a minimum of 10 years ' experience , and a degree , as fully certificated teachers .
those with lower qualifications are retrained as vocational teachers .
some 16,000 service personnel have qualified as teachers since t3 was set up in the us in 1994 .
whether we like it or not , children from more deprived neighbourhoods often respond to raw physical power centre for policy studies report the report said the programme had been an " outstanding success " , with some 88 % remaining in the profession three years after they qualified .
this compared to the usual retention rate for teachers in the us of 50 % after five years .
the report suggested ex-servicemen could have a particularly strong effect on discipline and learning .
" this is not merely because ex-servicemen are sure of their own moral authority .
" they are not intimidated by adrenaline-fuelled adolescents : they have , unlike most teachers , been there before , " it added .
it also argued that the perception that these teachers had been in a " macho profession " would be well-received by inner city children .
" whether we like it or not , children from more deprived neighbourhoods often respond to raw physical power , " it added .
' terrific boost ' chief of defence staff lord guthrie said knife crime , drugs and violence were reported daily in the inner cities .
he said the t3 programme was a " possible answer " that had been shown to work in the us .
" this will not , of course , solve all the problems of the inner city .
but it will help , " he said .
" it will provide youths with role models who understand discipline and self-restraint at the time in their lives when they need it most .
and it will be a terrific boost for our armed services . "
children , particularly in the worst schools , desperately need order and role models for self-discipline michael gove , shadow children 's secretary the charity skill force is already running a similar programme with 35 teams across 200 schools in england , scotland and wales , and the report says it could be expanded with government help .
shadow children 's secretary michael gove said helping soldiers retrain as teachers would be great for our schools .
" many british schools need a change of culture because they face real problems with violence and bad behaviour .
" children , particularly in the worst schools , desperately need order and role models for self-discipline . "
a department for children , schools and families spokesman said : " we know that professionals with industry experience can make really inspirational teachers and we are always looking to recruit teachers who have skills in other fields . "
the ministry of defence said it was already working with the department for children , schools and families on a scheme to encourage more ex-military personnel to consider secondary-level teaching .
a spokesman said help and advice on pursuing a career in education formed part of the resettlement package for service leavers .
we invited your comments .
here is a selection of your responses i am a former soldier who gained a 2:1 after leaving the army .
while some servicemen may make good instructors -lrb- not teachers -rrb- the majority are the ' monkey see monkey do ' types with limited intelligence and communications skills .
they know the ' what ' but rarely the ' why ' or ' how ' .
however , there may be a role for them in maintaining discipline within schools rather than have police based within the school as has already started happpening .
jon p , portsmouth i went to a school with cadets and so met ex-military people who worked either as teachers or in other roles within the school .
provided the right people are selected for the job -lrb- let 's face it - just being in the forces does not automatically make you a good teacher ! -rrb- it could be great .
half the battle in the classroom for any teacher is winning respect .
in my experience , good army officers are perfectly capable of acheiving this .
on paper it sounds a good idea , but it needs to be very carefully handled .
i wish this project every success , as anything that will truly benefit troubled schools is welcome in my opinion .
jen , ipswich if the yoof of today could actually take military discipline , it might be an improvement .
more likely , the ' hardcases ' would be wanting to fight the teachers .
perhaps their parents should be in class as well .
but surely our civil liberty friends will be bleating that you can not shout at them .
remembering - with fondness - my instructors from bassingbourn barracks , they would make mincemeat of the lot of them .
but it has to come from within - the army is voluntary , you expect what you will get .
school is compulsory ...
voice of the voyager , gloucester i am astonished at this proposal .
it seems as if ' toughness ' is the qualification that is perceived as the quality required for teaching now .
have n't we yet learned that violence or the threat of it does not work ?
having taught in an exclusion unit in southern england for a number of years , i can attest that many of the exclusions who attended the unit were boys who had suffered violence at the hands of their military fathers who obviously believed that threatening their offspring was the best way to control them .
indeed , whole military families of children were excluded from school .
i visited one family of five boys to give home tuition .
all were excluded from school for violent and uncontrollable behaviour .
mother was illiterate and sat in on reading lessons .
father tried to maintain discipline with his fists and complained to me that the more he tried to get the boys to behave , the worse they became .
enid anderson , st coulitz , france when i came out the raf in 1992 with an hnc in electronics -lrb- i now have a degree if that matters -rrb- i was being interviewed by my local job centre and was offered the chance to train as a teacher .
there was no way i would then or now accept the job as i do not have the temperament to deal with todays children .
they are frightened of and respect nothing and would n't waste my time and energy trying to teach them .
until the government gives back the ability for teachers to punish unruly children then this very sad state of affairs will continue .

while the uk woke up on monday to the news of amy winehouse 's quintuple award success at the grammys , fewer britons were aware of lewis 's lower-profile grammy adventure .
while winehouse picked up her trophies via a satellite link from london , lewis was in los angeles .
" i got invited to sing at the pre-grammy party , " she says , referring to the annual beverly hilton hotel bash held by the music mogul clive davis , who also happens to be lewis 's us label boss .
" just to go there with clive and to be introduced to whitney houston and janet jackson - alicia keys was there as well ...
to be amongst all those people was really special , " she says .
the appearance was the opening salvo in lewis 's campaign for us stardom .
the 22-year-old hopes to emulate winehouse 's grammy success after her debut album is released there in april .
" everyone would love to have her achievements , " she admits .
in the uk , however , the two singers are roughly on par .
winehouse had the top selling album in the uk last year - shifting 1.85 million copies of back to black .
but lewis 's spirit was a close second , notching up 1.59 million sales in just two months .
both singers have been dubbed the best voice of their generation despite having very different sounds - lewis 's smooth controlled power contrasts with winehouse 's rugged soul timbre .
but similarities between the two are less striking than their differences .
achievements a moment like this - fastest-selling female debut single selling 600,000 in first week in december bleeding love - top-selling single of 2007 , 489,153 copies spirit - fastest-selling uk debut album of all time selling 375,872 copies first week aesthetically , winehouse , complete with tattoos and unkempt beehive hairdo , looks rough and ready while lewis exudes polished , styled glamour .
winehouse 's current stint in rehab is the latest episode and a long and very public battle with drug addiction .
teetotal lewis , meanwhile , has the sort of wholesome clean-cut image that has had top designers falling over themselves to provide her with a frock for next week 's brit awards - where she is nominated in four categories , including best single and best breakthrough act .
the ceremony is the next milestone in lewis 's short but already record-breaking career . "
i was in the audience at the brits when i was 14 so to be actually performing on stage is a real achievement " leona lewis " i 'm excited about the brits , " she says .
" i 'm excited about performing .
" i was in the audience when i was 14 so to be actually performing on stage is a real achievement . "
but while there is much to look forward to , lewis - wearing a sequinned £ 25,000 versace couture dress - must now get ready for the umpteenth take of yet another scene on the second day of her video shoot .
the song will be released on 10 march as a double a-side with footprints in the sand , which is this year 's sport relief song .
sponsored mile making videos is still a relatively new experience for lewis , but her record label 's head of video , michael o 'keefe , says the singer has been " keen to learn and take on ideas " .
the video , directed by sophie muller - who previously worked with gwen stefani , the killers and coldplay - takes its inspiration from fashion photography , with lewis performing in front of " unrelated photographic set-ups " , he adds .
the clip for better in time 's flipside , footprint in the sand , will be shot when lewis visits orphanages in south africa to find out about sport relief 's work in poverty-stricken communities .
she flies out to africa immediately after the brits .
" we 're going to africa to make sure that there keeps on being awareness , " she said . "
just playing at the pre-grammys party with clive davis - i had to keep pinching myself then " leona lewis " footprints was actually a poem and it 's about standing by someone and being there for people who need your help . "
as we part company , i remind lewis that , the last time she spoke to the bbc news website in october , she described her post-x factor success as " a whirlwind " .
had anything changed , i wondered ?
" there 's always something different and new going on , " she says .
" just playing at the pre-grammys party with clive davis - i had to keep pinching myself then .
" i do n't think it 's ever something i could get used to . "
footprints in the sand / better in time is released on 10 march .

" i got invited to sing at the pre-grammy party , " she says , referring to the annual beverly hilton hotel bash held by the music mogul clive davis , who also happens to be lewis 's us label boss .
" just to go there with clive and to be introduced to whitney houston and janet jackson - alicia keys was there as well ...
to be amongst all those people was really special , " she says .
the appearance was the opening salvo in lewis 's campaign for us stardom .
the 22-year-old hopes to emulate winehouse 's grammy success after her debut album is released there in april .
lewis says she would love to emulate winehouse 's us success " everyone would love to have her achievements , " she admits .
in the uk , however , the two singers are roughly on par .
winehouse had the top selling album in the uk last year - shifting 1.85 million copies of back to black .
but lewis 's spirit was a close second , notching up 1.59 million sales in just two months .
both singers have been dubbed the best voice of their generation despite having very different sounds - lewis 's smooth controlled power contrasts with winehouse 's rugged soul timbre .
but similarities between the two are less striking than their differences .
achievements a moment like this - fastest-selling female debut single selling 600,000 in first week in december bleeding love - top-selling single of 2007 , 489,153 copies spirit - fastest-selling uk debut album of all time selling 375,872 copies first week aesthetically , winehouse , complete with tattoos and unkempt beehive hairdo , looks rough and ready while lewis exudes polished , styled glamour .
winehouse 's current stint in rehab is the latest episode and a long and very public battle with drug addiction .
teetotal lewis , meanwhile , has the sort of wholesome clean-cut image that has had top designers falling over themselves to provide her with a frock for next week 's brit awards - where she is nominated in four categories , including best single and best breakthrough act .
the ceremony is the next milestone in lewis 's short but already record-breaking career .
i was in the audience at the brits when i was 14 so to be actually performing on stage is a real achievement leona lewis " i 'm excited about the brits , " she says .
" i 'm excited about performing .
" i was in the audience when i was 14 so to be actually performing on stage is a real achievement . "
but while there is much to look forward to , lewis - wearing a sequinned £ 25,000 versace couture dress - must now get ready for the umpteenth take of yet another scene on the second day of her video shoot .
the song will be released on 10 march as a double a-side with footprints in the sand , which is this year 's sport relief song .
sponsored mile making videos is still a relatively new experience for lewis , but her record label 's head of video , michael o 'keefe , says the singer has been " keen to learn and take on ideas " .
lewis returned to x factor as a guest last year the video , directed by sophie muller - who previously worked with gwen stefani , the killers and coldplay - takes its inspiration from fashion photography , with lewis performing in front of " unrelated photographic set-ups " , he adds .
the clip for better in time 's flipside , footprint in the sand , will be shot when lewis visits orphanages in south africa to find out about sport relief 's work in poverty-stricken communities .
she flies out to africa immediately after the brits .
" we 're going to africa to make sure that there keeps on being awareness , " she said .
just playing at the pre-grammys party with clive davis - i had to keep pinching myself then leona lewis " footprints was actually a poem and it 's about standing by someone and being there for people who need your help . "
as we part company , i remind lewis that , the last time she spoke to the bbc news website in october , she described her post-x factor success as " a whirlwind " .
had anything changed , i wondered ?
" there 's always something different and new going on , " she says .
" just playing at the pre-grammys party with clive davis - i had to keep pinching myself then .
" i do n't think it 's ever something i could get used to . "
footprints in the sand / better in time is released on 10 march .

the surplus - the gap between what china exports and what it imports - grew to $ 22.7bn -lrb- £ 11.5bn -rrb- last month , compared with $ 15.9bn a year earlier .
china 's exports in january increased 26.7 % to $ 109.7bn , the biggest year-on-year rise in six months .
imports rose 27.6 % to $ 90.2bn , the biggest increase in almost two years .
yuan dispute the latest trade surplus figure was bigger than market estimates and is likely to renew criticism from the us and european union , who have accused china of undervaluing the yuan to make its exports artificially cheap .
the trade surplus figure is a bit lower than in the previous months , but still very strong yiping huang , citigroup chief china economist while beijing still does not allow the yuan to float freely against other currencies , it counters that the currency 's value has increased by 13 % since 2005 .
the chinese government also argues that it can not move any faster on liberalising the yuan for fear it could destabilise the country 's export-led economic boom .
china has instead moved to cool both exports and its overall breakneck economic growth through policies such as increased taxation , interest rate rises and limits on how much money banks can lend to businesses .
analysts said it would now be interesting to see how china 's exports were affected by continuing recession fears in the us .
" the first point is that we have n't really seen any significant softening of the growth numbers in terms of both exports and imports , " said yiping huang , chief china economist with citigroup in hong kong .
" the trade surplus figure is a bit lower than in the previous months , but still very strong . "
the international monetary fund said on friday that the chinese economy is likely to grow by 10 % this year , down slightly from 11.4 % in 2007 .

scientists at the university of east anglia -lrb- uea -rrb- have found that winter rain became more intense in the uk during the last 100 years .
similar increases in heavy rainfall are also evident in spring and , to a lesser extent , autumn .
a reduction in heavy summer downpours ended during the 1990s , and the uk has returned to more typical intense rain .
authors of the study said their results would boost other work currently being carried out on flood risk and the impact of extreme weather .
the study aims to help improve predictions of floods by using environmental science to investigate the physical processes involved .
extensive records using data from more than 600 rain gauges around the uk , from as far back as 1900 to as recently as 2006 the university 's climatic research unit classified every day 's measured precipitation into one of 10 categories of rainfall intensity , from drizzle to a downpour .
they then analysed how the amount of precipitation in each category has changed over time .
in winter , for example , the amount of precipitation falling in the heaviest category has increased over the last 40 years in all regions of the uk .
their classification took into account the typical differences in rainfall between summer and winter and across different regions of the country .
in parts of east anglia , for example , heavy rain meant at least 20mm falling on a single summer day , while in winter , 10mm in a day was sufficient to reach the heaviest category .
in the north-west highlands of scotland , rain or snow falls of at least 30mm in summer and even 60mm in winter were the minimum required to count towards the heaviest category .
this new , more extensive study , using up-to-date records , supports the existence of a long-term increase in winter precipitation intensity that is very widespread across the uk .
in the late 1960s , about 7 % of the uk 's winter precipitation came from heavy rain or snow events , while in the last 10 years that figure has been about 12 % .
" so far it is not clear what causes these trends and variations , " explained dr maraun .

in parts of east anglia , for example , heavy rain meant at least 20mm falling on a single summer day , while in winter , 10mm in a day was sufficient to reach the heaviest category .
in the north-west highlands of scotland , rain or snow falls of at least 30mm in summer and even 60mm in winter were the minimum required to count towards the heaviest category .
this new , more extensive study , using up-to-date records , supports the existence of a long-term increase in winter precipitation intensity that is very widespread across the uk .
in the late 1960s , about 7 % of the uk 's winter precipitation came from heavy rain or snow events , while in the last 10 years that figure has been about 12 % .
" so far it is not clear what causes these trends and variations , " explained dr maraun .

professor david baltimore , president of the american association for the advancement of science -lrb- aaas -rrb- , said there was little hope among scientists .
but he said that they were continuing efforts to develop a vaccine .
" our lack of success may be understandable but it is not acceptable , " he said .
" some years ago i came to the conclusion that our community had to seriously undertake new approaches or we might find ourselves with a worldwide epidemic and no effective response , " prof baltimore told the annual meeting of the aaas in boston .
" that is just where we are today . "
" i believe that hiv has found ways to totally fool the immune system - so we have to do one better than nature " professor david baltimore is hiv beating the scientists ?
hiv had evolved a way to protect itself from the human immune system , he said .
" this is a huge challenge because to control hiv immunologically the scientific community has to beat out nature , do something that nature , with its advantage of four billion years of evolution , has not been able to do , " prof baltimore said .
" i believe that hiv has found ways to totally fool the immune system .
" so we have to do one better than nature . "
' one shot ' attempts to control the virus through antibodies or by boosting the body 's immune system have ended in failure .
this has left the vaccine community depressed because they can see no hopeful way of success , prof baltimore said .
guide : the biology of aids among the novel techniques that scientists are turning to are gene and stem cell therapy , although these are still in their infancy .
" in the human you really only have one shot which is to try to change genes in stem cells , " said prof baltimore , one of the leading experts on the hiv virus .
" so we 're trying to do that , to design vectors that can carry genes that will be of therapeutic advantage . "
prof baltimore won the nobel prize in medicine in 1975 for the co-discovery of reverse transcriptase , an enzyme that was later found to be used by hiv to replicate in human cells .
he now leads the baltimore laboratory at caltech , with support from the gates foundation , to look for ways to genetically boost the immune system against infectious agents , particularly hiv .

professor david baltimore , president of the american association for the advancement of science -lrb- aaas -rrb- , said there was little hope among scientists .
but he said that they were continuing efforts to develop a vaccine .
" our lack of success may be understandable but it is not acceptable , " he said .
" some years ago i came to the conclusion that our community had to seriously undertake new approaches or we might find ourselves with a worldwide epidemic and no effective response , " prof baltimore told the annual meeting of the aaas in boston .
" that is just where we are today . "
i believe that hiv has found ways to totally fool the immune system - so we have to do one better than nature professor david baltimore is hiv beating the scientists ?
hiv had evolved a way to protect itself from the human immune system , he said .
" this is a huge challenge because to control hiv immunologically the scientific community has to beat out nature , do something that nature , with its advantage of four billion years of evolution , has not been able to do , " prof baltimore said .
" i believe that hiv has found ways to totally fool the immune system .
" so we have to do one better than nature . "
' one shot ' attempts to control the virus through antibodies or by boosting the body 's immune system have ended in failure .
this has left the vaccine community depressed because they can see no hopeful way of success , prof baltimore said .
guide : the biology of aids among the novel techniques that scientists are turning to are gene and stem cell therapy , although these are still in their infancy .
" in the human you really only have one shot which is to try to change genes in stem cells , " said prof baltimore , one of the leading experts on the hiv virus .
" so we 're trying to do that , to design vectors that can carry genes that will be of therapeutic advantage . "
prof baltimore won the nobel prize in medicine in 1975 for the co-discovery of reverse transcriptase , an enzyme that was later found to be used by hiv to replicate in human cells .
he now leads the baltimore laboratory at caltech , with support from the gates foundation , to look for ways to genetically boost the immune system against infectious agents , particularly hiv .
