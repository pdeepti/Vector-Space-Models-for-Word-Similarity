program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de bundesliga -pipe- 05.08.2008 bundesliga loses another top star in van der vaart großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : rafael van der vaart has waved bye-bye to hamburg rafael van der vaart 's transfer to real madrid came as a surprise to no one .
but the departure of the former hamburg playmaker shows once again that bayern are the only bundesliga club that can keep world-class talent . hamburg confirmed that their best player was leaving on monday , august 4 , ending a year of speculation in which the question was not whether van der vaart was going , but when , to whom and for how much .
because of a clause in the dutchman 's contract , which would have allowed him to leave for 1.5 million euros -lrb- $ 2.3 million -rrb- next season , hamburg had to sell .
the 14-16 million euro deal , depending on how real performs with van der vaart , is about half of his estimated market value - the best hamburg could do under the circumstances .
van der vaart has described the move as a dream come true , while the man who now wo n't be his coach , dutchman martin jol , told germany 's bild newspaper he considered the playmaker " one of the best players in the past 25 years . "
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the playmaker scored 29 goals in 74 matches for his ex-employers the 25-year-old playmaker , who 's already won 58 caps for holland , was certainly one of the best hamburg has seen in the last quarter-century .
with him the german side qualified for international competition three years on the trot .
significantly , when van der vaart was out injured for the first half of the 2006-7 season , hamburg had the second worst record in the league - when he came back in the second season half , hamburg were second-best .
his departure thus likely turns hamburg from a champions league contender to an also-ran in a transition year .
it also underscores the fact that , lamentably and with one notable exception , the bundesliga can not compete for the services of the world 's soccer elite .
no more mighty mice bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : kevin keegan and his amazing afro-styled hair played for hamburg in the late ' 70s things were n't always this way for hamburg and other comparably sized german clubs .
in 1977 , for instance , hamburg landed a spectacular transfer , attracting english striker kevin keegan away from liverpool .
mighty mouse , as the diminutive forward was quickly nicknamed , won the european player of the year award with hamburg and led the team to a league title and a berth in the final of the old european club championship .
-lrb- they lost to nottingham forest -rrb- .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : but in 2008 stars like steven gerrard give the bundesliga a miss what a difference three decades make .
the mere thought of steven gerrard or fernando torres leaving liverpool for hamburg is enough to draw guffaws from any football fan .
and hamburg are n't alone in perennially bumping their heads on what amounts to a glass ceiling .
in the next couple of seasons , bremen and stuttgart are likely to find themselves in the same situation with respect to stars diego and mario gomez as hamburg was with van der vaart .
bayern munich , alone , is capable of not only signing but retaining players of the top caliber .
so why have the rest of the bundesliga 's ambitious sides become so unattractive ?
money + success = more success bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : bayern 's record of achievement attracts the big names real madrid is one of the wealthiest clubs in the world , and even the other giants of the game - as manchester united are finding out right now with cristiano ronaldo - have a hard time staving off the spaniards ' advances when a player has caught their fancy .
but perhaps more important than money is the fact that no bundesliga side other than bayern has been able to establish its credentials as a regular contender for the prize of prizes - a champions league title .
that 's down to bayern 's double-advantage policy of buying up stars from other bundesliga clubs , simultaneously strengthening their own squad while weakening their domestic rivals .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : leverkusen fell apart when ballack turned his back on them case in point : bayer leverkusen .
in 2002 , they reached the champions league final , losing somewhat unluckily to real madrid .
as a club backed by the financial might of germany 's biggest pharmaceutical company , they looked like a decent bet to jump into europe 's elite .
instead bayern lured two of leverkusen 's mainstays , midfielders michael ballack and ze roberto , into jumping ship .
as a result , bayer leverkusen barely avoided relegation in 2003 and has never even qualified for the champions league again .
moreover , within that time span , no other german team other than those two has made a champions league semifinal , let alone a final .
and that 's what club soccer is all about for the world 's best .
so while bayern contends for glory year in , year out with the likes of frank ribery , luca toni and miroslav klose , clubs like hamburg are fated to losing players of van der vaart 's caliber , just as they should be poised to make the jump to the next level . jefferson chase send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

the goal is to reduce expensive energy imports . a german plan to extending the use of the country 's nuclear power plants beyond the set phase-out period in 2020 is more concrete than expected , der tagesspiegel newspaper reported tuesday , aug .
5 .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : will merkel , left , and glos , sign off on the paper ?
german economics minister michael glos recently set up an expert group called the political energy program , or pepp , consisting of top scientists and economy ministry officials .
the committee has come out in favor of an “ atomic energy use law , ” which has a complete framework and is set to be reviewed by the chancellery this fall .
“ turning back from the plan to phase out nuclear energy makes ecological and economic sense , and we recommend it , ” the scientist group wrote in the paper , according to tagesspiegel .
the paper recommends extending the planned use of german atomic plants by eight years , from a current 32 years up to “ at least 40 years . ” if not , in 10 years germans will need to generate twice as much energy from expensive gas as they do today , the experts warned .
committee urges swift action this would create “ many billions of euros ” in extra costs for consumers , given the soaring prices of natural gas , the paper said .
to avoid this , a decision must be made " as quickly as possible - at latest , at the beginning of the next legislative period , " to revoke the existing nuclear phase-out law , ” the pepp authors wrote .
under the previous red-green government , germany passed a law requiring a total decommissioning of nuclear power plants by 2021 .
to relieve pressure on consumers in the short term , the paper recommends political support for cheaper energy , using a calculation based on atomic energy prices .

bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : foreign natural gas is increasingly expensive this , in turn , would help make public discourse on nuclear energy “ more objective , ” according to pepp .
plan advocates voluntary investment of profits shortly before the summer legislative recess , the german cabinet assigned glos to examine the effect of the global energy crisis on the german economy , and to present solutions for an efficient , secure and cost-effective energy policy .
as part of that effort glos formed the pepp group .
according to tagesspiegel , glos has yet to officially sign off on the paper .
in the paper , pepp suggested that any profits the nuclear plants make by staying open longer should be set aside in a foundation , and be used to invest in energy efficiency , energy research and renewable energies .
the foundations should n't be mandated by legislation , but should take place in “ a framework of voluntary agreements . ”
they also said it is crucial to investigate possible terminal storage areas for atomic waste , with the “ aim of finding a solution . ” dw staff -lrb- jen -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de nuclear power -pipe- 05.08.2008 german experts recommend delaying nuclear phase-out großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : experts say the phase-out should be slowed down , if not stopped an expert commission has recommended pushing back germany 's planned nuclear phase-out by at least eight years , according to a news report published on tuesday .
the goal is to reduce expensive energy imports . a german plan to extending the use of the country 's nuclear power plants beyond the set phase-out period in 2020 is more concrete than expected , der tagesspiegel newspaper reported tuesday , aug .
5 .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : will merkel , left , and glos , sign off on the paper ?
german economics minister michael glos recently set up an expert group called the political energy program , or pepp , consisting of top scientists and economy ministry officials .
the committee has come out in favor of an “ atomic energy use law , ” which has a complete framework and is set to be reviewed by the chancellery this fall .
“ turning back from the plan to phase out nuclear energy makes ecological and economic sense , and we recommend it , ” the scientist group wrote in the paper , according to tagesspiegel .
the paper recommends extending the planned use of german atomic plants by eight years , from a current 32 years up to “ at least 40 years . ” if not , in 10 years germans will need to generate twice as much energy from expensive gas as they do today , the experts warned .
committee urges swift action this would create “ many billions of euros ” in extra costs for consumers , given the soaring prices of natural gas , the paper said .
to avoid this , a decision must be made " as quickly as possible - at latest , at the beginning of the next legislative period , " to revoke the existing nuclear phase-out law , ” the pepp authors wrote .
under the previous red-green government , germany passed a law requiring a total decommissioning of nuclear power plants by 2021 .
to relieve pressure on consumers in the short term , the paper recommends political support for cheaper energy , using a calculation based on atomic energy prices .
this would have a “ social component , ” the authors wrote , and would also help publicize the cost advantages of nuclear energy .

the committee has come out in favor of an “ atomic energy use law , ” which has a complete framework and is set to be reviewed by the chancellery this fall .
“ turning back from the plan to phase out nuclear energy makes ecological and economic sense , and we recommend it , ” the scientist group wrote in the paper , according to tagesspiegel .
the paper recommends extending the planned use of german atomic plants by eight years , from a current 32 years up to “ at least 40 years . ” if not , in 10 years germans will need to generate twice as much energy from expensive gas as they do today , the experts warned .
committee urges swift action this would create “ many billions of euros ” in extra costs for consumers , given the soaring prices of natural gas , the paper said .
to avoid this , a decision must be made " as quickly as possible - at latest , at the beginning of the next legislative period , " to revoke the existing nuclear phase-out law , ” the pepp authors wrote .
under the previous red-green government , germany passed a law requiring a total decommissioning of nuclear power plants by 2021 .
to relieve pressure on consumers in the short term , the paper recommends political support for cheaper energy , using a calculation based on atomic energy prices .
this would have a “ social component , ” the authors wrote , and would also help publicize the cost advantages of nuclear energy .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : foreign natural gas is increasingly expensive this , in turn , would help make public discourse on nuclear energy “ more objective , ” according to pepp .
plan advocates voluntary investment of profits shortly before the summer legislative recess , the german cabinet assigned glos to examine the effect of the global energy crisis on the german economy , and to present solutions for an efficient , secure and cost-effective energy policy .
as part of that effort glos formed the pepp group .
according to tagesspiegel , glos has yet to officially sign off on the paper .
in the paper , pepp suggested that any profits the nuclear plants make by staying open longer should be set aside in a foundation , and be used to invest in energy efficiency , energy research and renewable energies .
the foundations should n't be mandated by legislation , but should take place in “ a framework of voluntary agreements . ”
they also said it is crucial to investigate possible terminal storage areas for atomic waste , with the “ aim of finding a solution . ” dw staff -lrb- jen -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

the goal is to reduce expensive energy imports . a german plan to extending the use of the country 's nuclear power plants beyond the set phase-out period in 2020 is more concrete than expected , der tagesspiegel newspaper reported tuesday , aug .
5 .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : will merkel , left , and glos , sign off on the paper ?
german economics minister michael glos recently set up an expert group called the political energy program , or pepp , consisting of top scientists and economy ministry officials .
the committee has come out in favor of an “ atomic energy use law , ” which has a complete framework and is set to be reviewed by the chancellery this fall .
“ turning back from the plan to phase out nuclear energy makes ecological and economic sense , and we recommend it , ” the scientist group wrote in the paper , according to tagesspiegel .
the paper recommends extending the planned use of german atomic plants by eight years , from a current 32 years up to “ at least 40 years . ” if not , in 10 years germans will need to generate twice as much energy from expensive gas as they do today , the experts warned .
committee urges swift action this would create “ many billions of euros ” in extra costs for consumers , given the soaring prices of natural gas , the paper said .
to avoid this , a decision must be made " as quickly as possible - at latest , at the beginning of the next legislative period , " to revoke the existing nuclear phase-out law , ” the pepp authors wrote .
under the previous red-green government , germany passed a law requiring a total decommissioning of nuclear power plants by 2021 .
to relieve pressure on consumers in the short term , the paper recommends political support for cheaper energy , using a calculation based on atomic energy prices .
this would have a “ social component , ” the authors wrote , and would also help publicize the cost advantages of nuclear energy .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : foreign natural gas is increasingly expensive this , in turn , would help make public discourse on nuclear energy “ more objective , ” according to pepp .
plan advocates voluntary investment of profits shortly before the summer legislative recess , the german cabinet assigned glos to examine the effect of the global energy crisis on the german economy , and to present solutions for an efficient , secure and cost-effective energy policy .
as part of that effort glos formed the pepp group .
according to tagesspiegel , glos has yet to officially sign off on the paper .
in the paper , pepp suggested that any profits the nuclear plants make by staying open longer should be set aside in a foundation , and be used to invest in energy efficiency , energy research and renewable energies .
the foundations should n't be mandated by legislation , but should take place in “ a framework of voluntary agreements . ”
they also said it is crucial to investigate possible terminal storage areas for atomic waste , with the “ aim of finding a solution . ” dw staff -lrb- jen -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

" there are no plans to purchase a fighter drone for the bundeswehr , " a spokesman for the german defense ministry in berlin said .
the defense security cooperation agency -lrb- dsca -rrb- notified congress that germany had requested a possible sale of five of the unmanned combat aircraft while italy had asked for four .
the sale of the hunter-killer drones was valued at up to $ 330 million -lrb- 212 million euros -rrb- for italy , as the agreement would include five years of maintenance support .
germany 's sale , which includes just one year of maintenance support , was estimated at $ 205 million .
both countries are seeking the new drones " for the defense of deployed troops , regional security and interoperability with the united states , " the dsca said in its notification .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : italian pm berlusconi has long been a supporter of the war in iraq " this program will increase italy 's ability to contribute to future nato , coalition , and anti-terrorism operations that the us may undertake , " the agency said .
why fear the mq-9 reaper ?
known as a hunter-killer drone , the reaper was deployed only recently in iraq , flying for the first time from balad air base on july 17 .
it 's been used in afghanistan since september .
the reaper , which can carry four hellfire missiles and two 500-pound laser guided bombs , can fly faster , higher , farther and carry more weapons than its predecessor , according to lieutenant general gary north , the commander of us air forces in the middle east .
" we have turned a corner in warfare by bringing in this new platform that complements - and i stress complements - our incredible manned capacity today , " he told afp news agency .
" by acquiring this capability , germany will be able to provide the same level of protection for its own forces as those of the united states , " the dsca said .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de nuclear power -pipe- 05.08.2008 german experts recommend delaying nuclear phase-out großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : experts say the phase-out should be slowed down , if not stopped an expert commission has recommended pushing back germany 's planned nuclear phase-out by at least eight years , according to a news report published on tuesday .
the goal is to reduce expensive energy imports . a german plan to extending the use of the country 's nuclear power plants beyond the set phase-out period in 2020 is more concrete than expected , der tagesspiegel newspaper reported tuesday , aug .
5 .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : will merkel , left , and glos , sign off on the paper ?
german economics minister michael glos recently set up an expert group called the political energy program , or pepp , consisting of top scientists and economy ministry officials .
the committee has come out in favor of an “ atomic energy use law , ” which has a complete framework and is set to be reviewed by the chancellery this fall .
“ turning back from the plan to phase out nuclear energy makes ecological and economic sense , and we recommend it , ” the scientist group wrote in the paper , according to tagesspiegel .
the paper recommends extending the planned use of german atomic plants by eight years , from a current 32 years up to “ at least 40 years . ” if not , in 10 years germans will need to generate twice as much energy from expensive gas as they do today , the experts warned .
committee urges swift action this would create “ many billions of euros ” in extra costs for consumers , given the soaring prices of natural gas , the paper said .
to avoid this , a decision must be made " as quickly as possible - at latest , at the beginning of the next legislative period , " to revoke the existing nuclear phase-out law , ” the pepp authors wrote .
under the previous red-green government , germany passed a law requiring a total decommissioning of nuclear power plants by 2021 .
to relieve pressure on consumers in the short term , the paper recommends political support for cheaper energy , using a calculation based on atomic energy prices .
this would have a “ social component , ” the authors wrote , and would also help publicize the cost advantages of nuclear energy .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : foreign natural gas is increasingly expensive this , in turn , would help make public discourse on nuclear energy “ more objective , ” according to pepp .
plan advocates voluntary investment of profits shortly before the summer legislative recess , the german cabinet assigned glos to examine the effect of the global energy crisis on the german economy , and to present solutions for an efficient , secure and cost-effective energy policy .
as part of that effort glos formed the pepp group .
according to tagesspiegel , glos has yet to officially sign off on the paper .
in the paper , pepp suggested that any profits the nuclear plants make by staying open longer should be set aside in a foundation , and be used to invest in energy efficiency , energy research and renewable energies .
the foundations should n't be mandated by legislation , but should take place in “ a framework of voluntary agreements . ”
they also said it is crucial to investigate possible terminal storage areas for atomic waste , with the “ aim of finding a solution . ” dw staff -lrb- jen -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

sony and bertelsmann had each owned half of the new-york based sony bmg , the world 's second biggest music company since its creation in 2004 .

by doing so , he 's trying to help people understand the actions of china 's rulers , who have - permanently or temporarily - blocked the web sites of international media organizations , such as the bbc , the frankfurter allgemeine zeitung or deutsche welle , even within the press center of the olympic games . web sites are blocked all over the world - vesper is right about that .
but his comparison is still wrong and uncalled for . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : daniel scheschkewitz in germany , right-wing extremist sites are blocked because they instigate people to commit crimes and because the spreading of right-wing extremist ideas in itself is already a crime .
in the people 's republic of china on the other hand , the foreign press is denied free access to the internet , because media organizations - for reasons of state - are permanently and systematically controlled there .
why should guests be allowed to do what the own population is n't allowed to do ? from its own point of view , china 's leadership is acting logically and consequentially : in for a penny , in for a pound .
relaxing media censorship during the olympic games would have been a major surprise and would have sent a signal to the chinese population .
once freedoms have been granted , it 's very hard to take them away again .
the process of liberal evolution most often develops a dynamic of its own that 's hard to reckon with . china 's principled stand is countered by the west 's softness .
not only olympic officials , but also politicians and even representatives of journalistic organizations have only mildly protested with self-imposed restraint against the censorship measures so far .
a misunderstood pragmatism and a wish to woo a rising economic superpower are reasons for this . this playing with fire ould easily cost the west its soul .
without free discourse and the unhindered exchange of ideas , our free economic order does n't mean much , either .
the strength of our civil societies is based on tolerance and respect for the opinions of those who think differently . china has invited the world for the olympic games .
but the doors remain closed for the global spectrum of opinions - not only in the country but also in those places where journalists are supposed to make use of their right to unhindered access to information : in press centers and beijing 's large hotels .
to accept this chinese censorship is misconceived tolerance .
the west loses its credibility .
china will feel vindicated and continue to let no one dictate to it about human rights . besides - without pressure , no power apparatus , especially a regime that 's based on repression , will move an inch .
as good guests , olympic athletes and officials should respect their host country , its customs and traditions .
but if the rules of the game violate our fundamental values , one has to be able to point this out with indignation - even in china , and especially during the olympic games . daniel scheschkewitz is dw-radio 's national correspondent -lrb- win -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

by doing so , he 's trying to help people understand the actions of china 's rulers , who have - permanently or temporarily - blocked the web sites of international media organizations , such as the bbc , the frankfurter allgemeine zeitung or deutsche welle , even within the press center of the olympic games . web sites are blocked all over the world - vesper is right about that .
but his comparison is still wrong and uncalled for . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : daniel scheschkewitz in germany , right-wing extremist sites are blocked because they instigate people to commit crimes and because the spreading of right-wing extremist ideas in itself is already a crime .
in the people 's republic of china on the other hand , the foreign press is denied free access to the internet , because media organizations - for reasons of state - are permanently and systematically controlled there .
why should guests be allowed to do what the own population is n't allowed to do ? from its own point of view , china 's leadership is acting logically and consequentially : in for a penny , in for a pound .
relaxing media censorship during the olympic games would have been a major surprise and would have sent a signal to the chinese population .

the process of liberal evolution most often develops a dynamic of its own that 's hard to reckon with . china 's principled stand is countered by the west 's softness .
not only olympic officials , but also politicians and even representatives of journalistic organizations have only mildly protested with self-imposed restraint against the censorship measures so far .
a misunderstood pragmatism and a wish to woo a rising economic superpower are reasons for this . this playing with fire ould easily cost the west its soul .
without free discourse and the unhindered exchange of ideas , our free economic order does n't mean much , either .
the strength of our civil societies is based on tolerance and respect for the opinions of those who think differently . china has invited the world for the olympic games .
but the doors remain closed for the global spectrum of opinions - not only in the country but also in those places where journalists are supposed to make use of their right to unhindered access to information : in press centers and beijing 's large hotels .
to accept this chinese censorship is misconceived tolerance .
the west loses its credibility .
china will feel vindicated and continue to let no one dictate to it about human rights . besides - without pressure , no power apparatus , especially a regime that 's based on repression , will move an inch .

18 , 1977 , became known as death night for the leaders of the red army faction .
these were among the events collectively known as the german autumn , which also included a series of terrorist attacks and the west german government 's response .
debate over suicides according to a report in the stuttgarter zeitung on tuesday , aug .
5 , the pictures include images of the abduction of leading raf terrorists baader , ensslin and raspe , as well as the emergency operation performed on irmgard moeller , who tried to kill herself by stabbing herself four times in the chest .
bildunterschrift : germany sought the terrorists with ' wanted ' posters she survived her suicide attempt and has since stated that the deaths were not suicide , but rather extrajudicial killings undertaken by the german government of the time , a claim strongly denied by german governments , former and present .
photos show " nothing new " the pictures were discovered in a suitcase in the basement of a house a week ago , and had been taken by a long-deceased police photographer .
now they have been given to the stuttgart prosecutor 's office for further examination , a spokeswoman for the investigators confirmed .
on first look , the photos do n't show anything new , the spokeswoman said .
“ possibly , a few well-known pictures are shown again from a different angle , ” she added .
the newspaper further reported that the pictures were mostly taken to be used in the so-called stammheim deaths trial .
the files of the hotly debated trial were sent to the state archive in ludwigsburg in 2005 , but a few months ago were retrieved by the stuttgart prosecutors ' office .
prosecutor : new look at case unlikely now they are checking whether new investigations will be made into the politically explosive case .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : two of the raf leaders , ensslin and baader the spokeswoman for the prosecutors ' office said the files had been moved for space reasons .
when the media began reporting last year that security officers may have allowed the suicides to happen , investigators sought the files out again – “ a completely normal thing to do . ”
however , she said there are no indications pointing to a new look into the events of the autumn of 1977 . dw staff -lrb- jen -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de bundesliga -pipe- 05.08.2008 bundesliga loses another top star in van der vaart großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : rafael van der vaart has waved bye-bye to hamburg rafael van der vaart 's transfer to real madrid came as a surprise to no one .
but the departure of the former hamburg playmaker shows once again that bayern are the only bundesliga club that can keep world-class talent . hamburg confirmed that their best player was leaving on monday , august 4 , ending a year of speculation in which the question was not whether van der vaart was going , but when , to whom and for how much .
because of a clause in the dutchman 's contract , which would have allowed him to leave for 1.5 million euros -lrb- $ 2.3 million -rrb- next season , hamburg had to sell .
the 14-16 million euro deal , depending on how real performs with van der vaart , is about half of his estimated market value - the best hamburg could do under the circumstances .
van der vaart has described the move as a dream come true , while the man who now wo n't be his coach , dutchman martin jol , told germany 's bild newspaper he considered the playmaker " one of the best players in the past 25 years . "
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the playmaker scored 29 goals in 74 matches for his ex-employers the 25-year-old playmaker , who 's already won 58 caps for holland , was certainly one of the best hamburg has seen in the last quarter-century .
with him the german side qualified for international competition three years on the trot .
significantly , when van der vaart was out injured for the first half of the 2006-7 season , hamburg had the second worst record in the league - when he came back in the second season half , hamburg were second-best .
his departure thus likely turns hamburg from a champions league contender to an also-ran in a transition year .
it also underscores the fact that , lamentably and with one notable exception , the bundesliga can not compete for the services of the world 's soccer elite .
no more mighty mice bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : kevin keegan and his amazing afro-styled hair played for hamburg in the late ' 70s things were n't always this way for hamburg and other comparably sized german clubs .
in 1977 , for instance , hamburg landed a spectacular transfer , attracting english striker kevin keegan away from liverpool .
mighty mouse , as the diminutive forward was quickly nicknamed , won the european player of the year award with hamburg and led the team to a league title and a berth in the final of the old european club championship .
-lrb- they lost to nottingham forest -rrb- .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : but in 2008 stars like steven gerrard give the bundesliga a miss what a difference three decades make .
the mere thought of steven gerrard or fernando torres leaving liverpool for hamburg is enough to draw guffaws from any football fan .
and hamburg are n't alone in perennially bumping their heads on what amounts to a glass ceiling .
in the next couple of seasons , bremen and stuttgart are likely to find themselves in the same situation with respect to stars diego and mario gomez as hamburg was with van der vaart .
bayern munich , alone , is capable of not only signing but retaining players of the top caliber .
so why have the rest of the bundesliga 's ambitious sides become so unattractive ?
money + success = more success bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : bayern 's record of achievement attracts the big names real madrid is one of the wealthiest clubs in the world , and even the other giants of the game - as manchester united are finding out right now with cristiano ronaldo - have a hard time staving off the spaniards ' advances when a player has caught their fancy .
but perhaps more important than money is the fact that no bundesliga side other than bayern has been able to establish its credentials as a regular contender for the prize of prizes - a champions league title .
that 's down to bayern 's double-advantage policy of buying up stars from other bundesliga clubs , simultaneously strengthening their own squad while weakening their domestic rivals .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : leverkusen fell apart when ballack turned his back on them case in point : bayer leverkusen .
in 2002 , they reached the champions league final , losing somewhat unluckily to real madrid .
as a club backed by the financial might of germany 's biggest pharmaceutical company , they looked like a decent bet to jump into europe 's elite .
instead bayern lured two of leverkusen 's mainstays , midfielders michael ballack and ze roberto , into jumping ship .
as a result , bayer leverkusen barely avoided relegation in 2003 and has never even qualified for the champions league again .
moreover , within that time span , no other german team other than those two has made a champions league semifinal , let alone a final .
and that 's what club soccer is all about for the world 's best .
so while bayern contends for glory year in , year out with the likes of frank ribery , luca toni and miroslav klose , clubs like hamburg are fated to losing players of van der vaart 's caliber , just as they should be poised to make the jump to the next level . jefferson chase send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

but the departure of the former hamburg playmaker shows once again that bayern are the only bundesliga club that can keep world-class talent . hamburg confirmed that their best player was leaving on monday , august 4 , ending a year of speculation in which the question was not whether van der vaart was going , but when , to whom and for how much .
because of a clause in the dutchman 's contract , which would have allowed him to leave for 1.5 million euros -lrb- $ 2.3 million -rrb- next season , hamburg had to sell .
the 14-16 million euro deal , depending on how real performs with van der vaart , is about half of his estimated market value - the best hamburg could do under the circumstances .
van der vaart has described the move as a dream come true , while the man who now wo n't be his coach , dutchman martin jol , told germany 's bild newspaper he considered the playmaker " one of the best players in the past 25 years . "
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the playmaker scored 29 goals in 74 matches for his ex-employers the 25-year-old playmaker , who 's already won 58 caps for holland , was certainly one of the best hamburg has seen in the last quarter-century .
with him the german side qualified for international competition three years on the trot .
significantly , when van der vaart was out injured for the first half of the 2006-7 season , hamburg had the second worst record in the league - when he came back in the second season half , hamburg were second-best .
his departure thus likely turns hamburg from a champions league contender to an also-ran in a transition year .
it also underscores the fact that , lamentably and with one notable exception , the bundesliga can not compete for the services of the world 's soccer elite .
no more mighty mice bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : kevin keegan and his amazing afro-styled hair played for hamburg in the late ' 70s things were n't always this way for hamburg and other comparably sized german clubs .

the mere thought of steven gerrard or fernando torres leaving liverpool for hamburg is enough to draw guffaws from any football fan .
and hamburg are n't alone in perennially bumping their heads on what amounts to a glass ceiling .
in the next couple of seasons , bremen and stuttgart are likely to find themselves in the same situation with respect to stars diego and mario gomez as hamburg was with van der vaart .

but perhaps more important than money is the fact that no bundesliga side other than bayern has been able to establish its credentials as a regular contender for the prize of prizes - a champions league title .
that 's down to bayern 's double-advantage policy of buying up stars from other bundesliga clubs , simultaneously strengthening their own squad while weakening their domestic rivals .

18 , 1977 , became known as death night for the leaders of the red army faction .
these were among the events collectively known as the german autumn , which also included a series of terrorist attacks and the west german government 's response .
debate over suicides according to a report in the stuttgarter zeitung on tuesday , aug .
5 , the pictures include images of the abduction of leading raf terrorists baader , ensslin and raspe , as well as the emergency operation performed on irmgard moeller , who tried to kill herself by stabbing herself four times in the chest .
bildunterschrift : germany sought the terrorists with ' wanted ' posters she survived her suicide attempt and has since stated that the deaths were not suicide , but rather extrajudicial killings undertaken by the german government of the time , a claim strongly denied by german governments , former and present .
photos show " nothing new " the pictures were discovered in a suitcase in the basement of a house a week ago , and had been taken by a long-deceased police photographer .
now they have been given to the stuttgart prosecutor 's office for further examination , a spokeswoman for the investigators confirmed .
on first look , the photos do n't show anything new , the spokeswoman said .
“ possibly , a few well-known pictures are shown again from a different angle , ” she added .
the newspaper further reported that the pictures were mostly taken to be used in the so-called stammheim deaths trial .
the files of the hotly debated trial were sent to the state archive in ludwigsburg in 2005 , but a few months ago were retrieved by the stuttgart prosecutors ' office .
prosecutor : new look at case unlikely now they are checking whether new investigations will be made into the politically explosive case .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : two of the raf leaders , ensslin and baader the spokeswoman for the prosecutors ' office said the files had been moved for space reasons .

these were among the events collectively known as the german autumn , which also included a series of terrorist attacks and the west german government 's response .
debate over suicides according to a report in the stuttgarter zeitung on tuesday , aug .
5 , the pictures include images of the abduction of leading raf terrorists baader , ensslin and raspe , as well as the emergency operation performed on irmgard moeller , who tried to kill herself by stabbing herself four times in the chest .
bildunterschrift : germany sought the terrorists with ' wanted ' posters she survived her suicide attempt and has since stated that the deaths were not suicide , but rather extrajudicial killings undertaken by the german government of the time , a claim strongly denied by german governments , former and present .
photos show " nothing new " the pictures were discovered in a suitcase in the basement of a house a week ago , and had been taken by a long-deceased police photographer .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de bundesliga -pipe- 05.08.2008 bundesliga loses another top star in van der vaart großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : rafael van der vaart has waved bye-bye to hamburg rafael van der vaart 's transfer to real madrid came as a surprise to no one .
but the departure of the former hamburg playmaker shows once again that bayern are the only bundesliga club that can keep world-class talent . hamburg confirmed that their best player was leaving on monday , august 4 , ending a year of speculation in which the question was not whether van der vaart was going , but when , to whom and for how much .
because of a clause in the dutchman 's contract , which would have allowed him to leave for 1.5 million euros -lrb- $ 2.3 million -rrb- next season , hamburg had to sell .
the 14-16 million euro deal , depending on how real performs with van der vaart , is about half of his estimated market value - the best hamburg could do under the circumstances .
van der vaart has described the move as a dream come true , while the man who now wo n't be his coach , dutchman martin jol , told germany 's bild newspaper he considered the playmaker " one of the best players in the past 25 years . "
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the playmaker scored 29 goals in 74 matches for his ex-employers the 25-year-old playmaker , who 's already won 58 caps for holland , was certainly one of the best hamburg has seen in the last quarter-century .
with him the german side qualified for international competition three years on the trot .
significantly , when van der vaart was out injured for the first half of the 2006-7 season , hamburg had the second worst record in the league - when he came back in the second season half , hamburg were second-best .
his departure thus likely turns hamburg from a champions league contender to an also-ran in a transition year .
it also underscores the fact that , lamentably and with one notable exception , the bundesliga can not compete for the services of the world 's soccer elite .
no more mighty mice bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : kevin keegan and his amazing afro-styled hair played for hamburg in the late ' 70s things were n't always this way for hamburg and other comparably sized german clubs .
in 1977 , for instance , hamburg landed a spectacular transfer , attracting english striker kevin keegan away from liverpool .
mighty mouse , as the diminutive forward was quickly nicknamed , won the european player of the year award with hamburg and led the team to a league title and a berth in the final of the old european club championship .
-lrb- they lost to nottingham forest -rrb- .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : but in 2008 stars like steven gerrard give the bundesliga a miss what a difference three decades make .
the mere thought of steven gerrard or fernando torres leaving liverpool for hamburg is enough to draw guffaws from any football fan .
and hamburg are n't alone in perennially bumping their heads on what amounts to a glass ceiling .
in the next couple of seasons , bremen and stuttgart are likely to find themselves in the same situation with respect to stars diego and mario gomez as hamburg was with van der vaart .
bayern munich , alone , is capable of not only signing but retaining players of the top caliber .
so why have the rest of the bundesliga 's ambitious sides become so unattractive ?
money + success = more success bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : bayern 's record of achievement attracts the big names real madrid is one of the wealthiest clubs in the world , and even the other giants of the game - as manchester united are finding out right now with cristiano ronaldo - have a hard time staving off the spaniards ' advances when a player has caught their fancy .
but perhaps more important than money is the fact that no bundesliga side other than bayern has been able to establish its credentials as a regular contender for the prize of prizes - a champions league title .
that 's down to bayern 's double-advantage policy of buying up stars from other bundesliga clubs , simultaneously strengthening their own squad while weakening their domestic rivals .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : leverkusen fell apart when ballack turned his back on them case in point : bayer leverkusen .
in 2002 , they reached the champions league final , losing somewhat unluckily to real madrid .
as a club backed by the financial might of germany 's biggest pharmaceutical company , they looked like a decent bet to jump into europe 's elite .
instead bayern lured two of leverkusen 's mainstays , midfielders michael ballack and ze roberto , into jumping ship .
as a result , bayer leverkusen barely avoided relegation in 2003 and has never even qualified for the champions league again .
moreover , within that time span , no other german team other than those two has made a champions league semifinal , let alone a final .
and that 's what club soccer is all about for the world 's best .
so while bayern contends for glory year in , year out with the likes of frank ribery , luca toni and miroslav klose , clubs like hamburg are fated to losing players of van der vaart 's caliber , just as they should be poised to make the jump to the next level . jefferson chase send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

german economics minister michael glos recently set up an expert group called the political energy program , or pepp , consisting of top scientists and economy ministry officials .
the committee has come out in favor of an “ atomic energy use law , ” which has a complete framework and is set to be reviewed by the chancellery this fall .
“ turning back from the plan to phase out nuclear energy makes ecological and economic sense , and we recommend it , ” the scientist group wrote in the paper , according to tagesspiegel .
the paper recommends extending the planned use of german atomic plants by eight years , from a current 32 years up to “ at least 40 years . ” if not , in 10 years germans will need to generate twice as much energy from expensive gas as they do today , the experts warned .
committee urges swift action this would create “ many billions of euros ” in extra costs for consumers , given the soaring prices of natural gas , the paper said .
to avoid this , a decision must be made " as quickly as possible - at latest , at the beginning of the next legislative period , " to revoke the existing nuclear phase-out law , ” the pepp authors wrote .
under the previous red-green government , germany passed a law requiring a total decommissioning of nuclear power plants by 2021 .
to relieve pressure on consumers in the short term , the paper recommends political support for cheaper energy , using a calculation based on atomic energy prices .
this would have a “ social component , ” the authors wrote , and would also help publicize the cost advantages of nuclear energy .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : foreign natural gas is increasingly expensive this , in turn , would help make public discourse on nuclear energy “ more objective , ” according to pepp .
plan advocates voluntary investment of profits shortly before the summer legislative recess , the german cabinet assigned glos to examine the effect of the global energy crisis on the german economy , and to present solutions for an efficient , secure and cost-effective energy policy .
as part of that effort glos formed the pepp group .
according to tagesspiegel , glos has yet to officially sign off on the paper .
in the paper , pepp suggested that any profits the nuclear plants make by staying open longer should be set aside in a foundation , and be used to invest in energy efficiency , energy research and renewable energies .
the foundations should n't be mandated by legislation , but should take place in “ a framework of voluntary agreements . ”
they also said it is crucial to investigate possible terminal storage areas for atomic waste , with the “ aim of finding a solution . ” dw staff -lrb- jen -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : will merkel , left , and glos , sign off on the paper ?
german economics minister michael glos recently set up an expert group called the political energy program , or pepp , consisting of top scientists and economy ministry officials .
the committee has come out in favor of an “ atomic energy use law , ” which has a complete framework and is set to be reviewed by the chancellery this fall .
“ turning back from the plan to phase out nuclear energy makes ecological and economic sense , and we recommend it , ” the scientist group wrote in the paper , according to tagesspiegel .
the paper recommends extending the planned use of german atomic plants by eight years , from a current 32 years up to “ at least 40 years . ” if not , in 10 years germans will need to generate twice as much energy from expensive gas as they do today , the experts warned .
committee urges swift action this would create “ many billions of euros ” in extra costs for consumers , given the soaring prices of natural gas , the paper said .
to avoid this , a decision must be made " as quickly as possible - at latest , at the beginning of the next legislative period , " to revoke the existing nuclear phase-out law , ” the pepp authors wrote .
under the previous red-green government , germany passed a law requiring a total decommissioning of nuclear power plants by 2021 .
to relieve pressure on consumers in the short term , the paper recommends political support for cheaper energy , using a calculation based on atomic energy prices .
this would have a “ social component , ” the authors wrote , and would also help publicize the cost advantages of nuclear energy .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : foreign natural gas is increasingly expensive this , in turn , would help make public discourse on nuclear energy “ more objective , ” according to pepp .
plan advocates voluntary investment of profits shortly before the summer legislative recess , the german cabinet assigned glos to examine the effect of the global energy crisis on the german economy , and to present solutions for an efficient , secure and cost-effective energy policy .
as part of that effort glos formed the pepp group .
according to tagesspiegel , glos has yet to officially sign off on the paper .
in the paper , pepp suggested that any profits the nuclear plants make by staying open longer should be set aside in a foundation , and be used to invest in energy efficiency , energy research and renewable energies .
the foundations should n't be mandated by legislation , but should take place in “ a framework of voluntary agreements . ”
they also said it is crucial to investigate possible terminal storage areas for atomic waste , with the “ aim of finding a solution . ” dw staff -lrb- jen -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

" there are no plans to purchase a fighter drone for the bundeswehr , " a spokesman for the german defense ministry in berlin said .
the defense security cooperation agency -lrb- dsca -rrb- notified congress that germany had requested a possible sale of five of the unmanned combat aircraft while italy had asked for four .
the sale of the hunter-killer drones was valued at up to $ 330 million -lrb- 212 million euros -rrb- for italy , as the agreement would include five years of maintenance support .
germany 's sale , which includes just one year of maintenance support , was estimated at $ 205 million .
both countries are seeking the new drones " for the defense of deployed troops , regional security and interoperability with the united states , " the dsca said in its notification .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : italian pm berlusconi has long been a supporter of the war in iraq " this program will increase italy 's ability to contribute to future nato , coalition , and anti-terrorism operations that the us may undertake , " the agency said .
why fear the mq-9 reaper ?
known as a hunter-killer drone , the reaper was deployed only recently in iraq , flying for the first time from balad air base on july 17 .
it 's been used in afghanistan since september .
the reaper , which can carry four hellfire missiles and two 500-pound laser guided bombs , can fly faster , higher , farther and carry more weapons than its predecessor , according to lieutenant general gary north , the commander of us air forces in the middle east .
" we have turned a corner in warfare by bringing in this new platform that complements - and i stress complements - our incredible manned capacity today , " he told afp news agency .
" by acquiring this capability , germany will be able to provide the same level of protection for its own forces as those of the united states , " the dsca said .
germany currently has over 3,000 troops in afghanistan , a number set to increase to 4,000 in the coming year . dw staff -lrb- cat -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

but the departure of the former hamburg playmaker shows once again that bayern are the only bundesliga club that can keep world-class talent . hamburg confirmed that their best player was leaving on monday , august 4 , ending a year of speculation in which the question was not whether van der vaart was going , but when , to whom and for how much .
because of a clause in the dutchman 's contract , which would have allowed him to leave for 1.5 million euros -lrb- $ 2.3 million -rrb- next season , hamburg had to sell .
the 14-16 million euro deal , depending on how real performs with van der vaart , is about half of his estimated market value - the best hamburg could do under the circumstances .
van der vaart has described the move as a dream come true , while the man who now wo n't be his coach , dutchman martin jol , told germany 's bild newspaper he considered the playmaker " one of the best players in the past 25 years . "
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the playmaker scored 29 goals in 74 matches for his ex-employers the 25-year-old playmaker , who 's already won 58 caps for holland , was certainly one of the best hamburg has seen in the last quarter-century .
with him the german side qualified for international competition three years on the trot .
significantly , when van der vaart was out injured for the first half of the 2006-7 season , hamburg had the second worst record in the league - when he came back in the second season half , hamburg were second-best .
his departure thus likely turns hamburg from a champions league contender to an also-ran in a transition year .
it also underscores the fact that , lamentably and with one notable exception , the bundesliga can not compete for the services of the world 's soccer elite .
no more mighty mice bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : kevin keegan and his amazing afro-styled hair played for hamburg in the late ' 70s things were n't always this way for hamburg and other comparably sized german clubs .
in 1977 , for instance , hamburg landed a spectacular transfer , attracting english striker kevin keegan away from liverpool .
mighty mouse , as the diminutive forward was quickly nicknamed , won the european player of the year award with hamburg and led the team to a league title and a berth in the final of the old european club championship .
-lrb- they lost to nottingham forest -rrb- .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : but in 2008 stars like steven gerrard give the bundesliga a miss what a difference three decades make .
the mere thought of steven gerrard or fernando torres leaving liverpool for hamburg is enough to draw guffaws from any football fan .
and hamburg are n't alone in perennially bumping their heads on what amounts to a glass ceiling .
in the next couple of seasons , bremen and stuttgart are likely to find themselves in the same situation with respect to stars diego and mario gomez as hamburg was with van der vaart .
bayern munich , alone , is capable of not only signing but retaining players of the top caliber .
so why have the rest of the bundesliga 's ambitious sides become so unattractive ?
money + success = more success bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : bayern 's record of achievement attracts the big names real madrid is one of the wealthiest clubs in the world , and even the other giants of the game - as manchester united are finding out right now with cristiano ronaldo - have a hard time staving off the spaniards ' advances when a player has caught their fancy .
but perhaps more important than money is the fact that no bundesliga side other than bayern has been able to establish its credentials as a regular contender for the prize of prizes - a champions league title .
that 's down to bayern 's double-advantage policy of buying up stars from other bundesliga clubs , simultaneously strengthening their own squad while weakening their domestic rivals .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : leverkusen fell apart when ballack turned his back on them case in point : bayer leverkusen .
in 2002 , they reached the champions league final , losing somewhat unluckily to real madrid .
as a club backed by the financial might of germany 's biggest pharmaceutical company , they looked like a decent bet to jump into europe 's elite .
instead bayern lured two of leverkusen 's mainstays , midfielders michael ballack and ze roberto , into jumping ship .
as a result , bayer leverkusen barely avoided relegation in 2003 and has never even qualified for the champions league again .
moreover , within that time span , no other german team other than those two has made a champions league semifinal , let alone a final .

by doing so , he 's trying to help people understand the actions of china 's rulers , who have - permanently or temporarily - blocked the web sites of international media organizations , such as the bbc , the frankfurter allgemeine zeitung or deutsche welle , even within the press center of the olympic games . web sites are blocked all over the world - vesper is right about that .
but his comparison is still wrong and uncalled for . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : daniel scheschkewitz in germany , right-wing extremist sites are blocked because they instigate people to commit crimes and because the spreading of right-wing extremist ideas in itself is already a crime .
in the people 's republic of china on the other hand , the foreign press is denied free access to the internet , because media organizations - for reasons of state - are permanently and systematically controlled there .
why should guests be allowed to do what the own population is n't allowed to do ? from its own point of view , china 's leadership is acting logically and consequentially : in for a penny , in for a pound .
relaxing media censorship during the olympic games would have been a major surprise and would have sent a signal to the chinese population .
once freedoms have been granted , it 's very hard to take them away again .
the process of liberal evolution most often develops a dynamic of its own that 's hard to reckon with . china 's principled stand is countered by the west 's softness .
not only olympic officials , but also politicians and even representatives of journalistic organizations have only mildly protested with self-imposed restraint against the censorship measures so far .
a misunderstood pragmatism and a wish to woo a rising economic superpower are reasons for this . this playing with fire ould easily cost the west its soul .
without free discourse and the unhindered exchange of ideas , our free economic order does n't mean much , either .
the strength of our civil societies is based on tolerance and respect for the opinions of those who think differently . china has invited the world for the olympic games .
but the doors remain closed for the global spectrum of opinions - not only in the country but also in those places where journalists are supposed to make use of their right to unhindered access to information : in press centers and beijing 's large hotels .
to accept this chinese censorship is misconceived tolerance .
the west loses its credibility .
china will feel vindicated and continue to let no one dictate to it about human rights . besides - without pressure , no power apparatus , especially a regime that 's based on repression , will move an inch .
as good guests , olympic athletes and officials should respect their host country , its customs and traditions .

by doing so , he 's trying to help people understand the actions of china 's rulers , who have - permanently or temporarily - blocked the web sites of international media organizations , such as the bbc , the frankfurter allgemeine zeitung or deutsche welle , even within the press center of the olympic games . web sites are blocked all over the world - vesper is right about that .
but his comparison is still wrong and uncalled for . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : daniel scheschkewitz in germany , right-wing extremist sites are blocked because they instigate people to commit crimes and because the spreading of right-wing extremist ideas in itself is already a crime .
in the people 's republic of china on the other hand , the foreign press is denied free access to the internet , because media organizations - for reasons of state - are permanently and systematically controlled there .
why should guests be allowed to do what the own population is n't allowed to do ? from its own point of view , china 's leadership is acting logically and consequentially : in for a penny , in for a pound .
relaxing media censorship during the olympic games would have been a major surprise and would have sent a signal to the chinese population .
once freedoms have been granted , it 's very hard to take them away again .
the process of liberal evolution most often develops a dynamic of its own that 's hard to reckon with . china 's principled stand is countered by the west 's softness .
not only olympic officials , but also politicians and even representatives of journalistic organizations have only mildly protested with self-imposed restraint against the censorship measures so far .
a misunderstood pragmatism and a wish to woo a rising economic superpower are reasons for this . this playing with fire ould easily cost the west its soul .
without free discourse and the unhindered exchange of ideas , our free economic order does n't mean much , either .
the strength of our civil societies is based on tolerance and respect for the opinions of those who think differently . china has invited the world for the olympic games .
but the doors remain closed for the global spectrum of opinions - not only in the country but also in those places where journalists are supposed to make use of their right to unhindered access to information : in press centers and beijing 's large hotels .
to accept this chinese censorship is misconceived tolerance .
the west loses its credibility .
china will feel vindicated and continue to let no one dictate to it about human rights . besides - without pressure , no power apparatus , especially a regime that 's based on repression , will move an inch .
as good guests , olympic athletes and officials should respect their host country , its customs and traditions .

the goal is to reduce expensive energy imports . a german plan to extending the use of the country 's nuclear power plants beyond the set phase-out period in 2020 is more concrete than expected , der tagesspiegel newspaper reported tuesday , aug .

german economics minister michael glos recently set up an expert group called the political energy program , or pepp , consisting of top scientists and economy ministry officials .
the committee has come out in favor of an “ atomic energy use law , ” which has a complete framework and is set to be reviewed by the chancellery this fall .
“ turning back from the plan to phase out nuclear energy makes ecological and economic sense , and we recommend it , ” the scientist group wrote in the paper , according to tagesspiegel .
the paper recommends extending the planned use of german atomic plants by eight years , from a current 32 years up to “ at least 40 years . ” if not , in 10 years germans will need to generate twice as much energy from expensive gas as they do today , the experts warned .
committee urges swift action this would create “ many billions of euros ” in extra costs for consumers , given the soaring prices of natural gas , the paper said .
to avoid this , a decision must be made " as quickly as possible - at latest , at the beginning of the next legislative period , " to revoke the existing nuclear phase-out law , ” the pepp authors wrote .
under the previous red-green government , germany passed a law requiring a total decommissioning of nuclear power plants by 2021 .
to relieve pressure on consumers in the short term , the paper recommends political support for cheaper energy , using a calculation based on atomic energy prices .
this would have a “ social component , ” the authors wrote , and would also help publicize the cost advantages of nuclear energy .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : foreign natural gas is increasingly expensive this , in turn , would help make public discourse on nuclear energy “ more objective , ” according to pepp .
plan advocates voluntary investment of profits shortly before the summer legislative recess , the german cabinet assigned glos to examine the effect of the global energy crisis on the german economy , and to present solutions for an efficient , secure and cost-effective energy policy .
as part of that effort glos formed the pepp group .
according to tagesspiegel , glos has yet to officially sign off on the paper .
in the paper , pepp suggested that any profits the nuclear plants make by staying open longer should be set aside in a foundation , and be used to invest in energy efficiency , energy research and renewable energies .
the foundations should n't be mandated by legislation , but should take place in “ a framework of voluntary agreements . ”
they also said it is crucial to investigate possible terminal storage areas for atomic waste , with the “ aim of finding a solution . ” dw staff -lrb- jen -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de health -pipe- 05.08.2008 european union pushes for self-extinguishing cigarettes großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : now , if they can just develop beer that makes you sober smoking bans are n't the only thing on the eu 's cigarette agenda .
the bloc wants to see the tobacco industry develop products that go out if they 're not being smoked - it 's not at all a new idea . brussels says a new generation of cigarettes could dramatically reduce the number of deaths by fires .
" by introducing self-extinguishing cigarettes , at least 2,000 lives could be saved in the eu each year , " the bloc 's commissioner for consumer affairs told german newspaper die welt .
the german fire departments ' association was quick to greet the initiatives , saying some 200 of the 600 people who die by fire in germany each year are killed by flames originally caused by smoldering butts .
" if the self-extinguishing cigarette can contribute to reducing this number , its introduction has to be seen positively , " association spokeswoman silvia darmstaedter told dw-world.de. a spokesman for the eu standardization commission also told reporters he thought that " fire-safe " cigs could be made mandatory by the year 2011 .
ironic name , old idea bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the new cigs could help reduce forest fires throughout europe self-extinguishing cigarettes draw on a technology that developers , presumably with a sense of humor , call reduced ignition propensity - or rip .
bands of cellulose or alginate are put into the cigarette paper so that the burning tobacco goes out if not puffed on .
the concept has been kicking around for quite some time .
patents for self-extinguishing cigarettes were granted in the 1930s .
american cigarette makers philip morris and rj reynolds developed " fire-safe " models in the 1980s but did not , in general , market them .
" what is very important is that consumers should understand that those changes do not make fire-safe or even fire-safer cigarettes , " elfriede buben , external communications manager for philip morris germany , told dw-radio .
" anything that burns , if handled carelessly , can cause a fire . "
several american states , including new york , massachusetts and california limit the sale of cigarettes to rip models .
now the eu could follow their lead .
advantage for smokers bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the industry has prefered to make cigarettes that continue burning it is questionable whether technology and legislation are needed to solve the problem .
as smokers know , cigars , pipe tobacco and hand-rolled cigarettes tend to go out on their own .
that 's because regular cigarettes contain burning agents to keep them lit .

18 , 1977 , became known as death night for the leaders of the red army faction .
these were among the events collectively known as the german autumn , which also included a series of terrorist attacks and the west german government 's response .
debate over suicides according to a report in the stuttgarter zeitung on tuesday , aug .
5 , the pictures include images of the abduction of leading raf terrorists baader , ensslin and raspe , as well as the emergency operation performed on irmgard moeller , who tried to kill herself by stabbing herself four times in the chest .
bildunterschrift : germany sought the terrorists with ' wanted ' posters she survived her suicide attempt and has since stated that the deaths were not suicide , but rather extrajudicial killings undertaken by the german government of the time , a claim strongly denied by german governments , former and present .
photos show " nothing new " the pictures were discovered in a suitcase in the basement of a house a week ago , and had been taken by a long-deceased police photographer .
now they have been given to the stuttgart prosecutor 's office for further examination , a spokeswoman for the investigators confirmed .
on first look , the photos do n't show anything new , the spokeswoman said .
“ possibly , a few well-known pictures are shown again from a different angle , ” she added .
the newspaper further reported that the pictures were mostly taken to be used in the so-called stammheim deaths trial .
the files of the hotly debated trial were sent to the state archive in ludwigsburg in 2005 , but a few months ago were retrieved by the stuttgart prosecutors ' office .
prosecutor : new look at case unlikely now they are checking whether new investigations will be made into the politically explosive case .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : two of the raf leaders , ensslin and baader the spokeswoman for the prosecutors ' office said the files had been moved for space reasons .
when the media began reporting last year that security officers may have allowed the suicides to happen , investigators sought the files out again – “ a completely normal thing to do . ”
however , she said there are no indications pointing to a new look into the events of the autumn of 1977 . dw staff -lrb- jen -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

sony and bertelsmann had each owned half of the new-york based sony bmg , the world 's second biggest music company since its creation in 2004 .
according to some press reports , sony has maintained an option to buy bertelsmann 's stake .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de bundesliga -pipe- 05.08.2008 bundesliga loses another top star in van der vaart großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : rafael van der vaart has waved bye-bye to hamburg rafael van der vaart 's transfer to real madrid came as a surprise to no one .
but the departure of the former hamburg playmaker shows once again that bayern are the only bundesliga club that can keep world-class talent . hamburg confirmed that their best player was leaving on monday , august 4 , ending a year of speculation in which the question was not whether van der vaart was going , but when , to whom and for how much .
because of a clause in the dutchman 's contract , which would have allowed him to leave for 1.5 million euros -lrb- $ 2.3 million -rrb- next season , hamburg had to sell .
the 14-16 million euro deal , depending on how real performs with van der vaart , is about half of his estimated market value - the best hamburg could do under the circumstances .
van der vaart has described the move as a dream come true , while the man who now wo n't be his coach , dutchman martin jol , told germany 's bild newspaper he considered the playmaker " one of the best players in the past 25 years . "
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the playmaker scored 29 goals in 74 matches for his ex-employers the 25-year-old playmaker , who 's already won 58 caps for holland , was certainly one of the best hamburg has seen in the last quarter-century .
with him the german side qualified for international competition three years on the trot .
significantly , when van der vaart was out injured for the first half of the 2006-7 season , hamburg had the second worst record in the league - when he came back in the second season half , hamburg were second-best .
his departure thus likely turns hamburg from a champions league contender to an also-ran in a transition year .
it also underscores the fact that , lamentably and with one notable exception , the bundesliga can not compete for the services of the world 's soccer elite .
no more mighty mice bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : kevin keegan and his amazing afro-styled hair played for hamburg in the late ' 70s things were n't always this way for hamburg and other comparably sized german clubs .
in 1977 , for instance , hamburg landed a spectacular transfer , attracting english striker kevin keegan away from liverpool .
mighty mouse , as the diminutive forward was quickly nicknamed , won the european player of the year award with hamburg and led the team to a league title and a berth in the final of the old european club championship .

bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : but in 2008 stars like steven gerrard give the bundesliga a miss what a difference three decades make .
the mere thought of steven gerrard or fernando torres leaving liverpool for hamburg is enough to draw guffaws from any football fan .
and hamburg are n't alone in perennially bumping their heads on what amounts to a glass ceiling .
in the next couple of seasons , bremen and stuttgart are likely to find themselves in the same situation with respect to stars diego and mario gomez as hamburg was with van der vaart .
bayern munich , alone , is capable of not only signing but retaining players of the top caliber .
so why have the rest of the bundesliga 's ambitious sides become so unattractive ?
money + success = more success bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : bayern 's record of achievement attracts the big names real madrid is one of the wealthiest clubs in the world , and even the other giants of the game - as manchester united are finding out right now with cristiano ronaldo - have a hard time staving off the spaniards ' advances when a player has caught their fancy .
but perhaps more important than money is the fact that no bundesliga side other than bayern has been able to establish its credentials as a regular contender for the prize of prizes - a champions league title .
that 's down to bayern 's double-advantage policy of buying up stars from other bundesliga clubs , simultaneously strengthening their own squad while weakening their domestic rivals .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : leverkusen fell apart when ballack turned his back on them case in point : bayer leverkusen .
in 2002 , they reached the champions league final , losing somewhat unluckily to real madrid .
as a club backed by the financial might of germany 's biggest pharmaceutical company , they looked like a decent bet to jump into europe 's elite .
instead bayern lured two of leverkusen 's mainstays , midfielders michael ballack and ze roberto , into jumping ship .
as a result , bayer leverkusen barely avoided relegation in 2003 and has never even qualified for the champions league again .
moreover , within that time span , no other german team other than those two has made a champions league semifinal , let alone a final .
and that 's what club soccer is all about for the world 's best .
so while bayern contends for glory year in , year out with the likes of frank ribery , luca toni and miroslav klose , clubs like hamburg are fated to losing players of van der vaart 's caliber , just as they should be poised to make the jump to the next level . jefferson chase send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

german economics minister michael glos recently set up an expert group called the political energy program , or pepp , consisting of top scientists and economy ministry officials .
the committee has come out in favor of an “ atomic energy use law , ” which has a complete framework and is set to be reviewed by the chancellery this fall .
“ turning back from the plan to phase out nuclear energy makes ecological and economic sense , and we recommend it , ” the scientist group wrote in the paper , according to tagesspiegel .
the paper recommends extending the planned use of german atomic plants by eight years , from a current 32 years up to “ at least 40 years . ” if not , in 10 years germans will need to generate twice as much energy from expensive gas as they do today , the experts warned .
committee urges swift action this would create “ many billions of euros ” in extra costs for consumers , given the soaring prices of natural gas , the paper said .
to avoid this , a decision must be made " as quickly as possible - at latest , at the beginning of the next legislative period , " to revoke the existing nuclear phase-out law , ” the pepp authors wrote .
under the previous red-green government , germany passed a law requiring a total decommissioning of nuclear power plants by 2021 .
to relieve pressure on consumers in the short term , the paper recommends political support for cheaper energy , using a calculation based on atomic energy prices .
this would have a “ social component , ” the authors wrote , and would also help publicize the cost advantages of nuclear energy .

as part of that effort glos formed the pepp group .
according to tagesspiegel , glos has yet to officially sign off on the paper .
in the paper , pepp suggested that any profits the nuclear plants make by staying open longer should be set aside in a foundation , and be used to invest in energy efficiency , energy research and renewable energies .
the foundations should n't be mandated by legislation , but should take place in “ a framework of voluntary agreements . ”

to avoid this , a decision must be made " as quickly as possible - at latest , at the beginning of the next legislative period , " to revoke the existing nuclear phase-out law , ” the pepp authors wrote .
under the previous red-green government , germany passed a law requiring a total decommissioning of nuclear power plants by 2021 .
to relieve pressure on consumers in the short term , the paper recommends political support for cheaper energy , using a calculation based on atomic energy prices .
this would have a “ social component , ” the authors wrote , and would also help publicize the cost advantages of nuclear energy .

the committee has come out in favor of an “ atomic energy use law , ” which has a complete framework and is set to be reviewed by the chancellery this fall .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de health -pipe- 05.08.2008 european union pushes for self-extinguishing cigarettes großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : now , if they can just develop beer that makes you sober smoking bans are n't the only thing on the eu 's cigarette agenda .
the bloc wants to see the tobacco industry develop products that go out if they 're not being smoked - it 's not at all a new idea . brussels says a new generation of cigarettes could dramatically reduce the number of deaths by fires .
" by introducing self-extinguishing cigarettes , at least 2,000 lives could be saved in the eu each year , " the bloc 's commissioner for consumer affairs told german newspaper die welt .
the german fire departments ' association was quick to greet the initiatives , saying some 200 of the 600 people who die by fire in germany each year are killed by flames originally caused by smoldering butts .
" if the self-extinguishing cigarette can contribute to reducing this number , its introduction has to be seen positively , " association spokeswoman silvia darmstaedter told dw-world.de. a spokesman for the eu standardization commission also told reporters he thought that " fire-safe " cigs could be made mandatory by the year 2011 .
ironic name , old idea bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the new cigs could help reduce forest fires throughout europe self-extinguishing cigarettes draw on a technology that developers , presumably with a sense of humor , call reduced ignition propensity - or rip .
bands of cellulose or alginate are put into the cigarette paper so that the burning tobacco goes out if not puffed on .
the concept has been kicking around for quite some time .
patents for self-extinguishing cigarettes were granted in the 1930s .
american cigarette makers philip morris and rj reynolds developed " fire-safe " models in the 1980s but did not , in general , market them .
" what is very important is that consumers should understand that those changes do not make fire-safe or even fire-safer cigarettes , " elfriede buben , external communications manager for philip morris germany , told dw-radio .
" anything that burns , if handled carelessly , can cause a fire . "
several american states , including new york , massachusetts and california limit the sale of cigarettes to rip models .
now the eu could follow their lead .
advantage for smokers bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the industry has prefered to make cigarettes that continue burning it is questionable whether technology and legislation are needed to solve the problem .
as smokers know , cigars , pipe tobacco and hand-rolled cigarettes tend to go out on their own .
that 's because regular cigarettes contain burning agents to keep them lit .
" the elimination of burning agents in cigarette paper would be a simple and effective means of dramatically reducing the ignition propensity of cigarettes , " wrote simon chapman , a professor of public health at the university sydney , in a 2004 australian medical journal .
but if self-extinguishing cigarettes do become the mandatory eu norm , smokers may benefit financially .
after all a cigarette that burns down to the filter has to be replaced - whereas one that goes out on its own can always be relit . dw staff -lrb- jc -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

by doing so , he 's trying to help people understand the actions of china 's rulers , who have - permanently or temporarily - blocked the web sites of international media organizations , such as the bbc , the frankfurter allgemeine zeitung or deutsche welle , even within the press center of the olympic games . web sites are blocked all over the world - vesper is right about that .
but his comparison is still wrong and uncalled for . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : daniel scheschkewitz in germany , right-wing extremist sites are blocked because they instigate people to commit crimes and because the spreading of right-wing extremist ideas in itself is already a crime .
in the people 's republic of china on the other hand , the foreign press is denied free access to the internet , because media organizations - for reasons of state - are permanently and systematically controlled there .
why should guests be allowed to do what the own population is n't allowed to do ? from its own point of view , china 's leadership is acting logically and consequentially : in for a penny , in for a pound .

the process of liberal evolution most often develops a dynamic of its own that 's hard to reckon with . china 's principled stand is countered by the west 's softness .
not only olympic officials , but also politicians and even representatives of journalistic organizations have only mildly protested with self-imposed restraint against the censorship measures so far .
a misunderstood pragmatism and a wish to woo a rising economic superpower are reasons for this . this playing with fire ould easily cost the west its soul .
without free discourse and the unhindered exchange of ideas , our free economic order does n't mean much , either .
the strength of our civil societies is based on tolerance and respect for the opinions of those who think differently . china has invited the world for the olympic games .
but the doors remain closed for the global spectrum of opinions - not only in the country but also in those places where journalists are supposed to make use of their right to unhindered access to information : in press centers and beijing 's large hotels .
to accept this chinese censorship is misconceived tolerance .
the west loses its credibility .
china will feel vindicated and continue to let no one dictate to it about human rights . besides - without pressure , no power apparatus , especially a regime that 's based on repression , will move an inch .

by doing so , he 's trying to help people understand the actions of china 's rulers , who have - permanently or temporarily - blocked the web sites of international media organizations , such as the bbc , the frankfurter allgemeine zeitung or deutsche welle , even within the press center of the olympic games . web sites are blocked all over the world - vesper is right about that .
but his comparison is still wrong and uncalled for . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : daniel scheschkewitz in germany , right-wing extremist sites are blocked because they instigate people to commit crimes and because the spreading of right-wing extremist ideas in itself is already a crime .
in the people 's republic of china on the other hand , the foreign press is denied free access to the internet , because media organizations - for reasons of state - are permanently and systematically controlled there .
why should guests be allowed to do what the own population is n't allowed to do ? from its own point of view , china 's leadership is acting logically and consequentially : in for a penny , in for a pound .
relaxing media censorship during the olympic games would have been a major surprise and would have sent a signal to the chinese population .
once freedoms have been granted , it 's very hard to take them away again .
the process of liberal evolution most often develops a dynamic of its own that 's hard to reckon with . china 's principled stand is countered by the west 's softness .
not only olympic officials , but also politicians and even representatives of journalistic organizations have only mildly protested with self-imposed restraint against the censorship measures so far .
a misunderstood pragmatism and a wish to woo a rising economic superpower are reasons for this . this playing with fire ould easily cost the west its soul .
without free discourse and the unhindered exchange of ideas , our free economic order does n't mean much , either .
the strength of our civil societies is based on tolerance and respect for the opinions of those who think differently . china has invited the world for the olympic games .
but the doors remain closed for the global spectrum of opinions - not only in the country but also in those places where journalists are supposed to make use of their right to unhindered access to information : in press centers and beijing 's large hotels .
to accept this chinese censorship is misconceived tolerance .
the west loses its credibility .
china will feel vindicated and continue to let no one dictate to it about human rights . besides - without pressure , no power apparatus , especially a regime that 's based on repression , will move an inch .
as good guests , olympic athletes and officials should respect their host country , its customs and traditions .
but if the rules of the game violate our fundamental values , one has to be able to point this out with indignation - even in china , and especially during the olympic games . daniel scheschkewitz is dw-radio 's national correspondent -lrb- win -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

but the departure of the former hamburg playmaker shows once again that bayern are the only bundesliga club that can keep world-class talent . hamburg confirmed that their best player was leaving on monday , august 4 , ending a year of speculation in which the question was not whether van der vaart was going , but when , to whom and for how much .
because of a clause in the dutchman 's contract , which would have allowed him to leave for 1.5 million euros -lrb- $ 2.3 million -rrb- next season , hamburg had to sell .
the 14-16 million euro deal , depending on how real performs with van der vaart , is about half of his estimated market value - the best hamburg could do under the circumstances .
van der vaart has described the move as a dream come true , while the man who now wo n't be his coach , dutchman martin jol , told germany 's bild newspaper he considered the playmaker " one of the best players in the past 25 years . "
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the playmaker scored 29 goals in 74 matches for his ex-employers the 25-year-old playmaker , who 's already won 58 caps for holland , was certainly one of the best hamburg has seen in the last quarter-century .
with him the german side qualified for international competition three years on the trot .
significantly , when van der vaart was out injured for the first half of the 2006-7 season , hamburg had the second worst record in the league - when he came back in the second season half , hamburg were second-best .
his departure thus likely turns hamburg from a champions league contender to an also-ran in a transition year .
it also underscores the fact that , lamentably and with one notable exception , the bundesliga can not compete for the services of the world 's soccer elite .
no more mighty mice bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : kevin keegan and his amazing afro-styled hair played for hamburg in the late ' 70s things were n't always this way for hamburg and other comparably sized german clubs .
in 1977 , for instance , hamburg landed a spectacular transfer , attracting english striker kevin keegan away from liverpool .
mighty mouse , as the diminutive forward was quickly nicknamed , won the european player of the year award with hamburg and led the team to a league title and a berth in the final of the old european club championship .
-lrb- they lost to nottingham forest -rrb- .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : but in 2008 stars like steven gerrard give the bundesliga a miss what a difference three decades make .
the mere thought of steven gerrard or fernando torres leaving liverpool for hamburg is enough to draw guffaws from any football fan .
and hamburg are n't alone in perennially bumping their heads on what amounts to a glass ceiling .
in the next couple of seasons , bremen and stuttgart are likely to find themselves in the same situation with respect to stars diego and mario gomez as hamburg was with van der vaart .
bayern munich , alone , is capable of not only signing but retaining players of the top caliber .

but perhaps more important than money is the fact that no bundesliga side other than bayern has been able to establish its credentials as a regular contender for the prize of prizes - a champions league title .
that 's down to bayern 's double-advantage policy of buying up stars from other bundesliga clubs , simultaneously strengthening their own squad while weakening their domestic rivals .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : leverkusen fell apart when ballack turned his back on them case in point : bayer leverkusen .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de bundesliga -pipe- 05.08.2008 bundesliga loses another top star in van der vaart großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : rafael van der vaart has waved bye-bye to hamburg rafael van der vaart 's transfer to real madrid came as a surprise to no one .
but the departure of the former hamburg playmaker shows once again that bayern are the only bundesliga club that can keep world-class talent . hamburg confirmed that their best player was leaving on monday , august 4 , ending a year of speculation in which the question was not whether van der vaart was going , but when , to whom and for how much .
because of a clause in the dutchman 's contract , which would have allowed him to leave for 1.5 million euros -lrb- $ 2.3 million -rrb- next season , hamburg had to sell .
the 14-16 million euro deal , depending on how real performs with van der vaart , is about half of his estimated market value - the best hamburg could do under the circumstances .
van der vaart has described the move as a dream come true , while the man who now wo n't be his coach , dutchman martin jol , told germany 's bild newspaper he considered the playmaker " one of the best players in the past 25 years . "
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the playmaker scored 29 goals in 74 matches for his ex-employers the 25-year-old playmaker , who 's already won 58 caps for holland , was certainly one of the best hamburg has seen in the last quarter-century .
with him the german side qualified for international competition three years on the trot .
significantly , when van der vaart was out injured for the first half of the 2006-7 season , hamburg had the second worst record in the league - when he came back in the second season half , hamburg were second-best .
his departure thus likely turns hamburg from a champions league contender to an also-ran in a transition year .
it also underscores the fact that , lamentably and with one notable exception , the bundesliga can not compete for the services of the world 's soccer elite .
no more mighty mice bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : kevin keegan and his amazing afro-styled hair played for hamburg in the late ' 70s things were n't always this way for hamburg and other comparably sized german clubs .
in 1977 , for instance , hamburg landed a spectacular transfer , attracting english striker kevin keegan away from liverpool .
mighty mouse , as the diminutive forward was quickly nicknamed , won the european player of the year award with hamburg and led the team to a league title and a berth in the final of the old european club championship .
-lrb- they lost to nottingham forest -rrb- .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : but in 2008 stars like steven gerrard give the bundesliga a miss what a difference three decades make .
the mere thought of steven gerrard or fernando torres leaving liverpool for hamburg is enough to draw guffaws from any football fan .
and hamburg are n't alone in perennially bumping their heads on what amounts to a glass ceiling .
in the next couple of seasons , bremen and stuttgart are likely to find themselves in the same situation with respect to stars diego and mario gomez as hamburg was with van der vaart .
bayern munich , alone , is capable of not only signing but retaining players of the top caliber .
so why have the rest of the bundesliga 's ambitious sides become so unattractive ?
money + success = more success bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : bayern 's record of achievement attracts the big names real madrid is one of the wealthiest clubs in the world , and even the other giants of the game - as manchester united are finding out right now with cristiano ronaldo - have a hard time staving off the spaniards ' advances when a player has caught their fancy .
but perhaps more important than money is the fact that no bundesliga side other than bayern has been able to establish its credentials as a regular contender for the prize of prizes - a champions league title .
that 's down to bayern 's double-advantage policy of buying up stars from other bundesliga clubs , simultaneously strengthening their own squad while weakening their domestic rivals .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : leverkusen fell apart when ballack turned his back on them case in point : bayer leverkusen .
in 2002 , they reached the champions league final , losing somewhat unluckily to real madrid .
as a club backed by the financial might of germany 's biggest pharmaceutical company , they looked like a decent bet to jump into europe 's elite .
instead bayern lured two of leverkusen 's mainstays , midfielders michael ballack and ze roberto , into jumping ship .
as a result , bayer leverkusen barely avoided relegation in 2003 and has never even qualified for the champions league again .
moreover , within that time span , no other german team other than those two has made a champions league semifinal , let alone a final .
and that 's what club soccer is all about for the world 's best .
so while bayern contends for glory year in , year out with the likes of frank ribery , luca toni and miroslav klose , clubs like hamburg are fated to losing players of van der vaart 's caliber , just as they should be poised to make the jump to the next level . jefferson chase send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

by doing so , he 's trying to help people understand the actions of china 's rulers , who have - permanently or temporarily - blocked the web sites of international media organizations , such as the bbc , the frankfurter allgemeine zeitung or deutsche welle , even within the press center of the olympic games . web sites are blocked all over the world - vesper is right about that .
but his comparison is still wrong and uncalled for . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : daniel scheschkewitz in germany , right-wing extremist sites are blocked because they instigate people to commit crimes and because the spreading of right-wing extremist ideas in itself is already a crime .
in the people 's republic of china on the other hand , the foreign press is denied free access to the internet , because media organizations - for reasons of state - are permanently and systematically controlled there .
why should guests be allowed to do what the own population is n't allowed to do ? from its own point of view , china 's leadership is acting logically and consequentially : in for a penny , in for a pound .
relaxing media censorship during the olympic games would have been a major surprise and would have sent a signal to the chinese population .
once freedoms have been granted , it 's very hard to take them away again .
the process of liberal evolution most often develops a dynamic of its own that 's hard to reckon with . china 's principled stand is countered by the west 's softness .
not only olympic officials , but also politicians and even representatives of journalistic organizations have only mildly protested with self-imposed restraint against the censorship measures so far .
a misunderstood pragmatism and a wish to woo a rising economic superpower are reasons for this . this playing with fire ould easily cost the west its soul .
without free discourse and the unhindered exchange of ideas , our free economic order does n't mean much , either .
the strength of our civil societies is based on tolerance and respect for the opinions of those who think differently . china has invited the world for the olympic games .
but the doors remain closed for the global spectrum of opinions - not only in the country but also in those places where journalists are supposed to make use of their right to unhindered access to information : in press centers and beijing 's large hotels .
to accept this chinese censorship is misconceived tolerance .
the west loses its credibility .
china will feel vindicated and continue to let no one dictate to it about human rights . besides - without pressure , no power apparatus , especially a regime that 's based on repression , will move an inch .
as good guests , olympic athletes and officials should respect their host country , its customs and traditions .
but if the rules of the game violate our fundamental values , one has to be able to point this out with indignation - even in china , and especially during the olympic games . daniel scheschkewitz is dw-radio 's national correspondent -lrb- win -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

german economics minister michael glos recently set up an expert group called the political energy program , or pepp , consisting of top scientists and economy ministry officials .
the committee has come out in favor of an “ atomic energy use law , ” which has a complete framework and is set to be reviewed by the chancellery this fall .
“ turning back from the plan to phase out nuclear energy makes ecological and economic sense , and we recommend it , ” the scientist group wrote in the paper , according to tagesspiegel .
the paper recommends extending the planned use of german atomic plants by eight years , from a current 32 years up to “ at least 40 years . ” if not , in 10 years germans will need to generate twice as much energy from expensive gas as they do today , the experts warned .
committee urges swift action this would create “ many billions of euros ” in extra costs for consumers , given the soaring prices of natural gas , the paper said .
to avoid this , a decision must be made " as quickly as possible - at latest , at the beginning of the next legislative period , " to revoke the existing nuclear phase-out law , ” the pepp authors wrote .
under the previous red-green government , germany passed a law requiring a total decommissioning of nuclear power plants by 2021 .
to relieve pressure on consumers in the short term , the paper recommends political support for cheaper energy , using a calculation based on atomic energy prices .
this would have a “ social component , ” the authors wrote , and would also help publicize the cost advantages of nuclear energy .

in the paper , pepp suggested that any profits the nuclear plants make by staying open longer should be set aside in a foundation , and be used to invest in energy efficiency , energy research and renewable energies .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de bundesliga -pipe- 05.08.2008 bundesliga loses another top star in van der vaart großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : rafael van der vaart has waved bye-bye to hamburg rafael van der vaart 's transfer to real madrid came as a surprise to no one .
but the departure of the former hamburg playmaker shows once again that bayern are the only bundesliga club that can keep world-class talent . hamburg confirmed that their best player was leaving on monday , august 4 , ending a year of speculation in which the question was not whether van der vaart was going , but when , to whom and for how much .
because of a clause in the dutchman 's contract , which would have allowed him to leave for 1.5 million euros -lrb- $ 2.3 million -rrb- next season , hamburg had to sell .
the 14-16 million euro deal , depending on how real performs with van der vaart , is about half of his estimated market value - the best hamburg could do under the circumstances .
van der vaart has described the move as a dream come true , while the man who now wo n't be his coach , dutchman martin jol , told germany 's bild newspaper he considered the playmaker " one of the best players in the past 25 years . "
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the playmaker scored 29 goals in 74 matches for his ex-employers the 25-year-old playmaker , who 's already won 58 caps for holland , was certainly one of the best hamburg has seen in the last quarter-century .
with him the german side qualified for international competition three years on the trot .
significantly , when van der vaart was out injured for the first half of the 2006-7 season , hamburg had the second worst record in the league - when he came back in the second season half , hamburg were second-best .
his departure thus likely turns hamburg from a champions league contender to an also-ran in a transition year .
it also underscores the fact that , lamentably and with one notable exception , the bundesliga can not compete for the services of the world 's soccer elite .
no more mighty mice bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : kevin keegan and his amazing afro-styled hair played for hamburg in the late ' 70s things were n't always this way for hamburg and other comparably sized german clubs .
in 1977 , for instance , hamburg landed a spectacular transfer , attracting english striker kevin keegan away from liverpool .
mighty mouse , as the diminutive forward was quickly nicknamed , won the european player of the year award with hamburg and led the team to a league title and a berth in the final of the old european club championship .
-lrb- they lost to nottingham forest -rrb- .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : but in 2008 stars like steven gerrard give the bundesliga a miss what a difference three decades make .
the mere thought of steven gerrard or fernando torres leaving liverpool for hamburg is enough to draw guffaws from any football fan .
and hamburg are n't alone in perennially bumping their heads on what amounts to a glass ceiling .
in the next couple of seasons , bremen and stuttgart are likely to find themselves in the same situation with respect to stars diego and mario gomez as hamburg was with van der vaart .
bayern munich , alone , is capable of not only signing but retaining players of the top caliber .
so why have the rest of the bundesliga 's ambitious sides become so unattractive ?
money + success = more success bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : bayern 's record of achievement attracts the big names real madrid is one of the wealthiest clubs in the world , and even the other giants of the game - as manchester united are finding out right now with cristiano ronaldo - have a hard time staving off the spaniards ' advances when a player has caught their fancy .
but perhaps more important than money is the fact that no bundesliga side other than bayern has been able to establish its credentials as a regular contender for the prize of prizes - a champions league title .
that 's down to bayern 's double-advantage policy of buying up stars from other bundesliga clubs , simultaneously strengthening their own squad while weakening their domestic rivals .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : leverkusen fell apart when ballack turned his back on them case in point : bayer leverkusen .
in 2002 , they reached the champions league final , losing somewhat unluckily to real madrid .
as a club backed by the financial might of germany 's biggest pharmaceutical company , they looked like a decent bet to jump into europe 's elite .
instead bayern lured two of leverkusen 's mainstays , midfielders michael ballack and ze roberto , into jumping ship .
as a result , bayer leverkusen barely avoided relegation in 2003 and has never even qualified for the champions league again .
moreover , within that time span , no other german team other than those two has made a champions league semifinal , let alone a final .
and that 's what club soccer is all about for the world 's best .
so while bayern contends for glory year in , year out with the likes of frank ribery , luca toni and miroslav klose , clubs like hamburg are fated to losing players of van der vaart 's caliber , just as they should be poised to make the jump to the next level . jefferson chase send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

budget shortfall according to the director of the memorial , piotr cywinski , some 200 million zloty -lrb- 62.5 million euros , or $ 96.5 million -rrb- is currently needed for repairs .
the budget the museum gets annually from the polish government is 10 million zloty per year , and another 10 million is earned from the sale of books and fees for tours and parking .

by doing so , he 's trying to help people understand the actions of china 's rulers , who have - permanently or temporarily - blocked the web sites of international media organizations , such as the bbc , the frankfurter allgemeine zeitung or deutsche welle , even within the press center of the olympic games . web sites are blocked all over the world - vesper is right about that .
but his comparison is still wrong and uncalled for . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : daniel scheschkewitz in germany , right-wing extremist sites are blocked because they instigate people to commit crimes and because the spreading of right-wing extremist ideas in itself is already a crime .
in the people 's republic of china on the other hand , the foreign press is denied free access to the internet , because media organizations - for reasons of state - are permanently and systematically controlled there .
why should guests be allowed to do what the own population is n't allowed to do ? from its own point of view , china 's leadership is acting logically and consequentially : in for a penny , in for a pound .
relaxing media censorship during the olympic games would have been a major surprise and would have sent a signal to the chinese population .
once freedoms have been granted , it 's very hard to take them away again .
the process of liberal evolution most often develops a dynamic of its own that 's hard to reckon with . china 's principled stand is countered by the west 's softness .
not only olympic officials , but also politicians and even representatives of journalistic organizations have only mildly protested with self-imposed restraint against the censorship measures so far .
a misunderstood pragmatism and a wish to woo a rising economic superpower are reasons for this . this playing with fire ould easily cost the west its soul .
without free discourse and the unhindered exchange of ideas , our free economic order does n't mean much , either .
the strength of our civil societies is based on tolerance and respect for the opinions of those who think differently . china has invited the world for the olympic games .
but the doors remain closed for the global spectrum of opinions - not only in the country but also in those places where journalists are supposed to make use of their right to unhindered access to information : in press centers and beijing 's large hotels .
to accept this chinese censorship is misconceived tolerance .
the west loses its credibility .
china will feel vindicated and continue to let no one dictate to it about human rights . besides - without pressure , no power apparatus , especially a regime that 's based on repression , will move an inch .
as good guests , olympic athletes and officials should respect their host country , its customs and traditions .
but if the rules of the game violate our fundamental values , one has to be able to point this out with indignation - even in china , and especially during the olympic games . daniel scheschkewitz is dw-radio 's national correspondent -lrb- win -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

these were among the events collectively known as the german autumn , which also included a series of terrorist attacks and the west german government 's response .

the newspaper further reported that the pictures were mostly taken to be used in the so-called stammheim deaths trial .
the files of the hotly debated trial were sent to the state archive in ludwigsburg in 2005 , but a few months ago were retrieved by the stuttgart prosecutors ' office .
prosecutor : new look at case unlikely now they are checking whether new investigations will be made into the politically explosive case .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : two of the raf leaders , ensslin and baader the spokeswoman for the prosecutors ' office said the files had been moved for space reasons .
when the media began reporting last year that security officers may have allowed the suicides to happen , investigators sought the files out again – “ a completely normal thing to do . ”

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de bundesliga -pipe- 05.08.2008 bundesliga loses another top star in van der vaart großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : rafael van der vaart has waved bye-bye to hamburg rafael van der vaart 's transfer to real madrid came as a surprise to no one .
but the departure of the former hamburg playmaker shows once again that bayern are the only bundesliga club that can keep world-class talent . hamburg confirmed that their best player was leaving on monday , august 4 , ending a year of speculation in which the question was not whether van der vaart was going , but when , to whom and for how much .
because of a clause in the dutchman 's contract , which would have allowed him to leave for 1.5 million euros -lrb- $ 2.3 million -rrb- next season , hamburg had to sell .
the 14-16 million euro deal , depending on how real performs with van der vaart , is about half of his estimated market value - the best hamburg could do under the circumstances .
van der vaart has described the move as a dream come true , while the man who now wo n't be his coach , dutchman martin jol , told germany 's bild newspaper he considered the playmaker " one of the best players in the past 25 years . "
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the playmaker scored 29 goals in 74 matches for his ex-employers the 25-year-old playmaker , who 's already won 58 caps for holland , was certainly one of the best hamburg has seen in the last quarter-century .
with him the german side qualified for international competition three years on the trot .
significantly , when van der vaart was out injured for the first half of the 2006-7 season , hamburg had the second worst record in the league - when he came back in the second season half , hamburg were second-best .
his departure thus likely turns hamburg from a champions league contender to an also-ran in a transition year .
it also underscores the fact that , lamentably and with one notable exception , the bundesliga can not compete for the services of the world 's soccer elite .
no more mighty mice bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : kevin keegan and his amazing afro-styled hair played for hamburg in the late ' 70s things were n't always this way for hamburg and other comparably sized german clubs .
in 1977 , for instance , hamburg landed a spectacular transfer , attracting english striker kevin keegan away from liverpool .
mighty mouse , as the diminutive forward was quickly nicknamed , won the european player of the year award with hamburg and led the team to a league title and a berth in the final of the old european club championship .
-lrb- they lost to nottingham forest -rrb- .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : but in 2008 stars like steven gerrard give the bundesliga a miss what a difference three decades make .
the mere thought of steven gerrard or fernando torres leaving liverpool for hamburg is enough to draw guffaws from any football fan .
and hamburg are n't alone in perennially bumping their heads on what amounts to a glass ceiling .
in the next couple of seasons , bremen and stuttgart are likely to find themselves in the same situation with respect to stars diego and mario gomez as hamburg was with van der vaart .
bayern munich , alone , is capable of not only signing but retaining players of the top caliber .
so why have the rest of the bundesliga 's ambitious sides become so unattractive ?
money + success = more success bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : bayern 's record of achievement attracts the big names real madrid is one of the wealthiest clubs in the world , and even the other giants of the game - as manchester united are finding out right now with cristiano ronaldo - have a hard time staving off the spaniards ' advances when a player has caught their fancy .
but perhaps more important than money is the fact that no bundesliga side other than bayern has been able to establish its credentials as a regular contender for the prize of prizes - a champions league title .
that 's down to bayern 's double-advantage policy of buying up stars from other bundesliga clubs , simultaneously strengthening their own squad while weakening their domestic rivals .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : leverkusen fell apart when ballack turned his back on them case in point : bayer leverkusen .
in 2002 , they reached the champions league final , losing somewhat unluckily to real madrid .
as a club backed by the financial might of germany 's biggest pharmaceutical company , they looked like a decent bet to jump into europe 's elite .
instead bayern lured two of leverkusen 's mainstays , midfielders michael ballack and ze roberto , into jumping ship .
as a result , bayer leverkusen barely avoided relegation in 2003 and has never even qualified for the champions league again .
moreover , within that time span , no other german team other than those two has made a champions league semifinal , let alone a final .
and that 's what club soccer is all about for the world 's best .
so while bayern contends for glory year in , year out with the likes of frank ribery , luca toni and miroslav klose , clubs like hamburg are fated to losing players of van der vaart 's caliber , just as they should be poised to make the jump to the next level . jefferson chase send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de bundesliga -pipe- 05.08.2008 bundesliga loses another top star in van der vaart großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : rafael van der vaart has waved bye-bye to hamburg rafael van der vaart 's transfer to real madrid came as a surprise to no one .
but the departure of the former hamburg playmaker shows once again that bayern are the only bundesliga club that can keep world-class talent . hamburg confirmed that their best player was leaving on monday , august 4 , ending a year of speculation in which the question was not whether van der vaart was going , but when , to whom and for how much .
because of a clause in the dutchman 's contract , which would have allowed him to leave for 1.5 million euros -lrb- $ 2.3 million -rrb- next season , hamburg had to sell .
the 14-16 million euro deal , depending on how real performs with van der vaart , is about half of his estimated market value - the best hamburg could do under the circumstances .
van der vaart has described the move as a dream come true , while the man who now wo n't be his coach , dutchman martin jol , told germany 's bild newspaper he considered the playmaker " one of the best players in the past 25 years . "
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the playmaker scored 29 goals in 74 matches for his ex-employers the 25-year-old playmaker , who 's already won 58 caps for holland , was certainly one of the best hamburg has seen in the last quarter-century .
with him the german side qualified for international competition three years on the trot .
significantly , when van der vaart was out injured for the first half of the 2006-7 season , hamburg had the second worst record in the league - when he came back in the second season half , hamburg were second-best .
his departure thus likely turns hamburg from a champions league contender to an also-ran in a transition year .
it also underscores the fact that , lamentably and with one notable exception , the bundesliga can not compete for the services of the world 's soccer elite .
no more mighty mice bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : kevin keegan and his amazing afro-styled hair played for hamburg in the late ' 70s things were n't always this way for hamburg and other comparably sized german clubs .
in 1977 , for instance , hamburg landed a spectacular transfer , attracting english striker kevin keegan away from liverpool .
mighty mouse , as the diminutive forward was quickly nicknamed , won the european player of the year award with hamburg and led the team to a league title and a berth in the final of the old european club championship .
-lrb- they lost to nottingham forest -rrb- .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : but in 2008 stars like steven gerrard give the bundesliga a miss what a difference three decades make .
the mere thought of steven gerrard or fernando torres leaving liverpool for hamburg is enough to draw guffaws from any football fan .
and hamburg are n't alone in perennially bumping their heads on what amounts to a glass ceiling .
in the next couple of seasons , bremen and stuttgart are likely to find themselves in the same situation with respect to stars diego and mario gomez as hamburg was with van der vaart .
bayern munich , alone , is capable of not only signing but retaining players of the top caliber .
so why have the rest of the bundesliga 's ambitious sides become so unattractive ?
money + success = more success bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : bayern 's record of achievement attracts the big names real madrid is one of the wealthiest clubs in the world , and even the other giants of the game - as manchester united are finding out right now with cristiano ronaldo - have a hard time staving off the spaniards ' advances when a player has caught their fancy .
but perhaps more important than money is the fact that no bundesliga side other than bayern has been able to establish its credentials as a regular contender for the prize of prizes - a champions league title .
that 's down to bayern 's double-advantage policy of buying up stars from other bundesliga clubs , simultaneously strengthening their own squad while weakening their domestic rivals .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : leverkusen fell apart when ballack turned his back on them case in point : bayer leverkusen .
in 2002 , they reached the champions league final , losing somewhat unluckily to real madrid .
as a club backed by the financial might of germany 's biggest pharmaceutical company , they looked like a decent bet to jump into europe 's elite .
instead bayern lured two of leverkusen 's mainstays , midfielders michael ballack and ze roberto , into jumping ship .
as a result , bayer leverkusen barely avoided relegation in 2003 and has never even qualified for the champions league again .
moreover , within that time span , no other german team other than those two has made a champions league semifinal , let alone a final .
and that 's what club soccer is all about for the world 's best .
so while bayern contends for glory year in , year out with the likes of frank ribery , luca toni and miroslav klose , clubs like hamburg are fated to losing players of van der vaart 's caliber , just as they should be poised to make the jump to the next level . jefferson chase send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de health -pipe- 05.08.2008 european union pushes for self-extinguishing cigarettes großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : now , if they can just develop beer that makes you sober smoking bans are n't the only thing on the eu 's cigarette agenda .
the bloc wants to see the tobacco industry develop products that go out if they 're not being smoked - it 's not at all a new idea . brussels says a new generation of cigarettes could dramatically reduce the number of deaths by fires .
" by introducing self-extinguishing cigarettes , at least 2,000 lives could be saved in the eu each year , " the bloc 's commissioner for consumer affairs told german newspaper die welt .
the german fire departments ' association was quick to greet the initiatives , saying some 200 of the 600 people who die by fire in germany each year are killed by flames originally caused by smoldering butts .
" if the self-extinguishing cigarette can contribute to reducing this number , its introduction has to be seen positively , " association spokeswoman silvia darmstaedter told dw-world.de. a spokesman for the eu standardization commission also told reporters he thought that " fire-safe " cigs could be made mandatory by the year 2011 .
ironic name , old idea bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the new cigs could help reduce forest fires throughout europe self-extinguishing cigarettes draw on a technology that developers , presumably with a sense of humor , call reduced ignition propensity - or rip .
bands of cellulose or alginate are put into the cigarette paper so that the burning tobacco goes out if not puffed on .
the concept has been kicking around for quite some time .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de bundesliga -pipe- 05.08.2008 bundesliga loses another top star in van der vaart großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : rafael van der vaart has waved bye-bye to hamburg rafael van der vaart 's transfer to real madrid came as a surprise to no one .
but the departure of the former hamburg playmaker shows once again that bayern are the only bundesliga club that can keep world-class talent . hamburg confirmed that their best player was leaving on monday , august 4 , ending a year of speculation in which the question was not whether van der vaart was going , but when , to whom and for how much .
because of a clause in the dutchman 's contract , which would have allowed him to leave for 1.5 million euros -lrb- $ 2.3 million -rrb- next season , hamburg had to sell .
the 14-16 million euro deal , depending on how real performs with van der vaart , is about half of his estimated market value - the best hamburg could do under the circumstances .
van der vaart has described the move as a dream come true , while the man who now wo n't be his coach , dutchman martin jol , told germany 's bild newspaper he considered the playmaker " one of the best players in the past 25 years . "
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the playmaker scored 29 goals in 74 matches for his ex-employers the 25-year-old playmaker , who 's already won 58 caps for holland , was certainly one of the best hamburg has seen in the last quarter-century .
with him the german side qualified for international competition three years on the trot .
significantly , when van der vaart was out injured for the first half of the 2006-7 season , hamburg had the second worst record in the league - when he came back in the second season half , hamburg were second-best .
his departure thus likely turns hamburg from a champions league contender to an also-ran in a transition year .
it also underscores the fact that , lamentably and with one notable exception , the bundesliga can not compete for the services of the world 's soccer elite .
no more mighty mice bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : kevin keegan and his amazing afro-styled hair played for hamburg in the late ' 70s things were n't always this way for hamburg and other comparably sized german clubs .
in 1977 , for instance , hamburg landed a spectacular transfer , attracting english striker kevin keegan away from liverpool .
mighty mouse , as the diminutive forward was quickly nicknamed , won the european player of the year award with hamburg and led the team to a league title and a berth in the final of the old european club championship .
-lrb- they lost to nottingham forest -rrb- .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : but in 2008 stars like steven gerrard give the bundesliga a miss what a difference three decades make .
the mere thought of steven gerrard or fernando torres leaving liverpool for hamburg is enough to draw guffaws from any football fan .
and hamburg are n't alone in perennially bumping their heads on what amounts to a glass ceiling .
in the next couple of seasons , bremen and stuttgart are likely to find themselves in the same situation with respect to stars diego and mario gomez as hamburg was with van der vaart .
bayern munich , alone , is capable of not only signing but retaining players of the top caliber .
so why have the rest of the bundesliga 's ambitious sides become so unattractive ?
money + success = more success bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : bayern 's record of achievement attracts the big names real madrid is one of the wealthiest clubs in the world , and even the other giants of the game - as manchester united are finding out right now with cristiano ronaldo - have a hard time staving off the spaniards ' advances when a player has caught their fancy .
but perhaps more important than money is the fact that no bundesliga side other than bayern has been able to establish its credentials as a regular contender for the prize of prizes - a champions league title .
that 's down to bayern 's double-advantage policy of buying up stars from other bundesliga clubs , simultaneously strengthening their own squad while weakening their domestic rivals .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : leverkusen fell apart when ballack turned his back on them case in point : bayer leverkusen .
in 2002 , they reached the champions league final , losing somewhat unluckily to real madrid .
as a club backed by the financial might of germany 's biggest pharmaceutical company , they looked like a decent bet to jump into europe 's elite .
instead bayern lured two of leverkusen 's mainstays , midfielders michael ballack and ze roberto , into jumping ship .
as a result , bayer leverkusen barely avoided relegation in 2003 and has never even qualified for the champions league again .
moreover , within that time span , no other german team other than those two has made a champions league semifinal , let alone a final .
and that 's what club soccer is all about for the world 's best .
so while bayern contends for glory year in , year out with the likes of frank ribery , luca toni and miroslav klose , clubs like hamburg are fated to losing players of van der vaart 's caliber , just as they should be poised to make the jump to the next level . jefferson chase send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

" if the self-extinguishing cigarette can contribute to reducing this number , its introduction has to be seen positively , " association spokeswoman silvia darmstaedter told dw-world.de. a spokesman for the eu standardization commission also told reporters he thought that " fire-safe " cigs could be made mandatory by the year 2011 .
ironic name , old idea bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the new cigs could help reduce forest fires throughout europe self-extinguishing cigarettes draw on a technology that developers , presumably with a sense of humor , call reduced ignition propensity - or rip .
bands of cellulose or alginate are put into the cigarette paper so that the burning tobacco goes out if not puffed on .
the concept has been kicking around for quite some time .
patents for self-extinguishing cigarettes were granted in the 1930s .
american cigarette makers philip morris and rj reynolds developed " fire-safe " models in the 1980s but did not , in general , market them .
" what is very important is that consumers should understand that those changes do not make fire-safe or even fire-safer cigarettes , " elfriede buben , external communications manager for philip morris germany , told dw-radio .
" anything that burns , if handled carelessly , can cause a fire . "
several american states , including new york , massachusetts and california limit the sale of cigarettes to rip models .
now the eu could follow their lead .
advantage for smokers bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the industry has prefered to make cigarettes that continue burning it is questionable whether technology and legislation are needed to solve the problem .
as smokers know , cigars , pipe tobacco and hand-rolled cigarettes tend to go out on their own .
that 's because regular cigarettes contain burning agents to keep them lit .
" the elimination of burning agents in cigarette paper would be a simple and effective means of dramatically reducing the ignition propensity of cigarettes , " wrote simon chapman , a professor of public health at the university sydney , in a 2004 australian medical journal .
but if self-extinguishing cigarettes do become the mandatory eu norm , smokers may benefit financially .
after all a cigarette that burns down to the filter has to be replaced - whereas one that goes out on its own can always be relit . dw staff -lrb- jc -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

german economics minister michael glos recently set up an expert group called the political energy program , or pepp , consisting of top scientists and economy ministry officials .
the committee has come out in favor of an “ atomic energy use law , ” which has a complete framework and is set to be reviewed by the chancellery this fall .
“ turning back from the plan to phase out nuclear energy makes ecological and economic sense , and we recommend it , ” the scientist group wrote in the paper , according to tagesspiegel .
the paper recommends extending the planned use of german atomic plants by eight years , from a current 32 years up to “ at least 40 years . ” if not , in 10 years germans will need to generate twice as much energy from expensive gas as they do today , the experts warned .
committee urges swift action this would create “ many billions of euros ” in extra costs for consumers , given the soaring prices of natural gas , the paper said .
to avoid this , a decision must be made " as quickly as possible - at latest , at the beginning of the next legislative period , " to revoke the existing nuclear phase-out law , ” the pepp authors wrote .
under the previous red-green government , germany passed a law requiring a total decommissioning of nuclear power plants by 2021 .
to relieve pressure on consumers in the short term , the paper recommends political support for cheaper energy , using a calculation based on atomic energy prices .
this would have a “ social component , ” the authors wrote , and would also help publicize the cost advantages of nuclear energy .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : foreign natural gas is increasingly expensive this , in turn , would help make public discourse on nuclear energy “ more objective , ” according to pepp .
plan advocates voluntary investment of profits shortly before the summer legislative recess , the german cabinet assigned glos to examine the effect of the global energy crisis on the german economy , and to present solutions for an efficient , secure and cost-effective energy policy .
as part of that effort glos formed the pepp group .
according to tagesspiegel , glos has yet to officially sign off on the paper .
in the paper , pepp suggested that any profits the nuclear plants make by staying open longer should be set aside in a foundation , and be used to invest in energy efficiency , energy research and renewable energies .
the foundations should n't be mandated by legislation , but should take place in “ a framework of voluntary agreements . ”
they also said it is crucial to investigate possible terminal storage areas for atomic waste , with the “ aim of finding a solution . ” dw staff -lrb- jen -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

the goal is to reduce expensive energy imports . a german plan to extending the use of the country 's nuclear power plants beyond the set phase-out period in 2020 is more concrete than expected , der tagesspiegel newspaper reported tuesday , aug .
5 .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : will merkel , left , and glos , sign off on the paper ?
german economics minister michael glos recently set up an expert group called the political energy program , or pepp , consisting of top scientists and economy ministry officials .
the committee has come out in favor of an “ atomic energy use law , ” which has a complete framework and is set to be reviewed by the chancellery this fall .
“ turning back from the plan to phase out nuclear energy makes ecological and economic sense , and we recommend it , ” the scientist group wrote in the paper , according to tagesspiegel .
the paper recommends extending the planned use of german atomic plants by eight years , from a current 32 years up to “ at least 40 years . ” if not , in 10 years germans will need to generate twice as much energy from expensive gas as they do today , the experts warned .
committee urges swift action this would create “ many billions of euros ” in extra costs for consumers , given the soaring prices of natural gas , the paper said .
to avoid this , a decision must be made " as quickly as possible - at latest , at the beginning of the next legislative period , " to revoke the existing nuclear phase-out law , ” the pepp authors wrote .
under the previous red-green government , germany passed a law requiring a total decommissioning of nuclear power plants by 2021 .
to relieve pressure on consumers in the short term , the paper recommends political support for cheaper energy , using a calculation based on atomic energy prices .
this would have a “ social component , ” the authors wrote , and would also help publicize the cost advantages of nuclear energy .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : foreign natural gas is increasingly expensive this , in turn , would help make public discourse on nuclear energy “ more objective , ” according to pepp .
plan advocates voluntary investment of profits shortly before the summer legislative recess , the german cabinet assigned glos to examine the effect of the global energy crisis on the german economy , and to present solutions for an efficient , secure and cost-effective energy policy .
as part of that effort glos formed the pepp group .
according to tagesspiegel , glos has yet to officially sign off on the paper .
in the paper , pepp suggested that any profits the nuclear plants make by staying open longer should be set aside in a foundation , and be used to invest in energy efficiency , energy research and renewable energies .
the foundations should n't be mandated by legislation , but should take place in “ a framework of voluntary agreements . ”
they also said it is crucial to investigate possible terminal storage areas for atomic waste , with the “ aim of finding a solution . ” dw staff -lrb- jen -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

by doing so , he 's trying to help people understand the actions of china 's rulers , who have - permanently or temporarily - blocked the web sites of international media organizations , such as the bbc , the frankfurter allgemeine zeitung or deutsche welle , even within the press center of the olympic games . web sites are blocked all over the world - vesper is right about that .
but his comparison is still wrong and uncalled for . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : daniel scheschkewitz in germany , right-wing extremist sites are blocked because they instigate people to commit crimes and because the spreading of right-wing extremist ideas in itself is already a crime .
in the people 's republic of china on the other hand , the foreign press is denied free access to the internet , because media organizations - for reasons of state - are permanently and systematically controlled there .
why should guests be allowed to do what the own population is n't allowed to do ? from its own point of view , china 's leadership is acting logically and consequentially : in for a penny , in for a pound .
relaxing media censorship during the olympic games would have been a major surprise and would have sent a signal to the chinese population .
once freedoms have been granted , it 's very hard to take them away again .
the process of liberal evolution most often develops a dynamic of its own that 's hard to reckon with . china 's principled stand is countered by the west 's softness .
not only olympic officials , but also politicians and even representatives of journalistic organizations have only mildly protested with self-imposed restraint against the censorship measures so far .
a misunderstood pragmatism and a wish to woo a rising economic superpower are reasons for this . this playing with fire ould easily cost the west its soul .
without free discourse and the unhindered exchange of ideas , our free economic order does n't mean much , either .
the strength of our civil societies is based on tolerance and respect for the opinions of those who think differently . china has invited the world for the olympic games .
but the doors remain closed for the global spectrum of opinions - not only in the country but also in those places where journalists are supposed to make use of their right to unhindered access to information : in press centers and beijing 's large hotels .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de bundesliga -pipe- 05.08.2008 bundesliga loses another top star in van der vaart großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : rafael van der vaart has waved bye-bye to hamburg rafael van der vaart 's transfer to real madrid came as a surprise to no one .
but the departure of the former hamburg playmaker shows once again that bayern are the only bundesliga club that can keep world-class talent . hamburg confirmed that their best player was leaving on monday , august 4 , ending a year of speculation in which the question was not whether van der vaart was going , but when , to whom and for how much .
because of a clause in the dutchman 's contract , which would have allowed him to leave for 1.5 million euros -lrb- $ 2.3 million -rrb- next season , hamburg had to sell .
the 14-16 million euro deal , depending on how real performs with van der vaart , is about half of his estimated market value - the best hamburg could do under the circumstances .
van der vaart has described the move as a dream come true , while the man who now wo n't be his coach , dutchman martin jol , told germany 's bild newspaper he considered the playmaker " one of the best players in the past 25 years . "
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the playmaker scored 29 goals in 74 matches for his ex-employers the 25-year-old playmaker , who 's already won 58 caps for holland , was certainly one of the best hamburg has seen in the last quarter-century .
with him the german side qualified for international competition three years on the trot .
significantly , when van der vaart was out injured for the first half of the 2006-7 season , hamburg had the second worst record in the league - when he came back in the second season half , hamburg were second-best .
his departure thus likely turns hamburg from a champions league contender to an also-ran in a transition year .
it also underscores the fact that , lamentably and with one notable exception , the bundesliga can not compete for the services of the world 's soccer elite .
no more mighty mice bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : kevin keegan and his amazing afro-styled hair played for hamburg in the late ' 70s things were n't always this way for hamburg and other comparably sized german clubs .
in 1977 , for instance , hamburg landed a spectacular transfer , attracting english striker kevin keegan away from liverpool .
mighty mouse , as the diminutive forward was quickly nicknamed , won the european player of the year award with hamburg and led the team to a league title and a berth in the final of the old european club championship .
-lrb- they lost to nottingham forest -rrb- .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : but in 2008 stars like steven gerrard give the bundesliga a miss what a difference three decades make .
the mere thought of steven gerrard or fernando torres leaving liverpool for hamburg is enough to draw guffaws from any football fan .
and hamburg are n't alone in perennially bumping their heads on what amounts to a glass ceiling .
in the next couple of seasons , bremen and stuttgart are likely to find themselves in the same situation with respect to stars diego and mario gomez as hamburg was with van der vaart .
bayern munich , alone , is capable of not only signing but retaining players of the top caliber .
so why have the rest of the bundesliga 's ambitious sides become so unattractive ?
money + success = more success bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : bayern 's record of achievement attracts the big names real madrid is one of the wealthiest clubs in the world , and even the other giants of the game - as manchester united are finding out right now with cristiano ronaldo - have a hard time staving off the spaniards ' advances when a player has caught their fancy .
but perhaps more important than money is the fact that no bundesliga side other than bayern has been able to establish its credentials as a regular contender for the prize of prizes - a champions league title .
that 's down to bayern 's double-advantage policy of buying up stars from other bundesliga clubs , simultaneously strengthening their own squad while weakening their domestic rivals .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : leverkusen fell apart when ballack turned his back on them case in point : bayer leverkusen .
in 2002 , they reached the champions league final , losing somewhat unluckily to real madrid .
as a club backed by the financial might of germany 's biggest pharmaceutical company , they looked like a decent bet to jump into europe 's elite .
instead bayern lured two of leverkusen 's mainstays , midfielders michael ballack and ze roberto , into jumping ship .
as a result , bayer leverkusen barely avoided relegation in 2003 and has never even qualified for the champions league again .
moreover , within that time span , no other german team other than those two has made a champions league semifinal , let alone a final .
and that 's what club soccer is all about for the world 's best .

but the departure of the former hamburg playmaker shows once again that bayern are the only bundesliga club that can keep world-class talent . hamburg confirmed that their best player was leaving on monday , august 4 , ending a year of speculation in which the question was not whether van der vaart was going , but when , to whom and for how much .
because of a clause in the dutchman 's contract , which would have allowed him to leave for 1.5 million euros -lrb- $ 2.3 million -rrb- next season , hamburg had to sell .
the 14-16 million euro deal , depending on how real performs with van der vaart , is about half of his estimated market value - the best hamburg could do under the circumstances .
van der vaart has described the move as a dream come true , while the man who now wo n't be his coach , dutchman martin jol , told germany 's bild newspaper he considered the playmaker " one of the best players in the past 25 years . "
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the playmaker scored 29 goals in 74 matches for his ex-employers the 25-year-old playmaker , who 's already won 58 caps for holland , was certainly one of the best hamburg has seen in the last quarter-century .
with him the german side qualified for international competition three years on the trot .
significantly , when van der vaart was out injured for the first half of the 2006-7 season , hamburg had the second worst record in the league - when he came back in the second season half , hamburg were second-best .
his departure thus likely turns hamburg from a champions league contender to an also-ran in a transition year .
it also underscores the fact that , lamentably and with one notable exception , the bundesliga can not compete for the services of the world 's soccer elite .
no more mighty mice bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : kevin keegan and his amazing afro-styled hair played for hamburg in the late ' 70s things were n't always this way for hamburg and other comparably sized german clubs .
in 1977 , for instance , hamburg landed a spectacular transfer , attracting english striker kevin keegan away from liverpool .
mighty mouse , as the diminutive forward was quickly nicknamed , won the european player of the year award with hamburg and led the team to a league title and a berth in the final of the old european club championship .
-lrb- they lost to nottingham forest -rrb- .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : but in 2008 stars like steven gerrard give the bundesliga a miss what a difference three decades make .
the mere thought of steven gerrard or fernando torres leaving liverpool for hamburg is enough to draw guffaws from any football fan .
and hamburg are n't alone in perennially bumping their heads on what amounts to a glass ceiling .
in the next couple of seasons , bremen and stuttgart are likely to find themselves in the same situation with respect to stars diego and mario gomez as hamburg was with van der vaart .
bayern munich , alone , is capable of not only signing but retaining players of the top caliber .

but perhaps more important than money is the fact that no bundesliga side other than bayern has been able to establish its credentials as a regular contender for the prize of prizes - a champions league title .
that 's down to bayern 's double-advantage policy of buying up stars from other bundesliga clubs , simultaneously strengthening their own squad while weakening their domestic rivals .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : leverkusen fell apart when ballack turned his back on them case in point : bayer leverkusen .
in 2002 , they reached the champions league final , losing somewhat unluckily to real madrid .
as a club backed by the financial might of germany 's biggest pharmaceutical company , they looked like a decent bet to jump into europe 's elite .
instead bayern lured two of leverkusen 's mainstays , midfielders michael ballack and ze roberto , into jumping ship .
as a result , bayer leverkusen barely avoided relegation in 2003 and has never even qualified for the champions league again .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de bundesliga -pipe- 05.08.2008 bundesliga loses another top star in van der vaart großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : rafael van der vaart has waved bye-bye to hamburg rafael van der vaart 's transfer to real madrid came as a surprise to no one .
but the departure of the former hamburg playmaker shows once again that bayern are the only bundesliga club that can keep world-class talent . hamburg confirmed that their best player was leaving on monday , august 4 , ending a year of speculation in which the question was not whether van der vaart was going , but when , to whom and for how much .
because of a clause in the dutchman 's contract , which would have allowed him to leave for 1.5 million euros -lrb- $ 2.3 million -rrb- next season , hamburg had to sell .
the 14-16 million euro deal , depending on how real performs with van der vaart , is about half of his estimated market value - the best hamburg could do under the circumstances .
van der vaart has described the move as a dream come true , while the man who now wo n't be his coach , dutchman martin jol , told germany 's bild newspaper he considered the playmaker " one of the best players in the past 25 years . "
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the playmaker scored 29 goals in 74 matches for his ex-employers the 25-year-old playmaker , who 's already won 58 caps for holland , was certainly one of the best hamburg has seen in the last quarter-century .
with him the german side qualified for international competition three years on the trot .
significantly , when van der vaart was out injured for the first half of the 2006-7 season , hamburg had the second worst record in the league - when he came back in the second season half , hamburg were second-best .
his departure thus likely turns hamburg from a champions league contender to an also-ran in a transition year .
it also underscores the fact that , lamentably and with one notable exception , the bundesliga can not compete for the services of the world 's soccer elite .
no more mighty mice bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : kevin keegan and his amazing afro-styled hair played for hamburg in the late ' 70s things were n't always this way for hamburg and other comparably sized german clubs .
in 1977 , for instance , hamburg landed a spectacular transfer , attracting english striker kevin keegan away from liverpool .
mighty mouse , as the diminutive forward was quickly nicknamed , won the european player of the year award with hamburg and led the team to a league title and a berth in the final of the old european club championship .
-lrb- they lost to nottingham forest -rrb- .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : but in 2008 stars like steven gerrard give the bundesliga a miss what a difference three decades make .
the mere thought of steven gerrard or fernando torres leaving liverpool for hamburg is enough to draw guffaws from any football fan .
and hamburg are n't alone in perennially bumping their heads on what amounts to a glass ceiling .
in the next couple of seasons , bremen and stuttgart are likely to find themselves in the same situation with respect to stars diego and mario gomez as hamburg was with van der vaart .
bayern munich , alone , is capable of not only signing but retaining players of the top caliber .
so why have the rest of the bundesliga 's ambitious sides become so unattractive ?
money + success = more success bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : bayern 's record of achievement attracts the big names real madrid is one of the wealthiest clubs in the world , and even the other giants of the game - as manchester united are finding out right now with cristiano ronaldo - have a hard time staving off the spaniards ' advances when a player has caught their fancy .
but perhaps more important than money is the fact that no bundesliga side other than bayern has been able to establish its credentials as a regular contender for the prize of prizes - a champions league title .
that 's down to bayern 's double-advantage policy of buying up stars from other bundesliga clubs , simultaneously strengthening their own squad while weakening their domestic rivals .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : leverkusen fell apart when ballack turned his back on them case in point : bayer leverkusen .
in 2002 , they reached the champions league final , losing somewhat unluckily to real madrid .
as a club backed by the financial might of germany 's biggest pharmaceutical company , they looked like a decent bet to jump into europe 's elite .
instead bayern lured two of leverkusen 's mainstays , midfielders michael ballack and ze roberto , into jumping ship .
as a result , bayer leverkusen barely avoided relegation in 2003 and has never even qualified for the champions league again .
moreover , within that time span , no other german team other than those two has made a champions league semifinal , let alone a final .
and that 's what club soccer is all about for the world 's best .
so while bayern contends for glory year in , year out with the likes of frank ribery , luca toni and miroslav klose , clubs like hamburg are fated to losing players of van der vaart 's caliber , just as they should be poised to make the jump to the next level . jefferson chase send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

german economics minister michael glos recently set up an expert group called the political energy program , or pepp , consisting of top scientists and economy ministry officials .
the committee has come out in favor of an “ atomic energy use law , ” which has a complete framework and is set to be reviewed by the chancellery this fall .
“ turning back from the plan to phase out nuclear energy makes ecological and economic sense , and we recommend it , ” the scientist group wrote in the paper , according to tagesspiegel .
the paper recommends extending the planned use of german atomic plants by eight years , from a current 32 years up to “ at least 40 years . ” if not , in 10 years germans will need to generate twice as much energy from expensive gas as they do today , the experts warned .
committee urges swift action this would create “ many billions of euros ” in extra costs for consumers , given the soaring prices of natural gas , the paper said .
to avoid this , a decision must be made " as quickly as possible - at latest , at the beginning of the next legislative period , " to revoke the existing nuclear phase-out law , ” the pepp authors wrote .
under the previous red-green government , germany passed a law requiring a total decommissioning of nuclear power plants by 2021 .

this would have a “ social component , ” the authors wrote , and would also help publicize the cost advantages of nuclear energy .

as part of that effort glos formed the pepp group .
according to tagesspiegel , glos has yet to officially sign off on the paper .
in the paper , pepp suggested that any profits the nuclear plants make by staying open longer should be set aside in a foundation , and be used to invest in energy efficiency , energy research and renewable energies .

german economics minister michael glos recently set up an expert group called the political energy program , or pepp , consisting of top scientists and economy ministry officials .
the committee has come out in favor of an “ atomic energy use law , ” which has a complete framework and is set to be reviewed by the chancellery this fall .
“ turning back from the plan to phase out nuclear energy makes ecological and economic sense , and we recommend it , ” the scientist group wrote in the paper , according to tagesspiegel .
the paper recommends extending the planned use of german atomic plants by eight years , from a current 32 years up to “ at least 40 years . ” if not , in 10 years germans will need to generate twice as much energy from expensive gas as they do today , the experts warned .
committee urges swift action this would create “ many billions of euros ” in extra costs for consumers , given the soaring prices of natural gas , the paper said .
to avoid this , a decision must be made " as quickly as possible - at latest , at the beginning of the next legislative period , " to revoke the existing nuclear phase-out law , ” the pepp authors wrote .
under the previous red-green government , germany passed a law requiring a total decommissioning of nuclear power plants by 2021 .
to relieve pressure on consumers in the short term , the paper recommends political support for cheaper energy , using a calculation based on atomic energy prices .
this would have a “ social component , ” the authors wrote , and would also help publicize the cost advantages of nuclear energy .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : foreign natural gas is increasingly expensive this , in turn , would help make public discourse on nuclear energy “ more objective , ” according to pepp .
plan advocates voluntary investment of profits shortly before the summer legislative recess , the german cabinet assigned glos to examine the effect of the global energy crisis on the german economy , and to present solutions for an efficient , secure and cost-effective energy policy .
as part of that effort glos formed the pepp group .
according to tagesspiegel , glos has yet to officially sign off on the paper .
in the paper , pepp suggested that any profits the nuclear plants make by staying open longer should be set aside in a foundation , and be used to invest in energy efficiency , energy research and renewable energies .
the foundations should n't be mandated by legislation , but should take place in “ a framework of voluntary agreements . ”

18 , 1977 , became known as death night for the leaders of the red army faction .
these were among the events collectively known as the german autumn , which also included a series of terrorist attacks and the west german government 's response .
debate over suicides according to a report in the stuttgarter zeitung on tuesday , aug .
5 , the pictures include images of the abduction of leading raf terrorists baader , ensslin and raspe , as well as the emergency operation performed on irmgard moeller , who tried to kill herself by stabbing herself four times in the chest .
bildunterschrift : germany sought the terrorists with ' wanted ' posters she survived her suicide attempt and has since stated that the deaths were not suicide , but rather extrajudicial killings undertaken by the german government of the time , a claim strongly denied by german governments , former and present .
photos show " nothing new " the pictures were discovered in a suitcase in the basement of a house a week ago , and had been taken by a long-deceased police photographer .
now they have been given to the stuttgart prosecutor 's office for further examination , a spokeswoman for the investigators confirmed .
on first look , the photos do n't show anything new , the spokeswoman said .
“ possibly , a few well-known pictures are shown again from a different angle , ” she added .
the newspaper further reported that the pictures were mostly taken to be used in the so-called stammheim deaths trial .
the files of the hotly debated trial were sent to the state archive in ludwigsburg in 2005 , but a few months ago were retrieved by the stuttgart prosecutors ' office .
prosecutor : new look at case unlikely now they are checking whether new investigations will be made into the politically explosive case .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : two of the raf leaders , ensslin and baader the spokeswoman for the prosecutors ' office said the files had been moved for space reasons .
when the media began reporting last year that security officers may have allowed the suicides to happen , investigators sought the files out again – “ a completely normal thing to do . ”
however , she said there are no indications pointing to a new look into the events of the autumn of 1977 . dw staff -lrb- jen -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

by doing so , he 's trying to help people understand the actions of china 's rulers , who have - permanently or temporarily - blocked the web sites of international media organizations , such as the bbc , the frankfurter allgemeine zeitung or deutsche welle , even within the press center of the olympic games . web sites are blocked all over the world - vesper is right about that .
but his comparison is still wrong and uncalled for . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : daniel scheschkewitz in germany , right-wing extremist sites are blocked because they instigate people to commit crimes and because the spreading of right-wing extremist ideas in itself is already a crime .
in the people 's republic of china on the other hand , the foreign press is denied free access to the internet , because media organizations - for reasons of state - are permanently and systematically controlled there .
why should guests be allowed to do what the own population is n't allowed to do ? from its own point of view , china 's leadership is acting logically and consequentially : in for a penny , in for a pound .
relaxing media censorship during the olympic games would have been a major surprise and would have sent a signal to the chinese population .
once freedoms have been granted , it 's very hard to take them away again .
the process of liberal evolution most often develops a dynamic of its own that 's hard to reckon with . china 's principled stand is countered by the west 's softness .
not only olympic officials , but also politicians and even representatives of journalistic organizations have only mildly protested with self-imposed restraint against the censorship measures so far .
a misunderstood pragmatism and a wish to woo a rising economic superpower are reasons for this . this playing with fire ould easily cost the west its soul .
without free discourse and the unhindered exchange of ideas , our free economic order does n't mean much , either .
the strength of our civil societies is based on tolerance and respect for the opinions of those who think differently . china has invited the world for the olympic games .
but the doors remain closed for the global spectrum of opinions - not only in the country but also in those places where journalists are supposed to make use of their right to unhindered access to information : in press centers and beijing 's large hotels .
to accept this chinese censorship is misconceived tolerance .
the west loses its credibility .
china will feel vindicated and continue to let no one dictate to it about human rights . besides - without pressure , no power apparatus , especially a regime that 's based on repression , will move an inch .
as good guests , olympic athletes and officials should respect their host country , its customs and traditions .
but if the rules of the game violate our fundamental values , one has to be able to point this out with indignation - even in china , and especially during the olympic games . daniel scheschkewitz is dw-radio 's national correspondent -lrb- win -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

the bloc wants to see the tobacco industry develop products that go out if they 're not being smoked - it 's not at all a new idea . brussels says a new generation of cigarettes could dramatically reduce the number of deaths by fires .
" by introducing self-extinguishing cigarettes , at least 2,000 lives could be saved in the eu each year , " the bloc 's commissioner for consumer affairs told german newspaper die welt .
the german fire departments ' association was quick to greet the initiatives , saying some 200 of the 600 people who die by fire in germany each year are killed by flames originally caused by smoldering butts .
" if the self-extinguishing cigarette can contribute to reducing this number , its introduction has to be seen positively , " association spokeswoman silvia darmstaedter told dw-world.de. a spokesman for the eu standardization commission also told reporters he thought that " fire-safe " cigs could be made mandatory by the year 2011 .
ironic name , old idea bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the new cigs could help reduce forest fires throughout europe self-extinguishing cigarettes draw on a technology that developers , presumably with a sense of humor , call reduced ignition propensity - or rip .
bands of cellulose or alginate are put into the cigarette paper so that the burning tobacco goes out if not puffed on .
the concept has been kicking around for quite some time .
patents for self-extinguishing cigarettes were granted in the 1930s .
american cigarette makers philip morris and rj reynolds developed " fire-safe " models in the 1980s but did not , in general , market them .
" what is very important is that consumers should understand that those changes do not make fire-safe or even fire-safer cigarettes , " elfriede buben , external communications manager for philip morris germany , told dw-radio .
" anything that burns , if handled carelessly , can cause a fire . "
several american states , including new york , massachusetts and california limit the sale of cigarettes to rip models .
now the eu could follow their lead .
advantage for smokers bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the industry has prefered to make cigarettes that continue burning it is questionable whether technology and legislation are needed to solve the problem .
as smokers know , cigars , pipe tobacco and hand-rolled cigarettes tend to go out on their own .
that 's because regular cigarettes contain burning agents to keep them lit .
" the elimination of burning agents in cigarette paper would be a simple and effective means of dramatically reducing the ignition propensity of cigarettes , " wrote simon chapman , a professor of public health at the university sydney , in a 2004 australian medical journal .
but if self-extinguishing cigarettes do become the mandatory eu norm , smokers may benefit financially .
after all a cigarette that burns down to the filter has to be replaced - whereas one that goes out on its own can always be relit . dw staff -lrb- jc -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de bundesliga -pipe- 05.08.2008 bundesliga loses another top star in van der vaart großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : rafael van der vaart has waved bye-bye to hamburg rafael van der vaart 's transfer to real madrid came as a surprise to no one .
but the departure of the former hamburg playmaker shows once again that bayern are the only bundesliga club that can keep world-class talent . hamburg confirmed that their best player was leaving on monday , august 4 , ending a year of speculation in which the question was not whether van der vaart was going , but when , to whom and for how much .
because of a clause in the dutchman 's contract , which would have allowed him to leave for 1.5 million euros -lrb- $ 2.3 million -rrb- next season , hamburg had to sell .
the 14-16 million euro deal , depending on how real performs with van der vaart , is about half of his estimated market value - the best hamburg could do under the circumstances .
van der vaart has described the move as a dream come true , while the man who now wo n't be his coach , dutchman martin jol , told germany 's bild newspaper he considered the playmaker " one of the best players in the past 25 years . "
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the playmaker scored 29 goals in 74 matches for his ex-employers the 25-year-old playmaker , who 's already won 58 caps for holland , was certainly one of the best hamburg has seen in the last quarter-century .
with him the german side qualified for international competition three years on the trot .
significantly , when van der vaart was out injured for the first half of the 2006-7 season , hamburg had the second worst record in the league - when he came back in the second season half , hamburg were second-best .
his departure thus likely turns hamburg from a champions league contender to an also-ran in a transition year .
it also underscores the fact that , lamentably and with one notable exception , the bundesliga can not compete for the services of the world 's soccer elite .
no more mighty mice bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : kevin keegan and his amazing afro-styled hair played for hamburg in the late ' 70s things were n't always this way for hamburg and other comparably sized german clubs .
in 1977 , for instance , hamburg landed a spectacular transfer , attracting english striker kevin keegan away from liverpool .
mighty mouse , as the diminutive forward was quickly nicknamed , won the european player of the year award with hamburg and led the team to a league title and a berth in the final of the old european club championship .
-lrb- they lost to nottingham forest -rrb- .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : but in 2008 stars like steven gerrard give the bundesliga a miss what a difference three decades make .
the mere thought of steven gerrard or fernando torres leaving liverpool for hamburg is enough to draw guffaws from any football fan .
and hamburg are n't alone in perennially bumping their heads on what amounts to a glass ceiling .
in the next couple of seasons , bremen and stuttgart are likely to find themselves in the same situation with respect to stars diego and mario gomez as hamburg was with van der vaart .
bayern munich , alone , is capable of not only signing but retaining players of the top caliber .
so why have the rest of the bundesliga 's ambitious sides become so unattractive ?
money + success = more success bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : bayern 's record of achievement attracts the big names real madrid is one of the wealthiest clubs in the world , and even the other giants of the game - as manchester united are finding out right now with cristiano ronaldo - have a hard time staving off the spaniards ' advances when a player has caught their fancy .
but perhaps more important than money is the fact that no bundesliga side other than bayern has been able to establish its credentials as a regular contender for the prize of prizes - a champions league title .
that 's down to bayern 's double-advantage policy of buying up stars from other bundesliga clubs , simultaneously strengthening their own squad while weakening their domestic rivals .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : leverkusen fell apart when ballack turned his back on them case in point : bayer leverkusen .
in 2002 , they reached the champions league final , losing somewhat unluckily to real madrid .
as a club backed by the financial might of germany 's biggest pharmaceutical company , they looked like a decent bet to jump into europe 's elite .
instead bayern lured two of leverkusen 's mainstays , midfielders michael ballack and ze roberto , into jumping ship .
as a result , bayer leverkusen barely avoided relegation in 2003 and has never even qualified for the champions league again .
moreover , within that time span , no other german team other than those two has made a champions league semifinal , let alone a final .
and that 's what club soccer is all about for the world 's best .
so while bayern contends for glory year in , year out with the likes of frank ribery , luca toni and miroslav klose , clubs like hamburg are fated to losing players of van der vaart 's caliber , just as they should be poised to make the jump to the next level . jefferson chase send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

the bloc wants to see the tobacco industry develop products that go out if they 're not being smoked - it 's not at all a new idea . brussels says a new generation of cigarettes could dramatically reduce the number of deaths by fires .
" by introducing self-extinguishing cigarettes , at least 2,000 lives could be saved in the eu each year , " the bloc 's commissioner for consumer affairs told german newspaper die welt .
the german fire departments ' association was quick to greet the initiatives , saying some 200 of the 600 people who die by fire in germany each year are killed by flames originally caused by smoldering butts .

by doing so , he 's trying to help people understand the actions of china 's rulers , who have - permanently or temporarily - blocked the web sites of international media organizations , such as the bbc , the frankfurter allgemeine zeitung or deutsche welle , even within the press center of the olympic games . web sites are blocked all over the world - vesper is right about that .
but his comparison is still wrong and uncalled for . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : daniel scheschkewitz in germany , right-wing extremist sites are blocked because they instigate people to commit crimes and because the spreading of right-wing extremist ideas in itself is already a crime .
in the people 's republic of china on the other hand , the foreign press is denied free access to the internet , because media organizations - for reasons of state - are permanently and systematically controlled there .
why should guests be allowed to do what the own population is n't allowed to do ? from its own point of view , china 's leadership is acting logically and consequentially : in for a penny , in for a pound .
relaxing media censorship during the olympic games would have been a major surprise and would have sent a signal to the chinese population .
once freedoms have been granted , it 's very hard to take them away again .
the process of liberal evolution most often develops a dynamic of its own that 's hard to reckon with . china 's principled stand is countered by the west 's softness .
not only olympic officials , but also politicians and even representatives of journalistic organizations have only mildly protested with self-imposed restraint against the censorship measures so far .
a misunderstood pragmatism and a wish to woo a rising economic superpower are reasons for this . this playing with fire ould easily cost the west its soul .
without free discourse and the unhindered exchange of ideas , our free economic order does n't mean much , either .
the strength of our civil societies is based on tolerance and respect for the opinions of those who think differently . china has invited the world for the olympic games .
but the doors remain closed for the global spectrum of opinions - not only in the country but also in those places where journalists are supposed to make use of their right to unhindered access to information : in press centers and beijing 's large hotels .
to accept this chinese censorship is misconceived tolerance .
the west loses its credibility .
china will feel vindicated and continue to let no one dictate to it about human rights . besides - without pressure , no power apparatus , especially a regime that 's based on repression , will move an inch .
as good guests , olympic athletes and officials should respect their host country , its customs and traditions .
but if the rules of the game violate our fundamental values , one has to be able to point this out with indignation - even in china , and especially during the olympic games . daniel scheschkewitz is dw-radio 's national correspondent -lrb- win -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

" there are no plans to purchase a fighter drone for the bundeswehr , " a spokesman for the german defense ministry in berlin said .
the defense security cooperation agency -lrb- dsca -rrb- notified congress that germany had requested a possible sale of five of the unmanned combat aircraft while italy had asked for four .
the sale of the hunter-killer drones was valued at up to $ 330 million -lrb- 212 million euros -rrb- for italy , as the agreement would include five years of maintenance support .
germany 's sale , which includes just one year of maintenance support , was estimated at $ 205 million .
both countries are seeking the new drones " for the defense of deployed troops , regional security and interoperability with the united states , " the dsca said in its notification .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : italian pm berlusconi has long been a supporter of the war in iraq " this program will increase italy 's ability to contribute to future nato , coalition , and anti-terrorism operations that the us may undertake , " the agency said .
why fear the mq-9 reaper ?
known as a hunter-killer drone , the reaper was deployed only recently in iraq , flying for the first time from balad air base on july 17 .
it 's been used in afghanistan since september .
the reaper , which can carry four hellfire missiles and two 500-pound laser guided bombs , can fly faster , higher , farther and carry more weapons than its predecessor , according to lieutenant general gary north , the commander of us air forces in the middle east .
" we have turned a corner in warfare by bringing in this new platform that complements - and i stress complements - our incredible manned capacity today , " he told afp news agency .
" by acquiring this capability , germany will be able to provide the same level of protection for its own forces as those of the united states , " the dsca said .

without free discourse and the unhindered exchange of ideas , our free economic order does n't mean much , either .
the strength of our civil societies is based on tolerance and respect for the opinions of those who think differently . china has invited the world for the olympic games .
but the doors remain closed for the global spectrum of opinions - not only in the country but also in those places where journalists are supposed to make use of their right to unhindered access to information : in press centers and beijing 's large hotels .
to accept this chinese censorship is misconceived tolerance .
the west loses its credibility .
china will feel vindicated and continue to let no one dictate to it about human rights . besides - without pressure , no power apparatus , especially a regime that 's based on repression , will move an inch .
as good guests , olympic athletes and officials should respect their host country , its customs and traditions .
but if the rules of the game violate our fundamental values , one has to be able to point this out with indignation - even in china , and especially during the olympic games . daniel scheschkewitz is dw-radio 's national correspondent -lrb- win -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

" there are no plans to purchase a fighter drone for the bundeswehr , " a spokesman for the german defense ministry in berlin said .
the defense security cooperation agency -lrb- dsca -rrb- notified congress that germany had requested a possible sale of five of the unmanned combat aircraft while italy had asked for four .
the sale of the hunter-killer drones was valued at up to $ 330 million -lrb- 212 million euros -rrb- for italy , as the agreement would include five years of maintenance support .
germany 's sale , which includes just one year of maintenance support , was estimated at $ 205 million .

known as a hunter-killer drone , the reaper was deployed only recently in iraq , flying for the first time from balad air base on july 17 .
it 's been used in afghanistan since september .
the reaper , which can carry four hellfire missiles and two 500-pound laser guided bombs , can fly faster , higher , farther and carry more weapons than its predecessor , according to lieutenant general gary north , the commander of us air forces in the middle east .
" we have turned a corner in warfare by bringing in this new platform that complements - and i stress complements - our incredible manned capacity today , " he told afp news agency .
" by acquiring this capability , germany will be able to provide the same level of protection for its own forces as those of the united states , " the dsca said .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de bundesliga -pipe- 05.08.2008 bundesliga loses another top star in van der vaart großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : rafael van der vaart has waved bye-bye to hamburg rafael van der vaart 's transfer to real madrid came as a surprise to no one .
but the departure of the former hamburg playmaker shows once again that bayern are the only bundesliga club that can keep world-class talent . hamburg confirmed that their best player was leaving on monday , august 4 , ending a year of speculation in which the question was not whether van der vaart was going , but when , to whom and for how much .
because of a clause in the dutchman 's contract , which would have allowed him to leave for 1.5 million euros -lrb- $ 2.3 million -rrb- next season , hamburg had to sell .
the 14-16 million euro deal , depending on how real performs with van der vaart , is about half of his estimated market value - the best hamburg could do under the circumstances .
van der vaart has described the move as a dream come true , while the man who now wo n't be his coach , dutchman martin jol , told germany 's bild newspaper he considered the playmaker " one of the best players in the past 25 years . "
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the playmaker scored 29 goals in 74 matches for his ex-employers the 25-year-old playmaker , who 's already won 58 caps for holland , was certainly one of the best hamburg has seen in the last quarter-century .
with him the german side qualified for international competition three years on the trot .
significantly , when van der vaart was out injured for the first half of the 2006-7 season , hamburg had the second worst record in the league - when he came back in the second season half , hamburg were second-best .
his departure thus likely turns hamburg from a champions league contender to an also-ran in a transition year .
it also underscores the fact that , lamentably and with one notable exception , the bundesliga can not compete for the services of the world 's soccer elite .
no more mighty mice bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : kevin keegan and his amazing afro-styled hair played for hamburg in the late ' 70s things were n't always this way for hamburg and other comparably sized german clubs .
in 1977 , for instance , hamburg landed a spectacular transfer , attracting english striker kevin keegan away from liverpool .
mighty mouse , as the diminutive forward was quickly nicknamed , won the european player of the year award with hamburg and led the team to a league title and a berth in the final of the old european club championship .
-lrb- they lost to nottingham forest -rrb- .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : but in 2008 stars like steven gerrard give the bundesliga a miss what a difference three decades make .
the mere thought of steven gerrard or fernando torres leaving liverpool for hamburg is enough to draw guffaws from any football fan .
and hamburg are n't alone in perennially bumping their heads on what amounts to a glass ceiling .
in the next couple of seasons , bremen and stuttgart are likely to find themselves in the same situation with respect to stars diego and mario gomez as hamburg was with van der vaart .
bayern munich , alone , is capable of not only signing but retaining players of the top caliber .
so why have the rest of the bundesliga 's ambitious sides become so unattractive ?
money + success = more success bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : bayern 's record of achievement attracts the big names real madrid is one of the wealthiest clubs in the world , and even the other giants of the game - as manchester united are finding out right now with cristiano ronaldo - have a hard time staving off the spaniards ' advances when a player has caught their fancy .
but perhaps more important than money is the fact that no bundesliga side other than bayern has been able to establish its credentials as a regular contender for the prize of prizes - a champions league title .
that 's down to bayern 's double-advantage policy of buying up stars from other bundesliga clubs , simultaneously strengthening their own squad while weakening their domestic rivals .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : leverkusen fell apart when ballack turned his back on them case in point : bayer leverkusen .
in 2002 , they reached the champions league final , losing somewhat unluckily to real madrid .
as a club backed by the financial might of germany 's biggest pharmaceutical company , they looked like a decent bet to jump into europe 's elite .
instead bayern lured two of leverkusen 's mainstays , midfielders michael ballack and ze roberto , into jumping ship .
as a result , bayer leverkusen barely avoided relegation in 2003 and has never even qualified for the champions league again .
moreover , within that time span , no other german team other than those two has made a champions league semifinal , let alone a final .
and that 's what club soccer is all about for the world 's best .
so while bayern contends for glory year in , year out with the likes of frank ribery , luca toni and miroslav klose , clubs like hamburg are fated to losing players of van der vaart 's caliber , just as they should be poised to make the jump to the next level . jefferson chase send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

by doing so , he 's trying to help people understand the actions of china 's rulers , who have - permanently or temporarily - blocked the web sites of international media organizations , such as the bbc , the frankfurter allgemeine zeitung or deutsche welle , even within the press center of the olympic games . web sites are blocked all over the world - vesper is right about that .
but his comparison is still wrong and uncalled for . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : daniel scheschkewitz in germany , right-wing extremist sites are blocked because they instigate people to commit crimes and because the spreading of right-wing extremist ideas in itself is already a crime .
in the people 's republic of china on the other hand , the foreign press is denied free access to the internet , because media organizations - for reasons of state - are permanently and systematically controlled there .
why should guests be allowed to do what the own population is n't allowed to do ? from its own point of view , china 's leadership is acting logically and consequentially : in for a penny , in for a pound .
relaxing media censorship during the olympic games would have been a major surprise and would have sent a signal to the chinese population .
once freedoms have been granted , it 's very hard to take them away again .

the goal is to reduce expensive energy imports . a german plan to extending the use of the country 's nuclear power plants beyond the set phase-out period in 2020 is more concrete than expected , der tagesspiegel newspaper reported tuesday , aug .
5 .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : will merkel , left , and glos , sign off on the paper ?
german economics minister michael glos recently set up an expert group called the political energy program , or pepp , consisting of top scientists and economy ministry officials .
the committee has come out in favor of an “ atomic energy use law , ” which has a complete framework and is set to be reviewed by the chancellery this fall .
“ turning back from the plan to phase out nuclear energy makes ecological and economic sense , and we recommend it , ” the scientist group wrote in the paper , according to tagesspiegel .
the paper recommends extending the planned use of german atomic plants by eight years , from a current 32 years up to “ at least 40 years . ” if not , in 10 years germans will need to generate twice as much energy from expensive gas as they do today , the experts warned .
committee urges swift action this would create “ many billions of euros ” in extra costs for consumers , given the soaring prices of natural gas , the paper said .
to avoid this , a decision must be made " as quickly as possible - at latest , at the beginning of the next legislative period , " to revoke the existing nuclear phase-out law , ” the pepp authors wrote .
under the previous red-green government , germany passed a law requiring a total decommissioning of nuclear power plants by 2021 .
to relieve pressure on consumers in the short term , the paper recommends political support for cheaper energy , using a calculation based on atomic energy prices .
this would have a “ social component , ” the authors wrote , and would also help publicize the cost advantages of nuclear energy .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : foreign natural gas is increasingly expensive this , in turn , would help make public discourse on nuclear energy “ more objective , ” according to pepp .
plan advocates voluntary investment of profits shortly before the summer legislative recess , the german cabinet assigned glos to examine the effect of the global energy crisis on the german economy , and to present solutions for an efficient , secure and cost-effective energy policy .
as part of that effort glos formed the pepp group .
according to tagesspiegel , glos has yet to officially sign off on the paper .
in the paper , pepp suggested that any profits the nuclear plants make by staying open longer should be set aside in a foundation , and be used to invest in energy efficiency , energy research and renewable energies .
the foundations should n't be mandated by legislation , but should take place in “ a framework of voluntary agreements . ”
they also said it is crucial to investigate possible terminal storage areas for atomic waste , with the “ aim of finding a solution . ” dw staff -lrb- jen -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the playmaker scored 29 goals in 74 matches for his ex-employers the 25-year-old playmaker , who 's already won 58 caps for holland , was certainly one of the best hamburg has seen in the last quarter-century .
with him the german side qualified for international competition three years on the trot .
significantly , when van der vaart was out injured for the first half of the 2006-7 season , hamburg had the second worst record in the league - when he came back in the second season half , hamburg were second-best .
his departure thus likely turns hamburg from a champions league contender to an also-ran in a transition year .
it also underscores the fact that , lamentably and with one notable exception , the bundesliga can not compete for the services of the world 's soccer elite .
no more mighty mice bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : kevin keegan and his amazing afro-styled hair played for hamburg in the late ' 70s things were n't always this way for hamburg and other comparably sized german clubs .
in 1977 , for instance , hamburg landed a spectacular transfer , attracting english striker kevin keegan away from liverpool .
mighty mouse , as the diminutive forward was quickly nicknamed , won the european player of the year award with hamburg and led the team to a league title and a berth in the final of the old european club championship .
-lrb- they lost to nottingham forest -rrb- .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : but in 2008 stars like steven gerrard give the bundesliga a miss what a difference three decades make .
the mere thought of steven gerrard or fernando torres leaving liverpool for hamburg is enough to draw guffaws from any football fan .
and hamburg are n't alone in perennially bumping their heads on what amounts to a glass ceiling .
in the next couple of seasons , bremen and stuttgart are likely to find themselves in the same situation with respect to stars diego and mario gomez as hamburg was with van der vaart .
bayern munich , alone , is capable of not only signing but retaining players of the top caliber .
so why have the rest of the bundesliga 's ambitious sides become so unattractive ?
money + success = more success bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : bayern 's record of achievement attracts the big names real madrid is one of the wealthiest clubs in the world , and even the other giants of the game - as manchester united are finding out right now with cristiano ronaldo - have a hard time staving off the spaniards ' advances when a player has caught their fancy .
but perhaps more important than money is the fact that no bundesliga side other than bayern has been able to establish its credentials as a regular contender for the prize of prizes - a champions league title .
that 's down to bayern 's double-advantage policy of buying up stars from other bundesliga clubs , simultaneously strengthening their own squad while weakening their domestic rivals .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : leverkusen fell apart when ballack turned his back on them case in point : bayer leverkusen .
in 2002 , they reached the champions league final , losing somewhat unluckily to real madrid .
as a club backed by the financial might of germany 's biggest pharmaceutical company , they looked like a decent bet to jump into europe 's elite .
instead bayern lured two of leverkusen 's mainstays , midfielders michael ballack and ze roberto , into jumping ship .
as a result , bayer leverkusen barely avoided relegation in 2003 and has never even qualified for the champions league again .
moreover , within that time span , no other german team other than those two has made a champions league semifinal , let alone a final .
and that 's what club soccer is all about for the world 's best .
so while bayern contends for glory year in , year out with the likes of frank ribery , luca toni and miroslav klose , clubs like hamburg are fated to losing players of van der vaart 's caliber , just as they should be poised to make the jump to the next level . jefferson chase send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

the goal is to reduce expensive energy imports . a german plan to extending the use of the country 's nuclear power plants beyond the set phase-out period in 2020 is more concrete than expected , der tagesspiegel newspaper reported tuesday , aug .
5 .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : will merkel , left , and glos , sign off on the paper ?
german economics minister michael glos recently set up an expert group called the political energy program , or pepp , consisting of top scientists and economy ministry officials .
the committee has come out in favor of an “ atomic energy use law , ” which has a complete framework and is set to be reviewed by the chancellery this fall .
“ turning back from the plan to phase out nuclear energy makes ecological and economic sense , and we recommend it , ” the scientist group wrote in the paper , according to tagesspiegel .
the paper recommends extending the planned use of german atomic plants by eight years , from a current 32 years up to “ at least 40 years . ” if not , in 10 years germans will need to generate twice as much energy from expensive gas as they do today , the experts warned .
committee urges swift action this would create “ many billions of euros ” in extra costs for consumers , given the soaring prices of natural gas , the paper said .
to avoid this , a decision must be made " as quickly as possible - at latest , at the beginning of the next legislative period , " to revoke the existing nuclear phase-out law , ” the pepp authors wrote .
under the previous red-green government , germany passed a law requiring a total decommissioning of nuclear power plants by 2021 .
to relieve pressure on consumers in the short term , the paper recommends political support for cheaper energy , using a calculation based on atomic energy prices .
this would have a “ social component , ” the authors wrote , and would also help publicize the cost advantages of nuclear energy .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : foreign natural gas is increasingly expensive this , in turn , would help make public discourse on nuclear energy “ more objective , ” according to pepp .
plan advocates voluntary investment of profits shortly before the summer legislative recess , the german cabinet assigned glos to examine the effect of the global energy crisis on the german economy , and to present solutions for an efficient , secure and cost-effective energy policy .
as part of that effort glos formed the pepp group .
according to tagesspiegel , glos has yet to officially sign off on the paper .
in the paper , pepp suggested that any profits the nuclear plants make by staying open longer should be set aside in a foundation , and be used to invest in energy efficiency , energy research and renewable energies .
the foundations should n't be mandated by legislation , but should take place in “ a framework of voluntary agreements . ”
they also said it is crucial to investigate possible terminal storage areas for atomic waste , with the “ aim of finding a solution . ” dw staff -lrb- jen -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

these were among the events collectively known as the german autumn , which also included a series of terrorist attacks and the west german government 's response .

german economics minister michael glos recently set up an expert group called the political energy program , or pepp , consisting of top scientists and economy ministry officials .
the committee has come out in favor of an “ atomic energy use law , ” which has a complete framework and is set to be reviewed by the chancellery this fall .
“ turning back from the plan to phase out nuclear energy makes ecological and economic sense , and we recommend it , ” the scientist group wrote in the paper , according to tagesspiegel .
the paper recommends extending the planned use of german atomic plants by eight years , from a current 32 years up to “ at least 40 years . ” if not , in 10 years germans will need to generate twice as much energy from expensive gas as they do today , the experts warned .
committee urges swift action this would create “ many billions of euros ” in extra costs for consumers , given the soaring prices of natural gas , the paper said .
to avoid this , a decision must be made " as quickly as possible - at latest , at the beginning of the next legislative period , " to revoke the existing nuclear phase-out law , ” the pepp authors wrote .
under the previous red-green government , germany passed a law requiring a total decommissioning of nuclear power plants by 2021 .
to relieve pressure on consumers in the short term , the paper recommends political support for cheaper energy , using a calculation based on atomic energy prices .
this would have a “ social component , ” the authors wrote , and would also help publicize the cost advantages of nuclear energy .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : foreign natural gas is increasingly expensive this , in turn , would help make public discourse on nuclear energy “ more objective , ” according to pepp .
plan advocates voluntary investment of profits shortly before the summer legislative recess , the german cabinet assigned glos to examine the effect of the global energy crisis on the german economy , and to present solutions for an efficient , secure and cost-effective energy policy .
as part of that effort glos formed the pepp group .
according to tagesspiegel , glos has yet to officially sign off on the paper .
in the paper , pepp suggested that any profits the nuclear plants make by staying open longer should be set aside in a foundation , and be used to invest in energy efficiency , energy research and renewable energies .
the foundations should n't be mandated by legislation , but should take place in “ a framework of voluntary agreements . ”

" there are no plans to purchase a fighter drone for the bundeswehr , " a spokesman for the german defense ministry in berlin said .
the defense security cooperation agency -lrb- dsca -rrb- notified congress that germany had requested a possible sale of five of the unmanned combat aircraft while italy had asked for four .
the sale of the hunter-killer drones was valued at up to $ 330 million -lrb- 212 million euros -rrb- for italy , as the agreement would include five years of maintenance support .
germany 's sale , which includes just one year of maintenance support , was estimated at $ 205 million .

the reaper , which can carry four hellfire missiles and two 500-pound laser guided bombs , can fly faster , higher , farther and carry more weapons than its predecessor , according to lieutenant general gary north , the commander of us air forces in the middle east .

the bloc wants to see the tobacco industry develop products that go out if they 're not being smoked - it 's not at all a new idea . brussels says a new generation of cigarettes could dramatically reduce the number of deaths by fires .
" by introducing self-extinguishing cigarettes , at least 2,000 lives could be saved in the eu each year , " the bloc 's commissioner for consumer affairs told german newspaper die welt .
the german fire departments ' association was quick to greet the initiatives , saying some 200 of the 600 people who die by fire in germany each year are killed by flames originally caused by smoldering butts .
" if the self-extinguishing cigarette can contribute to reducing this number , its introduction has to be seen positively , " association spokeswoman silvia darmstaedter told dw-world.de. a spokesman for the eu standardization commission also told reporters he thought that " fire-safe " cigs could be made mandatory by the year 2011 .
ironic name , old idea bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the new cigs could help reduce forest fires throughout europe self-extinguishing cigarettes draw on a technology that developers , presumably with a sense of humor , call reduced ignition propensity - or rip .
bands of cellulose or alginate are put into the cigarette paper so that the burning tobacco goes out if not puffed on .
the concept has been kicking around for quite some time .
patents for self-extinguishing cigarettes were granted in the 1930s .
american cigarette makers philip morris and rj reynolds developed " fire-safe " models in the 1980s but did not , in general , market them .
" what is very important is that consumers should understand that those changes do not make fire-safe or even fire-safer cigarettes , " elfriede buben , external communications manager for philip morris germany , told dw-radio .
" anything that burns , if handled carelessly , can cause a fire . "
several american states , including new york , massachusetts and california limit the sale of cigarettes to rip models .
now the eu could follow their lead .
advantage for smokers bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the industry has prefered to make cigarettes that continue burning it is questionable whether technology and legislation are needed to solve the problem .
as smokers know , cigars , pipe tobacco and hand-rolled cigarettes tend to go out on their own .
that 's because regular cigarettes contain burning agents to keep them lit .
" the elimination of burning agents in cigarette paper would be a simple and effective means of dramatically reducing the ignition propensity of cigarettes , " wrote simon chapman , a professor of public health at the university sydney , in a 2004 australian medical journal .
but if self-extinguishing cigarettes do become the mandatory eu norm , smokers may benefit financially .
after all a cigarette that burns down to the filter has to be replaced - whereas one that goes out on its own can always be relit . dw staff -lrb- jc -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

on the table in his front room , driton gerguri opens a red album , like a family heirloom .
" other kids collected stamps , but i collected these , " he says proudly .
page after page of carefully mounted badges and tie pins , from sporting events and factories , anniversaries and celebrations .
each is like a crumb of the common life that people of different nationalities used to live in the old yugoslavia .
taken together , the album is like a carefully preserved cake of a bygone world .
driton and his family too are like rare items in a collector 's scrapbook - one of the last albanian families in the mikronaselje neighbourhood , in serb-dominated northern mitrovica .
nearly 300 albanian families lived in this part of town before the war .
now there are only 58 .
" there have been very sad periods , " driton says .
" during the war -lsb- 1998-99 -rsb- many people fled , and we witnessed the burning of many houses . "

diverse residents so they stayed .
the great complication for them , as for many families in this divided town , was the bridge over the river ibar , linking the mainly serbian north to the mainly albanian south .
during the worst days , demonstrators , police , and nato soldiers regularly fought on the bridge , which the girls needed to cross in order to get to school .
their oldest daughter , besarta , was only 10 then .
her parents took the difficult decision to send her to stay with her aunt in relatively peaceful pristina .
sometimes they did not see her for months on end .
besarta repaid their trust by studying hard .
this summer , she is on a scholarship in new jersey .
mitrovica is quieter now , but trouble can flare up at any time . "

driton gerguri their second daughter mediwa , 17 , crosses the main bridge , or the footbridge nearby , each day to school in the south .
the two youngest children , mohammed , 10 , and sumea , 13 , go to school in the north .
" this was always a mixed neighbourhood .
no-one ever asked ' what is he or she ? " ' says driton , remembering the pre-war days .
driton worked until 1990 in the grand hotel in pristina , as a cashier in the casino .
he was fired in 1990 , as the nationalism of milosevic 's serbia grew .
" more and more racketeers were staying in the hotel , " he remembers .
today , he runs a funeral service , on the southern , albanian side of the river .
his wife shadije started as a translator , then became a judge in the un-run courthouse in mitrovica .
but the court - another focal point of clashes - has been closed since february , so now she has to travel to vucitrn , the next town on the road to pristina , to go to work .
as we talk , there is a sudden commotion on the street outside .
a kitten has climbed up into the gutter of a neighbouring house and got stuck .
children come running from all directions .
serbs and albanians , and the town 's other minorities - bosniaks , turks and roma .
alarmed by so many spectators , the kitten eventually leaps to safety .
" what i like about mitrovica , is that i know a lot of people .

i stop and talk to so many people , " says driton .
" if i go to a restaurant , and ca n't pay the bill , i can always pay later . "
' endless stress ' inside the bathroom of their house , water containers are everywhere , full to the brim .
while northern mitrovica is spared the power cuts which plague the rest of the country , the problem here is running water .
there are other discomforts .
an ambulance can not come from south to north without a police or nato escort .
relatives and friends from the south are afraid to visit them .
the psychological pressure is always high .
especially at times of major political events - the independence declaration in february , or the setting up of a serb parliament at the end of june .
before we leave , driton shows me some of the prizes from his badge collection .
a squirrel with a rainbow tail from the winter olympics in sarajevo in 1984 .

once upon a time there was a town named after josip broz tito , yugoslav leader from 1945 to 1980 , in every republic and province of yugoslavia .

on the table in his front room , driton gerguri opens a red album , like a family heirloom .
" other kids collected stamps , but i collected these , " he says proudly .
page after page of carefully mounted badges and tie pins , from sporting events and factories , anniversaries and celebrations .
each is like a crumb of the common life that people of different nationalities used to live in the old yugoslavia .
taken together , the album is like a carefully preserved cake of a bygone world .
the badges are relics of a country that disappeared in 1991 enlarge image driton and his family too are like rare items in a collector 's scrapbook - one of the last albanian families in the mikronaselje neighbourhood , in serb-dominated northern mitrovica .
nearly 300 albanian families lived in this part of town before the war .
now there are only 58 .
" there have been very sad periods , " driton says .
" during the war -lsb- 1998-99 -rsb- many people fled , and we witnessed the burning of many houses . "
but as the albanians who used to form the majority of the population in northern mitrovica were driven out , the gerguris clung on .
" we were very lucky .
none of our close relatives were killed , or murdered , or died . "
he uses all three verbs .
" two things stopped us leaving .
we did n't know where to go , and even how safe it would be to travel .
and secondly , my mother suffered from diabetes .
it would have been very hard to move her . "
diverse residents so they stayed .
the great complication for them , as for many families in this divided town , was the bridge over the river ibar , linking the mainly serbian north to the mainly albanian south .
during the worst days , demonstrators , police , and nato soldiers regularly fought on the bridge , which the girls needed to cross in order to get to school .
their oldest daughter , besarta , was only 10 then .
her parents took the difficult decision to send her to stay with her aunt in relatively peaceful pristina .
sometimes they did not see her for months on end .
besarta repaid their trust by studying hard .
this summer , she is on a scholarship in new jersey .
mitrovica is quieter now , but trouble can flare up at any time .
if a man ca n't afford to buy food for his family , or a toy for his child , how can he enjoy sitting and talking ?
driton gerguri their second daughter mediwa , 17 , crosses the main bridge , or the footbridge nearby , each day to school in the south .
the two youngest children , mohammed , 10 , and sumea , 13 , go to school in the north .
" this was always a mixed neighbourhood .
no-one ever asked ' what is he or she ? " ' says driton , remembering the pre-war days .
driton worked until 1990 in the grand hotel in pristina , as a cashier in the casino .
he was fired in 1990 , as the nationalism of milosevic 's serbia grew .
" more and more racketeers were staying in the hotel , " he remembers .
today , he runs a funeral service , on the southern , albanian side of the river .
his wife shadije started as a translator , then became a judge in the un-run courthouse in mitrovica .
but the court - another focal point of clashes - has been closed since february , so now she has to travel to vucitrn , the next town on the road to pristina , to go to work .
as we talk , there is a sudden commotion on the street outside .
a kitten has climbed up into the gutter of a neighbouring house and got stuck .
children come running from all directions .
serbs and albanians , and the town 's other minorities - bosniaks , turks and roma .
alarmed by so many spectators , the kitten eventually leaps to safety .
" what i like about mitrovica , is that i know a lot of people .
it takes me an hour to walk down the street , into town .
i stop and talk to so many people , " says driton .
" if i go to a restaurant , and ca n't pay the bill , i can always pay later . "
' endless stress ' inside the bathroom of their house , water containers are everywhere , full to the brim .
while northern mitrovica is spared the power cuts which plague the rest of the country , the problem here is running water .
there are other discomforts .
an ambulance can not come from south to north without a police or nato escort .
relatives and friends from the south are afraid to visit them .
the gerguri family have faced many challenges the psychological pressure is always high .
especially at times of major political events - the independence declaration in february , or the setting up of a serb parliament at the end of june .
before we leave , driton shows me some of the prizes from his badge collection .
a squirrel with a rainbow tail from the winter olympics in sarajevo in 1984 .
" kosovo my desire " , written in slovenian , from 1980 .
once upon a time there was a town named after josip broz tito , yugoslav leader from 1945 to 1980 , in every republic and province of yugoslavia .
and in kosovo , this was titovska mitrovica .
" he was supposed to visit the town in his famous blue train in 1978 , " remembers driton .
" we waited for hours at the railway station to wave .
when the trip was cancelled at the last minute , we cried all day . "
" until recently , i was a community leader here , with a serb , " he explains .
" we met so many donors .
they organised so many seminars .
when all we needed was basic services - and work . "
when he realised that he could n't fulfil any of the hopes his community placed in him , he quit .
" if a man ca n't afford to buy food for his family , or a toy for his child , how can he enjoy sitting and talking ? "
the people of mitrovica deserve something better than " this endless stress " , he concludes , adding that politicians could be part of the problem , rather than the solution .
" i sometimes have the impression that the international community , together with local leaders , are the ones who are keeping this town divided . "

page after page of carefully mounted badges and tie pins , from sporting events and factories , anniversaries and celebrations .
each is like a crumb of the common life that people of different nationalities used to live in the old yugoslavia .
taken together , the album is like a carefully preserved cake of a bygone world .
the badges are relics of a country that disappeared in 1991 enlarge image driton and his family too are like rare items in a collector 's scrapbook - one of the last albanian families in the mikronaselje neighbourhood , in serb-dominated northern mitrovica .
nearly 300 albanian families lived in this part of town before the war .
now there are only 58 .
" there have been very sad periods , " driton says .
" during the war -lsb- 1998-99 -rsb- many people fled , and we witnessed the burning of many houses . "
but as the albanians who used to form the majority of the population in northern mitrovica were driven out , the gerguris clung on .
" we were very lucky .
none of our close relatives were killed , or murdered , or died . "
he uses all three verbs .
" two things stopped us leaving .
we did n't know where to go , and even how safe it would be to travel .
and secondly , my mother suffered from diabetes .
it would have been very hard to move her . "
diverse residents so they stayed .
the great complication for them , as for many families in this divided town , was the bridge over the river ibar , linking the mainly serbian north to the mainly albanian south .
during the worst days , demonstrators , police , and nato soldiers regularly fought on the bridge , which the girls needed to cross in order to get to school .
their oldest daughter , besarta , was only 10 then .
her parents took the difficult decision to send her to stay with her aunt in relatively peaceful pristina .
sometimes they did not see her for months on end .
besarta repaid their trust by studying hard .
this summer , she is on a scholarship in new jersey .
mitrovica is quieter now , but trouble can flare up at any time .
if a man ca n't afford to buy food for his family , or a toy for his child , how can he enjoy sitting and talking ?
driton gerguri their second daughter mediwa , 17 , crosses the main bridge , or the footbridge nearby , each day to school in the south .
the two youngest children , mohammed , 10 , and sumea , 13 , go to school in the north .
" this was always a mixed neighbourhood .
no-one ever asked ' what is he or she ? " ' says driton , remembering the pre-war days .
driton worked until 1990 in the grand hotel in pristina , as a cashier in the casino .
he was fired in 1990 , as the nationalism of milosevic 's serbia grew .
" more and more racketeers were staying in the hotel , " he remembers .
today , he runs a funeral service , on the southern , albanian side of the river .
his wife shadije started as a translator , then became a judge in the un-run courthouse in mitrovica .
but the court - another focal point of clashes - has been closed since february , so now she has to travel to vucitrn , the next town on the road to pristina , to go to work .
as we talk , there is a sudden commotion on the street outside .
a kitten has climbed up into the gutter of a neighbouring house and got stuck .
children come running from all directions .
serbs and albanians , and the town 's other minorities - bosniaks , turks and roma .
alarmed by so many spectators , the kitten eventually leaps to safety .
" what i like about mitrovica , is that i know a lot of people .
it takes me an hour to walk down the street , into town .
i stop and talk to so many people , " says driton .
" if i go to a restaurant , and ca n't pay the bill , i can always pay later . "
' endless stress ' inside the bathroom of their house , water containers are everywhere , full to the brim .
while northern mitrovica is spared the power cuts which plague the rest of the country , the problem here is running water .
there are other discomforts .
an ambulance can not come from south to north without a police or nato escort .
relatives and friends from the south are afraid to visit them .
the gerguri family have faced many challenges the psychological pressure is always high .
especially at times of major political events - the independence declaration in february , or the setting up of a serb parliament at the end of june .
before we leave , driton shows me some of the prizes from his badge collection .
a squirrel with a rainbow tail from the winter olympics in sarajevo in 1984 .
" kosovo my desire " , written in slovenian , from 1980 .
once upon a time there was a town named after josip broz tito , yugoslav leader from 1945 to 1980 , in every republic and province of yugoslavia .
and in kosovo , this was titovska mitrovica .
" he was supposed to visit the town in his famous blue train in 1978 , " remembers driton .
" we waited for hours at the railway station to wave .
when the trip was cancelled at the last minute , we cried all day . "
" until recently , i was a community leader here , with a serb , " he explains .
" we met so many donors .
they organised so many seminars .
when all we needed was basic services - and work . "
when he realised that he could n't fulfil any of the hopes his community placed in him , he quit .
" if a man ca n't afford to buy food for his family , or a toy for his child , how can he enjoy sitting and talking ? "
the people of mitrovica deserve something better than " this endless stress " , he concludes , adding that politicians could be part of the problem , rather than the solution .
" i sometimes have the impression that the international community , together with local leaders , are the ones who are keeping this town divided . "

" the illumination of these two historically-important structures will have a significant visual impact and highlight an interesting and important part of pontypridd 's past , " he said .
the iconic old bridge over the river taff was believed to be the longest single-span bridge in the world when it was built by william edwards in 1756 .
lido the bridge standing today was edwards 's third attempt after previous efforts had failed .
the stone railway viaduct over the river rhondda was built by one of britain 's most renowned engineers , isambard kingdom brunel , in 1837 .
it cost £ 190 and helped create a direct rail link between merthyr and cardiff .
other plans to regenerate pontypridd include reopening the lido in ynysangharad park and building a new shopping centre on the site of the taff vale precinct .

the number of repossessions is also rising and one scottish estate agent believes house prices have now fallen by up to 15 % as a result .
bbc scotland business correspondent hayley millar reports .
glasgow 's quality hotel is becoming a mecca for bargain hunters .
this is where countrywide holds its scottish property auction and auctioneer paul bridgeman says repossessed properties are now making a regular appearance .
" we 've seen an increase in repossessions in line with market trends , " he explained .
" it 's about 45 % to 50 % of the properties sold here .
this time last year , repossessions were probably only around 30 % . "
at countrywide 's most recent auction , a waterfront flat in leith sold for £ 152,000 .
it was bought for £ 289,000 just two years ago .
flats like this may have been bought as buy-to-let investments rather than primary homes , but either way , they are examples of people not being able to meet their mortgage payments .
in the past 12 months , lenders who had relied on financial markets to fund their mortgage books , have come a cropper .
lending squeeze banks now have less money to lend so they are choosier about whom they lend it to - 100 % loan-to-value ratios have disappeared .
crawford mccaughie , from the dunfermline building society , is the council of mortgage lenders ' spokesman in scotland and he says that 80 % is now the norm in scotland .
he said : " there are no signs of the securitisation markets opening .
something major needs to happen to kick-start the mortgage industry , perhaps not back to the levels that we saw in 2005 to 2007 , but perhaps back to a level that would support the economic growth of the country . "
the change of circumstance in the mortgage market has hit scotland 's housing market .
transactions are down by about 50 % and now house prices are falling too .
bill cullens , managing director of estate agents clyde property , believes the housing market has already seen a correction .
" people need to accept that there has been a correction of between 12 % and 15 % in prices depending on where you are , " he said .
" i think they have gone as far as they need to go .
prices are now down at 2005 levels . "
the housing slow-down is now having a wider impact .
housebuilders are stopping many new developments and thousands of jobs are going as a result .

the number of repossessions is also rising and one scottish estate agent believes house prices have now fallen by up to 15 % as a result .
bbc scotland business correspondent hayley millar reports .
glasgow 's quality hotel is becoming a mecca for bargain hunters .
the market has seen a continued period of slow-down this is where countrywide holds its scottish property auction and auctioneer paul bridgeman says repossessed properties are now making a regular appearance .
" we 've seen an increase in repossessions in line with market trends , " he explained .
" it 's about 45 % to 50 % of the properties sold here .
this time last year , repossessions were probably only around 30 % . "
at countrywide 's most recent auction , a waterfront flat in leith sold for £ 152,000 .
it was bought for £ 289,000 just two years ago .
flats like this may have been bought as buy-to-let investments rather than primary homes , but either way , they are examples of people not being able to meet their mortgage payments .
in the past 12 months , lenders who had relied on financial markets to fund their mortgage books , have come a cropper .
lending squeeze banks now have less money to lend so they are choosier about whom they lend it to - 100 % loan-to-value ratios have disappeared .
crawford mccaughie , from the dunfermline building society , is the council of mortgage lenders ' spokesman in scotland and he says that 80 % is now the norm in scotland .
he said : " there are no signs of the securitisation markets opening .
something major needs to happen to kick-start the mortgage industry , perhaps not back to the levels that we saw in 2005 to 2007 , but perhaps back to a level that would support the economic growth of the country . "
bill cullens , from clyde property , says prices are at 2005 levels the change of circumstance in the mortgage market has hit scotland 's housing market .
transactions are down by about 50 % and now house prices are falling too .
bill cullens , managing director of estate agents clyde property , believes the housing market has already seen a correction .
" people need to accept that there has been a correction of between 12 % and 15 % in prices depending on where you are , " he said .
" i think they have gone as far as they need to go .
prices are now down at 2005 levels . "
the housing slow-down is now having a wider impact .
housebuilders are stopping many new developments and thousands of jobs are going as a result .
