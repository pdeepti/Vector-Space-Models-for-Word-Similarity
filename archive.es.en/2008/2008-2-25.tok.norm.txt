the first-ever coalition at state level between the green party and angela merkel 's conservatives could be on the cards after the christian democrats lost their absolute majority in hamburg . incumbent mayor ole von beust -lrb- cdu -rrb- has said he is planning to hold a first round of coalition talks with both the green party and the social democrats -lrb- spd -rrb- respectively .
the heads of the two parties signaled on sunday , feb .
24 , that they would , at least , tolerate this mould-breaking coalition .
hamburg 's mayor welcomed this shift .
" i am generally glad that thinking has become more open . "
he also added in his interview with the german broadcaster ndr that chancellor angela merkel had given him a free hand to decide with which party to form a coalition .
referring to a possible coalition with the greens , von beust said it would be interesting .
" but the agenda has got to be right , " he stressed .

bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : final results wo n't actually be out until wednesday the leader of hamburg 's greens , christa goetsch , has , however , expressed reservations , saying that she saw little common ground .
local green party members are set to decide on the matter on thursday .
preliminary results from the city state give von beust 42.6 percent , down from 47 percent four years ago .
according to exit polls , the center-left spd gained 34.1 percent , increasing their share of the vote by 4 percent .
the greens dropped from 12.3 to 9.6 percent .
the free-market liberal free democrats did not make the 5-percent hurdle required to enter parliament , while the left party established its presence after taking a 6.4-percent share of the vote .
conventional choices impossible bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : hamburg 's results could affect berlin the results mean that neither the conservatives nor the social democrats can form coalitions with their preferred political partners , fdp and the greens respectively . the situation is made more complicated by the fact that the exact balance of power in the state parliament will not be known until wednesday when the official final results will be announced .
the delay is linked with introduction of a new voting system in the city .
cdu secretary general ronald pofalla -lrb- cdu -rrb- said : " i believe that it would do hamburg good , if there was a coalition between the cdu and the greens . "
he told the german broadcaster n24 that it would be a good opportunity to test this combination .
" we would have the opportunity to see for a year , or a year-and-a-half how this cooperation works . "
at the same time , pofalla stressed in an interview with the radio station bayrischer rundfunk that this did not undermine the future of the current grand coalition between the spd and the conservatives .
" there we have a responsibility to the state , " he said .
green party chairman reinhard buetikofer said the greens would talk to hamburg 's mayor , " if ole von beust wants to talk to us " .
but he warned : " no one should imagine that the greens will form a prop for a mayor , who has lost his majority , and wants to continue his previous policies . "
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : some commentators accuse beck of clumsiness christa sager , a green member of parliament for hamburg , has also spoken out in favor of exploratory talks .
she also blamed the left party for splitting the left-wing vote and preventing the removal of the conservatives altogether .
" the left party has stopped the spd and the green party gaining a majority . "
mathematically speaking , a coalition between the spd , the greens and the left party would be possible in the northern german city , but this has been ruled out by the spd 's top candidate , michael naumann .
kurt beck criticized for possibly ill-timed comments he has criticized national party chairman kurt beck for scaring off some voters by raising the possibility of tacit cooperation with the left party in the state of hesse , where a government has still not been formed four weeks after the vote .
up to now , the social democrats have strictly ruled out working with the party - a broad far-left grouping that includes disaffected former social democrats and former east german communists - in western germany .
several coalitions exist in eastern germany , including in the capital , berlin .
the rise of the party is currently causing a considerable shake-up in germany 's political landscape .
while the last three state elections have seen a swing to the left , this has not translated into a straightforward rise in support for the social democrats .

24 , confirming a voter swing to the left ahead of federal elections next year . preliminary results from the hamburg election gave no clear indication of what coalition of party 's would have the best chance to lead the port city . christian democrat -lrb- cdu -rrb- ole von beust , a merkel ally who has ruled hamburg since 2001 , won 42.6 percent of the vote , down from 47 percent four years ago , initial results showed . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : mayor beust may soon be wooing the greens the cdu will remain the strongest single party in the state legislature , but without the absolute majority it once enjoyed . the center-left social democrats -lrb- spd -rrb- scored 34.1 percent according to the exit poll , which represents almost a four-point jump in comparison to last elections . " we are the future of germany , " said spd national leader kurt beck after the vote .
" this election proved that our concerns - social justice and economic success - are those of voters . " the vote in the northern city-state was seen as a key test of whether chancellor angela merkel can stem a swing to the political left ahead of next year 's national ballot .
merkel remains highly popular in germany , but her party has seen its support dip in three consecutive state elections this year . another victory for the left with 6.4 percent , the left party - which came out of a merger between a splinter group of disgruntled spd supporters and the heirs of the east german communist party - will take up seats in the hamburg parliament for the first time after gaining entry to three other western german legislature in the past year . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the left now has seats in 10 of germany 's 16 state legislatures the greens , which took 12.3 percent last time , landed at 9.6 percent , while the liberal fdp , which failed to enter the legislature four years ago , increased their share of the vote , but at 4.7 percent still failed to reach the 5-percent hurdle . observers predicted that forming a governing coalition in the port city would be difficult .
neither the conservatives nor the social democrats will be able to form coalitions with their preferred political partners , fdp and the greens , respectively . the conservatives could stay in power if they formed a coalition with the spd - akin to the " grand coalition " on the federal level .

it would be the first conservative-green party coalition on a state level in germany . at the same time , the spd could - purely mathematically speaking - form the necessary majority with the greens and the left party . campaign issues school reform , environmental policy and expanding the harbor were among the top campaign issues , and the left has managed to garner support with its stress on social justice . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : spd 's michael naumann has ruled out a coalition with the left party but the left party , despite its increasing popularity , is still cold-shouldered by most established political groupings and by many traditional spd voters . a survey published by the sunday edition of the mass circulation daily bild newspaper said spd supporters were so strongly opposed to a pact with the ex-communists that one in four would demand party chief kurt beck 's departure . the spd 's candidate in hamburg , michael naumann , has insisted he would rather remain in opposition than rule with the left , telling reporters : " we will not work with them so we would like to tell voters that every vote for the left is a lost vote .

24 , confirming a voter swing to the left ahead of federal elections next year . preliminary results from the hamburg election gave no clear indication of what coalition of party 's would have the best chance to lead the port city . christian democrat -lrb- cdu -rrb- ole von beust , a merkel ally who has ruled hamburg since 2001 , won 42.6 percent of the vote , down from 47 percent four years ago , initial results showed . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : mayor beust may soon be wooing the greens the cdu will remain the strongest single party in the state legislature , but without the absolute majority it once enjoyed . the center-left social democrats -lrb- spd -rrb- scored 34.1 percent according to the exit poll , which represents almost a four-point jump in comparison to last elections . " we are the future of germany , " said spd national leader kurt beck after the vote .
" this election proved that our concerns - social justice and economic success - are those of voters . " the vote in the northern city-state was seen as a key test of whether chancellor angela merkel can stem a swing to the political left ahead of next year 's national ballot .
merkel remains highly popular in germany , but her party has seen its support dip in three consecutive state elections this year . another victory for the left with 6.4 percent , the left party - which came out of a merger between a splinter group of disgruntled spd supporters and the heirs of the east german communist party - will take up seats in the hamburg parliament for the first time after gaining entry to three other western german legislature in the past year . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the left now has seats in 10 of germany 's 16 state legislatures the greens , which took 12.3 percent last time , landed at 9.6 percent , while the liberal fdp , which failed to enter the legislature four years ago , increased their share of the vote , but at 4.7 percent still failed to reach the 5-percent hurdle . observers predicted that forming a governing coalition in the port city would be difficult .
neither the conservatives nor the social democrats will be able to form coalitions with their preferred political partners , fdp and the greens , respectively . the conservatives could stay in power if they formed a coalition with the spd - akin to the " grand coalition " on the federal level .
but what appears more likely is that they will try to overcome political differences and reach out to the greens . " i believe it would be good for hamburg and the political landscape in germany if a new combination of the cdu and greens were possible , " cdu secretary general ronald pofalla said .

last year he spent several months producing the show on site in the north of the country . dw-world.de : why does the german military produce a radio program for afghans ?
is that typical for regions where it has troops stationed ? sebastian knepper : it 's clear to the soldiers why they 're on the mission , but it 's sometimes not clear to the local people .
it 's their right to know why the german military is there and we have to explain to the people what our mission is .
our intent is to provide them with reliable and factual information .
getting trustworthy information is an important issue in becoming an open , democratic society .
that 's the reason why the german military always deploys soldiers like me to countries where they 're involved , in order to set up the kind of information structure that is found in developed countries like germany . it all started in somalia in 1993 .
the branch i work in , called operative information , has grown since then .
it 's proven to be a good way to explain to the people -lsb- where we have troops stationed -rsb- why we 're there , but also to react to actions by insurgents or terrorists groups .
we inform the people of the facts surrounding the incidents and do n't let the insurgents get in the people 's heads . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : german troops are stationed in the north we provide information they can sometimes only get from us , because there is no real infrastructure for tv or other media . what do you mean by " information ? "
the word " propaganda " certainly comes to mind with such a program . it 's like a normal radio broadcast in germany .
we provide local news from their province or town , we provide the news from around afghanistan and from all over the world .
the radio hour is divided into four quarters and there is a news section in each quarter .
we mix it up with entertainment and music . who are your listeners ? those who can receive our signal .
we have one station in the capital , kabul , and four more in the north , the territory that is run by the germans .
there are other radio stations run by our allies all over afghanistan . the illiteracy rate is quite high in afghanistan and the tv infrastructure is not as good as in europe , so radio is the easiest way to reach the people .
when soldiers go out to the villages , they give away radios that the people can use to listen to our program . so it 's popular ? it 's quite popular .
we do n't have exact figures , but the latest poll from 2005 showed that the bbc 's program is the most listened to , but the bundeswehr 's " voice of freedom " program came in second .
that represents only five years of work to create a radio program there from scratch . it sounds like a difficult job to produce a program from germany in a foreign language for people living in a different culture .
how do you overcome this challenge ? while we 're in germany , we prepare for the next region we 'll be stationed in .
it 's the soldier stationed in afghanistan who works on a daily basis on the program .
he works together with the local journalists that produce the program in the local languages - in afghanistan these are dari and pashto . we produce extra material here in germany , like a program called " world of knowledge , " with afghan refugees living here , but most of the work is done in afghanistan . who are the local journalists you partner with in afghanistan ? we have an afghan staff .
when i was there last year , we had 13 journalists working in mazar-i-sharif .
they come to work each day , except fridays , and do the program . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : radio is popular because the illiteracy rate is high , said knepper what is essential to know about afghan culture , the political situation there or the media landscape when producing a radio program that 's interesting to the people ? in afghanistan , there 's a lot more talk on the radio .
there 's also a lot of music - both afghan and western music .
but they talk for a long time .
on a german radio program , you would n't have a piece longer than 90 seconds , but in afghanistan sometimes the pieces last for three to five minutes .
maybe it 's a cultural thing - they can concentrate longer than people -lsb- in germany -rsb- . what was your daily job like ? my daily job was to get an overview of the latest local news in the region i was responsible for in the north .
we have correspondents and freelancers providing us daily with news from various provinces .
this has to be checked , and i decided which news to include in our program , as well as what kind of entertainment to use . what criteria do you have for selecting news pieces ? the pieces have to stick to our goals , which are democracy , openness and rule of law .
that is our mandate in these countries .
it was my main job to check whether the news - and the music , as well - kept with these goals . do you think the bundeswehr 's work will help establish a freer and more stable media in afghanistan in the future ? it 's the first step .
we ca n't think short-term .
in the long-term , it 's essential for an open society to have a valid media landscape .
we also contribute by engaging and educating local journalists . what did you learn during your own stay in afghanistan ? the people there are more relaxed .
they 're satisfied with much less than people here in our western society .
it 's a war-torn country and people just want to have a stable and peaceful environment to work and live in .
it was impressive to see how eager the people are for peace . click on the link below to listen to an excerpt from the dari-language news program , which reports on the opening of a new school for girls sponsored by the international security assistance force in afghanistan -lrb- isaf -rrb- . interview : kate bowen send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

last year he spent several months producing the show on site in the north of the country . dw-world.de : why does the german military produce a radio program for afghans ?
is that typical for regions where it has troops stationed ? sebastian knepper : it 's clear to the soldiers why they 're on the mission , but it 's sometimes not clear to the local people .
it 's their right to know why the german military is there and we have to explain to the people what our mission is .
our intent is to provide them with reliable and factual information .
getting trustworthy information is an important issue in becoming an open , democratic society .
that 's the reason why the german military always deploys soldiers like me to countries where they 're involved , in order to set up the kind of information structure that is found in developed countries like germany . it all started in somalia in 1993 .
the branch i work in , called operative information , has grown since then .
it 's proven to be a good way to explain to the people -lsb- where we have troops stationed -rsb- why we 're there , but also to react to actions by insurgents or terrorists groups .
we inform the people of the facts surrounding the incidents and do n't let the insurgents get in the people 's heads . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : german troops are stationed in the north we provide information they can sometimes only get from us , because there is no real infrastructure for tv or other media . what do you mean by " information ? "
the word " propaganda " certainly comes to mind with such a program . it 's like a normal radio broadcast in germany .
we provide local news from their province or town , we provide the news from around afghanistan and from all over the world .
the radio hour is divided into four quarters and there is a news section in each quarter .
we mix it up with entertainment and music . who are your listeners ? those who can receive our signal .
we have one station in the capital , kabul , and four more in the north , the territory that is run by the germans .
there are other radio stations run by our allies all over afghanistan . the illiteracy rate is quite high in afghanistan and the tv infrastructure is not as good as in europe , so radio is the easiest way to reach the people .
when soldiers go out to the villages , they give away radios that the people can use to listen to our program . so it 's popular ? it 's quite popular .
we do n't have exact figures , but the latest poll from 2005 showed that the bbc 's program is the most listened to , but the bundeswehr 's " voice of freedom " program came in second .
that represents only five years of work to create a radio program there from scratch . it sounds like a difficult job to produce a program from germany in a foreign language for people living in a different culture .
how do you overcome this challenge ? while we 're in germany , we prepare for the next region we 'll be stationed in .
it 's the soldier stationed in afghanistan who works on a daily basis on the program .
he works together with the local journalists that produce the program in the local languages - in afghanistan these are dari and pashto . we produce extra material here in germany , like a program called " world of knowledge , " with afghan refugees living here , but most of the work is done in afghanistan . who are the local journalists you partner with in afghanistan ? we have an afghan staff .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de politics -pipe- 25.02.2008 conservatives consider mould-breaking coalition with greens großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : could hamburg shake up germany 's political landscape ?
the first-ever coalition at state level between the green party and angela merkel 's conservatives could be on the cards after the christian democrats lost their absolute majority in hamburg . incumbent mayor ole von beust -lrb- cdu -rrb- has said he is planning to hold a first round of coalition talks with both the green party and the social democrats -lrb- spd -rrb- respectively .
the heads of the two parties signaled on sunday , feb .
24 , that they would , at least , tolerate this mould-breaking coalition .
hamburg 's mayor welcomed this shift .
" i am generally glad that thinking has become more open . "
he also added in his interview with the german broadcaster ndr that chancellor angela merkel had given him a free hand to decide with which party to form a coalition .
referring to a possible coalition with the greens , von beust said it would be interesting .
" but the agenda has got to be right , " he stressed .
playing hard to get ?
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : final results wo n't actually be out until wednesday the leader of hamburg 's greens , christa goetsch , has , however , expressed reservations , saying that she saw little common ground .
local green party members are set to decide on the matter on thursday .
preliminary results from the city state give von beust 42.6 percent , down from 47 percent four years ago .
according to exit polls , the center-left spd gained 34.1 percent , increasing their share of the vote by 4 percent .
the greens dropped from 12.3 to 9.6 percent .
the free-market liberal free democrats did not make the 5-percent hurdle required to enter parliament , while the left party established its presence after taking a 6.4-percent share of the vote .
conventional choices impossible bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : hamburg 's results could affect berlin the results mean that neither the conservatives nor the social democrats can form coalitions with their preferred political partners , fdp and the greens respectively . the situation is made more complicated by the fact that the exact balance of power in the state parliament will not be known until wednesday when the official final results will be announced .
the delay is linked with introduction of a new voting system in the city .
cdu secretary general ronald pofalla -lrb- cdu -rrb- said : " i believe that it would do hamburg good , if there was a coalition between the cdu and the greens . "
he told the german broadcaster n24 that it would be a good opportunity to test this combination .
" we would have the opportunity to see for a year , or a year-and-a-half how this cooperation works . "
at the same time , pofalla stressed in an interview with the radio station bayrischer rundfunk that this did not undermine the future of the current grand coalition between the spd and the conservatives .
" there we have a responsibility to the state , " he said .
green party chairman reinhard buetikofer said the greens would talk to hamburg 's mayor , " if ole von beust wants to talk to us " .
but he warned : " no one should imagine that the greens will form a prop for a mayor , who has lost his majority , and wants to continue his previous policies . "
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : some commentators accuse beck of clumsiness christa sager , a green member of parliament for hamburg , has also spoken out in favor of exploratory talks .
she also blamed the left party for splitting the left-wing vote and preventing the removal of the conservatives altogether .
" the left party has stopped the spd and the green party gaining a majority . "
mathematically speaking , a coalition between the spd , the greens and the left party would be possible in the northern german city , but this has been ruled out by the spd 's top candidate , michael naumann .
kurt beck criticized for possibly ill-timed comments he has criticized national party chairman kurt beck for scaring off some voters by raising the possibility of tacit cooperation with the left party in the state of hesse , where a government has still not been formed four weeks after the vote .
up to now , the social democrats have strictly ruled out working with the party - a broad far-left grouping that includes disaffected former social democrats and former east german communists - in western germany .
several coalitions exist in eastern germany , including in the capital , berlin .
the rise of the party is currently causing a considerable shake-up in germany 's political landscape .

its first test comes this weekend in saxony . the fifth-division match between locomotive leipzig and kickers markkleeberg on sunday , feb 24 , came under an unusual type of scrutiny .
fearing fan violence , authorities decided to watch over events outside the stadium and in the stands with a camera mounted on a 60,000 euro -lrb- $ 90,000 -rrb- miniature helicopter .
" we 're the first to employ an unmanned drone under real conditions , " saxony police president bernd merbitz told dpa news agency .
" usually we can only see the first row .
if a stone comes flying from a group of people , you ca n't tell who it was . "
authorities said they would have a state prosecutor on site at the markkleeberg stadium to analyze the images taken by the camera and decide whether arrests need to be made .
stadium fears bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : fans of lower-division , eastern german teams have a bad reputation while violence from soccer hooligans is largely under control in the upper divisions , it has repeatedly flared up in the lower leagues , where teams often lack the resources to deal with sometimes drunken crowds and ensure security .
teams from saxony , where social frustration runs relatively high , have often been at the center of the soccer-related fighting .
in late 2006 , dresden dynamo fans ran riot at a match against hertha berlin 's amateur developmental squad .
thirty-eight people were injured in battles between supporters and security guards .
action belongs on the pitch bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : conventional security methods have n't ended the problem and in february 2007 , all matches from the fifth division on down in saxony were cancelled because of doubts that the clubs concerned could keep spectators safe .
saxony police hope that by using high-tech surveillance methods they can keep the action where it belongs - on the pitch .
" we have no intention of stigmatizing true fans , " merbitz said .
" but people should n't always have to be afraid that others will run wild , if the opposing team scores a goal . "
the saxony police 's plan has attracted considerable media attention in the run up to the match this weekend , and those concerned with ending hooliganism will be watching to see whether the miniature eye-in-the-sky actually helps . dw staff -lrb- jc -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

yet one of germany 's eight remaining mines closed early after being blamed for causing earthquakes . the closure of a coal mine in the western german region of saarland did n't come as a surprise .
residents knew that the german government planned to phase out the subsidies which have propped up the industry for decades .
yet the abrupt closure saturday , feb .
23 , still came as a shock .
or maybe more of a rattle .
a small earthquake caused by the mining shook the region on saturday afternoon .
it 's unclear what caused the seismic shock , which originated in a coal mining operation more than 1 kilometer -lrb- half a mile -rrb- underground near the french border .
the earth quake was small , registering a " light " 4.0 on the richter magnitude scale .
mining era nearing an end bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : mine closures are common in germany in recent years the german government has subsidized coal mining to the tune of more than 160 billion euros -lrb- $ 237 billion -rrb- .
importing coal from abroad makes more sense than propping up domestic mining , the government has said .
the shuttering of the saarland mine is the latest in a series of closures .
last year , the german government announced it would gradually phase out coal mining , which has a 200-year tradition in germany .
germany 's eight remaining coal mines employ approximately 33,000 people .
the phase-out is planned to start in 2009 and will be finished by 2018 , with miners receiving government compensation .
residents all shook up bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the quake shook stones loose the tremor was the strongest on record in the area , rattling pictures on walls , knocking over chimneys and causing electrical outages .
a church in the border town of saarwellingen near the mine was closed to the public as a precautionary measure after the tremor shook stones loose .
after the quake , about 1,000 protestors gathered in saarwellingen to demand an end to the mining work which caused dozens of small tremors in recent months .
about 150,000 people live in the area .
they got backing from the region 's top official , premier peter mueller .
he promised that mining would not be allowed to resume if there was evidence that it could cause further earthquakes .
mueller is scheduled to meet with mining officials monday to discuss the future of mining in the area .
investigators are also expected to spend the next few days searching for the cause of the tremors .

the mine near saarwellingen is rag 's only in saarland .
essen-based rag is a group of companies which has chemical , energy and real estate holdings .
rag apologized for the recent tremors in saarland and promised to set up a claim system for those whose property was damaged in the quake .
it remains unclear if the mine will reopen .
it 's the company 's responsibility to demonstrate whether it can " unequivocally eliminate danger to life and limb , " mueller said .
" if it ca n't do that , from my point of view restarting the mining is not possible , " mueller was quoted as saying in the monday edition of the bild newspaper . dw staff -lrb- th -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

a small earthquake caused by the mining shook the region on saturday afternoon .

the first-ever coalition at state level between the green party and angela merkel 's conservatives could be on the cards after the christian democrats lost their absolute majority in hamburg . incumbent mayor ole von beust -lrb- cdu -rrb- has said he is planning to hold a first round of coalition talks with both the green party and the social democrats -lrb- spd -rrb- respectively .
the heads of the two parties signaled on sunday , feb .
24 , that they would , at least , tolerate this mould-breaking coalition .
hamburg 's mayor welcomed this shift .
" i am generally glad that thinking has become more open . "
he also added in his interview with the german broadcaster ndr that chancellor angela merkel had given him a free hand to decide with which party to form a coalition .
referring to a possible coalition with the greens , von beust said it would be interesting .
" but the agenda has got to be right , " he stressed .
playing hard to get ?

if participating nations take part , the mission would increase to 400 officers . berlin 's offer comes against a background of ongoing criticism that germany had reneged on its earlier promises to the trouble-torn country , and international calls upon germany to increase its commitments in afghanistan . foreign minister frank-walter steinmeier and interior minister wolfgang schaeuble expressed germany 's willingness to increase the number of trainers from 60 to 120 in a joint commentary published sunday , feb .

24 , confirming a voter swing to the left ahead of federal elections next year . preliminary results from the hamburg election gave no clear indication of what coalition of party 's would have the best chance to lead the port city . christian democrat -lrb- cdu -rrb- ole von beust , a merkel ally who has ruled hamburg since 2001 , won 42.6 percent of the vote , down from 47 percent four years ago , initial results showed . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : mayor beust may soon be wooing the greens the cdu will remain the strongest single party in the state legislature , but without the absolute majority it once enjoyed . the center-left social democrats -lrb- spd -rrb- scored 34.1 percent according to the exit poll , which represents almost a four-point jump in comparison to last elections . " we are the future of germany , " said spd national leader kurt beck after the vote .
" this election proved that our concerns - social justice and economic success - are those of voters . " the vote in the northern city-state was seen as a key test of whether chancellor angela merkel can stem a swing to the political left ahead of next year 's national ballot .
merkel remains highly popular in germany , but her party has seen its support dip in three consecutive state elections this year . another victory for the left with 6.4 percent , the left party - which came out of a merger between a splinter group of disgruntled spd supporters and the heirs of the east german communist party - will take up seats in the hamburg parliament for the first time after gaining entry to three other western german legislature in the past year . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the left now has seats in 10 of germany 's 16 state legislatures the greens , which took 12.3 percent last time , landed at 9.6 percent , while the liberal fdp , which failed to enter the legislature four years ago , increased their share of the vote , but at 4.7 percent still failed to reach the 5-percent hurdle . observers predicted that forming a governing coalition in the port city would be difficult .
neither the conservatives nor the social democrats will be able to form coalitions with their preferred political partners , fdp and the greens , respectively . the conservatives could stay in power if they formed a coalition with the spd - akin to the " grand coalition " on the federal level .
but what appears more likely is that they will try to overcome political differences and reach out to the greens . " i believe it would be good for hamburg and the political landscape in germany if a new combination of the cdu and greens were possible , " cdu secretary general ronald pofalla said .
it would be the first conservative-green party coalition on a state level in germany . at the same time , the spd could - purely mathematically speaking - form the necessary majority with the greens and the left party . campaign issues school reform , environmental policy and expanding the harbor were among the top campaign issues , and the left has managed to garner support with its stress on social justice . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : spd 's michael naumann has ruled out a coalition with the left party but the left party , despite its increasing popularity , is still cold-shouldered by most established political groupings and by many traditional spd voters . a survey published by the sunday edition of the mass circulation daily bild newspaper said spd supporters were so strongly opposed to a pact with the ex-communists that one in four would demand party chief kurt beck 's departure . the spd 's candidate in hamburg , michael naumann , has insisted he would rather remain in opposition than rule with the left , telling reporters : " we will not work with them so we would like to tell voters that every vote for the left is a lost vote . " hesse revisited in many ways , the hamburg vote is repeating the dramatically divisive results of the state elections in hesse on jan .
27 . the shape of a new government coalition in the state of hesse still remains unclear after stunning losses robbed angela merkel 's conservatives of their clear majority and the far left saw surprise gains . the major parties - spd and cdu - who won almost the same share of the poll in hesse - have been unwilling to form a coalition together , but have also not been able to create a majority government without making significant compromises or breaking pre-election promises . dw staff -lrb- tt -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

24 , confirming a voter swing to the left ahead of federal elections next year . preliminary results from the hamburg election gave no clear indication of what coalition of party 's would have the best chance to lead the port city . christian democrat -lrb- cdu -rrb- ole von beust , a merkel ally who has ruled hamburg since 2001 , won 42.6 percent of the vote , down from 47 percent four years ago , initial results showed . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : mayor beust may soon be wooing the greens the cdu will remain the strongest single party in the state legislature , but without the absolute majority it once enjoyed . the center-left social democrats -lrb- spd -rrb- scored 34.1 percent according to the exit poll , which represents almost a four-point jump in comparison to last elections . " we are the future of germany , " said spd national leader kurt beck after the vote .
" this election proved that our concerns - social justice and economic success - are those of voters . " the vote in the northern city-state was seen as a key test of whether chancellor angela merkel can stem a swing to the political left ahead of next year 's national ballot .
merkel remains highly popular in germany , but her party has seen its support dip in three consecutive state elections this year . another victory for the left with 6.4 percent , the left party - which came out of a merger between a splinter group of disgruntled spd supporters and the heirs of the east german communist party - will take up seats in the hamburg parliament for the first time after gaining entry to three other western german legislature in the past year . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the left now has seats in 10 of germany 's 16 state legislatures the greens , which took 12.3 percent last time , landed at 9.6 percent , while the liberal fdp , which failed to enter the legislature four years ago , increased their share of the vote , but at 4.7 percent still failed to reach the 5-percent hurdle . observers predicted that forming a governing coalition in the port city would be difficult .
neither the conservatives nor the social democrats will be able to form coalitions with their preferred political partners , fdp and the greens , respectively . the conservatives could stay in power if they formed a coalition with the spd - akin to the " grand coalition " on the federal level .
but what appears more likely is that they will try to overcome political differences and reach out to the greens . " i believe it would be good for hamburg and the political landscape in germany if a new combination of the cdu and greens were possible , " cdu secretary general ronald pofalla said .
it would be the first conservative-green party coalition on a state level in germany . at the same time , the spd could - purely mathematically speaking - form the necessary majority with the greens and the left party . campaign issues school reform , environmental policy and expanding the harbor were among the top campaign issues , and the left has managed to garner support with its stress on social justice . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : spd 's michael naumann has ruled out a coalition with the left party but the left party , despite its increasing popularity , is still cold-shouldered by most established political groupings and by many traditional spd voters . a survey published by the sunday edition of the mass circulation daily bild newspaper said spd supporters were so strongly opposed to a pact with the ex-communists that one in four would demand party chief kurt beck 's departure . the spd 's candidate in hamburg , michael naumann , has insisted he would rather remain in opposition than rule with the left , telling reporters : " we will not work with them so we would like to tell voters that every vote for the left is a lost vote . " hesse revisited in many ways , the hamburg vote is repeating the dramatically divisive results of the state elections in hesse on jan .
27 . the shape of a new government coalition in the state of hesse still remains unclear after stunning losses robbed angela merkel 's conservatives of their clear majority and the far left saw surprise gains . the major parties - spd and cdu - who won almost the same share of the poll in hesse - have been unwilling to form a coalition together , but have also not been able to create a majority government without making significant compromises or breaking pre-election promises . dw staff -lrb- tt -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

24 , confirming a voter swing to the left ahead of federal elections next year . preliminary results from the hamburg election gave no clear indication of what coalition of party 's would have the best chance to lead the port city . christian democrat -lrb- cdu -rrb- ole von beust , a merkel ally who has ruled hamburg since 2001 , won 42.6 percent of the vote , down from 47 percent four years ago , initial results showed . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : mayor beust may soon be wooing the greens the cdu will remain the strongest single party in the state legislature , but without the absolute majority it once enjoyed . the center-left social democrats -lrb- spd -rrb- scored 34.1 percent according to the exit poll , which represents almost a four-point jump in comparison to last elections . " we are the future of germany , " said spd national leader kurt beck after the vote .
" this election proved that our concerns - social justice and economic success - are those of voters . " the vote in the northern city-state was seen as a key test of whether chancellor angela merkel can stem a swing to the political left ahead of next year 's national ballot .
merkel remains highly popular in germany , but her party has seen its support dip in three consecutive state elections this year . another victory for the left with 6.4 percent , the left party - which came out of a merger between a splinter group of disgruntled spd supporters and the heirs of the east german communist party - will take up seats in the hamburg parliament for the first time after gaining entry to three other western german legislature in the past year . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the left now has seats in 10 of germany 's 16 state legislatures the greens , which took 12.3 percent last time , landed at 9.6 percent , while the liberal fdp , which failed to enter the legislature four years ago , increased their share of the vote , but at 4.7 percent still failed to reach the 5-percent hurdle . observers predicted that forming a governing coalition in the port city would be difficult .
neither the conservatives nor the social democrats will be able to form coalitions with their preferred political partners , fdp and the greens , respectively . the conservatives could stay in power if they formed a coalition with the spd - akin to the " grand coalition " on the federal level .
but what appears more likely is that they will try to overcome political differences and reach out to the greens . " i believe it would be good for hamburg and the political landscape in germany if a new combination of the cdu and greens were possible , " cdu secretary general ronald pofalla said .
it would be the first conservative-green party coalition on a state level in germany . at the same time , the spd could - purely mathematically speaking - form the necessary majority with the greens and the left party . campaign issues school reform , environmental policy and expanding the harbor were among the top campaign issues , and the left has managed to garner support with its stress on social justice . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : spd 's michael naumann has ruled out a coalition with the left party but the left party , despite its increasing popularity , is still cold-shouldered by most established political groupings and by many traditional spd voters . a survey published by the sunday edition of the mass circulation daily bild newspaper said spd supporters were so strongly opposed to a pact with the ex-communists that one in four would demand party chief kurt beck 's departure . the spd 's candidate in hamburg , michael naumann , has insisted he would rather remain in opposition than rule with the left , telling reporters : " we will not work with them so we would like to tell voters that every vote for the left is a lost vote . " hesse revisited in many ways , the hamburg vote is repeating the dramatically divisive results of the state elections in hesse on jan .
27 . the shape of a new government coalition in the state of hesse still remains unclear after stunning losses robbed angela merkel 's conservatives of their clear majority and the far left saw surprise gains . the major parties - spd and cdu - who won almost the same share of the poll in hesse - have been unwilling to form a coalition together , but have also not been able to create a majority government without making significant compromises or breaking pre-election promises . dw staff -lrb- tt -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

the greek cypriot government in the south , which is internationally recognized , is separated from the northern half of the island by a un-controlled " green line . "
the ongoing tensions have complicated the relationship between greece and turkey and been an obstacle to turkey 's efforts to join the eu .
papadopoulos ' surprising defeat bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : dimitris christofias wants to restart negotiations but cypriots signaled they were ready for a changed during the first round of presidential elections on feb .
17 .
in a surprise result , incumbent tassos papadopoulos , who had taken a hard-line stance against negotiations , was eliminated from the race .
christofias , of the communist akel party , won 53.36 percent of the votes .
his rival , ionnis kasoulides , a conservative and former foreign minister , received 46.64 percent of the votes .
after the first round of voting , the two leading candidates began courting supporters of parties which had backed papadopoulos .
christofias picked up the endorsement of three small parties after making important concessions .
christofias reportedly promised the center-right diko party of papadopoulos three ministries , including foreign affairs , and the socialist edek party two .
the deal could make it more difficult to enter into negotiations with turkish cypriots as the diko and edek parties have historically been less flexible .
experts have warned that any negotiation process that could lead to reunification will be slow and difficult .
communists score a win bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : talat has agreed to a meeting soviet-educated christofias , 62 , is the only communist leader in the 27-member eu and the first to lead cyprus .
christofias has said he will not interfere with the country 's market economy , despite his party 's leninist roots .
the election results have also worried some in the eu as christofias ' akel party has strong ties with moscow and is considered skeptical of the eu and nato .
christofias has rejected claims that he 's anti-european and said he will not nationalize the economy or do away with any international agreements .
christofias will serve a five-year term .
christofias said his first order of business would be to pursue un-mediated peace talks .
" today the public spoke . ...

green party chairman reinhard buetikofer said the greens would talk to hamburg 's mayor , " if ole von beust wants to talk to us " .

she also blamed the left party for splitting the left-wing vote and preventing the removal of the conservatives altogether .
" the left party has stopped the spd and the green party gaining a majority . "
mathematically speaking , a coalition between the spd , the greens and the left party would be possible in the northern german city , but this has been ruled out by the spd 's top candidate , michael naumann .
kurt beck criticized for possibly ill-timed comments he has criticized national party chairman kurt beck for scaring off some voters by raising the possibility of tacit cooperation with the left party in the state of hesse , where a government has still not been formed four weeks after the vote .
up to now , the social democrats have strictly ruled out working with the party - a broad far-left grouping that includes disaffected former social democrats and former east german communists - in western germany .
several coalitions exist in eastern germany , including in the capital , berlin .
the rise of the party is currently causing a considerable shake-up in germany 's political landscape .

yet one of germany 's eight remaining mines closed early after being blamed for causing earthquakes . the closure of a coal mine in the western german region of saarland did n't come as a surprise .
residents knew that the german government planned to phase out the subsidies which have propped up the industry for decades .
yet the abrupt closure saturday , feb .
23 , still came as a shock .
or maybe more of a rattle .
a small earthquake caused by the mining shook the region on saturday afternoon .
it 's unclear what caused the seismic shock , which originated in a coal mining operation more than 1 kilometer -lrb- half a mile -rrb- underground near the french border .
the earth quake was small , registering a " light " 4.0 on the richter magnitude scale .
mining era nearing an end bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : mine closures are common in germany in recent years the german government has subsidized coal mining to the tune of more than 160 billion euros -lrb- $ 237 billion -rrb- .
importing coal from abroad makes more sense than propping up domestic mining , the government has said .
the shuttering of the saarland mine is the latest in a series of closures .
last year , the german government announced it would gradually phase out coal mining , which has a 200-year tradition in germany .
germany 's eight remaining coal mines employ approximately 33,000 people .
the phase-out is planned to start in 2009 and will be finished by 2018 , with miners receiving government compensation .
residents all shook up bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the quake shook stones loose the tremor was the strongest on record in the area , rattling pictures on walls , knocking over chimneys and causing electrical outages .
a church in the border town of saarwellingen near the mine was closed to the public as a precautionary measure after the tremor shook stones loose .
after the quake , about 1,000 protestors gathered in saarwellingen to demand an end to the mining work which caused dozens of small tremors in recent months .
about 150,000 people live in the area .
they got backing from the region 's top official , premier peter mueller .
he promised that mining would not be allowed to resume if there was evidence that it could cause further earthquakes .
mueller is scheduled to meet with mining officials monday to discuss the future of mining in the area .
investigators are also expected to spend the next few days searching for the cause of the tremors .
closed for now bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : coal mining has a long tradition in germany the hilly , forested region is home to a coal mining operation run by rag deutsche steinkohle .

the mine near saarwellingen is rag 's only in saarland .
essen-based rag is a group of companies which has chemical , energy and real estate holdings .
rag apologized for the recent tremors in saarland and promised to set up a claim system for those whose property was damaged in the quake .
it remains unclear if the mine will reopen .
it 's the company 's responsibility to demonstrate whether it can " unequivocally eliminate danger to life and limb , " mueller said .
" if it ca n't do that , from my point of view restarting the mining is not possible , " mueller was quoted as saying in the monday edition of the bild newspaper . dw staff -lrb- th -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

yet one of germany 's eight remaining mines closed early after being blamed for causing earthquakes . the closure of a coal mine in the western german region of saarland did n't come as a surprise .
residents knew that the german government planned to phase out the subsidies which have propped up the industry for decades .
yet the abrupt closure saturday , feb .
23 , still came as a shock .
or maybe more of a rattle .
a small earthquake caused by the mining shook the region on saturday afternoon .
it 's unclear what caused the seismic shock , which originated in a coal mining operation more than 1 kilometer -lrb- half a mile -rrb- underground near the french border .
the earth quake was small , registering a " light " 4.0 on the richter magnitude scale .
mining era nearing an end bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : mine closures are common in germany in recent years the german government has subsidized coal mining to the tune of more than 160 billion euros -lrb- $ 237 billion -rrb- .
importing coal from abroad makes more sense than propping up domestic mining , the government has said .
the shuttering of the saarland mine is the latest in a series of closures .
last year , the german government announced it would gradually phase out coal mining , which has a 200-year tradition in germany .
germany 's eight remaining coal mines employ approximately 33,000 people .
the phase-out is planned to start in 2009 and will be finished by 2018 , with miners receiving government compensation .
residents all shook up bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the quake shook stones loose the tremor was the strongest on record in the area , rattling pictures on walls , knocking over chimneys and causing electrical outages .
a church in the border town of saarwellingen near the mine was closed to the public as a precautionary measure after the tremor shook stones loose .
after the quake , about 1,000 protestors gathered in saarwellingen to demand an end to the mining work which caused dozens of small tremors in recent months .
about 150,000 people live in the area .
they got backing from the region 's top official , premier peter mueller .
he promised that mining would not be allowed to resume if there was evidence that it could cause further earthquakes .
mueller is scheduled to meet with mining officials monday to discuss the future of mining in the area .
investigators are also expected to spend the next few days searching for the cause of the tremors .
closed for now bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : coal mining has a long tradition in germany the hilly , forested region is home to a coal mining operation run by rag deutsche steinkohle .
rag stopped mining at the site until further notice , provisionally laying off 3,600 employees .
the mine near saarwellingen is rag 's only in saarland .
essen-based rag is a group of companies which has chemical , energy and real estate holdings .
rag apologized for the recent tremors in saarland and promised to set up a claim system for those whose property was damaged in the quake .
it remains unclear if the mine will reopen .
it 's the company 's responsibility to demonstrate whether it can " unequivocally eliminate danger to life and limb , " mueller said .
" if it ca n't do that , from my point of view restarting the mining is not possible , " mueller was quoted as saying in the monday edition of the bild newspaper . dw staff -lrb- th -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

25 , it would provide information to foreign countries whose nationals are involved in the tax evasion affair . " we are going to respond to requests in this regard , " german finance ministry spokesman , thorsten albig told reporters , adding that germany would not charge foreign governments for the information . scandinavians , britons involved in tax affair ? germany 's intelligence service is reported to have paid 4.2 million euros -lrb- $ 6.22 million -rrb- to an informant , a former employee of liechtenstein banking group lgt , for an incriminating list containing the names of hundreds of people who evaded taxes by parking their money in secret bank accounts in the tiny alpine principality of liechtenstein . albig said berlin bought the information because investigators believed that " it could lead to the return of hundreds of thousands of dollars . " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : it 's not just liechtenstein 's scenic beauty that attracts the rich and famous the list is believed to contain the names of more than 700 wealthy germans as well as well-heeled tax cheats from other nations .
the disclosure has prompted a massive investigation in germany and frayed ties between berlin and liechtenstein capital , vaduz . germany 's handelsblatt business daily reported that finland , sweden and norway had signaled interest in getting their hands on the list of bank clients . joining the german crackdown on tax evaders , the british government 's tax agency said on monday it too had paid for information on secret liechtenstein bank accounts held by british citizens .
media reports said britain paid a whistleblower 100,000 pounds -lrb- 132,931 euros , $ 196,000 -rrb- for details of liechtenstein accounts held by 100 wealthy britons .
unpaid taxes in the affair could amount to as much as 100 million pounds , reports said . the financial times reported that britain had refused two years ago to pay the whistleblower but changed its mind after germany shelled out money to get similar information . the tax scandal also made waves across the atlantic as a senior us lawmaker said last week he would launch an investigation into american citizens also believed to have hid assets at lgt . high-profile victim the investigation into the tax evasion scandal , considered one of the biggest in german history , began earlier this month with raids on the home and offices of klaus zumwinkel , the high-profile boss of deutsche post , europe 's largest postal service , who is suspected of having dodged taxes to the tune of 1 million euros .
zumwinkel has since resigned his post . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : zumwinkel 's fall from grace was rapid ever since , german authorities have been conducting raids across the country on private individuals for allegedly hiding money in accounts liechtenstein 's biggest private bank , the lgt group , which specializes in setting up foundations and is owned by liechtenstein 's royal family . the affair has angered ordinary germans and sparked a heated debate about the ethics and accountability of the country 's highly-paid business elite . anger over " stolen information " equally , the german government 's payment for the incriminating information , which was allegedly stolen from the liechtenstein bank by the former lgt employee , has come under intense scrutiny . on monday , the lgt bank voiced anger at how the " stolen information " was being shared around european capitals . " apparently , the stolen data material has also been illegally disclosed , directly or indirectly , to other authorities , " the bank said in a statement .
" lgt regards such methods as being extremely offensive . " the affair has also raised questions about banking secrecy laws enjoyed by some european nations .
liechtenstein is one of only three countries on the oecd 's tax-haven black-list , alongside andorra and monaco .
germany has vowed to broaden efforts to crack down on tax evasion to countries such as switzerland , luxembourg and austria as well . switzerland and luxembourg have distanced themselves from the charges .

its first test comes this weekend in saxony . the fifth-division match between locomotive leipzig and kickers markkleeberg on sunday , feb 24 , came under an unusual type of scrutiny .
fearing fan violence , authorities decided to watch over events outside the stadium and in the stands with a camera mounted on a 60,000 euro -lrb- $ 90,000 -rrb- miniature helicopter .
" we 're the first to employ an unmanned drone under real conditions , " saxony police president bernd merbitz told dpa news agency .
" usually we can only see the first row .

teams from saxony , where social frustration runs relatively high , have often been at the center of the soccer-related fighting .
in late 2006 , dresden dynamo fans ran riot at a match against hertha berlin 's amateur developmental squad .

on sunday , feb .
24 , such a movie won an oscar for best foreign-language film . germany 's nazi past has been a recurrent theme in films made in the country in recent years .
from " downfall , " which controversially portrayed the human side of hitler , to a recent irreverent comedy about the nazi dictator called " mein führer : the truly truest truth about adolf hitler , " german films have been breaking new ground by using humor and irony to tackle issues still sensitive in the country .
the latest film , " the counterfeiters , " sheds light on a little-known chapter of nazi history . it tells the spectacular tale of the largest forgery operation of all time , conducted from within the squalor of one of hitler 's concentration camps .
for the last three years of the second world war , 142 prisoners in the sachsenhausen camp , north of berlin , were forced by their captors to counterfeit millions of british and us banknotes in an attempt to bring the enemy economies to their knees .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : a film scene depicting the wooden huts of the workshop it was an ambitious plan , but the most astonishing thing about it was the way in which it was executed .
in two shielded wooden huts within the barbed wire confines of the camp , the men - some of them were trained printers while others had experiences in counterfeiting - were granted a life of relative comfort and provided enough food , soft beds and proper toilets .
in return they used their professional expertise to forge money .

on sunday , feb .
24 , such a movie won an oscar for best foreign-language film . germany 's nazi past has been a recurrent theme in films made in the country in recent years .
from " downfall , " which controversially portrayed the human side of hitler , to a recent irreverent comedy about the nazi dictator called " mein führer : the truly truest truth about adolf hitler , " german films have been breaking new ground by using humor and irony to tackle issues still sensitive in the country .
the latest film , " the counterfeiters , " sheds light on a little-known chapter of nazi history . it tells the spectacular tale of the largest forgery operation of all time , conducted from within the squalor of one of hitler 's concentration camps .
for the last three years of the second world war , 142 prisoners in the sachsenhausen camp , north of berlin , were forced by their captors to counterfeit millions of british and us banknotes in an attempt to bring the enemy economies to their knees .

in two shielded wooden huts within the barbed wire confines of the camp , the men - some of them were trained printers while others had experiences in counterfeiting - were granted a life of relative comfort and provided enough food , soft beds and proper toilets .
in return they used their professional expertise to forge money .
a first-rate printing workshop was set up inside the two huts and the counterfeiters became part of a state secret which kept them alive while thousands of prisoners were being murdered and starved to death around them .

on sunday , feb .
24 , such a movie won an oscar for best foreign-language film . germany 's nazi past has been a recurrent theme in films made in the country in recent years .
from " downfall , " which controversially portrayed the human side of hitler , to a recent irreverent comedy about the nazi dictator called " mein führer : the truly truest truth about adolf hitler , " german films have been breaking new ground by using humor and irony to tackle issues still sensitive in the country .
the latest film , " the counterfeiters , " sheds light on a little-known chapter of nazi history . it tells the spectacular tale of the largest forgery operation of all time , conducted from within the squalor of one of hitler 's concentration camps .
for the last three years of the second world war , 142 prisoners in the sachsenhausen camp , north of berlin , were forced by their captors to counterfeit millions of british and us banknotes in an attempt to bring the enemy economies to their knees .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : a film scene depicting the wooden huts of the workshop it was an ambitious plan , but the most astonishing thing about it was the way in which it was executed .
in two shielded wooden huts within the barbed wire confines of the camp , the men - some of them were trained printers while others had experiences in counterfeiting - were granted a life of relative comfort and provided enough food , soft beds and proper toilets .
in return they used their professional expertise to forge money .
a first-rate printing workshop was set up inside the two huts and the counterfeiters became part of a state secret which kept them alive while thousands of prisoners were being murdered and starved to death around them .
the men came to call the workshop their " golden cage . "
the devil 's workshop the film , directed by austrian stefan ruzowitzky , is based on a true account of the forgery workshop as told in adolf burger 's book " des teufels werkstatt " -lrb- the devil 's workshop -rrb- .
it follows a character called salomon sorowitsch , loosely based on a notorious counterfeiter of that time named salomon smolianoff .
the existence of the concentration camp forgery mill is a relatively little-known chapter in nazi history , but the producers of " the counterfeiters , " babette schröder and nina bohlmann , immediately recognized the potential of the story when they came across burger 's book .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the sachsenhausen concentration camp schröder and bohlmann said they first read the book six years ago and thought the story would make an interesting movie .
after considering different ways of reworking the material , they approached adolf burger about adapting it for the silver screen .
they also talked to ruzowitzky , who said he was immediately drawn by the universal nature of the material .
" asking whether people should play table-tennis in a concentration camp when others around them are being tortured to death is the same as asking whether we should be allowed to live such affluent , protected lives when there is so much suffering the world , " ruzowitzky said .
issues of conscience burger worked with ruzowitzky as an advisor on the script and accompanied the production as it progressed .
although some of the historical details , such as the prisoners ' release , are not entirely in keeping with what really happened , schröder and bohlmann have tried to show the issues of conscience facing the counterfeiters .
" what fascinated us about the story was that there were two huts in the middle of this huge concentration camp in which the prisoners were allowed to live under better conditions than everyone else , " the producer-duo said .
" they knew about the atrocities on the far side of their wooden walls , they could hear it day by day , but they could n't do anything about it . "
dangerous game of sabotage bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : karl markovics plays salomon sorowitsch during their period of " privileged " imprisonment , burger and his fellow prisoners knew that if they co-operated with their captors , they stood a chance of survival , but that if they sabotaged the efforts to flood the allied economies , they would face certain death .
for some , questions of conscience were at play ; for others , the survival instinct was the greatest .
for producers schröder and bohlmann , it was the character of salomon smolinoff that was the most interesting .
author adolf burger describes in his book how the counterfeiter labored to produce the perfect dollar note .
the results however were never quite satisfactory because other prisoners were sabotaging his efforts without his knowledge , the producer-duo said .
their stalling tactics could not go on forever , and ultimately the dollar did go into production in sachsenhausen .
but by then the allies were well on their way to berlin and there was n't enough time to mass produce the counterfeited notes .
the bills they did manage to print , along with the 134 million british pounds , stamps and other forged documents are believed to have been sunk in austria 's lake toplitz .
reaching a wide audience bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : a film scene from " the counterfeiters " in a note of introduction to his book , burger states : " this book was written in order that people do n't forget what happened . "
the makers and producers of the film have taken that message to heart .
" we have to tell the stories of the holocaust , and we are morally obliged to do it in such a way that we reach as many people as possible , " ruzowitzky said .
" in that sense even a film about the holocaust should contain elements of excitement and entertainment .
' the counterfeiters ' is an entertaining film .

dangerous game of sabotage bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : karl markovics plays salomon sorowitsch during their period of " privileged " imprisonment , burger and his fellow prisoners knew that if they co-operated with their captors , they stood a chance of survival , but that if they sabotaged the efforts to flood the allied economies , they would face certain death .
for some , questions of conscience were at play ; for others , the survival instinct was the greatest .
for producers schröder and bohlmann , it was the character of salomon smolinoff that was the most interesting .
author adolf burger describes in his book how the counterfeiter labored to produce the perfect dollar note .
the results however were never quite satisfactory because other prisoners were sabotaging his efforts without his knowledge , the producer-duo said .
their stalling tactics could not go on forever , and ultimately the dollar did go into production in sachsenhausen .
but by then the allies were well on their way to berlin and there was n't enough time to mass produce the counterfeited notes .
the bills they did manage to print , along with the 134 million british pounds , stamps and other forged documents are believed to have been sunk in austria 's lake toplitz .
reaching a wide audience bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : a film scene from " the counterfeiters " in a note of introduction to his book , burger states : " this book was written in order that people do n't forget what happened . "
the makers and producers of the film have taken that message to heart .
" we have to tell the stories of the holocaust , and we are morally obliged to do it in such a way that we reach as many people as possible , " ruzowitzky said .
" in that sense even a film about the holocaust should contain elements of excitement and entertainment .
' the counterfeiters ' is an entertaining film .

25 , it would provide information to foreign countries whose nationals are involved in the tax evasion affair . " we are going to respond to requests in this regard , " german finance ministry spokesman , thorsten albig told reporters , adding that germany would not charge foreign governments for the information . scandinavians , britons involved in tax affair ? germany 's intelligence service is reported to have paid 4.2 million euros -lrb- $ 6.22 million -rrb- to an informant , a former employee of liechtenstein banking group lgt , for an incriminating list containing the names of hundreds of people who evaded taxes by parking their money in secret bank accounts in the tiny alpine principality of liechtenstein . albig said berlin bought the information because investigators believed that " it could lead to the return of hundreds of thousands of dollars . " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : it 's not just liechtenstein 's scenic beauty that attracts the rich and famous the list is believed to contain the names of more than 700 wealthy germans as well as well-heeled tax cheats from other nations .
the disclosure has prompted a massive investigation in germany and frayed ties between berlin and liechtenstein capital , vaduz . germany 's handelsblatt business daily reported that finland , sweden and norway had signaled interest in getting their hands on the list of bank clients . joining the german crackdown on tax evaders , the british government 's tax agency said on monday it too had paid for information on secret liechtenstein bank accounts held by british citizens .
media reports said britain paid a whistleblower 100,000 pounds -lrb- 132,931 euros , $ 196,000 -rrb- for details of liechtenstein accounts held by 100 wealthy britons .
unpaid taxes in the affair could amount to as much as 100 million pounds , reports said . the financial times reported that britain had refused two years ago to pay the whistleblower but changed its mind after germany shelled out money to get similar information . the tax scandal also made waves across the atlantic as a senior us lawmaker said last week he would launch an investigation into american citizens also believed to have hid assets at lgt . high-profile victim the investigation into the tax evasion scandal , considered one of the biggest in german history , began earlier this month with raids on the home and offices of klaus zumwinkel , the high-profile boss of deutsche post , europe 's largest postal service , who is suspected of having dodged taxes to the tune of 1 million euros .
zumwinkel has since resigned his post . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : zumwinkel 's fall from grace was rapid ever since , german authorities have been conducting raids across the country on private individuals for allegedly hiding money in accounts liechtenstein 's biggest private bank , the lgt group , which specializes in setting up foundations and is owned by liechtenstein 's royal family . the affair has angered ordinary germans and sparked a heated debate about the ethics and accountability of the country 's highly-paid business elite . anger over " stolen information " equally , the german government 's payment for the incriminating information , which was allegedly stolen from the liechtenstein bank by the former lgt employee , has come under intense scrutiny . on monday , the lgt bank voiced anger at how the " stolen information " was being shared around european capitals . " apparently , the stolen data material has also been illegally disclosed , directly or indirectly , to other authorities , " the bank said in a statement .
" lgt regards such methods as being extremely offensive . " the affair has also raised questions about banking secrecy laws enjoyed by some european nations .
liechtenstein is one of only three countries on the oecd 's tax-haven black-list , alongside andorra and monaco .
germany has vowed to broaden efforts to crack down on tax evasion to countries such as switzerland , luxembourg and austria as well . switzerland and luxembourg have distanced themselves from the charges .
both of the countries prohibit revealing bank information to the outside world except in criminal matters . dw staff -lrb- sp -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de southern europe -pipe- 25.02.2008 cyprus president-elect promises reunification talks großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : score one for the communists hours after the polls in cyprus closed , president-elect president dimitris christofias promised to begin reunification talks with his turkish cypriot counterpart .
yet the process is likely to be slow and difficult . in an acceptance speech before a stadium of cheering supporters after polls closed sunday , feb .
24 , christofias said he 'd already spoken with turkish cypriot leader mehmet ali talat about arranging a meeting .
" i offer a hand of friendship and cooperation to the turkish cypriots and their leadership .
i urge them to work together with us for the common good of the people in a climate of peace , " christofias said sunday .
talat , who heads the breakaway turkish republic of northern cyprus , called christofias to congratulate him shortly after his win , and the two have agreed to meet , an aide to talat told afp .
reunification became a major election theme as cypriots signaled their frustration with the former government 's unwillingness to negotiate .
christofias ' election victory has revived hopes that a peace process can be resumed .
country remains divided bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : cyprus remains visibly divided the last round of talks broke down in 2004 after greek cypriots rejected a united nations plan and joined the european union alone .
the mediterranean island , a former british colony and favorite tourist destination , has been divided since an athens-supported coup in 1974 caused the turkish government to send troops into the north .
the turkish republic of northern cyprus is recognized only by ankara , which has 30,000 troops stationed there .
the greek cypriot government in the south , which is internationally recognized , is separated from the northern half of the island by a un-controlled " green line . "
the ongoing tensions have complicated the relationship between greece and turkey and been an obstacle to turkey 's efforts to join the eu .
papadopoulos ' surprising defeat bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : dimitris christofias wants to restart negotiations but cypriots signaled they were ready for a changed during the first round of presidential elections on feb .
17 .
in a surprise result , incumbent tassos papadopoulos , who had taken a hard-line stance against negotiations , was eliminated from the race .
christofias , of the communist akel party , won 53.36 percent of the votes .
his rival , ionnis kasoulides , a conservative and former foreign minister , received 46.64 percent of the votes .
after the first round of voting , the two leading candidates began courting supporters of parties which had backed papadopoulos .
christofias picked up the endorsement of three small parties after making important concessions .
christofias reportedly promised the center-right diko party of papadopoulos three ministries , including foreign affairs , and the socialist edek party two .
the deal could make it more difficult to enter into negotiations with turkish cypriots as the diko and edek parties have historically been less flexible .
experts have warned that any negotiation process that could lead to reunification will be slow and difficult .
communists score a win bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : talat has agreed to a meeting soviet-educated christofias , 62 , is the only communist leader in the 27-member eu and the first to lead cyprus .

yet one of germany 's eight remaining mines closed early after being blamed for causing earthquakes . the closure of a coal mine in the western german region of saarland did n't come as a surprise .
residents knew that the german government planned to phase out the subsidies which have propped up the industry for decades .
yet the abrupt closure saturday , feb .
23 , still came as a shock .
or maybe more of a rattle .
a small earthquake caused by the mining shook the region on saturday afternoon .
it 's unclear what caused the seismic shock , which originated in a coal mining operation more than 1 kilometer -lrb- half a mile -rrb- underground near the french border .
the earth quake was small , registering a " light " 4.0 on the richter magnitude scale .
mining era nearing an end bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : mine closures are common in germany in recent years the german government has subsidized coal mining to the tune of more than 160 billion euros -lrb- $ 237 billion -rrb- .
importing coal from abroad makes more sense than propping up domestic mining , the government has said .
the shuttering of the saarland mine is the latest in a series of closures .
last year , the german government announced it would gradually phase out coal mining , which has a 200-year tradition in germany .
germany 's eight remaining coal mines employ approximately 33,000 people .
the phase-out is planned to start in 2009 and will be finished by 2018 , with miners receiving government compensation .
residents all shook up bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the quake shook stones loose the tremor was the strongest on record in the area , rattling pictures on walls , knocking over chimneys and causing electrical outages .
a church in the border town of saarwellingen near the mine was closed to the public as a precautionary measure after the tremor shook stones loose .
after the quake , about 1,000 protestors gathered in saarwellingen to demand an end to the mining work which caused dozens of small tremors in recent months .
about 150,000 people live in the area .
they got backing from the region 's top official , premier peter mueller .
he promised that mining would not be allowed to resume if there was evidence that it could cause further earthquakes .
mueller is scheduled to meet with mining officials monday to discuss the future of mining in the area .
investigators are also expected to spend the next few days searching for the cause of the tremors .

the mine near saarwellingen is rag 's only in saarland .
essen-based rag is a group of companies which has chemical , energy and real estate holdings .
rag apologized for the recent tremors in saarland and promised to set up a claim system for those whose property was damaged in the quake .
it remains unclear if the mine will reopen .
it 's the company 's responsibility to demonstrate whether it can " unequivocally eliminate danger to life and limb , " mueller said .

importing coal from abroad makes more sense than propping up domestic mining , the government has said .
the shuttering of the saarland mine is the latest in a series of closures .
last year , the german government announced it would gradually phase out coal mining , which has a 200-year tradition in germany .
germany 's eight remaining coal mines employ approximately 33,000 people .
the phase-out is planned to start in 2009 and will be finished by 2018 , with miners receiving government compensation .
residents all shook up bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the quake shook stones loose the tremor was the strongest on record in the area , rattling pictures on walls , knocking over chimneys and causing electrical outages .
a church in the border town of saarwellingen near the mine was closed to the public as a precautionary measure after the tremor shook stones loose .
after the quake , about 1,000 protestors gathered in saarwellingen to demand an end to the mining work which caused dozens of small tremors in recent months .
about 150,000 people live in the area .
they got backing from the region 's top official , premier peter mueller .
he promised that mining would not be allowed to resume if there was evidence that it could cause further earthquakes .
mueller is scheduled to meet with mining officials monday to discuss the future of mining in the area .
investigators are also expected to spend the next few days searching for the cause of the tremors .
closed for now bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : coal mining has a long tradition in germany the hilly , forested region is home to a coal mining operation run by rag deutsche steinkohle .
rag stopped mining at the site until further notice , provisionally laying off 3,600 employees .
the mine near saarwellingen is rag 's only in saarland .
essen-based rag is a group of companies which has chemical , energy and real estate holdings .
rag apologized for the recent tremors in saarland and promised to set up a claim system for those whose property was damaged in the quake .
it remains unclear if the mine will reopen .
it 's the company 's responsibility to demonstrate whether it can " unequivocally eliminate danger to life and limb , " mueller said .
" if it ca n't do that , from my point of view restarting the mining is not possible , " mueller was quoted as saying in the monday edition of the bild newspaper . dw staff -lrb- th -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

yet one of germany 's eight remaining mines closed early after being blamed for causing earthquakes . the closure of a coal mine in the western german region of saarland did n't come as a surprise .
residents knew that the german government planned to phase out the subsidies which have propped up the industry for decades .
yet the abrupt closure saturday , feb .
23 , still came as a shock .
or maybe more of a rattle .
a small earthquake caused by the mining shook the region on saturday afternoon .
it 's unclear what caused the seismic shock , which originated in a coal mining operation more than 1 kilometer -lrb- half a mile -rrb- underground near the french border .
the earth quake was small , registering a " light " 4.0 on the richter magnitude scale .
mining era nearing an end bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : mine closures are common in germany in recent years the german government has subsidized coal mining to the tune of more than 160 billion euros -lrb- $ 237 billion -rrb- .
importing coal from abroad makes more sense than propping up domestic mining , the government has said .
the shuttering of the saarland mine is the latest in a series of closures .
last year , the german government announced it would gradually phase out coal mining , which has a 200-year tradition in germany .
germany 's eight remaining coal mines employ approximately 33,000 people .
the phase-out is planned to start in 2009 and will be finished by 2018 , with miners receiving government compensation .
residents all shook up bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the quake shook stones loose the tremor was the strongest on record in the area , rattling pictures on walls , knocking over chimneys and causing electrical outages .
a church in the border town of saarwellingen near the mine was closed to the public as a precautionary measure after the tremor shook stones loose .
after the quake , about 1,000 protestors gathered in saarwellingen to demand an end to the mining work which caused dozens of small tremors in recent months .
about 150,000 people live in the area .
they got backing from the region 's top official , premier peter mueller .
he promised that mining would not be allowed to resume if there was evidence that it could cause further earthquakes .
mueller is scheduled to meet with mining officials monday to discuss the future of mining in the area .
investigators are also expected to spend the next few days searching for the cause of the tremors .
closed for now bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : coal mining has a long tradition in germany the hilly , forested region is home to a coal mining operation run by rag deutsche steinkohle .
rag stopped mining at the site until further notice , provisionally laying off 3,600 employees .
the mine near saarwellingen is rag 's only in saarland .
essen-based rag is a group of companies which has chemical , energy and real estate holdings .
rag apologized for the recent tremors in saarland and promised to set up a claim system for those whose property was damaged in the quake .
it remains unclear if the mine will reopen .
it 's the company 's responsibility to demonstrate whether it can " unequivocally eliminate danger to life and limb , " mueller said .
" if it ca n't do that , from my point of view restarting the mining is not possible , " mueller was quoted as saying in the monday edition of the bild newspaper . dw staff -lrb- th -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

local green party members are set to decide on the matter on thursday .
preliminary results from the city state give von beust 42.6 percent , down from 47 percent four years ago .
according to exit polls , the center-left spd gained 34.1 percent , increasing their share of the vote by 4 percent .
the greens dropped from 12.3 to 9.6 percent .
the free-market liberal free democrats did not make the 5-percent hurdle required to enter parliament , while the left party established its presence after taking a 6.4-percent share of the vote .

the delay is linked with introduction of a new voting system in the city .
cdu secretary general ronald pofalla -lrb- cdu -rrb- said : " i believe that it would do hamburg good , if there was a coalition between the cdu and the greens . "
he told the german broadcaster n24 that it would be a good opportunity to test this combination .
" we would have the opportunity to see for a year , or a year-and-a-half how this cooperation works . "
at the same time , pofalla stressed in an interview with the radio station bayrischer rundfunk that this did not undermine the future of the current grand coalition between the spd and the conservatives .
" there we have a responsibility to the state , " he said .
green party chairman reinhard buetikofer said the greens would talk to hamburg 's mayor , " if ole von beust wants to talk to us " .
but he warned : " no one should imagine that the greens will form a prop for a mayor , who has lost his majority , and wants to continue his previous policies . "

she also blamed the left party for splitting the left-wing vote and preventing the removal of the conservatives altogether .

25 , it would provide information to foreign countries whose nationals are involved in the tax evasion affair . " we are going to respond to requests in this regard , " german finance ministry spokesman , thorsten albig told reporters , adding that germany would not charge foreign governments for the information . scandinavians , britons involved in tax affair ? germany 's intelligence service is reported to have paid 4.2 million euros -lrb- $ 6.22 million -rrb- to an informant , a former employee of liechtenstein banking group lgt , for an incriminating list containing the names of hundreds of people who evaded taxes by parking their money in secret bank accounts in the tiny alpine principality of liechtenstein . albig said berlin bought the information because investigators believed that " it could lead to the return of hundreds of thousands of dollars . " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : it 's not just liechtenstein 's scenic beauty that attracts the rich and famous the list is believed to contain the names of more than 700 wealthy germans as well as well-heeled tax cheats from other nations .
the disclosure has prompted a massive investigation in germany and frayed ties between berlin and liechtenstein capital , vaduz . germany 's handelsblatt business daily reported that finland , sweden and norway had signaled interest in getting their hands on the list of bank clients . joining the german crackdown on tax evaders , the british government 's tax agency said on monday it too had paid for information on secret liechtenstein bank accounts held by british citizens .
media reports said britain paid a whistleblower 100,000 pounds -lrb- 132,931 euros , $ 196,000 -rrb- for details of liechtenstein accounts held by 100 wealthy britons .
unpaid taxes in the affair could amount to as much as 100 million pounds , reports said . the financial times reported that britain had refused two years ago to pay the whistleblower but changed its mind after germany shelled out money to get similar information . the tax scandal also made waves across the atlantic as a senior us lawmaker said last week he would launch an investigation into american citizens also believed to have hid assets at lgt . high-profile victim the investigation into the tax evasion scandal , considered one of the biggest in german history , began earlier this month with raids on the home and offices of klaus zumwinkel , the high-profile boss of deutsche post , europe 's largest postal service , who is suspected of having dodged taxes to the tune of 1 million euros .
zumwinkel has since resigned his post . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : zumwinkel 's fall from grace was rapid ever since , german authorities have been conducting raids across the country on private individuals for allegedly hiding money in accounts liechtenstein 's biggest private bank , the lgt group , which specializes in setting up foundations and is owned by liechtenstein 's royal family . the affair has angered ordinary germans and sparked a heated debate about the ethics and accountability of the country 's highly-paid business elite . anger over " stolen information " equally , the german government 's payment for the incriminating information , which was allegedly stolen from the liechtenstein bank by the former lgt employee , has come under intense scrutiny . on monday , the lgt bank voiced anger at how the " stolen information " was being shared around european capitals . " apparently , the stolen data material has also been illegally disclosed , directly or indirectly , to other authorities , " the bank said in a statement .
" lgt regards such methods as being extremely offensive . " the affair has also raised questions about banking secrecy laws enjoyed by some european nations .
liechtenstein is one of only three countries on the oecd 's tax-haven black-list , alongside andorra and monaco .
germany has vowed to broaden efforts to crack down on tax evasion to countries such as switzerland , luxembourg and austria as well . switzerland and luxembourg have distanced themselves from the charges .

the first-ever coalition at state level between the green party and angela merkel 's conservatives could be on the cards after the christian democrats lost their absolute majority in hamburg . incumbent mayor ole von beust -lrb- cdu -rrb- has said he is planning to hold a first round of coalition talks with both the green party and the social democrats -lrb- spd -rrb- respectively .
the heads of the two parties signaled on sunday , feb .
24 , that they would , at least , tolerate this mould-breaking coalition .
hamburg 's mayor welcomed this shift .
" i am generally glad that thinking has become more open . "
he also added in his interview with the german broadcaster ndr that chancellor angela merkel had given him a free hand to decide with which party to form a coalition .
referring to a possible coalition with the greens , von beust said it would be interesting .
" but the agenda has got to be right , " he stressed .
playing hard to get ?
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : final results wo n't actually be out until wednesday the leader of hamburg 's greens , christa goetsch , has , however , expressed reservations , saying that she saw little common ground .
local green party members are set to decide on the matter on thursday .
preliminary results from the city state give von beust 42.6 percent , down from 47 percent four years ago .
according to exit polls , the center-left spd gained 34.1 percent , increasing their share of the vote by 4 percent .
the greens dropped from 12.3 to 9.6 percent .
the free-market liberal free democrats did not make the 5-percent hurdle required to enter parliament , while the left party established its presence after taking a 6.4-percent share of the vote .
conventional choices impossible bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : hamburg 's results could affect berlin the results mean that neither the conservatives nor the social democrats can form coalitions with their preferred political partners , fdp and the greens respectively . the situation is made more complicated by the fact that the exact balance of power in the state parliament will not be known until wednesday when the official final results will be announced .
the delay is linked with introduction of a new voting system in the city .
cdu secretary general ronald pofalla -lrb- cdu -rrb- said : " i believe that it would do hamburg good , if there was a coalition between the cdu and the greens . "
he told the german broadcaster n24 that it would be a good opportunity to test this combination .
" we would have the opportunity to see for a year , or a year-and-a-half how this cooperation works . "
at the same time , pofalla stressed in an interview with the radio station bayrischer rundfunk that this did not undermine the future of the current grand coalition between the spd and the conservatives .
" there we have a responsibility to the state , " he said .
green party chairman reinhard buetikofer said the greens would talk to hamburg 's mayor , " if ole von beust wants to talk to us " .
but he warned : " no one should imagine that the greens will form a prop for a mayor , who has lost his majority , and wants to continue his previous policies . "
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : some commentators accuse beck of clumsiness christa sager , a green member of parliament for hamburg , has also spoken out in favor of exploratory talks .
she also blamed the left party for splitting the left-wing vote and preventing the removal of the conservatives altogether .
" the left party has stopped the spd and the green party gaining a majority . "
mathematically speaking , a coalition between the spd , the greens and the left party would be possible in the northern german city , but this has been ruled out by the spd 's top candidate , michael naumann .
kurt beck criticized for possibly ill-timed comments he has criticized national party chairman kurt beck for scaring off some voters by raising the possibility of tacit cooperation with the left party in the state of hesse , where a government has still not been formed four weeks after the vote .
up to now , the social democrats have strictly ruled out working with the party - a broad far-left grouping that includes disaffected former social democrats and former east german communists - in western germany .
several coalitions exist in eastern germany , including in the capital , berlin .
the rise of the party is currently causing a considerable shake-up in germany 's political landscape .
while the last three state elections have seen a swing to the left , this has not translated into a straightforward rise in support for the social democrats .
the split in the vote is leading to parties beginning to think the previously unthinkable . dw staff -lrb- jg -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

the first-ever coalition at state level between the green party and angela merkel 's conservatives could be on the cards after the christian democrats lost their absolute majority in hamburg . incumbent mayor ole von beust -lrb- cdu -rrb- has said he is planning to hold a first round of coalition talks with both the green party and the social democrats -lrb- spd -rrb- respectively .
the heads of the two parties signaled on sunday , feb .
24 , that they would , at least , tolerate this mould-breaking coalition .
hamburg 's mayor welcomed this shift .
" i am generally glad that thinking has become more open . "
he also added in his interview with the german broadcaster ndr that chancellor angela merkel had given him a free hand to decide with which party to form a coalition .
referring to a possible coalition with the greens , von beust said it would be interesting .
" but the agenda has got to be right , " he stressed .
playing hard to get ?
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : final results wo n't actually be out until wednesday the leader of hamburg 's greens , christa goetsch , has , however , expressed reservations , saying that she saw little common ground .
local green party members are set to decide on the matter on thursday .
preliminary results from the city state give von beust 42.6 percent , down from 47 percent four years ago .
according to exit polls , the center-left spd gained 34.1 percent , increasing their share of the vote by 4 percent .
the greens dropped from 12.3 to 9.6 percent .
the free-market liberal free democrats did not make the 5-percent hurdle required to enter parliament , while the left party established its presence after taking a 6.4-percent share of the vote .
conventional choices impossible bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : hamburg 's results could affect berlin the results mean that neither the conservatives nor the social democrats can form coalitions with their preferred political partners , fdp and the greens respectively . the situation is made more complicated by the fact that the exact balance of power in the state parliament will not be known until wednesday when the official final results will be announced .
the delay is linked with introduction of a new voting system in the city .
cdu secretary general ronald pofalla -lrb- cdu -rrb- said : " i believe that it would do hamburg good , if there was a coalition between the cdu and the greens . "
he told the german broadcaster n24 that it would be a good opportunity to test this combination .
" we would have the opportunity to see for a year , or a year-and-a-half how this cooperation works . "
at the same time , pofalla stressed in an interview with the radio station bayrischer rundfunk that this did not undermine the future of the current grand coalition between the spd and the conservatives .
" there we have a responsibility to the state , " he said .
green party chairman reinhard buetikofer said the greens would talk to hamburg 's mayor , " if ole von beust wants to talk to us " .
but he warned : " no one should imagine that the greens will form a prop for a mayor , who has lost his majority , and wants to continue his previous policies . "
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : some commentators accuse beck of clumsiness christa sager , a green member of parliament for hamburg , has also spoken out in favor of exploratory talks .
she also blamed the left party for splitting the left-wing vote and preventing the removal of the conservatives altogether .
" the left party has stopped the spd and the green party gaining a majority . "
mathematically speaking , a coalition between the spd , the greens and the left party would be possible in the northern german city , but this has been ruled out by the spd 's top candidate , michael naumann .
kurt beck criticized for possibly ill-timed comments he has criticized national party chairman kurt beck for scaring off some voters by raising the possibility of tacit cooperation with the left party in the state of hesse , where a government has still not been formed four weeks after the vote .
up to now , the social democrats have strictly ruled out working with the party - a broad far-left grouping that includes disaffected former social democrats and former east german communists - in western germany .
several coalitions exist in eastern germany , including in the capital , berlin .
the rise of the party is currently causing a considerable shake-up in germany 's political landscape .
while the last three state elections have seen a swing to the left , this has not translated into a straightforward rise in support for the social democrats .
the split in the vote is leading to parties beginning to think the previously unthinkable . dw staff -lrb- jg -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

25 , after merkel 's party lost sole control in state elections in hamburg , and the spd warmed up to the idea of cooperating with a so-far taboo partner and new political constellations seem likely to shake up german politics . " the grand coalition will continue , but relations will get nastier , " gerd langguth , a political scientist at bonn university told reuters news agency . the cdu lost their overall majority in hamburg after taking 42.7 percent of the vote , while the social democrats increased their share to 34.1 percent from 30.5 percent - albeit by less than it hoped . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : merkel congratulated von beust on getting the most votes in hamburg 's election the results mean that neither the conservatives nor the social democrats can form coalitions with their preferred political partners , the free-market liberal fdp and the greens respectively . the hamburg vote is the second state election in a month to produce inconclusive results and raise the possibility of new partnerships amid growing disillusionment inside merkel 's ruling coalition , which has been at loggerheads in recent months . there are fears that continued bickering would hinder much-needed tax and labor market reforms needed for bolstering germany 's economic recovery as it faces risks from a us slowdown and a strong euro . a path-breaking new alliance the cdu 's preferred political partner , the free-market liberal fdp failed to get into parliament in the hamburg election , leading to the cdu sounding out the greens as coalition partners in the northern german port city . a cdu-greens coalition would be a first in a german state , although the two parties have combined successfully at the municipal level . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : hamburg election results left many wondering what will come next there are several hurdles to such a power-sharing agreement .
incumbent hamburg mayor ole von beust and his cdu are determined to dredge the elbe river to increase the size of europe 's second-largest container port .
they also want a new coal-fired power station . the greens are adamantly opposed to both points , and there are also major differences on education policy . merkel hits out at spd flip-flopping amid the uncertainty in hamburg , merkel on monday lashed out at the spd for eyeing an agreement in the state of hesse with the left party , a grouping of ex-communists and disgruntled social democratic defectors . the left party was the clear winner in the hamburg election , winning a place in a fourth regional parliament in less than a year to establish itself as part of the political landscape in western germany after long being a fixture only in the poorer , former communist east . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the left party 's popularity is growing in western germany " we are now present in legislatures in 10 of germany 's -lsb- 16 -rsb- states .
we are on our way to becoming a party for all of germany , " lothar bisky , president of the left party , said on monday . merkel has blamed the failure of the social democrats to retain their left-wing voter base , much of which has drifted further to the left cast votes for the ex-communists , for the left party 's recent successes .
the left party remains anathema to all of germany 's mainstream parties because of its communist past . however , on monday , the spd 's steering committee effectively backed leader kurt beck and gave the green light to rely on the left party 's votes to get its candidate elected as premier in hesse . merkel said the social democrats had forsaken their credibility by considering a tie-up with the left party after ruling out such a pact in the run-up to the election . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : merkel accused beck , above , of breaking election promises " the social democrats have ... shown themselves in recent weeks not to be reliable , " merkel said in one of her strongest criticisms of her coalition partner , with whom she has shared an awkward relationship at the federal level since 2005 . " this is an experience that will stay in the minds of german people showing you can not rely on what is said before an election , " she added .
" we must expect that this will repeat itself in various ways , and it will be left up to the voter to decide on this in 2009 . " new constellations needed however , many say there is a need for new political constellations in germany where government since world war ii has been dominated by the cdu and the spd , with the fdp , and more recently the greens , often playing the kingmaker . " german democracy is in the creche of a five-party system , it will take time before it can all function properly , " german daily sueddeutsche zeitung wrote on monday , " old resentments must be packed away and new alliances must be risked .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de afghanistan -pipe- 25.02.2008 german military reaches out to afghans on air großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the soldiers distribute radios to the people as germany prepares to send combat troops to northern afghanistan , its military also aims to win over the country by radio . captain sebastian knepper works on the radio program that the german military , the bundeswehr , broadcasts in afghanistan .
last year he spent several months producing the show on site in the north of the country . dw-world.de : why does the german military produce a radio program for afghans ?
is that typical for regions where it has troops stationed ? sebastian knepper : it 's clear to the soldiers why they 're on the mission , but it 's sometimes not clear to the local people .
it 's their right to know why the german military is there and we have to explain to the people what our mission is .
our intent is to provide them with reliable and factual information .
getting trustworthy information is an important issue in becoming an open , democratic society .
that 's the reason why the german military always deploys soldiers like me to countries where they 're involved , in order to set up the kind of information structure that is found in developed countries like germany . it all started in somalia in 1993 .
the branch i work in , called operative information , has grown since then .
it 's proven to be a good way to explain to the people -lsb- where we have troops stationed -rsb- why we 're there , but also to react to actions by insurgents or terrorists groups .
we inform the people of the facts surrounding the incidents and do n't let the insurgents get in the people 's heads . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : german troops are stationed in the north we provide information they can sometimes only get from us , because there is no real infrastructure for tv or other media . what do you mean by " information ? "
the word " propaganda " certainly comes to mind with such a program . it 's like a normal radio broadcast in germany .
we provide local news from their province or town , we provide the news from around afghanistan and from all over the world .
the radio hour is divided into four quarters and there is a news section in each quarter .
we mix it up with entertainment and music . who are your listeners ? those who can receive our signal .
we have one station in the capital , kabul , and four more in the north , the territory that is run by the germans .
there are other radio stations run by our allies all over afghanistan . the illiteracy rate is quite high in afghanistan and the tv infrastructure is not as good as in europe , so radio is the easiest way to reach the people .
when soldiers go out to the villages , they give away radios that the people can use to listen to our program . so it 's popular ? it 's quite popular .
we do n't have exact figures , but the latest poll from 2005 showed that the bbc 's program is the most listened to , but the bundeswehr 's " voice of freedom " program came in second .
that represents only five years of work to create a radio program there from scratch . it sounds like a difficult job to produce a program from germany in a foreign language for people living in a different culture .
how do you overcome this challenge ? while we 're in germany , we prepare for the next region we 'll be stationed in .
it 's the soldier stationed in afghanistan who works on a daily basis on the program .
he works together with the local journalists that produce the program in the local languages - in afghanistan these are dari and pashto . we produce extra material here in germany , like a program called " world of knowledge , " with afghan refugees living here , but most of the work is done in afghanistan . who are the local journalists you partner with in afghanistan ? we have an afghan staff .
when i was there last year , we had 13 journalists working in mazar-i-sharif .
they come to work each day , except fridays , and do the program . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : radio is popular because the illiteracy rate is high , said knepper what is essential to know about afghan culture , the political situation there or the media landscape when producing a radio program that 's interesting to the people ? in afghanistan , there 's a lot more talk on the radio .
there 's also a lot of music - both afghan and western music .
but they talk for a long time .
on a german radio program , you would n't have a piece longer than 90 seconds , but in afghanistan sometimes the pieces last for three to five minutes .
maybe it 's a cultural thing - they can concentrate longer than people -lsb- in germany -rsb- . what was your daily job like ? my daily job was to get an overview of the latest local news in the region i was responsible for in the north .
we have correspondents and freelancers providing us daily with news from various provinces .
this has to be checked , and i decided which news to include in our program , as well as what kind of entertainment to use . what criteria do you have for selecting news pieces ? the pieces have to stick to our goals , which are democracy , openness and rule of law .
that is our mandate in these countries .
it was my main job to check whether the news - and the music , as well - kept with these goals . do you think the bundeswehr 's work will help establish a freer and more stable media in afghanistan in the future ? it 's the first step .
we ca n't think short-term .
in the long-term , it 's essential for an open society to have a valid media landscape .
we also contribute by engaging and educating local journalists . what did you learn during your own stay in afghanistan ? the people there are more relaxed .
they 're satisfied with much less than people here in our western society .
it 's a war-torn country and people just want to have a stable and peaceful environment to work and live in .
it was impressive to see how eager the people are for peace . click on the link below to listen to an excerpt from the dari-language news program , which reports on the opening of a new school for girls sponsored by the international security assistance force in afghanistan -lrb- isaf -rrb- . interview : kate bowen send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

last year he spent several months producing the show on site in the north of the country . dw-world.de : why does the german military produce a radio program for afghans ?
is that typical for regions where it has troops stationed ? sebastian knepper : it 's clear to the soldiers why they 're on the mission , but it 's sometimes not clear to the local people .
it 's their right to know why the german military is there and we have to explain to the people what our mission is .
our intent is to provide them with reliable and factual information .
getting trustworthy information is an important issue in becoming an open , democratic society .
that 's the reason why the german military always deploys soldiers like me to countries where they 're involved , in order to set up the kind of information structure that is found in developed countries like germany . it all started in somalia in 1993 .
the branch i work in , called operative information , has grown since then .
it 's proven to be a good way to explain to the people -lsb- where we have troops stationed -rsb- why we 're there , but also to react to actions by insurgents or terrorists groups .
we inform the people of the facts surrounding the incidents and do n't let the insurgents get in the people 's heads . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : german troops are stationed in the north we provide information they can sometimes only get from us , because there is no real infrastructure for tv or other media . what do you mean by " information ? "
the word " propaganda " certainly comes to mind with such a program . it 's like a normal radio broadcast in germany .
we provide local news from their province or town , we provide the news from around afghanistan and from all over the world .
the radio hour is divided into four quarters and there is a news section in each quarter .
we mix it up with entertainment and music . who are your listeners ? those who can receive our signal .
we have one station in the capital , kabul , and four more in the north , the territory that is run by the germans .
there are other radio stations run by our allies all over afghanistan . the illiteracy rate is quite high in afghanistan and the tv infrastructure is not as good as in europe , so radio is the easiest way to reach the people .
when soldiers go out to the villages , they give away radios that the people can use to listen to our program . so it 's popular ? it 's quite popular .
we do n't have exact figures , but the latest poll from 2005 showed that the bbc 's program is the most listened to , but the bundeswehr 's " voice of freedom " program came in second .
that represents only five years of work to create a radio program there from scratch . it sounds like a difficult job to produce a program from germany in a foreign language for people living in a different culture .
how do you overcome this challenge ? while we 're in germany , we prepare for the next region we 'll be stationed in .
it 's the soldier stationed in afghanistan who works on a daily basis on the program .
he works together with the local journalists that produce the program in the local languages - in afghanistan these are dari and pashto . we produce extra material here in germany , like a program called " world of knowledge , " with afghan refugees living here , but most of the work is done in afghanistan . who are the local journalists you partner with in afghanistan ? we have an afghan staff .
when i was there last year , we had 13 journalists working in mazar-i-sharif .
they come to work each day , except fridays , and do the program . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : radio is popular because the illiteracy rate is high , said knepper what is essential to know about afghan culture , the political situation there or the media landscape when producing a radio program that 's interesting to the people ? in afghanistan , there 's a lot more talk on the radio .
there 's also a lot of music - both afghan and western music .
but they talk for a long time .
on a german radio program , you would n't have a piece longer than 90 seconds , but in afghanistan sometimes the pieces last for three to five minutes .
maybe it 's a cultural thing - they can concentrate longer than people -lsb- in germany -rsb- . what was your daily job like ? my daily job was to get an overview of the latest local news in the region i was responsible for in the north .
we have correspondents and freelancers providing us daily with news from various provinces .
this has to be checked , and i decided which news to include in our program , as well as what kind of entertainment to use . what criteria do you have for selecting news pieces ? the pieces have to stick to our goals , which are democracy , openness and rule of law .
that is our mandate in these countries .
it was my main job to check whether the news - and the music , as well - kept with these goals . do you think the bundeswehr 's work will help establish a freer and more stable media in afghanistan in the future ? it 's the first step .
we ca n't think short-term .
in the long-term , it 's essential for an open society to have a valid media landscape .
we also contribute by engaging and educating local journalists . what did you learn during your own stay in afghanistan ? the people there are more relaxed .
they 're satisfied with much less than people here in our western society .
it 's a war-torn country and people just want to have a stable and peaceful environment to work and live in .

24 , confirming a voter swing to the left ahead of federal elections next year . preliminary results from the hamburg election gave no clear indication of what coalition of party 's would have the best chance to lead the port city . christian democrat -lrb- cdu -rrb- ole von beust , a merkel ally who has ruled hamburg since 2001 , won 42.6 percent of the vote , down from 47 percent four years ago , initial results showed . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : mayor beust may soon be wooing the greens the cdu will remain the strongest single party in the state legislature , but without the absolute majority it once enjoyed . the center-left social democrats -lrb- spd -rrb- scored 34.1 percent according to the exit poll , which represents almost a four-point jump in comparison to last elections . " we are the future of germany , " said spd national leader kurt beck after the vote .
" this election proved that our concerns - social justice and economic success - are those of voters . " the vote in the northern city-state was seen as a key test of whether chancellor angela merkel can stem a swing to the political left ahead of next year 's national ballot .
merkel remains highly popular in germany , but her party has seen its support dip in three consecutive state elections this year . another victory for the left with 6.4 percent , the left party - which came out of a merger between a splinter group of disgruntled spd supporters and the heirs of the east german communist party - will take up seats in the hamburg parliament for the first time after gaining entry to three other western german legislature in the past year . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the left now has seats in 10 of germany 's 16 state legislatures the greens , which took 12.3 percent last time , landed at 9.6 percent , while the liberal fdp , which failed to enter the legislature four years ago , increased their share of the vote , but at 4.7 percent still failed to reach the 5-percent hurdle . observers predicted that forming a governing coalition in the port city would be difficult .

yet one of germany 's eight remaining mines closed early after being blamed for causing earthquakes . the closure of a coal mine in the western german region of saarland did n't come as a surprise .
residents knew that the german government planned to phase out the subsidies which have propped up the industry for decades .
yet the abrupt closure saturday , feb .
23 , still came as a shock .
or maybe more of a rattle .
a small earthquake caused by the mining shook the region on saturday afternoon .
it 's unclear what caused the seismic shock , which originated in a coal mining operation more than 1 kilometer -lrb- half a mile -rrb- underground near the french border .
the earth quake was small , registering a " light " 4.0 on the richter magnitude scale .
mining era nearing an end bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : mine closures are common in germany in recent years the german government has subsidized coal mining to the tune of more than 160 billion euros -lrb- $ 237 billion -rrb- .
importing coal from abroad makes more sense than propping up domestic mining , the government has said .
the shuttering of the saarland mine is the latest in a series of closures .
last year , the german government announced it would gradually phase out coal mining , which has a 200-year tradition in germany .
germany 's eight remaining coal mines employ approximately 33,000 people .
the phase-out is planned to start in 2009 and will be finished by 2018 , with miners receiving government compensation .
residents all shook up bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the quake shook stones loose the tremor was the strongest on record in the area , rattling pictures on walls , knocking over chimneys and causing electrical outages .
a church in the border town of saarwellingen near the mine was closed to the public as a precautionary measure after the tremor shook stones loose .
after the quake , about 1,000 protestors gathered in saarwellingen to demand an end to the mining work which caused dozens of small tremors in recent months .
about 150,000 people live in the area .
they got backing from the region 's top official , premier peter mueller .
he promised that mining would not be allowed to resume if there was evidence that it could cause further earthquakes .
mueller is scheduled to meet with mining officials monday to discuss the future of mining in the area .
investigators are also expected to spend the next few days searching for the cause of the tremors .
closed for now bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : coal mining has a long tradition in germany the hilly , forested region is home to a coal mining operation run by rag deutsche steinkohle .
rag stopped mining at the site until further notice , provisionally laying off 3,600 employees .
the mine near saarwellingen is rag 's only in saarland .
essen-based rag is a group of companies which has chemical , energy and real estate holdings .
rag apologized for the recent tremors in saarland and promised to set up a claim system for those whose property was damaged in the quake .
it remains unclear if the mine will reopen .
it 's the company 's responsibility to demonstrate whether it can " unequivocally eliminate danger to life and limb , " mueller said .
" if it ca n't do that , from my point of view restarting the mining is not possible , " mueller was quoted as saying in the monday edition of the bild newspaper . dw staff -lrb- th -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

yet one of germany 's eight remaining mines closed early after being blamed for causing earthquakes . the closure of a coal mine in the western german region of saarland did n't come as a surprise .
residents knew that the german government planned to phase out the subsidies which have propped up the industry for decades .
yet the abrupt closure saturday , feb .
23 , still came as a shock .
or maybe more of a rattle .
a small earthquake caused by the mining shook the region on saturday afternoon .
it 's unclear what caused the seismic shock , which originated in a coal mining operation more than 1 kilometer -lrb- half a mile -rrb- underground near the french border .
the earth quake was small , registering a " light " 4.0 on the richter magnitude scale .
mining era nearing an end bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : mine closures are common in germany in recent years the german government has subsidized coal mining to the tune of more than 160 billion euros -lrb- $ 237 billion -rrb- .
importing coal from abroad makes more sense than propping up domestic mining , the government has said .
the shuttering of the saarland mine is the latest in a series of closures .
last year , the german government announced it would gradually phase out coal mining , which has a 200-year tradition in germany .
germany 's eight remaining coal mines employ approximately 33,000 people .
the phase-out is planned to start in 2009 and will be finished by 2018 , with miners receiving government compensation .
residents all shook up bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the quake shook stones loose the tremor was the strongest on record in the area , rattling pictures on walls , knocking over chimneys and causing electrical outages .
a church in the border town of saarwellingen near the mine was closed to the public as a precautionary measure after the tremor shook stones loose .
after the quake , about 1,000 protestors gathered in saarwellingen to demand an end to the mining work which caused dozens of small tremors in recent months .
about 150,000 people live in the area .
they got backing from the region 's top official , premier peter mueller .
he promised that mining would not be allowed to resume if there was evidence that it could cause further earthquakes .
mueller is scheduled to meet with mining officials monday to discuss the future of mining in the area .
investigators are also expected to spend the next few days searching for the cause of the tremors .

the mine near saarwellingen is rag 's only in saarland .
essen-based rag is a group of companies which has chemical , energy and real estate holdings .
rag apologized for the recent tremors in saarland and promised to set up a claim system for those whose property was damaged in the quake .
it remains unclear if the mine will reopen .
it 's the company 's responsibility to demonstrate whether it can " unequivocally eliminate danger to life and limb , " mueller said .

the first-ever coalition at state level between the green party and angela merkel 's conservatives could be on the cards after the christian democrats lost their absolute majority in hamburg . incumbent mayor ole von beust -lrb- cdu -rrb- has said he is planning to hold a first round of coalition talks with both the green party and the social democrats -lrb- spd -rrb- respectively .
the heads of the two parties signaled on sunday , feb .
24 , that they would , at least , tolerate this mould-breaking coalition .
hamburg 's mayor welcomed this shift .
" i am generally glad that thinking has become more open . "
he also added in his interview with the german broadcaster ndr that chancellor angela merkel had given him a free hand to decide with which party to form a coalition .
referring to a possible coalition with the greens , von beust said it would be interesting .
" but the agenda has got to be right , " he stressed .
playing hard to get ?
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : final results wo n't actually be out until wednesday the leader of hamburg 's greens , christa goetsch , has , however , expressed reservations , saying that she saw little common ground .
local green party members are set to decide on the matter on thursday .
preliminary results from the city state give von beust 42.6 percent , down from 47 percent four years ago .
according to exit polls , the center-left spd gained 34.1 percent , increasing their share of the vote by 4 percent .
the greens dropped from 12.3 to 9.6 percent .
the free-market liberal free democrats did not make the 5-percent hurdle required to enter parliament , while the left party established its presence after taking a 6.4-percent share of the vote .
conventional choices impossible bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : hamburg 's results could affect berlin the results mean that neither the conservatives nor the social democrats can form coalitions with their preferred political partners , fdp and the greens respectively . the situation is made more complicated by the fact that the exact balance of power in the state parliament will not be known until wednesday when the official final results will be announced .
the delay is linked with introduction of a new voting system in the city .
cdu secretary general ronald pofalla -lrb- cdu -rrb- said : " i believe that it would do hamburg good , if there was a coalition between the cdu and the greens . "
he told the german broadcaster n24 that it would be a good opportunity to test this combination .
" we would have the opportunity to see for a year , or a year-and-a-half how this cooperation works . "
at the same time , pofalla stressed in an interview with the radio station bayrischer rundfunk that this did not undermine the future of the current grand coalition between the spd and the conservatives .
" there we have a responsibility to the state , " he said .
green party chairman reinhard buetikofer said the greens would talk to hamburg 's mayor , " if ole von beust wants to talk to us " .
but he warned : " no one should imagine that the greens will form a prop for a mayor , who has lost his majority , and wants to continue his previous policies . "
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : some commentators accuse beck of clumsiness christa sager , a green member of parliament for hamburg , has also spoken out in favor of exploratory talks .
she also blamed the left party for splitting the left-wing vote and preventing the removal of the conservatives altogether .
" the left party has stopped the spd and the green party gaining a majority . "
mathematically speaking , a coalition between the spd , the greens and the left party would be possible in the northern german city , but this has been ruled out by the spd 's top candidate , michael naumann .

it 's their right to know why the german military is there and we have to explain to the people what our mission is .
our intent is to provide them with reliable and factual information .
getting trustworthy information is an important issue in becoming an open , democratic society .
that 's the reason why the german military always deploys soldiers like me to countries where they 're involved , in order to set up the kind of information structure that is found in developed countries like germany . it all started in somalia in 1993 .
the branch i work in , called operative information , has grown since then .
it 's proven to be a good way to explain to the people -lsb- where we have troops stationed -rsb- why we 're there , but also to react to actions by insurgents or terrorists groups .

we do n't have exact figures , but the latest poll from 2005 showed that the bbc 's program is the most listened to , but the bundeswehr 's " voice of freedom " program came in second .
that represents only five years of work to create a radio program there from scratch . it sounds like a difficult job to produce a program from germany in a foreign language for people living in a different culture .
how do you overcome this challenge ? while we 're in germany , we prepare for the next region we 'll be stationed in .

25 , it would provide information to foreign countries whose nationals are involved in the tax evasion affair . " we are going to respond to requests in this regard , " german finance ministry spokesman , thorsten albig told reporters , adding that germany would not charge foreign governments for the information . scandinavians , britons involved in tax affair ? germany 's intelligence service is reported to have paid 4.2 million euros -lrb- $ 6.22 million -rrb- to an informant , a former employee of liechtenstein banking group lgt , for an incriminating list containing the names of hundreds of people who evaded taxes by parking their money in secret bank accounts in the tiny alpine principality of liechtenstein . albig said berlin bought the information because investigators believed that " it could lead to the return of hundreds of thousands of dollars . " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : it 's not just liechtenstein 's scenic beauty that attracts the rich and famous the list is believed to contain the names of more than 700 wealthy germans as well as well-heeled tax cheats from other nations .
the disclosure has prompted a massive investigation in germany and frayed ties between berlin and liechtenstein capital , vaduz . germany 's handelsblatt business daily reported that finland , sweden and norway had signaled interest in getting their hands on the list of bank clients . joining the german crackdown on tax evaders , the british government 's tax agency said on monday it too had paid for information on secret liechtenstein bank accounts held by british citizens .
media reports said britain paid a whistleblower 100,000 pounds -lrb- 132,931 euros , $ 196,000 -rrb- for details of liechtenstein accounts held by 100 wealthy britons .
unpaid taxes in the affair could amount to as much as 100 million pounds , reports said . the financial times reported that britain had refused two years ago to pay the whistleblower but changed its mind after germany shelled out money to get similar information . the tax scandal also made waves across the atlantic as a senior us lawmaker said last week he would launch an investigation into american citizens also believed to have hid assets at lgt . high-profile victim the investigation into the tax evasion scandal , considered one of the biggest in german history , began earlier this month with raids on the home and offices of klaus zumwinkel , the high-profile boss of deutsche post , europe 's largest postal service , who is suspected of having dodged taxes to the tune of 1 million euros .
zumwinkel has since resigned his post . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : zumwinkel 's fall from grace was rapid ever since , german authorities have been conducting raids across the country on private individuals for allegedly hiding money in accounts liechtenstein 's biggest private bank , the lgt group , which specializes in setting up foundations and is owned by liechtenstein 's royal family . the affair has angered ordinary germans and sparked a heated debate about the ethics and accountability of the country 's highly-paid business elite . anger over " stolen information " equally , the german government 's payment for the incriminating information , which was allegedly stolen from the liechtenstein bank by the former lgt employee , has come under intense scrutiny . on monday , the lgt bank voiced anger at how the " stolen information " was being shared around european capitals . " apparently , the stolen data material has also been illegally disclosed , directly or indirectly , to other authorities , " the bank said in a statement .
" lgt regards such methods as being extremely offensive . " the affair has also raised questions about banking secrecy laws enjoyed by some european nations .
liechtenstein is one of only three countries on the oecd 's tax-haven black-list , alongside andorra and monaco .
germany has vowed to broaden efforts to crack down on tax evasion to countries such as switzerland , luxembourg and austria as well . switzerland and luxembourg have distanced themselves from the charges .

" the grand coalition will continue , but relations will get nastier , " gerd langguth , a political scientist at bonn university told reuters news agency . the cdu lost their overall majority in hamburg after taking 42.7 percent of the vote , while the social democrats increased their share to 34.1 percent from 30.5 percent - albeit by less than it hoped . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : merkel congratulated von beust on getting the most votes in hamburg 's election the results mean that neither the conservatives nor the social democrats can form coalitions with their preferred political partners , the free-market liberal fdp and the greens respectively . the hamburg vote is the second state election in a month to produce inconclusive results and raise the possibility of new partnerships amid growing disillusionment inside merkel 's ruling coalition , which has been at loggerheads in recent months . there are fears that continued bickering would hinder much-needed tax and labor market reforms needed for bolstering germany 's economic recovery as it faces risks from a us slowdown and a strong euro . a path-breaking new alliance the cdu 's preferred political partner , the free-market liberal fdp failed to get into parliament in the hamburg election , leading to the cdu sounding out the greens as coalition partners in the northern german port city . a cdu-greens coalition would be a first in a german state , although the two parties have combined successfully at the municipal level . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : hamburg election results left many wondering what will come next there are several hurdles to such a power-sharing agreement .
incumbent hamburg mayor ole von beust and his cdu are determined to dredge the elbe river to increase the size of europe 's second-largest container port .
they also want a new coal-fired power station . the greens are adamantly opposed to both points , and there are also major differences on education policy . merkel hits out at spd flip-flopping amid the uncertainty in hamburg , merkel on monday lashed out at the spd for eyeing an agreement in the state of hesse with the left party , a grouping of ex-communists and disgruntled social democratic defectors . the left party was the clear winner in the hamburg election , winning a place in a fourth regional parliament in less than a year to establish itself as part of the political landscape in western germany after long being a fixture only in the poorer , former communist east . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the left party 's popularity is growing in western germany " we are now present in legislatures in 10 of germany 's -lsb- 16 -rsb- states .
we are on our way to becoming a party for all of germany , " lothar bisky , president of the left party , said on monday . merkel has blamed the failure of the social democrats to retain their left-wing voter base , much of which has drifted further to the left cast votes for the ex-communists , for the left party 's recent successes .
the left party remains anathema to all of germany 's mainstream parties because of its communist past . however , on monday , the spd 's steering committee effectively backed leader kurt beck and gave the green light to rely on the left party 's votes to get its candidate elected as premier in hesse . merkel said the social democrats had forsaken their credibility by considering a tie-up with the left party after ruling out such a pact in the run-up to the election . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : merkel accused beck , above , of breaking election promises " the social democrats have ... shown themselves in recent weeks not to be reliable , " merkel said in one of her strongest criticisms of her coalition partner , with whom she has shared an awkward relationship at the federal level since 2005 . " this is an experience that will stay in the minds of german people showing you can not rely on what is said before an election , " she added .
" we must expect that this will repeat itself in various ways , and it will be left up to the voter to decide on this in 2009 . " new constellations needed however , many say there is a need for new political constellations in germany where government since world war ii has been dominated by the cdu and the spd , with the fdp , and more recently the greens , often playing the kingmaker . " german democracy is in the creche of a five-party system , it will take time before it can all function properly , " german daily sueddeutsche zeitung wrote on monday , " old resentments must be packed away and new alliances must be risked .

25 , after merkel 's party lost sole control in state elections in hamburg , and the spd warmed up to the idea of cooperating with a so-far taboo partner and new political constellations seem likely to shake up german politics . " the grand coalition will continue , but relations will get nastier , " gerd langguth , a political scientist at bonn university told reuters news agency . the cdu lost their overall majority in hamburg after taking 42.7 percent of the vote , while the social democrats increased their share to 34.1 percent from 30.5 percent - albeit by less than it hoped . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : merkel congratulated von beust on getting the most votes in hamburg 's election the results mean that neither the conservatives nor the social democrats can form coalitions with their preferred political partners , the free-market liberal fdp and the greens respectively . the hamburg vote is the second state election in a month to produce inconclusive results and raise the possibility of new partnerships amid growing disillusionment inside merkel 's ruling coalition , which has been at loggerheads in recent months . there are fears that continued bickering would hinder much-needed tax and labor market reforms needed for bolstering germany 's economic recovery as it faces risks from a us slowdown and a strong euro . a path-breaking new alliance the cdu 's preferred political partner , the free-market liberal fdp failed to get into parliament in the hamburg election , leading to the cdu sounding out the greens as coalition partners in the northern german port city . a cdu-greens coalition would be a first in a german state , although the two parties have combined successfully at the municipal level . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : hamburg election results left many wondering what will come next there are several hurdles to such a power-sharing agreement .
incumbent hamburg mayor ole von beust and his cdu are determined to dredge the elbe river to increase the size of europe 's second-largest container port .
they also want a new coal-fired power station . the greens are adamantly opposed to both points , and there are also major differences on education policy . merkel hits out at spd flip-flopping amid the uncertainty in hamburg , merkel on monday lashed out at the spd for eyeing an agreement in the state of hesse with the left party , a grouping of ex-communists and disgruntled social democratic defectors . the left party was the clear winner in the hamburg election , winning a place in a fourth regional parliament in less than a year to establish itself as part of the political landscape in western germany after long being a fixture only in the poorer , former communist east . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the left party 's popularity is growing in western germany " we are now present in legislatures in 10 of germany 's -lsb- 16 -rsb- states .
we are on our way to becoming a party for all of germany , " lothar bisky , president of the left party , said on monday . merkel has blamed the failure of the social democrats to retain their left-wing voter base , much of which has drifted further to the left cast votes for the ex-communists , for the left party 's recent successes .
the left party remains anathema to all of germany 's mainstream parties because of its communist past . however , on monday , the spd 's steering committee effectively backed leader kurt beck and gave the green light to rely on the left party 's votes to get its candidate elected as premier in hesse . merkel said the social democrats had forsaken their credibility by considering a tie-up with the left party after ruling out such a pact in the run-up to the election . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : merkel accused beck , above , of breaking election promises " the social democrats have ... shown themselves in recent weeks not to be reliable , " merkel said in one of her strongest criticisms of her coalition partner , with whom she has shared an awkward relationship at the federal level since 2005 . " this is an experience that will stay in the minds of german people showing you can not rely on what is said before an election , " she added .
" we must expect that this will repeat itself in various ways , and it will be left up to the voter to decide on this in 2009 . " new constellations needed however , many say there is a need for new political constellations in germany where government since world war ii has been dominated by the cdu and the spd , with the fdp , and more recently the greens , often playing the kingmaker . " german democracy is in the creche of a five-party system , it will take time before it can all function properly , " german daily sueddeutsche zeitung wrote on monday , " old resentments must be packed away and new alliances must be risked .

on sunday , feb .
24 , such a movie won an oscar for best foreign-language film . germany 's nazi past has been a recurrent theme in films made in the country in recent years .
from " downfall , " which controversially portrayed the human side of hitler , to a recent irreverent comedy about the nazi dictator called " mein führer : the truly truest truth about adolf hitler , " german films have been breaking new ground by using humor and irony to tackle issues still sensitive in the country .
the latest film , " the counterfeiters , " sheds light on a little-known chapter of nazi history . it tells the spectacular tale of the largest forgery operation of all time , conducted from within the squalor of one of hitler 's concentration camps .
for the last three years of the second world war , 142 prisoners in the sachsenhausen camp , north of berlin , were forced by their captors to counterfeit millions of british and us banknotes in an attempt to bring the enemy economies to their knees .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : a film scene depicting the wooden huts of the workshop it was an ambitious plan , but the most astonishing thing about it was the way in which it was executed .
in two shielded wooden huts within the barbed wire confines of the camp , the men - some of them were trained printers while others had experiences in counterfeiting - were granted a life of relative comfort and provided enough food , soft beds and proper toilets .
in return they used their professional expertise to forge money .
a first-rate printing workshop was set up inside the two huts and the counterfeiters became part of a state secret which kept them alive while thousands of prisoners were being murdered and starved to death around them .
the men came to call the workshop their " golden cage . "
the devil 's workshop the film , directed by austrian stefan ruzowitzky , is based on a true account of the forgery workshop as told in adolf burger 's book " des teufels werkstatt " -lrb- the devil 's workshop -rrb- .
it follows a character called salomon sorowitsch , loosely based on a notorious counterfeiter of that time named salomon smolianoff .
the existence of the concentration camp forgery mill is a relatively little-known chapter in nazi history , but the producers of " the counterfeiters , " babette schröder and nina bohlmann , immediately recognized the potential of the story when they came across burger 's book .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the sachsenhausen concentration camp schröder and bohlmann said they first read the book six years ago and thought the story would make an interesting movie .
after considering different ways of reworking the material , they approached adolf burger about adapting it for the silver screen .
they also talked to ruzowitzky , who said he was immediately drawn by the universal nature of the material .
" asking whether people should play table-tennis in a concentration camp when others around them are being tortured to death is the same as asking whether we should be allowed to live such affluent , protected lives when there is so much suffering the world , " ruzowitzky said .
issues of conscience burger worked with ruzowitzky as an advisor on the script and accompanied the production as it progressed .
although some of the historical details , such as the prisoners ' release , are not entirely in keeping with what really happened , schröder and bohlmann have tried to show the issues of conscience facing the counterfeiters .
" what fascinated us about the story was that there were two huts in the middle of this huge concentration camp in which the prisoners were allowed to live under better conditions than everyone else , " the producer-duo said .
" they knew about the atrocities on the far side of their wooden walls , they could hear it day by day , but they could n't do anything about it . "
dangerous game of sabotage bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : karl markovics plays salomon sorowitsch during their period of " privileged " imprisonment , burger and his fellow prisoners knew that if they co-operated with their captors , they stood a chance of survival , but that if they sabotaged the efforts to flood the allied economies , they would face certain death .
for some , questions of conscience were at play ; for others , the survival instinct was the greatest .
for producers schröder and bohlmann , it was the character of salomon smolinoff that was the most interesting .
author adolf burger describes in his book how the counterfeiter labored to produce the perfect dollar note .
the results however were never quite satisfactory because other prisoners were sabotaging his efforts without his knowledge , the producer-duo said .
their stalling tactics could not go on forever , and ultimately the dollar did go into production in sachsenhausen .
but by then the allies were well on their way to berlin and there was n't enough time to mass produce the counterfeited notes .
the bills they did manage to print , along with the 134 million british pounds , stamps and other forged documents are believed to have been sunk in austria 's lake toplitz .
reaching a wide audience bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : a film scene from " the counterfeiters " in a note of introduction to his book , burger states : " this book was written in order that people do n't forget what happened . "
the makers and producers of the film have taken that message to heart .
" we have to tell the stories of the holocaust , and we are morally obliged to do it in such a way that we reach as many people as possible , " ruzowitzky said .
" in that sense even a film about the holocaust should contain elements of excitement and entertainment .
' the counterfeiters ' is an entertaining film .

on sunday , feb .
24 , such a movie won an oscar for best foreign-language film . germany 's nazi past has been a recurrent theme in films made in the country in recent years .
from " downfall , " which controversially portrayed the human side of hitler , to a recent irreverent comedy about the nazi dictator called " mein führer : the truly truest truth about adolf hitler , " german films have been breaking new ground by using humor and irony to tackle issues still sensitive in the country .
the latest film , " the counterfeiters , " sheds light on a little-known chapter of nazi history . it tells the spectacular tale of the largest forgery operation of all time , conducted from within the squalor of one of hitler 's concentration camps .
for the last three years of the second world war , 142 prisoners in the sachsenhausen camp , north of berlin , were forced by their captors to counterfeit millions of british and us banknotes in an attempt to bring the enemy economies to their knees .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : a film scene depicting the wooden huts of the workshop it was an ambitious plan , but the most astonishing thing about it was the way in which it was executed .
in two shielded wooden huts within the barbed wire confines of the camp , the men - some of them were trained printers while others had experiences in counterfeiting - were granted a life of relative comfort and provided enough food , soft beds and proper toilets .
in return they used their professional expertise to forge money .
a first-rate printing workshop was set up inside the two huts and the counterfeiters became part of a state secret which kept them alive while thousands of prisoners were being murdered and starved to death around them .
the men came to call the workshop their " golden cage . "
the devil 's workshop the film , directed by austrian stefan ruzowitzky , is based on a true account of the forgery workshop as told in adolf burger 's book " des teufels werkstatt " -lrb- the devil 's workshop -rrb- .
it follows a character called salomon sorowitsch , loosely based on a notorious counterfeiter of that time named salomon smolianoff .
the existence of the concentration camp forgery mill is a relatively little-known chapter in nazi history , but the producers of " the counterfeiters , " babette schröder and nina bohlmann , immediately recognized the potential of the story when they came across burger 's book .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the sachsenhausen concentration camp schröder and bohlmann said they first read the book six years ago and thought the story would make an interesting movie .
after considering different ways of reworking the material , they approached adolf burger about adapting it for the silver screen .
they also talked to ruzowitzky , who said he was immediately drawn by the universal nature of the material .
" asking whether people should play table-tennis in a concentration camp when others around them are being tortured to death is the same as asking whether we should be allowed to live such affluent , protected lives when there is so much suffering the world , " ruzowitzky said .
issues of conscience burger worked with ruzowitzky as an advisor on the script and accompanied the production as it progressed .
although some of the historical details , such as the prisoners ' release , are not entirely in keeping with what really happened , schröder and bohlmann have tried to show the issues of conscience facing the counterfeiters .
" what fascinated us about the story was that there were two huts in the middle of this huge concentration camp in which the prisoners were allowed to live under better conditions than everyone else , " the producer-duo said .
" they knew about the atrocities on the far side of their wooden walls , they could hear it day by day , but they could n't do anything about it . "
dangerous game of sabotage bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : karl markovics plays salomon sorowitsch during their period of " privileged " imprisonment , burger and his fellow prisoners knew that if they co-operated with their captors , they stood a chance of survival , but that if they sabotaged the efforts to flood the allied economies , they would face certain death .
for some , questions of conscience were at play ; for others , the survival instinct was the greatest .
for producers schröder and bohlmann , it was the character of salomon smolinoff that was the most interesting .
author adolf burger describes in his book how the counterfeiter labored to produce the perfect dollar note .
the results however were never quite satisfactory because other prisoners were sabotaging his efforts without his knowledge , the producer-duo said .
their stalling tactics could not go on forever , and ultimately the dollar did go into production in sachsenhausen .
but by then the allies were well on their way to berlin and there was n't enough time to mass produce the counterfeited notes .
the bills they did manage to print , along with the 134 million british pounds , stamps and other forged documents are believed to have been sunk in austria 's lake toplitz .
reaching a wide audience bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : a film scene from " the counterfeiters " in a note of introduction to his book , burger states : " this book was written in order that people do n't forget what happened . "
the makers and producers of the film have taken that message to heart .
" we have to tell the stories of the holocaust , and we are morally obliged to do it in such a way that we reach as many people as possible , " ruzowitzky said .
" in that sense even a film about the holocaust should contain elements of excitement and entertainment .
' the counterfeiters ' is an entertaining film .

on sunday , feb .
24 , such a movie won an oscar for best foreign-language film . germany 's nazi past has been a recurrent theme in films made in the country in recent years .
from " downfall , " which controversially portrayed the human side of hitler , to a recent irreverent comedy about the nazi dictator called " mein führer : the truly truest truth about adolf hitler , " german films have been breaking new ground by using humor and irony to tackle issues still sensitive in the country .
the latest film , " the counterfeiters , " sheds light on a little-known chapter of nazi history . it tells the spectacular tale of the largest forgery operation of all time , conducted from within the squalor of one of hitler 's concentration camps .
for the last three years of the second world war , 142 prisoners in the sachsenhausen camp , north of berlin , were forced by their captors to counterfeit millions of british and us banknotes in an attempt to bring the enemy economies to their knees .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : a film scene depicting the wooden huts of the workshop it was an ambitious plan , but the most astonishing thing about it was the way in which it was executed .
in two shielded wooden huts within the barbed wire confines of the camp , the men - some of them were trained printers while others had experiences in counterfeiting - were granted a life of relative comfort and provided enough food , soft beds and proper toilets .
in return they used their professional expertise to forge money .
a first-rate printing workshop was set up inside the two huts and the counterfeiters became part of a state secret which kept them alive while thousands of prisoners were being murdered and starved to death around them .
the men came to call the workshop their " golden cage . "
the devil 's workshop the film , directed by austrian stefan ruzowitzky , is based on a true account of the forgery workshop as told in adolf burger 's book " des teufels werkstatt " -lrb- the devil 's workshop -rrb- .
it follows a character called salomon sorowitsch , loosely based on a notorious counterfeiter of that time named salomon smolianoff .
the existence of the concentration camp forgery mill is a relatively little-known chapter in nazi history , but the producers of " the counterfeiters , " babette schröder and nina bohlmann , immediately recognized the potential of the story when they came across burger 's book .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the sachsenhausen concentration camp schröder and bohlmann said they first read the book six years ago and thought the story would make an interesting movie .
after considering different ways of reworking the material , they approached adolf burger about adapting it for the silver screen .
they also talked to ruzowitzky , who said he was immediately drawn by the universal nature of the material .
" asking whether people should play table-tennis in a concentration camp when others around them are being tortured to death is the same as asking whether we should be allowed to live such affluent , protected lives when there is so much suffering the world , " ruzowitzky said .
issues of conscience burger worked with ruzowitzky as an advisor on the script and accompanied the production as it progressed .
although some of the historical details , such as the prisoners ' release , are not entirely in keeping with what really happened , schröder and bohlmann have tried to show the issues of conscience facing the counterfeiters .
" what fascinated us about the story was that there were two huts in the middle of this huge concentration camp in which the prisoners were allowed to live under better conditions than everyone else , " the producer-duo said .

on sunday , feb .
24 , such a movie won an oscar for best foreign-language film . germany 's nazi past has been a recurrent theme in films made in the country in recent years .
from " downfall , " which controversially portrayed the human side of hitler , to a recent irreverent comedy about the nazi dictator called " mein führer : the truly truest truth about adolf hitler , " german films have been breaking new ground by using humor and irony to tackle issues still sensitive in the country .
the latest film , " the counterfeiters , " sheds light on a little-known chapter of nazi history . it tells the spectacular tale of the largest forgery operation of all time , conducted from within the squalor of one of hitler 's concentration camps .
for the last three years of the second world war , 142 prisoners in the sachsenhausen camp , north of berlin , were forced by their captors to counterfeit millions of british and us banknotes in an attempt to bring the enemy economies to their knees .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : a film scene depicting the wooden huts of the workshop it was an ambitious plan , but the most astonishing thing about it was the way in which it was executed .
in two shielded wooden huts within the barbed wire confines of the camp , the men - some of them were trained printers while others had experiences in counterfeiting - were granted a life of relative comfort and provided enough food , soft beds and proper toilets .
in return they used their professional expertise to forge money .
a first-rate printing workshop was set up inside the two huts and the counterfeiters became part of a state secret which kept them alive while thousands of prisoners were being murdered and starved to death around them .
the men came to call the workshop their " golden cage . "
the devil 's workshop the film , directed by austrian stefan ruzowitzky , is based on a true account of the forgery workshop as told in adolf burger 's book " des teufels werkstatt " -lrb- the devil 's workshop -rrb- .
it follows a character called salomon sorowitsch , loosely based on a notorious counterfeiter of that time named salomon smolianoff .
the existence of the concentration camp forgery mill is a relatively little-known chapter in nazi history , but the producers of " the counterfeiters , " babette schröder and nina bohlmann , immediately recognized the potential of the story when they came across burger 's book .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the sachsenhausen concentration camp schröder and bohlmann said they first read the book six years ago and thought the story would make an interesting movie .
after considering different ways of reworking the material , they approached adolf burger about adapting it for the silver screen .
they also talked to ruzowitzky , who said he was immediately drawn by the universal nature of the material .
" asking whether people should play table-tennis in a concentration camp when others around them are being tortured to death is the same as asking whether we should be allowed to live such affluent , protected lives when there is so much suffering the world , " ruzowitzky said .
issues of conscience burger worked with ruzowitzky as an advisor on the script and accompanied the production as it progressed .
although some of the historical details , such as the prisoners ' release , are not entirely in keeping with what really happened , schröder and bohlmann have tried to show the issues of conscience facing the counterfeiters .
" what fascinated us about the story was that there were two huts in the middle of this huge concentration camp in which the prisoners were allowed to live under better conditions than everyone else , " the producer-duo said .
" they knew about the atrocities on the far side of their wooden walls , they could hear it day by day , but they could n't do anything about it . "
dangerous game of sabotage bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : karl markovics plays salomon sorowitsch during their period of " privileged " imprisonment , burger and his fellow prisoners knew that if they co-operated with their captors , they stood a chance of survival , but that if they sabotaged the efforts to flood the allied economies , they would face certain death .
for some , questions of conscience were at play ; for others , the survival instinct was the greatest .
for producers schröder and bohlmann , it was the character of salomon smolinoff that was the most interesting .
author adolf burger describes in his book how the counterfeiter labored to produce the perfect dollar note .
the results however were never quite satisfactory because other prisoners were sabotaging his efforts without his knowledge , the producer-duo said .
their stalling tactics could not go on forever , and ultimately the dollar did go into production in sachsenhausen .
but by then the allies were well on their way to berlin and there was n't enough time to mass produce the counterfeited notes .
the bills they did manage to print , along with the 134 million british pounds , stamps and other forged documents are believed to have been sunk in austria 's lake toplitz .
reaching a wide audience bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : a film scene from " the counterfeiters " in a note of introduction to his book , burger states : " this book was written in order that people do n't forget what happened . "
the makers and producers of the film have taken that message to heart .
" we have to tell the stories of the holocaust , and we are morally obliged to do it in such a way that we reach as many people as possible , " ruzowitzky said .

25 , after merkel 's party lost sole control in state elections in hamburg , and the spd warmed up to the idea of cooperating with a so-far taboo partner and new political constellations seem likely to shake up german politics . " the grand coalition will continue , but relations will get nastier , " gerd langguth , a political scientist at bonn university told reuters news agency . the cdu lost their overall majority in hamburg after taking 42.7 percent of the vote , while the social democrats increased their share to 34.1 percent from 30.5 percent - albeit by less than it hoped . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : merkel congratulated von beust on getting the most votes in hamburg 's election the results mean that neither the conservatives nor the social democrats can form coalitions with their preferred political partners , the free-market liberal fdp and the greens respectively . the hamburg vote is the second state election in a month to produce inconclusive results and raise the possibility of new partnerships amid growing disillusionment inside merkel 's ruling coalition , which has been at loggerheads in recent months . there are fears that continued bickering would hinder much-needed tax and labor market reforms needed for bolstering germany 's economic recovery as it faces risks from a us slowdown and a strong euro . a path-breaking new alliance the cdu 's preferred political partner , the free-market liberal fdp failed to get into parliament in the hamburg election , leading to the cdu sounding out the greens as coalition partners in the northern german port city . a cdu-greens coalition would be a first in a german state , although the two parties have combined successfully at the municipal level . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : hamburg election results left many wondering what will come next there are several hurdles to such a power-sharing agreement .
incumbent hamburg mayor ole von beust and his cdu are determined to dredge the elbe river to increase the size of europe 's second-largest container port .
they also want a new coal-fired power station . the greens are adamantly opposed to both points , and there are also major differences on education policy . merkel hits out at spd flip-flopping amid the uncertainty in hamburg , merkel on monday lashed out at the spd for eyeing an agreement in the state of hesse with the left party , a grouping of ex-communists and disgruntled social democratic defectors . the left party was the clear winner in the hamburg election , winning a place in a fourth regional parliament in less than a year to establish itself as part of the political landscape in western germany after long being a fixture only in the poorer , former communist east . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the left party 's popularity is growing in western germany " we are now present in legislatures in 10 of germany 's -lsb- 16 -rsb- states .
we are on our way to becoming a party for all of germany , " lothar bisky , president of the left party , said on monday . merkel has blamed the failure of the social democrats to retain their left-wing voter base , much of which has drifted further to the left cast votes for the ex-communists , for the left party 's recent successes .
the left party remains anathema to all of germany 's mainstream parties because of its communist past . however , on monday , the spd 's steering committee effectively backed leader kurt beck and gave the green light to rely on the left party 's votes to get its candidate elected as premier in hesse . merkel said the social democrats had forsaken their credibility by considering a tie-up with the left party after ruling out such a pact in the run-up to the election . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : merkel accused beck , above , of breaking election promises " the social democrats have ... shown themselves in recent weeks not to be reliable , " merkel said in one of her strongest criticisms of her coalition partner , with whom she has shared an awkward relationship at the federal level since 2005 .

25 , after merkel 's party lost sole control in state elections in hamburg , and the spd warmed up to the idea of cooperating with a so-far taboo partner and new political constellations seem likely to shake up german politics . " the grand coalition will continue , but relations will get nastier , " gerd langguth , a political scientist at bonn university told reuters news agency . the cdu lost their overall majority in hamburg after taking 42.7 percent of the vote , while the social democrats increased their share to 34.1 percent from 30.5 percent - albeit by less than it hoped . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : merkel congratulated von beust on getting the most votes in hamburg 's election the results mean that neither the conservatives nor the social democrats can form coalitions with their preferred political partners , the free-market liberal fdp and the greens respectively . the hamburg vote is the second state election in a month to produce inconclusive results and raise the possibility of new partnerships amid growing disillusionment inside merkel 's ruling coalition , which has been at loggerheads in recent months . there are fears that continued bickering would hinder much-needed tax and labor market reforms needed for bolstering germany 's economic recovery as it faces risks from a us slowdown and a strong euro . a path-breaking new alliance the cdu 's preferred political partner , the free-market liberal fdp failed to get into parliament in the hamburg election , leading to the cdu sounding out the greens as coalition partners in the northern german port city . a cdu-greens coalition would be a first in a german state , although the two parties have combined successfully at the municipal level . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : hamburg election results left many wondering what will come next there are several hurdles to such a power-sharing agreement .
incumbent hamburg mayor ole von beust and his cdu are determined to dredge the elbe river to increase the size of europe 's second-largest container port .
they also want a new coal-fired power station . the greens are adamantly opposed to both points , and there are also major differences on education policy . merkel hits out at spd flip-flopping amid the uncertainty in hamburg , merkel on monday lashed out at the spd for eyeing an agreement in the state of hesse with the left party , a grouping of ex-communists and disgruntled social democratic defectors . the left party was the clear winner in the hamburg election , winning a place in a fourth regional parliament in less than a year to establish itself as part of the political landscape in western germany after long being a fixture only in the poorer , former communist east . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the left party 's popularity is growing in western germany " we are now present in legislatures in 10 of germany 's -lsb- 16 -rsb- states .
we are on our way to becoming a party for all of germany , " lothar bisky , president of the left party , said on monday . merkel has blamed the failure of the social democrats to retain their left-wing voter base , much of which has drifted further to the left cast votes for the ex-communists , for the left party 's recent successes .
the left party remains anathema to all of germany 's mainstream parties because of its communist past . however , on monday , the spd 's steering committee effectively backed leader kurt beck and gave the green light to rely on the left party 's votes to get its candidate elected as premier in hesse . merkel said the social democrats had forsaken their credibility by considering a tie-up with the left party after ruling out such a pact in the run-up to the election . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : merkel accused beck , above , of breaking election promises " the social democrats have ... shown themselves in recent weeks not to be reliable , " merkel said in one of her strongest criticisms of her coalition partner , with whom she has shared an awkward relationship at the federal level since 2005 . " this is an experience that will stay in the minds of german people showing you can not rely on what is said before an election , " she added .
" we must expect that this will repeat itself in various ways , and it will be left up to the voter to decide on this in 2009 . " new constellations needed however , many say there is a need for new political constellations in germany where government since world war ii has been dominated by the cdu and the spd , with the fdp , and more recently the greens , often playing the kingmaker .

last year he spent several months producing the show on site in the north of the country . dw-world.de : why does the german military produce a radio program for afghans ?
is that typical for regions where it has troops stationed ? sebastian knepper : it 's clear to the soldiers why they 're on the mission , but it 's sometimes not clear to the local people .
it 's their right to know why the german military is there and we have to explain to the people what our mission is .
our intent is to provide them with reliable and factual information .
getting trustworthy information is an important issue in becoming an open , democratic society .
that 's the reason why the german military always deploys soldiers like me to countries where they 're involved , in order to set up the kind of information structure that is found in developed countries like germany . it all started in somalia in 1993 .
the branch i work in , called operative information , has grown since then .
it 's proven to be a good way to explain to the people -lsb- where we have troops stationed -rsb- why we 're there , but also to react to actions by insurgents or terrorists groups .
we inform the people of the facts surrounding the incidents and do n't let the insurgents get in the people 's heads . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : german troops are stationed in the north we provide information they can sometimes only get from us , because there is no real infrastructure for tv or other media . what do you mean by " information ? "
the word " propaganda " certainly comes to mind with such a program . it 's like a normal radio broadcast in germany .
we provide local news from their province or town , we provide the news from around afghanistan and from all over the world .
the radio hour is divided into four quarters and there is a news section in each quarter .
we mix it up with entertainment and music . who are your listeners ? those who can receive our signal .
we have one station in the capital , kabul , and four more in the north , the territory that is run by the germans .
there are other radio stations run by our allies all over afghanistan . the illiteracy rate is quite high in afghanistan and the tv infrastructure is not as good as in europe , so radio is the easiest way to reach the people .
when soldiers go out to the villages , they give away radios that the people can use to listen to our program . so it 's popular ? it 's quite popular .
we do n't have exact figures , but the latest poll from 2005 showed that the bbc 's program is the most listened to , but the bundeswehr 's " voice of freedom " program came in second .
that represents only five years of work to create a radio program there from scratch . it sounds like a difficult job to produce a program from germany in a foreign language for people living in a different culture .
how do you overcome this challenge ? while we 're in germany , we prepare for the next region we 'll be stationed in .
it 's the soldier stationed in afghanistan who works on a daily basis on the program .
he works together with the local journalists that produce the program in the local languages - in afghanistan these are dari and pashto . we produce extra material here in germany , like a program called " world of knowledge , " with afghan refugees living here , but most of the work is done in afghanistan . who are the local journalists you partner with in afghanistan ? we have an afghan staff .
when i was there last year , we had 13 journalists working in mazar-i-sharif .
they come to work each day , except fridays , and do the program . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : radio is popular because the illiteracy rate is high , said knepper what is essential to know about afghan culture , the political situation there or the media landscape when producing a radio program that 's interesting to the people ? in afghanistan , there 's a lot more talk on the radio .
there 's also a lot of music - both afghan and western music .
but they talk for a long time .
on a german radio program , you would n't have a piece longer than 90 seconds , but in afghanistan sometimes the pieces last for three to five minutes .
maybe it 's a cultural thing - they can concentrate longer than people -lsb- in germany -rsb- . what was your daily job like ? my daily job was to get an overview of the latest local news in the region i was responsible for in the north .
we have correspondents and freelancers providing us daily with news from various provinces .
this has to be checked , and i decided which news to include in our program , as well as what kind of entertainment to use . what criteria do you have for selecting news pieces ? the pieces have to stick to our goals , which are democracy , openness and rule of law .
that is our mandate in these countries .
it was my main job to check whether the news - and the music , as well - kept with these goals . do you think the bundeswehr 's work will help establish a freer and more stable media in afghanistan in the future ? it 's the first step .
we ca n't think short-term .
in the long-term , it 's essential for an open society to have a valid media landscape .
we also contribute by engaging and educating local journalists . what did you learn during your own stay in afghanistan ? the people there are more relaxed .
they 're satisfied with much less than people here in our western society .
it 's a war-torn country and people just want to have a stable and peaceful environment to work and live in .
it was impressive to see how eager the people are for peace . click on the link below to listen to an excerpt from the dari-language news program , which reports on the opening of a new school for girls sponsored by the international security assistance force in afghanistan -lrb- isaf -rrb- . interview : kate bowen send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

its first test comes this weekend in saxony . the fifth-division match between locomotive leipzig and kickers markkleeberg on sunday , feb 24 , came under an unusual type of scrutiny .
fearing fan violence , authorities decided to watch over events outside the stadium and in the stands with a camera mounted on a 60,000 euro -lrb- $ 90,000 -rrb- miniature helicopter .
" we 're the first to employ an unmanned drone under real conditions , " saxony police president bernd merbitz told dpa news agency .
" usually we can only see the first row .
if a stone comes flying from a group of people , you ca n't tell who it was . "
authorities said they would have a state prosecutor on site at the markkleeberg stadium to analyze the images taken by the camera and decide whether arrests need to be made .
stadium fears bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : fans of lower-division , eastern german teams have a bad reputation while violence from soccer hooligans is largely under control in the upper divisions , it has repeatedly flared up in the lower leagues , where teams often lack the resources to deal with sometimes drunken crowds and ensure security .
teams from saxony , where social frustration runs relatively high , have often been at the center of the soccer-related fighting .
in late 2006 , dresden dynamo fans ran riot at a match against hertha berlin 's amateur developmental squad .
thirty-eight people were injured in battles between supporters and security guards .
action belongs on the pitch bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : conventional security methods have n't ended the problem and in february 2007 , all matches from the fifth division on down in saxony were cancelled because of doubts that the clubs concerned could keep spectators safe .
saxony police hope that by using high-tech surveillance methods they can keep the action where it belongs - on the pitch .
" we have no intention of stigmatizing true fans , " merbitz said .
" but people should n't always have to be afraid that others will run wild , if the opposing team scores a goal . "
the saxony police 's plan has attracted considerable media attention in the run up to the match this weekend , and those concerned with ending hooliganism will be watching to see whether the miniature eye-in-the-sky actually helps . dw staff -lrb- jc -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

its first test comes this weekend in saxony . the fifth-division match between locomotive leipzig and kickers markkleeberg on sunday , feb 24 , came under an unusual type of scrutiny .
fearing fan violence , authorities decided to watch over events outside the stadium and in the stands with a camera mounted on a 60,000 euro -lrb- $ 90,000 -rrb- miniature helicopter .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de afghanistan -pipe- 25.02.2008 german military reaches out to afghans on air großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the soldiers distribute radios to the people as germany prepares to send combat troops to northern afghanistan , its military also aims to win over the country by radio . captain sebastian knepper works on the radio program that the german military , the bundeswehr , broadcasts in afghanistan .
last year he spent several months producing the show on site in the north of the country . dw-world.de : why does the german military produce a radio program for afghans ?
is that typical for regions where it has troops stationed ? sebastian knepper : it 's clear to the soldiers why they 're on the mission , but it 's sometimes not clear to the local people .
it 's their right to know why the german military is there and we have to explain to the people what our mission is .
our intent is to provide them with reliable and factual information .
getting trustworthy information is an important issue in becoming an open , democratic society .
that 's the reason why the german military always deploys soldiers like me to countries where they 're involved , in order to set up the kind of information structure that is found in developed countries like germany . it all started in somalia in 1993 .
the branch i work in , called operative information , has grown since then .
it 's proven to be a good way to explain to the people -lsb- where we have troops stationed -rsb- why we 're there , but also to react to actions by insurgents or terrorists groups .
we inform the people of the facts surrounding the incidents and do n't let the insurgents get in the people 's heads . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : german troops are stationed in the north we provide information they can sometimes only get from us , because there is no real infrastructure for tv or other media . what do you mean by " information ? "
the word " propaganda " certainly comes to mind with such a program . it 's like a normal radio broadcast in germany .
we provide local news from their province or town , we provide the news from around afghanistan and from all over the world .
the radio hour is divided into four quarters and there is a news section in each quarter .
we mix it up with entertainment and music . who are your listeners ? those who can receive our signal .
we have one station in the capital , kabul , and four more in the north , the territory that is run by the germans .
there are other radio stations run by our allies all over afghanistan . the illiteracy rate is quite high in afghanistan and the tv infrastructure is not as good as in europe , so radio is the easiest way to reach the people .
when soldiers go out to the villages , they give away radios that the people can use to listen to our program . so it 's popular ? it 's quite popular .
we do n't have exact figures , but the latest poll from 2005 showed that the bbc 's program is the most listened to , but the bundeswehr 's " voice of freedom " program came in second .
that represents only five years of work to create a radio program there from scratch . it sounds like a difficult job to produce a program from germany in a foreign language for people living in a different culture .
how do you overcome this challenge ? while we 're in germany , we prepare for the next region we 'll be stationed in .
it 's the soldier stationed in afghanistan who works on a daily basis on the program .
he works together with the local journalists that produce the program in the local languages - in afghanistan these are dari and pashto . we produce extra material here in germany , like a program called " world of knowledge , " with afghan refugees living here , but most of the work is done in afghanistan . who are the local journalists you partner with in afghanistan ? we have an afghan staff .
when i was there last year , we had 13 journalists working in mazar-i-sharif .
they come to work each day , except fridays , and do the program . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : radio is popular because the illiteracy rate is high , said knepper what is essential to know about afghan culture , the political situation there or the media landscape when producing a radio program that 's interesting to the people ? in afghanistan , there 's a lot more talk on the radio .
there 's also a lot of music - both afghan and western music .
but they talk for a long time .
on a german radio program , you would n't have a piece longer than 90 seconds , but in afghanistan sometimes the pieces last for three to five minutes .
maybe it 's a cultural thing - they can concentrate longer than people -lsb- in germany -rsb- . what was your daily job like ? my daily job was to get an overview of the latest local news in the region i was responsible for in the north .
we have correspondents and freelancers providing us daily with news from various provinces .
this has to be checked , and i decided which news to include in our program , as well as what kind of entertainment to use . what criteria do you have for selecting news pieces ? the pieces have to stick to our goals , which are democracy , openness and rule of law .
that is our mandate in these countries .
it was my main job to check whether the news - and the music , as well - kept with these goals . do you think the bundeswehr 's work will help establish a freer and more stable media in afghanistan in the future ? it 's the first step .
we ca n't think short-term .
in the long-term , it 's essential for an open society to have a valid media landscape .
we also contribute by engaging and educating local journalists . what did you learn during your own stay in afghanistan ? the people there are more relaxed .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de afghanistan -pipe- 25.02.2008 german military reaches out to afghans on air großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the soldiers distribute radios to the people as germany prepares to send combat troops to northern afghanistan , its military also aims to win over the country by radio . captain sebastian knepper works on the radio program that the german military , the bundeswehr , broadcasts in afghanistan .
last year he spent several months producing the show on site in the north of the country . dw-world.de : why does the german military produce a radio program for afghans ?
is that typical for regions where it has troops stationed ? sebastian knepper : it 's clear to the soldiers why they 're on the mission , but it 's sometimes not clear to the local people .
it 's their right to know why the german military is there and we have to explain to the people what our mission is .
our intent is to provide them with reliable and factual information .
getting trustworthy information is an important issue in becoming an open , democratic society .
that 's the reason why the german military always deploys soldiers like me to countries where they 're involved , in order to set up the kind of information structure that is found in developed countries like germany . it all started in somalia in 1993 .
the branch i work in , called operative information , has grown since then .
it 's proven to be a good way to explain to the people -lsb- where we have troops stationed -rsb- why we 're there , but also to react to actions by insurgents or terrorists groups .
we inform the people of the facts surrounding the incidents and do n't let the insurgents get in the people 's heads . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : german troops are stationed in the north we provide information they can sometimes only get from us , because there is no real infrastructure for tv or other media . what do you mean by " information ? "
the word " propaganda " certainly comes to mind with such a program . it 's like a normal radio broadcast in germany .
we provide local news from their province or town , we provide the news from around afghanistan and from all over the world .
the radio hour is divided into four quarters and there is a news section in each quarter .
we mix it up with entertainment and music . who are your listeners ? those who can receive our signal .
we have one station in the capital , kabul , and four more in the north , the territory that is run by the germans .
there are other radio stations run by our allies all over afghanistan . the illiteracy rate is quite high in afghanistan and the tv infrastructure is not as good as in europe , so radio is the easiest way to reach the people .
when soldiers go out to the villages , they give away radios that the people can use to listen to our program . so it 's popular ? it 's quite popular .
we do n't have exact figures , but the latest poll from 2005 showed that the bbc 's program is the most listened to , but the bundeswehr 's " voice of freedom " program came in second .
that represents only five years of work to create a radio program there from scratch . it sounds like a difficult job to produce a program from germany in a foreign language for people living in a different culture .
how do you overcome this challenge ? while we 're in germany , we prepare for the next region we 'll be stationed in .
it 's the soldier stationed in afghanistan who works on a daily basis on the program .
he works together with the local journalists that produce the program in the local languages - in afghanistan these are dari and pashto . we produce extra material here in germany , like a program called " world of knowledge , " with afghan refugees living here , but most of the work is done in afghanistan . who are the local journalists you partner with in afghanistan ? we have an afghan staff .
when i was there last year , we had 13 journalists working in mazar-i-sharif .
they come to work each day , except fridays , and do the program . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : radio is popular because the illiteracy rate is high , said knepper what is essential to know about afghan culture , the political situation there or the media landscape when producing a radio program that 's interesting to the people ? in afghanistan , there 's a lot more talk on the radio .
there 's also a lot of music - both afghan and western music .
but they talk for a long time .
on a german radio program , you would n't have a piece longer than 90 seconds , but in afghanistan sometimes the pieces last for three to five minutes .
maybe it 's a cultural thing - they can concentrate longer than people -lsb- in germany -rsb- . what was your daily job like ? my daily job was to get an overview of the latest local news in the region i was responsible for in the north .
we have correspondents and freelancers providing us daily with news from various provinces .
this has to be checked , and i decided which news to include in our program , as well as what kind of entertainment to use . what criteria do you have for selecting news pieces ? the pieces have to stick to our goals , which are democracy , openness and rule of law .
that is our mandate in these countries .
it was my main job to check whether the news - and the music , as well - kept with these goals . do you think the bundeswehr 's work will help establish a freer and more stable media in afghanistan in the future ? it 's the first step .
we ca n't think short-term .
in the long-term , it 's essential for an open society to have a valid media landscape .
we also contribute by engaging and educating local journalists . what did you learn during your own stay in afghanistan ? the people there are more relaxed .
they 're satisfied with much less than people here in our western society .
it 's a war-torn country and people just want to have a stable and peaceful environment to work and live in .

the first-ever coalition at state level between the green party and angela merkel 's conservatives could be on the cards after the christian democrats lost their absolute majority in hamburg . incumbent mayor ole von beust -lrb- cdu -rrb- has said he is planning to hold a first round of coalition talks with both the green party and the social democrats -lrb- spd -rrb- respectively .
the heads of the two parties signaled on sunday , feb .
24 , that they would , at least , tolerate this mould-breaking coalition .
hamburg 's mayor welcomed this shift .
" i am generally glad that thinking has become more open . "
he also added in his interview with the german broadcaster ndr that chancellor angela merkel had given him a free hand to decide with which party to form a coalition .
referring to a possible coalition with the greens , von beust said it would be interesting .
" but the agenda has got to be right , " he stressed .
playing hard to get ?
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : final results wo n't actually be out until wednesday the leader of hamburg 's greens , christa goetsch , has , however , expressed reservations , saying that she saw little common ground .
local green party members are set to decide on the matter on thursday .
preliminary results from the city state give von beust 42.6 percent , down from 47 percent four years ago .
according to exit polls , the center-left spd gained 34.1 percent , increasing their share of the vote by 4 percent .
the greens dropped from 12.3 to 9.6 percent .
the free-market liberal free democrats did not make the 5-percent hurdle required to enter parliament , while the left party established its presence after taking a 6.4-percent share of the vote .
conventional choices impossible bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : hamburg 's results could affect berlin the results mean that neither the conservatives nor the social democrats can form coalitions with their preferred political partners , fdp and the greens respectively . the situation is made more complicated by the fact that the exact balance of power in the state parliament will not be known until wednesday when the official final results will be announced .
the delay is linked with introduction of a new voting system in the city .
cdu secretary general ronald pofalla -lrb- cdu -rrb- said : " i believe that it would do hamburg good , if there was a coalition between the cdu and the greens . "
he told the german broadcaster n24 that it would be a good opportunity to test this combination .
" we would have the opportunity to see for a year , or a year-and-a-half how this cooperation works . "
at the same time , pofalla stressed in an interview with the radio station bayrischer rundfunk that this did not undermine the future of the current grand coalition between the spd and the conservatives .
" there we have a responsibility to the state , " he said .
green party chairman reinhard buetikofer said the greens would talk to hamburg 's mayor , " if ole von beust wants to talk to us " .
but he warned : " no one should imagine that the greens will form a prop for a mayor , who has lost his majority , and wants to continue his previous policies . "
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : some commentators accuse beck of clumsiness christa sager , a green member of parliament for hamburg , has also spoken out in favor of exploratory talks .
she also blamed the left party for splitting the left-wing vote and preventing the removal of the conservatives altogether .
" the left party has stopped the spd and the green party gaining a majority . "
mathematically speaking , a coalition between the spd , the greens and the left party would be possible in the northern german city , but this has been ruled out by the spd 's top candidate , michael naumann .
kurt beck criticized for possibly ill-timed comments he has criticized national party chairman kurt beck for scaring off some voters by raising the possibility of tacit cooperation with the left party in the state of hesse , where a government has still not been formed four weeks after the vote .
up to now , the social democrats have strictly ruled out working with the party - a broad far-left grouping that includes disaffected former social democrats and former east german communists - in western germany .
several coalitions exist in eastern germany , including in the capital , berlin .
the rise of the party is currently causing a considerable shake-up in germany 's political landscape .
while the last three state elections have seen a swing to the left , this has not translated into a straightforward rise in support for the social democrats .
the split in the vote is leading to parties beginning to think the previously unthinkable . dw staff -lrb- jg -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

25 , after merkel 's party lost sole control in state elections in hamburg , and the spd warmed up to the idea of cooperating with a so-far taboo partner and new political constellations seem likely to shake up german politics . " the grand coalition will continue , but relations will get nastier , " gerd langguth , a political scientist at bonn university told reuters news agency . the cdu lost their overall majority in hamburg after taking 42.7 percent of the vote , while the social democrats increased their share to 34.1 percent from 30.5 percent - albeit by less than it hoped . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : merkel congratulated von beust on getting the most votes in hamburg 's election the results mean that neither the conservatives nor the social democrats can form coalitions with their preferred political partners , the free-market liberal fdp and the greens respectively . the hamburg vote is the second state election in a month to produce inconclusive results and raise the possibility of new partnerships amid growing disillusionment inside merkel 's ruling coalition , which has been at loggerheads in recent months . there are fears that continued bickering would hinder much-needed tax and labor market reforms needed for bolstering germany 's economic recovery as it faces risks from a us slowdown and a strong euro . a path-breaking new alliance the cdu 's preferred political partner , the free-market liberal fdp failed to get into parliament in the hamburg election , leading to the cdu sounding out the greens as coalition partners in the northern german port city . a cdu-greens coalition would be a first in a german state , although the two parties have combined successfully at the municipal level . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : hamburg election results left many wondering what will come next there are several hurdles to such a power-sharing agreement .
incumbent hamburg mayor ole von beust and his cdu are determined to dredge the elbe river to increase the size of europe 's second-largest container port .
they also want a new coal-fired power station . the greens are adamantly opposed to both points , and there are also major differences on education policy . merkel hits out at spd flip-flopping amid the uncertainty in hamburg , merkel on monday lashed out at the spd for eyeing an agreement in the state of hesse with the left party , a grouping of ex-communists and disgruntled social democratic defectors . the left party was the clear winner in the hamburg election , winning a place in a fourth regional parliament in less than a year to establish itself as part of the political landscape in western germany after long being a fixture only in the poorer , former communist east . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the left party 's popularity is growing in western germany " we are now present in legislatures in 10 of germany 's -lsb- 16 -rsb- states .
we are on our way to becoming a party for all of germany , " lothar bisky , president of the left party , said on monday . merkel has blamed the failure of the social democrats to retain their left-wing voter base , much of which has drifted further to the left cast votes for the ex-communists , for the left party 's recent successes .
the left party remains anathema to all of germany 's mainstream parties because of its communist past . however , on monday , the spd 's steering committee effectively backed leader kurt beck and gave the green light to rely on the left party 's votes to get its candidate elected as premier in hesse . merkel said the social democrats had forsaken their credibility by considering a tie-up with the left party after ruling out such a pact in the run-up to the election . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : merkel accused beck , above , of breaking election promises " the social democrats have ... shown themselves in recent weeks not to be reliable , " merkel said in one of her strongest criticisms of her coalition partner , with whom she has shared an awkward relationship at the federal level since 2005 . " this is an experience that will stay in the minds of german people showing you can not rely on what is said before an election , " she added .
" we must expect that this will repeat itself in various ways , and it will be left up to the voter to decide on this in 2009 . " new constellations needed however , many say there is a need for new political constellations in germany where government since world war ii has been dominated by the cdu and the spd , with the fdp , and more recently the greens , often playing the kingmaker . " german democracy is in the creche of a five-party system , it will take time before it can all function properly , " german daily sueddeutsche zeitung wrote on monday , " old resentments must be packed away and new alliances must be risked .

last year he spent several months producing the show on site in the north of the country . dw-world.de : why does the german military produce a radio program for afghans ?
is that typical for regions where it has troops stationed ? sebastian knepper : it 's clear to the soldiers why they 're on the mission , but it 's sometimes not clear to the local people .
it 's their right to know why the german military is there and we have to explain to the people what our mission is .
our intent is to provide them with reliable and factual information .
getting trustworthy information is an important issue in becoming an open , democratic society .
that 's the reason why the german military always deploys soldiers like me to countries where they 're involved , in order to set up the kind of information structure that is found in developed countries like germany . it all started in somalia in 1993 .
the branch i work in , called operative information , has grown since then .
it 's proven to be a good way to explain to the people -lsb- where we have troops stationed -rsb- why we 're there , but also to react to actions by insurgents or terrorists groups .
we inform the people of the facts surrounding the incidents and do n't let the insurgents get in the people 's heads . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : german troops are stationed in the north we provide information they can sometimes only get from us , because there is no real infrastructure for tv or other media . what do you mean by " information ? "
the word " propaganda " certainly comes to mind with such a program . it 's like a normal radio broadcast in germany .
we provide local news from their province or town , we provide the news from around afghanistan and from all over the world .
the radio hour is divided into four quarters and there is a news section in each quarter .
we mix it up with entertainment and music . who are your listeners ? those who can receive our signal .
we have one station in the capital , kabul , and four more in the north , the territory that is run by the germans .
there are other radio stations run by our allies all over afghanistan . the illiteracy rate is quite high in afghanistan and the tv infrastructure is not as good as in europe , so radio is the easiest way to reach the people .
when soldiers go out to the villages , they give away radios that the people can use to listen to our program . so it 's popular ? it 's quite popular .
we do n't have exact figures , but the latest poll from 2005 showed that the bbc 's program is the most listened to , but the bundeswehr 's " voice of freedom " program came in second .
that represents only five years of work to create a radio program there from scratch . it sounds like a difficult job to produce a program from germany in a foreign language for people living in a different culture .
how do you overcome this challenge ? while we 're in germany , we prepare for the next region we 'll be stationed in .
it 's the soldier stationed in afghanistan who works on a daily basis on the program .
he works together with the local journalists that produce the program in the local languages - in afghanistan these are dari and pashto . we produce extra material here in germany , like a program called " world of knowledge , " with afghan refugees living here , but most of the work is done in afghanistan . who are the local journalists you partner with in afghanistan ? we have an afghan staff .
when i was there last year , we had 13 journalists working in mazar-i-sharif .
they come to work each day , except fridays , and do the program . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : radio is popular because the illiteracy rate is high , said knepper what is essential to know about afghan culture , the political situation there or the media landscape when producing a radio program that 's interesting to the people ? in afghanistan , there 's a lot more talk on the radio .
there 's also a lot of music - both afghan and western music .
but they talk for a long time .
on a german radio program , you would n't have a piece longer than 90 seconds , but in afghanistan sometimes the pieces last for three to five minutes .
maybe it 's a cultural thing - they can concentrate longer than people -lsb- in germany -rsb- . what was your daily job like ? my daily job was to get an overview of the latest local news in the region i was responsible for in the north .
we have correspondents and freelancers providing us daily with news from various provinces .
this has to be checked , and i decided which news to include in our program , as well as what kind of entertainment to use . what criteria do you have for selecting news pieces ? the pieces have to stick to our goals , which are democracy , openness and rule of law .
that is our mandate in these countries .
it was my main job to check whether the news - and the music , as well - kept with these goals . do you think the bundeswehr 's work will help establish a freer and more stable media in afghanistan in the future ? it 's the first step .
we ca n't think short-term .
in the long-term , it 's essential for an open society to have a valid media landscape .
we also contribute by engaging and educating local journalists . what did you learn during your own stay in afghanistan ? the people there are more relaxed .
they 're satisfied with much less than people here in our western society .
it 's a war-torn country and people just want to have a stable and peaceful environment to work and live in .
it was impressive to see how eager the people are for peace . click on the link below to listen to an excerpt from the dari-language news program , which reports on the opening of a new school for girls sponsored by the international security assistance force in afghanistan -lrb- isaf -rrb- . interview : kate bowen send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de afghanistan -pipe- 25.02.2008 german military reaches out to afghans on air großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the soldiers distribute radios to the people as germany prepares to send combat troops to northern afghanistan , its military also aims to win over the country by radio . captain sebastian knepper works on the radio program that the german military , the bundeswehr , broadcasts in afghanistan .
last year he spent several months producing the show on site in the north of the country . dw-world.de : why does the german military produce a radio program for afghans ?
is that typical for regions where it has troops stationed ? sebastian knepper : it 's clear to the soldiers why they 're on the mission , but it 's sometimes not clear to the local people .
it 's their right to know why the german military is there and we have to explain to the people what our mission is .
our intent is to provide them with reliable and factual information .
getting trustworthy information is an important issue in becoming an open , democratic society .
that 's the reason why the german military always deploys soldiers like me to countries where they 're involved , in order to set up the kind of information structure that is found in developed countries like germany . it all started in somalia in 1993 .
the branch i work in , called operative information , has grown since then .
it 's proven to be a good way to explain to the people -lsb- where we have troops stationed -rsb- why we 're there , but also to react to actions by insurgents or terrorists groups .
we inform the people of the facts surrounding the incidents and do n't let the insurgents get in the people 's heads . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : german troops are stationed in the north we provide information they can sometimes only get from us , because there is no real infrastructure for tv or other media . what do you mean by " information ? "
the word " propaganda " certainly comes to mind with such a program . it 's like a normal radio broadcast in germany .
we provide local news from their province or town , we provide the news from around afghanistan and from all over the world .
the radio hour is divided into four quarters and there is a news section in each quarter .
we mix it up with entertainment and music . who are your listeners ? those who can receive our signal .
we have one station in the capital , kabul , and four more in the north , the territory that is run by the germans .
there are other radio stations run by our allies all over afghanistan . the illiteracy rate is quite high in afghanistan and the tv infrastructure is not as good as in europe , so radio is the easiest way to reach the people .
when soldiers go out to the villages , they give away radios that the people can use to listen to our program . so it 's popular ? it 's quite popular .
we do n't have exact figures , but the latest poll from 2005 showed that the bbc 's program is the most listened to , but the bundeswehr 's " voice of freedom " program came in second .
that represents only five years of work to create a radio program there from scratch . it sounds like a difficult job to produce a program from germany in a foreign language for people living in a different culture .
how do you overcome this challenge ? while we 're in germany , we prepare for the next region we 'll be stationed in .
it 's the soldier stationed in afghanistan who works on a daily basis on the program .
he works together with the local journalists that produce the program in the local languages - in afghanistan these are dari and pashto . we produce extra material here in germany , like a program called " world of knowledge , " with afghan refugees living here , but most of the work is done in afghanistan . who are the local journalists you partner with in afghanistan ? we have an afghan staff .
when i was there last year , we had 13 journalists working in mazar-i-sharif .
they come to work each day , except fridays , and do the program . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : radio is popular because the illiteracy rate is high , said knepper what is essential to know about afghan culture , the political situation there or the media landscape when producing a radio program that 's interesting to the people ? in afghanistan , there 's a lot more talk on the radio .
there 's also a lot of music - both afghan and western music .
but they talk for a long time .
on a german radio program , you would n't have a piece longer than 90 seconds , but in afghanistan sometimes the pieces last for three to five minutes .
maybe it 's a cultural thing - they can concentrate longer than people -lsb- in germany -rsb- . what was your daily job like ? my daily job was to get an overview of the latest local news in the region i was responsible for in the north .
we have correspondents and freelancers providing us daily with news from various provinces .
this has to be checked , and i decided which news to include in our program , as well as what kind of entertainment to use . what criteria do you have for selecting news pieces ? the pieces have to stick to our goals , which are democracy , openness and rule of law .
that is our mandate in these countries .
it was my main job to check whether the news - and the music , as well - kept with these goals . do you think the bundeswehr 's work will help establish a freer and more stable media in afghanistan in the future ? it 's the first step .

25 , it would provide information to foreign countries whose nationals are involved in the tax evasion affair . " we are going to respond to requests in this regard , " german finance ministry spokesman , thorsten albig told reporters , adding that germany would not charge foreign governments for the information . scandinavians , britons involved in tax affair ? germany 's intelligence service is reported to have paid 4.2 million euros -lrb- $ 6.22 million -rrb- to an informant , a former employee of liechtenstein banking group lgt , for an incriminating list containing the names of hundreds of people who evaded taxes by parking their money in secret bank accounts in the tiny alpine principality of liechtenstein . albig said berlin bought the information because investigators believed that " it could lead to the return of hundreds of thousands of dollars . " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : it 's not just liechtenstein 's scenic beauty that attracts the rich and famous the list is believed to contain the names of more than 700 wealthy germans as well as well-heeled tax cheats from other nations .

" this election proved that our concerns - social justice and economic success - are those of voters . " the vote in the northern city-state was seen as a key test of whether chancellor angela merkel can stem a swing to the political left ahead of next year 's national ballot .
merkel remains highly popular in germany , but her party has seen its support dip in three consecutive state elections this year . another victory for the left with 6.4 percent , the left party - which came out of a merger between a splinter group of disgruntled spd supporters and the heirs of the east german communist party - will take up seats in the hamburg parliament for the first time after gaining entry to three other western german legislature in the past year . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the left now has seats in 10 of germany 's 16 state legislatures the greens , which took 12.3 percent last time , landed at 9.6 percent , while the liberal fdp , which failed to enter the legislature four years ago , increased their share of the vote , but at 4.7 percent still failed to reach the 5-percent hurdle . observers predicted that forming a governing coalition in the port city would be difficult .

24 , confirming a voter swing to the left ahead of federal elections next year . preliminary results from the hamburg election gave no clear indication of what coalition of party 's would have the best chance to lead the port city . christian democrat -lrb- cdu -rrb- ole von beust , a merkel ally who has ruled hamburg since 2001 , won 42.6 percent of the vote , down from 47 percent four years ago , initial results showed . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : mayor beust may soon be wooing the greens the cdu will remain the strongest single party in the state legislature , but without the absolute majority it once enjoyed . the center-left social democrats -lrb- spd -rrb- scored 34.1 percent according to the exit poll , which represents almost a four-point jump in comparison to last elections . " we are the future of germany , " said spd national leader kurt beck after the vote .
" this election proved that our concerns - social justice and economic success - are those of voters . " the vote in the northern city-state was seen as a key test of whether chancellor angela merkel can stem a swing to the political left ahead of next year 's national ballot .
merkel remains highly popular in germany , but her party has seen its support dip in three consecutive state elections this year . another victory for the left with 6.4 percent , the left party - which came out of a merger between a splinter group of disgruntled spd supporters and the heirs of the east german communist party - will take up seats in the hamburg parliament for the first time after gaining entry to three other western german legislature in the past year . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the left now has seats in 10 of germany 's 16 state legislatures the greens , which took 12.3 percent last time , landed at 9.6 percent , while the liberal fdp , which failed to enter the legislature four years ago , increased their share of the vote , but at 4.7 percent still failed to reach the 5-percent hurdle . observers predicted that forming a governing coalition in the port city would be difficult .
neither the conservatives nor the social democrats will be able to form coalitions with their preferred political partners , fdp and the greens , respectively . the conservatives could stay in power if they formed a coalition with the spd - akin to the " grand coalition " on the federal level .
but what appears more likely is that they will try to overcome political differences and reach out to the greens . " i believe it would be good for hamburg and the political landscape in germany if a new combination of the cdu and greens were possible , " cdu secretary general ronald pofalla said .
it would be the first conservative-green party coalition on a state level in germany . at the same time , the spd could - purely mathematically speaking - form the necessary majority with the greens and the left party . campaign issues school reform , environmental policy and expanding the harbor were among the top campaign issues , and the left has managed to garner support with its stress on social justice . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : spd 's michael naumann has ruled out a coalition with the left party but the left party , despite its increasing popularity , is still cold-shouldered by most established political groupings and by many traditional spd voters . a survey published by the sunday edition of the mass circulation daily bild newspaper said spd supporters were so strongly opposed to a pact with the ex-communists that one in four would demand party chief kurt beck 's departure . the spd 's candidate in hamburg , michael naumann , has insisted he would rather remain in opposition than rule with the left , telling reporters : " we will not work with them so we would like to tell voters that every vote for the left is a lost vote .

yet one of germany 's eight remaining mines closed early after being blamed for causing earthquakes . the closure of a coal mine in the western german region of saarland did n't come as a surprise .
residents knew that the german government planned to phase out the subsidies which have propped up the industry for decades .
yet the abrupt closure saturday , feb .
23 , still came as a shock .
or maybe more of a rattle .
a small earthquake caused by the mining shook the region on saturday afternoon .
it 's unclear what caused the seismic shock , which originated in a coal mining operation more than 1 kilometer -lrb- half a mile -rrb- underground near the french border .
the earth quake was small , registering a " light " 4.0 on the richter magnitude scale .
mining era nearing an end bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : mine closures are common in germany in recent years the german government has subsidized coal mining to the tune of more than 160 billion euros -lrb- $ 237 billion -rrb- .
importing coal from abroad makes more sense than propping up domestic mining , the government has said .
the shuttering of the saarland mine is the latest in a series of closures .
last year , the german government announced it would gradually phase out coal mining , which has a 200-year tradition in germany .
germany 's eight remaining coal mines employ approximately 33,000 people .
the phase-out is planned to start in 2009 and will be finished by 2018 , with miners receiving government compensation .
residents all shook up bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the quake shook stones loose the tremor was the strongest on record in the area , rattling pictures on walls , knocking over chimneys and causing electrical outages .
a church in the border town of saarwellingen near the mine was closed to the public as a precautionary measure after the tremor shook stones loose .
after the quake , about 1,000 protestors gathered in saarwellingen to demand an end to the mining work which caused dozens of small tremors in recent months .
about 150,000 people live in the area .
they got backing from the region 's top official , premier peter mueller .
he promised that mining would not be allowed to resume if there was evidence that it could cause further earthquakes .
mueller is scheduled to meet with mining officials monday to discuss the future of mining in the area .
investigators are also expected to spend the next few days searching for the cause of the tremors .

the first-ever coalition at state level between the green party and angela merkel 's conservatives could be on the cards after the christian democrats lost their absolute majority in hamburg . incumbent mayor ole von beust -lrb- cdu -rrb- has said he is planning to hold a first round of coalition talks with both the green party and the social democrats -lrb- spd -rrb- respectively .
the heads of the two parties signaled on sunday , feb .
24 , that they would , at least , tolerate this mould-breaking coalition .
hamburg 's mayor welcomed this shift .
" i am generally glad that thinking has become more open . "
he also added in his interview with the german broadcaster ndr that chancellor angela merkel had given him a free hand to decide with which party to form a coalition .
referring to a possible coalition with the greens , von beust said it would be interesting .
" but the agenda has got to be right , " he stressed .

bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : final results wo n't actually be out until wednesday the leader of hamburg 's greens , christa goetsch , has , however , expressed reservations , saying that she saw little common ground .
local green party members are set to decide on the matter on thursday .
preliminary results from the city state give von beust 42.6 percent , down from 47 percent four years ago .
according to exit polls , the center-left spd gained 34.1 percent , increasing their share of the vote by 4 percent .
the greens dropped from 12.3 to 9.6 percent .
the free-market liberal free democrats did not make the 5-percent hurdle required to enter parliament , while the left party established its presence after taking a 6.4-percent share of the vote .
conventional choices impossible bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : hamburg 's results could affect berlin the results mean that neither the conservatives nor the social democrats can form coalitions with their preferred political partners , fdp and the greens respectively . the situation is made more complicated by the fact that the exact balance of power in the state parliament will not be known until wednesday when the official final results will be announced .
the delay is linked with introduction of a new voting system in the city .
cdu secretary general ronald pofalla -lrb- cdu -rrb- said : " i believe that it would do hamburg good , if there was a coalition between the cdu and the greens . "
he told the german broadcaster n24 that it would be a good opportunity to test this combination .
" we would have the opportunity to see for a year , or a year-and-a-half how this cooperation works . "
at the same time , pofalla stressed in an interview with the radio station bayrischer rundfunk that this did not undermine the future of the current grand coalition between the spd and the conservatives .
" there we have a responsibility to the state , " he said .
green party chairman reinhard buetikofer said the greens would talk to hamburg 's mayor , " if ole von beust wants to talk to us " .
but he warned : " no one should imagine that the greens will form a prop for a mayor , who has lost his majority , and wants to continue his previous policies . "
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : some commentators accuse beck of clumsiness christa sager , a green member of parliament for hamburg , has also spoken out in favor of exploratory talks .
she also blamed the left party for splitting the left-wing vote and preventing the removal of the conservatives altogether .
" the left party has stopped the spd and the green party gaining a majority . "
mathematically speaking , a coalition between the spd , the greens and the left party would be possible in the northern german city , but this has been ruled out by the spd 's top candidate , michael naumann .
kurt beck criticized for possibly ill-timed comments he has criticized national party chairman kurt beck for scaring off some voters by raising the possibility of tacit cooperation with the left party in the state of hesse , where a government has still not been formed four weeks after the vote .
up to now , the social democrats have strictly ruled out working with the party - a broad far-left grouping that includes disaffected former social democrats and former east german communists - in western germany .
several coalitions exist in eastern germany , including in the capital , berlin .
the rise of the party is currently causing a considerable shake-up in germany 's political landscape .
while the last three state elections have seen a swing to the left , this has not translated into a straightforward rise in support for the social democrats .
the split in the vote is leading to parties beginning to think the previously unthinkable . dw staff -lrb- jg -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

" this is an experience that will stay in the minds of german people showing you can not rely on what is said before an election , " she added .
" we must expect that this will repeat itself in various ways , and it will be left up to the voter to decide on this in 2009 . " new constellations needed however , many say there is a need for new political constellations in germany where government since world war ii has been dominated by the cdu and the spd , with the fdp , and more recently the greens , often playing the kingmaker . " german democracy is in the creche of a five-party system , it will take time before it can all function properly , " german daily sueddeutsche zeitung wrote on monday , " old resentments must be packed away and new alliances must be risked .

its first test comes this weekend in saxony . the fifth-division match between locomotive leipzig and kickers markkleeberg on sunday , feb 24 , came under an unusual type of scrutiny .
fearing fan violence , authorities decided to watch over events outside the stadium and in the stands with a camera mounted on a 60,000 euro -lrb- $ 90,000 -rrb- miniature helicopter .
" we 're the first to employ an unmanned drone under real conditions , " saxony police president bernd merbitz told dpa news agency .
" usually we can only see the first row .
if a stone comes flying from a group of people , you ca n't tell who it was . "
authorities said they would have a state prosecutor on site at the markkleeberg stadium to analyze the images taken by the camera and decide whether arrests need to be made .
stadium fears bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : fans of lower-division , eastern german teams have a bad reputation while violence from soccer hooligans is largely under control in the upper divisions , it has repeatedly flared up in the lower leagues , where teams often lack the resources to deal with sometimes drunken crowds and ensure security .
teams from saxony , where social frustration runs relatively high , have often been at the center of the soccer-related fighting .
in late 2006 , dresden dynamo fans ran riot at a match against hertha berlin 's amateur developmental squad .
thirty-eight people were injured in battles between supporters and security guards .
action belongs on the pitch bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : conventional security methods have n't ended the problem and in february 2007 , all matches from the fifth division on down in saxony were cancelled because of doubts that the clubs concerned could keep spectators safe .
saxony police hope that by using high-tech surveillance methods they can keep the action where it belongs - on the pitch .
" we have no intention of stigmatizing true fans , " merbitz said .
" but people should n't always have to be afraid that others will run wild , if the opposing team scores a goal . "
the saxony police 's plan has attracted considerable media attention in the run up to the match this weekend , and those concerned with ending hooliganism will be watching to see whether the miniature eye-in-the-sky actually helps . dw staff -lrb- jc -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

yet one of germany 's eight remaining mines closed early after being blamed for causing earthquakes . the closure of a coal mine in the western german region of saarland did n't come as a surprise .
residents knew that the german government planned to phase out the subsidies which have propped up the industry for decades .
yet the abrupt closure saturday , feb .
23 , still came as a shock .
or maybe more of a rattle .
a small earthquake caused by the mining shook the region on saturday afternoon .
it 's unclear what caused the seismic shock , which originated in a coal mining operation more than 1 kilometer -lrb- half a mile -rrb- underground near the french border .
the earth quake was small , registering a " light " 4.0 on the richter magnitude scale .
mining era nearing an end bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : mine closures are common in germany in recent years the german government has subsidized coal mining to the tune of more than 160 billion euros -lrb- $ 237 billion -rrb- .
importing coal from abroad makes more sense than propping up domestic mining , the government has said .
the shuttering of the saarland mine is the latest in a series of closures .
last year , the german government announced it would gradually phase out coal mining , which has a 200-year tradition in germany .
germany 's eight remaining coal mines employ approximately 33,000 people .
the phase-out is planned to start in 2009 and will be finished by 2018 , with miners receiving government compensation .
residents all shook up bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the quake shook stones loose the tremor was the strongest on record in the area , rattling pictures on walls , knocking over chimneys and causing electrical outages .
a church in the border town of saarwellingen near the mine was closed to the public as a precautionary measure after the tremor shook stones loose .
after the quake , about 1,000 protestors gathered in saarwellingen to demand an end to the mining work which caused dozens of small tremors in recent months .
about 150,000 people live in the area .
they got backing from the region 's top official , premier peter mueller .
he promised that mining would not be allowed to resume if there was evidence that it could cause further earthquakes .
mueller is scheduled to meet with mining officials monday to discuss the future of mining in the area .
investigators are also expected to spend the next few days searching for the cause of the tremors .
closed for now bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : coal mining has a long tradition in germany the hilly , forested region is home to a coal mining operation run by rag deutsche steinkohle .
rag stopped mining at the site until further notice , provisionally laying off 3,600 employees .
the mine near saarwellingen is rag 's only in saarland .
essen-based rag is a group of companies which has chemical , energy and real estate holdings .
rag apologized for the recent tremors in saarland and promised to set up a claim system for those whose property was damaged in the quake .
it remains unclear if the mine will reopen .
it 's the company 's responsibility to demonstrate whether it can " unequivocally eliminate danger to life and limb , " mueller said .
" if it ca n't do that , from my point of view restarting the mining is not possible , " mueller was quoted as saying in the monday edition of the bild newspaper . dw staff -lrb- th -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

yet one of germany 's eight remaining mines closed early after being blamed for causing earthquakes . the closure of a coal mine in the western german region of saarland did n't come as a surprise .
residents knew that the german government planned to phase out the subsidies which have propped up the industry for decades .
yet the abrupt closure saturday , feb .
23 , still came as a shock .
or maybe more of a rattle .
a small earthquake caused by the mining shook the region on saturday afternoon .
it 's unclear what caused the seismic shock , which originated in a coal mining operation more than 1 kilometer -lrb- half a mile -rrb- underground near the french border .
the earth quake was small , registering a " light " 4.0 on the richter magnitude scale .
mining era nearing an end bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : mine closures are common in germany in recent years the german government has subsidized coal mining to the tune of more than 160 billion euros -lrb- $ 237 billion -rrb- .
importing coal from abroad makes more sense than propping up domestic mining , the government has said .
the shuttering of the saarland mine is the latest in a series of closures .
last year , the german government announced it would gradually phase out coal mining , which has a 200-year tradition in germany .
germany 's eight remaining coal mines employ approximately 33,000 people .
the phase-out is planned to start in 2009 and will be finished by 2018 , with miners receiving government compensation .
residents all shook up bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the quake shook stones loose the tremor was the strongest on record in the area , rattling pictures on walls , knocking over chimneys and causing electrical outages .
a church in the border town of saarwellingen near the mine was closed to the public as a precautionary measure after the tremor shook stones loose .
after the quake , about 1,000 protestors gathered in saarwellingen to demand an end to the mining work which caused dozens of small tremors in recent months .
about 150,000 people live in the area .
they got backing from the region 's top official , premier peter mueller .
he promised that mining would not be allowed to resume if there was evidence that it could cause further earthquakes .
mueller is scheduled to meet with mining officials monday to discuss the future of mining in the area .
investigators are also expected to spend the next few days searching for the cause of the tremors .
closed for now bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : coal mining has a long tradition in germany the hilly , forested region is home to a coal mining operation run by rag deutsche steinkohle .
rag stopped mining at the site until further notice , provisionally laying off 3,600 employees .
the mine near saarwellingen is rag 's only in saarland .
essen-based rag is a group of companies which has chemical , energy and real estate holdings .
rag apologized for the recent tremors in saarland and promised to set up a claim system for those whose property was damaged in the quake .
it remains unclear if the mine will reopen .
it 's the company 's responsibility to demonstrate whether it can " unequivocally eliminate danger to life and limb , " mueller said .
" if it ca n't do that , from my point of view restarting the mining is not possible , " mueller was quoted as saying in the monday edition of the bild newspaper . dw staff -lrb- th -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

the first-ever coalition at state level between the green party and angela merkel 's conservatives could be on the cards after the christian democrats lost their absolute majority in hamburg . incumbent mayor ole von beust -lrb- cdu -rrb- has said he is planning to hold a first round of coalition talks with both the green party and the social democrats -lrb- spd -rrb- respectively .
the heads of the two parties signaled on sunday , feb .
24 , that they would , at least , tolerate this mould-breaking coalition .
hamburg 's mayor welcomed this shift .
" i am generally glad that thinking has become more open . "
he also added in his interview with the german broadcaster ndr that chancellor angela merkel had given him a free hand to decide with which party to form a coalition .
referring to a possible coalition with the greens , von beust said it would be interesting .
" but the agenda has got to be right , " he stressed .
playing hard to get ?
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : final results wo n't actually be out until wednesday the leader of hamburg 's greens , christa goetsch , has , however , expressed reservations , saying that she saw little common ground .
local green party members are set to decide on the matter on thursday .
preliminary results from the city state give von beust 42.6 percent , down from 47 percent four years ago .
according to exit polls , the center-left spd gained 34.1 percent , increasing their share of the vote by 4 percent .
the greens dropped from 12.3 to 9.6 percent .
the free-market liberal free democrats did not make the 5-percent hurdle required to enter parliament , while the left party established its presence after taking a 6.4-percent share of the vote .
conventional choices impossible bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : hamburg 's results could affect berlin the results mean that neither the conservatives nor the social democrats can form coalitions with their preferred political partners , fdp and the greens respectively . the situation is made more complicated by the fact that the exact balance of power in the state parliament will not be known until wednesday when the official final results will be announced .
the delay is linked with introduction of a new voting system in the city .
cdu secretary general ronald pofalla -lrb- cdu -rrb- said : " i believe that it would do hamburg good , if there was a coalition between the cdu and the greens . "
he told the german broadcaster n24 that it would be a good opportunity to test this combination .
" we would have the opportunity to see for a year , or a year-and-a-half how this cooperation works . "
at the same time , pofalla stressed in an interview with the radio station bayrischer rundfunk that this did not undermine the future of the current grand coalition between the spd and the conservatives .
" there we have a responsibility to the state , " he said .
green party chairman reinhard buetikofer said the greens would talk to hamburg 's mayor , " if ole von beust wants to talk to us " .
but he warned : " no one should imagine that the greens will form a prop for a mayor , who has lost his majority , and wants to continue his previous policies . "
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : some commentators accuse beck of clumsiness christa sager , a green member of parliament for hamburg , has also spoken out in favor of exploratory talks .
she also blamed the left party for splitting the left-wing vote and preventing the removal of the conservatives altogether .
" the left party has stopped the spd and the green party gaining a majority . "
mathematically speaking , a coalition between the spd , the greens and the left party would be possible in the northern german city , but this has been ruled out by the spd 's top candidate , michael naumann .
kurt beck criticized for possibly ill-timed comments he has criticized national party chairman kurt beck for scaring off some voters by raising the possibility of tacit cooperation with the left party in the state of hesse , where a government has still not been formed four weeks after the vote .
up to now , the social democrats have strictly ruled out working with the party - a broad far-left grouping that includes disaffected former social democrats and former east german communists - in western germany .
several coalitions exist in eastern germany , including in the capital , berlin .
the rise of the party is currently causing a considerable shake-up in germany 's political landscape .
while the last three state elections have seen a swing to the left , this has not translated into a straightforward rise in support for the social democrats .

the first-ever coalition at state level between the green party and angela merkel 's conservatives could be on the cards after the christian democrats lost their absolute majority in hamburg . incumbent mayor ole von beust -lrb- cdu -rrb- has said he is planning to hold a first round of coalition talks with both the green party and the social democrats -lrb- spd -rrb- respectively .
the heads of the two parties signaled on sunday , feb .
24 , that they would , at least , tolerate this mould-breaking coalition .
hamburg 's mayor welcomed this shift .
" i am generally glad that thinking has become more open . "
he also added in his interview with the german broadcaster ndr that chancellor angela merkel had given him a free hand to decide with which party to form a coalition .
referring to a possible coalition with the greens , von beust said it would be interesting .
" but the agenda has got to be right , " he stressed .

local green party members are set to decide on the matter on thursday .
preliminary results from the city state give von beust 42.6 percent , down from 47 percent four years ago .
according to exit polls , the center-left spd gained 34.1 percent , increasing their share of the vote by 4 percent .
the greens dropped from 12.3 to 9.6 percent .
the free-market liberal free democrats did not make the 5-percent hurdle required to enter parliament , while the left party established its presence after taking a 6.4-percent share of the vote .
conventional choices impossible bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : hamburg 's results could affect berlin the results mean that neither the conservatives nor the social democrats can form coalitions with their preferred political partners , fdp and the greens respectively . the situation is made more complicated by the fact that the exact balance of power in the state parliament will not be known until wednesday when the official final results will be announced .
the delay is linked with introduction of a new voting system in the city .
cdu secretary general ronald pofalla -lrb- cdu -rrb- said : " i believe that it would do hamburg good , if there was a coalition between the cdu and the greens . "
he told the german broadcaster n24 that it would be a good opportunity to test this combination .
" we would have the opportunity to see for a year , or a year-and-a-half how this cooperation works . "
at the same time , pofalla stressed in an interview with the radio station bayrischer rundfunk that this did not undermine the future of the current grand coalition between the spd and the conservatives .
" there we have a responsibility to the state , " he said .
green party chairman reinhard buetikofer said the greens would talk to hamburg 's mayor , " if ole von beust wants to talk to us " .
but he warned : " no one should imagine that the greens will form a prop for a mayor , who has lost his majority , and wants to continue his previous policies . "
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : some commentators accuse beck of clumsiness christa sager , a green member of parliament for hamburg , has also spoken out in favor of exploratory talks .
she also blamed the left party for splitting the left-wing vote and preventing the removal of the conservatives altogether .
" the left party has stopped the spd and the green party gaining a majority . "
mathematically speaking , a coalition between the spd , the greens and the left party would be possible in the northern german city , but this has been ruled out by the spd 's top candidate , michael naumann .
kurt beck criticized for possibly ill-timed comments he has criticized national party chairman kurt beck for scaring off some voters by raising the possibility of tacit cooperation with the left party in the state of hesse , where a government has still not been formed four weeks after the vote .
up to now , the social democrats have strictly ruled out working with the party - a broad far-left grouping that includes disaffected former social democrats and former east german communists - in western germany .
several coalitions exist in eastern germany , including in the capital , berlin .
the rise of the party is currently causing a considerable shake-up in germany 's political landscape .

last year he spent several months producing the show on site in the north of the country . dw-world.de : why does the german military produce a radio program for afghans ?
is that typical for regions where it has troops stationed ? sebastian knepper : it 's clear to the soldiers why they 're on the mission , but it 's sometimes not clear to the local people .
it 's their right to know why the german military is there and we have to explain to the people what our mission is .
our intent is to provide them with reliable and factual information .
getting trustworthy information is an important issue in becoming an open , democratic society .
that 's the reason why the german military always deploys soldiers like me to countries where they 're involved , in order to set up the kind of information structure that is found in developed countries like germany . it all started in somalia in 1993 .
the branch i work in , called operative information , has grown since then .
it 's proven to be a good way to explain to the people -lsb- where we have troops stationed -rsb- why we 're there , but also to react to actions by insurgents or terrorists groups .
we inform the people of the facts surrounding the incidents and do n't let the insurgents get in the people 's heads . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : german troops are stationed in the north we provide information they can sometimes only get from us , because there is no real infrastructure for tv or other media . what do you mean by " information ? "
the word " propaganda " certainly comes to mind with such a program . it 's like a normal radio broadcast in germany .
we provide local news from their province or town , we provide the news from around afghanistan and from all over the world .
the radio hour is divided into four quarters and there is a news section in each quarter .
we mix it up with entertainment and music . who are your listeners ? those who can receive our signal .
we have one station in the capital , kabul , and four more in the north , the territory that is run by the germans .
there are other radio stations run by our allies all over afghanistan . the illiteracy rate is quite high in afghanistan and the tv infrastructure is not as good as in europe , so radio is the easiest way to reach the people .
when soldiers go out to the villages , they give away radios that the people can use to listen to our program . so it 's popular ? it 's quite popular .
we do n't have exact figures , but the latest poll from 2005 showed that the bbc 's program is the most listened to , but the bundeswehr 's " voice of freedom " program came in second .
that represents only five years of work to create a radio program there from scratch . it sounds like a difficult job to produce a program from germany in a foreign language for people living in a different culture .
how do you overcome this challenge ? while we 're in germany , we prepare for the next region we 'll be stationed in .
it 's the soldier stationed in afghanistan who works on a daily basis on the program .
he works together with the local journalists that produce the program in the local languages - in afghanistan these are dari and pashto . we produce extra material here in germany , like a program called " world of knowledge , " with afghan refugees living here , but most of the work is done in afghanistan . who are the local journalists you partner with in afghanistan ? we have an afghan staff .
when i was there last year , we had 13 journalists working in mazar-i-sharif .
they come to work each day , except fridays , and do the program . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : radio is popular because the illiteracy rate is high , said knepper what is essential to know about afghan culture , the political situation there or the media landscape when producing a radio program that 's interesting to the people ? in afghanistan , there 's a lot more talk on the radio .
there 's also a lot of music - both afghan and western music .
but they talk for a long time .
on a german radio program , you would n't have a piece longer than 90 seconds , but in afghanistan sometimes the pieces last for three to five minutes .
maybe it 's a cultural thing - they can concentrate longer than people -lsb- in germany -rsb- . what was your daily job like ? my daily job was to get an overview of the latest local news in the region i was responsible for in the north .
we have correspondents and freelancers providing us daily with news from various provinces .
this has to be checked , and i decided which news to include in our program , as well as what kind of entertainment to use . what criteria do you have for selecting news pieces ? the pieces have to stick to our goals , which are democracy , openness and rule of law .
that is our mandate in these countries .
it was my main job to check whether the news - and the music , as well - kept with these goals . do you think the bundeswehr 's work will help establish a freer and more stable media in afghanistan in the future ? it 's the first step .
we ca n't think short-term .
in the long-term , it 's essential for an open society to have a valid media landscape .
we also contribute by engaging and educating local journalists . what did you learn during your own stay in afghanistan ? the people there are more relaxed .
they 're satisfied with much less than people here in our western society .
it 's a war-torn country and people just want to have a stable and peaceful environment to work and live in .
it was impressive to see how eager the people are for peace . click on the link below to listen to an excerpt from the dari-language news program , which reports on the opening of a new school for girls sponsored by the international security assistance force in afghanistan -lrb- isaf -rrb- . interview : kate bowen send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

last year he spent several months producing the show on site in the north of the country . dw-world.de : why does the german military produce a radio program for afghans ?
is that typical for regions where it has troops stationed ? sebastian knepper : it 's clear to the soldiers why they 're on the mission , but it 's sometimes not clear to the local people .
it 's their right to know why the german military is there and we have to explain to the people what our mission is .
our intent is to provide them with reliable and factual information .
getting trustworthy information is an important issue in becoming an open , democratic society .
that 's the reason why the german military always deploys soldiers like me to countries where they 're involved , in order to set up the kind of information structure that is found in developed countries like germany . it all started in somalia in 1993 .
the branch i work in , called operative information , has grown since then .
it 's proven to be a good way to explain to the people -lsb- where we have troops stationed -rsb- why we 're there , but also to react to actions by insurgents or terrorists groups .
we inform the people of the facts surrounding the incidents and do n't let the insurgents get in the people 's heads . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : german troops are stationed in the north we provide information they can sometimes only get from us , because there is no real infrastructure for tv or other media . what do you mean by " information ? "
the word " propaganda " certainly comes to mind with such a program . it 's like a normal radio broadcast in germany .
we provide local news from their province or town , we provide the news from around afghanistan and from all over the world .
the radio hour is divided into four quarters and there is a news section in each quarter .
we mix it up with entertainment and music . who are your listeners ? those who can receive our signal .
we have one station in the capital , kabul , and four more in the north , the territory that is run by the germans .
there are other radio stations run by our allies all over afghanistan . the illiteracy rate is quite high in afghanistan and the tv infrastructure is not as good as in europe , so radio is the easiest way to reach the people .
when soldiers go out to the villages , they give away radios that the people can use to listen to our program . so it 's popular ? it 's quite popular .
we do n't have exact figures , but the latest poll from 2005 showed that the bbc 's program is the most listened to , but the bundeswehr 's " voice of freedom " program came in second .
that represents only five years of work to create a radio program there from scratch . it sounds like a difficult job to produce a program from germany in a foreign language for people living in a different culture .
how do you overcome this challenge ? while we 're in germany , we prepare for the next region we 'll be stationed in .
it 's the soldier stationed in afghanistan who works on a daily basis on the program .
he works together with the local journalists that produce the program in the local languages - in afghanistan these are dari and pashto . we produce extra material here in germany , like a program called " world of knowledge , " with afghan refugees living here , but most of the work is done in afghanistan . who are the local journalists you partner with in afghanistan ? we have an afghan staff .
when i was there last year , we had 13 journalists working in mazar-i-sharif .
they come to work each day , except fridays , and do the program . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : radio is popular because the illiteracy rate is high , said knepper what is essential to know about afghan culture , the political situation there or the media landscape when producing a radio program that 's interesting to the people ? in afghanistan , there 's a lot more talk on the radio .
there 's also a lot of music - both afghan and western music .
but they talk for a long time .
on a german radio program , you would n't have a piece longer than 90 seconds , but in afghanistan sometimes the pieces last for three to five minutes .
maybe it 's a cultural thing - they can concentrate longer than people -lsb- in germany -rsb- . what was your daily job like ? my daily job was to get an overview of the latest local news in the region i was responsible for in the north .
we have correspondents and freelancers providing us daily with news from various provinces .
this has to be checked , and i decided which news to include in our program , as well as what kind of entertainment to use . what criteria do you have for selecting news pieces ? the pieces have to stick to our goals , which are democracy , openness and rule of law .
that is our mandate in these countries .
it was my main job to check whether the news - and the music , as well - kept with these goals . do you think the bundeswehr 's work will help establish a freer and more stable media in afghanistan in the future ? it 's the first step .
we ca n't think short-term .
in the long-term , it 's essential for an open society to have a valid media landscape .
we also contribute by engaging and educating local journalists . what did you learn during your own stay in afghanistan ? the people there are more relaxed .

yet the process is likely to be slow and difficult . in an acceptance speech before a stadium of cheering supporters after polls closed sunday , feb .
24 , christofias said he 'd already spoken with turkish cypriot leader mehmet ali talat about arranging a meeting .
" i offer a hand of friendship and cooperation to the turkish cypriots and their leadership .
i urge them to work together with us for the common good of the people in a climate of peace , " christofias said sunday .
talat , who heads the breakaway turkish republic of northern cyprus , called christofias to congratulate him shortly after his win , and the two have agreed to meet , an aide to talat told afp .
reunification became a major election theme as cypriots signaled their frustration with the former government 's unwillingness to negotiate .
christofias ' election victory has revived hopes that a peace process can be resumed .
country remains divided bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : cyprus remains visibly divided the last round of talks broke down in 2004 after greek cypriots rejected a united nations plan and joined the european union alone .
the mediterranean island , a former british colony and favorite tourist destination , has been divided since an athens-supported coup in 1974 caused the turkish government to send troops into the north .
the turkish republic of northern cyprus is recognized only by ankara , which has 30,000 troops stationed there .
the greek cypriot government in the south , which is internationally recognized , is separated from the northern half of the island by a un-controlled " green line . "
the ongoing tensions have complicated the relationship between greece and turkey and been an obstacle to turkey 's efforts to join the eu .
papadopoulos ' surprising defeat bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : dimitris christofias wants to restart negotiations but cypriots signaled they were ready for a changed during the first round of presidential elections on feb .
17 .
in a surprise result , incumbent tassos papadopoulos , who had taken a hard-line stance against negotiations , was eliminated from the race .
christofias , of the communist akel party , won 53.36 percent of the votes .
his rival , ionnis kasoulides , a conservative and former foreign minister , received 46.64 percent of the votes .
after the first round of voting , the two leading candidates began courting supporters of parties which had backed papadopoulos .
christofias picked up the endorsement of three small parties after making important concessions .
christofias reportedly promised the center-right diko party of papadopoulos three ministries , including foreign affairs , and the socialist edek party two .
the deal could make it more difficult to enter into negotiations with turkish cypriots as the diko and edek parties have historically been less flexible .
experts have warned that any negotiation process that could lead to reunification will be slow and difficult .
communists score a win bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : talat has agreed to a meeting soviet-educated christofias , 62 , is the only communist leader in the 27-member eu and the first to lead cyprus .
christofias has said he will not interfere with the country 's market economy , despite his party 's leninist roots .
the election results have also worried some in the eu as christofias ' akel party has strong ties with moscow and is considered skeptical of the eu and nato .
christofias has rejected claims that he 's anti-european and said he will not nationalize the economy or do away with any international agreements .
christofias will serve a five-year term .
christofias said his first order of business would be to pursue un-mediated peace talks .

" i offer a hand of friendship and cooperation to the turkish cypriots and their leadership .
i urge them to work together with us for the common good of the people in a climate of peace , " christofias said sunday .
talat , who heads the breakaway turkish republic of northern cyprus , called christofias to congratulate him shortly after his win , and the two have agreed to meet , an aide to talat told afp .
reunification became a major election theme as cypriots signaled their frustration with the former government 's unwillingness to negotiate .
christofias ' election victory has revived hopes that a peace process can be resumed .
country remains divided bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : cyprus remains visibly divided the last round of talks broke down in 2004 after greek cypriots rejected a united nations plan and joined the european union alone .
the mediterranean island , a former british colony and favorite tourist destination , has been divided since an athens-supported coup in 1974 caused the turkish government to send troops into the north .
the turkish republic of northern cyprus is recognized only by ankara , which has 30,000 troops stationed there .
the greek cypriot government in the south , which is internationally recognized , is separated from the northern half of the island by a un-controlled " green line . "

christofias , of the communist akel party , won 53.36 percent of the votes .
his rival , ionnis kasoulides , a conservative and former foreign minister , received 46.64 percent of the votes .
after the first round of voting , the two leading candidates began courting supporters of parties which had backed papadopoulos .
christofias picked up the endorsement of three small parties after making important concessions .
christofias reportedly promised the center-right diko party of papadopoulos three ministries , including foreign affairs , and the socialist edek party two .
the deal could make it more difficult to enter into negotiations with turkish cypriots as the diko and edek parties have historically been less flexible .

last year he spent several months producing the show on site in the north of the country . dw-world.de : why does the german military produce a radio program for afghans ?
is that typical for regions where it has troops stationed ? sebastian knepper : it 's clear to the soldiers why they 're on the mission , but it 's sometimes not clear to the local people .
it 's their right to know why the german military is there and we have to explain to the people what our mission is .
our intent is to provide them with reliable and factual information .
getting trustworthy information is an important issue in becoming an open , democratic society .
that 's the reason why the german military always deploys soldiers like me to countries where they 're involved , in order to set up the kind of information structure that is found in developed countries like germany . it all started in somalia in 1993 .
the branch i work in , called operative information , has grown since then .
it 's proven to be a good way to explain to the people -lsb- where we have troops stationed -rsb- why we 're there , but also to react to actions by insurgents or terrorists groups .
we inform the people of the facts surrounding the incidents and do n't let the insurgents get in the people 's heads . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : german troops are stationed in the north we provide information they can sometimes only get from us , because there is no real infrastructure for tv or other media . what do you mean by " information ? "
the word " propaganda " certainly comes to mind with such a program . it 's like a normal radio broadcast in germany .
we provide local news from their province or town , we provide the news from around afghanistan and from all over the world .
the radio hour is divided into four quarters and there is a news section in each quarter .
we mix it up with entertainment and music . who are your listeners ? those who can receive our signal .
we have one station in the capital , kabul , and four more in the north , the territory that is run by the germans .
there are other radio stations run by our allies all over afghanistan . the illiteracy rate is quite high in afghanistan and the tv infrastructure is not as good as in europe , so radio is the easiest way to reach the people .
when soldiers go out to the villages , they give away radios that the people can use to listen to our program . so it 's popular ? it 's quite popular .
we do n't have exact figures , but the latest poll from 2005 showed that the bbc 's program is the most listened to , but the bundeswehr 's " voice of freedom " program came in second .
that represents only five years of work to create a radio program there from scratch . it sounds like a difficult job to produce a program from germany in a foreign language for people living in a different culture .
how do you overcome this challenge ? while we 're in germany , we prepare for the next region we 'll be stationed in .
it 's the soldier stationed in afghanistan who works on a daily basis on the program .
he works together with the local journalists that produce the program in the local languages - in afghanistan these are dari and pashto . we produce extra material here in germany , like a program called " world of knowledge , " with afghan refugees living here , but most of the work is done in afghanistan . who are the local journalists you partner with in afghanistan ? we have an afghan staff .
when i was there last year , we had 13 journalists working in mazar-i-sharif .
they come to work each day , except fridays , and do the program . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : radio is popular because the illiteracy rate is high , said knepper what is essential to know about afghan culture , the political situation there or the media landscape when producing a radio program that 's interesting to the people ? in afghanistan , there 's a lot more talk on the radio .
there 's also a lot of music - both afghan and western music .
but they talk for a long time .
on a german radio program , you would n't have a piece longer than 90 seconds , but in afghanistan sometimes the pieces last for three to five minutes .
maybe it 's a cultural thing - they can concentrate longer than people -lsb- in germany -rsb- . what was your daily job like ? my daily job was to get an overview of the latest local news in the region i was responsible for in the north .
we have correspondents and freelancers providing us daily with news from various provinces .
this has to be checked , and i decided which news to include in our program , as well as what kind of entertainment to use . what criteria do you have for selecting news pieces ? the pieces have to stick to our goals , which are democracy , openness and rule of law .
that is our mandate in these countries .
it was my main job to check whether the news - and the music , as well - kept with these goals . do you think the bundeswehr 's work will help establish a freer and more stable media in afghanistan in the future ? it 's the first step .
we ca n't think short-term .
in the long-term , it 's essential for an open society to have a valid media landscape .
we also contribute by engaging and educating local journalists . what did you learn during your own stay in afghanistan ? the people there are more relaxed .
they 're satisfied with much less than people here in our western society .
it 's a war-torn country and people just want to have a stable and peaceful environment to work and live in .
it was impressive to see how eager the people are for peace . click on the link below to listen to an excerpt from the dari-language news program , which reports on the opening of a new school for girls sponsored by the international security assistance force in afghanistan -lrb- isaf -rrb- . interview : kate bowen send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de afghanistan -pipe- 25.02.2008 german military reaches out to afghans on air großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the soldiers distribute radios to the people as germany prepares to send combat troops to northern afghanistan , its military also aims to win over the country by radio . captain sebastian knepper works on the radio program that the german military , the bundeswehr , broadcasts in afghanistan .
last year he spent several months producing the show on site in the north of the country . dw-world.de : why does the german military produce a radio program for afghans ?
is that typical for regions where it has troops stationed ? sebastian knepper : it 's clear to the soldiers why they 're on the mission , but it 's sometimes not clear to the local people .
it 's their right to know why the german military is there and we have to explain to the people what our mission is .
our intent is to provide them with reliable and factual information .
getting trustworthy information is an important issue in becoming an open , democratic society .
that 's the reason why the german military always deploys soldiers like me to countries where they 're involved , in order to set up the kind of information structure that is found in developed countries like germany . it all started in somalia in 1993 .
the branch i work in , called operative information , has grown since then .
it 's proven to be a good way to explain to the people -lsb- where we have troops stationed -rsb- why we 're there , but also to react to actions by insurgents or terrorists groups .
we inform the people of the facts surrounding the incidents and do n't let the insurgents get in the people 's heads . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : german troops are stationed in the north we provide information they can sometimes only get from us , because there is no real infrastructure for tv or other media . what do you mean by " information ? "
the word " propaganda " certainly comes to mind with such a program . it 's like a normal radio broadcast in germany .
we provide local news from their province or town , we provide the news from around afghanistan and from all over the world .
the radio hour is divided into four quarters and there is a news section in each quarter .
we mix it up with entertainment and music . who are your listeners ? those who can receive our signal .
we have one station in the capital , kabul , and four more in the north , the territory that is run by the germans .
there are other radio stations run by our allies all over afghanistan . the illiteracy rate is quite high in afghanistan and the tv infrastructure is not as good as in europe , so radio is the easiest way to reach the people .
when soldiers go out to the villages , they give away radios that the people can use to listen to our program . so it 's popular ? it 's quite popular .
we do n't have exact figures , but the latest poll from 2005 showed that the bbc 's program is the most listened to , but the bundeswehr 's " voice of freedom " program came in second .
that represents only five years of work to create a radio program there from scratch . it sounds like a difficult job to produce a program from germany in a foreign language for people living in a different culture .
how do you overcome this challenge ? while we 're in germany , we prepare for the next region we 'll be stationed in .
it 's the soldier stationed in afghanistan who works on a daily basis on the program .
he works together with the local journalists that produce the program in the local languages - in afghanistan these are dari and pashto . we produce extra material here in germany , like a program called " world of knowledge , " with afghan refugees living here , but most of the work is done in afghanistan . who are the local journalists you partner with in afghanistan ? we have an afghan staff .
when i was there last year , we had 13 journalists working in mazar-i-sharif .
they come to work each day , except fridays , and do the program . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : radio is popular because the illiteracy rate is high , said knepper what is essential to know about afghan culture , the political situation there or the media landscape when producing a radio program that 's interesting to the people ? in afghanistan , there 's a lot more talk on the radio .
there 's also a lot of music - both afghan and western music .
but they talk for a long time .
on a german radio program , you would n't have a piece longer than 90 seconds , but in afghanistan sometimes the pieces last for three to five minutes .
maybe it 's a cultural thing - they can concentrate longer than people -lsb- in germany -rsb- . what was your daily job like ? my daily job was to get an overview of the latest local news in the region i was responsible for in the north .
we have correspondents and freelancers providing us daily with news from various provinces .
this has to be checked , and i decided which news to include in our program , as well as what kind of entertainment to use . what criteria do you have for selecting news pieces ? the pieces have to stick to our goals , which are democracy , openness and rule of law .
that is our mandate in these countries .
it was my main job to check whether the news - and the music , as well - kept with these goals . do you think the bundeswehr 's work will help establish a freer and more stable media in afghanistan in the future ? it 's the first step .
we ca n't think short-term .
in the long-term , it 's essential for an open society to have a valid media landscape .
we also contribute by engaging and educating local journalists . what did you learn during your own stay in afghanistan ? the people there are more relaxed .
they 're satisfied with much less than people here in our western society .
it 's a war-torn country and people just want to have a stable and peaceful environment to work and live in .
it was impressive to see how eager the people are for peace . click on the link below to listen to an excerpt from the dari-language news program , which reports on the opening of a new school for girls sponsored by the international security assistance force in afghanistan -lrb- isaf -rrb- . interview : kate bowen send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

25 , it would provide information to foreign countries whose nationals are involved in the tax evasion affair . " we are going to respond to requests in this regard , " german finance ministry spokesman , thorsten albig told reporters , adding that germany would not charge foreign governments for the information . scandinavians , britons involved in tax affair ? germany 's intelligence service is reported to have paid 4.2 million euros -lrb- $ 6.22 million -rrb- to an informant , a former employee of liechtenstein banking group lgt , for an incriminating list containing the names of hundreds of people who evaded taxes by parking their money in secret bank accounts in the tiny alpine principality of liechtenstein . albig said berlin bought the information because investigators believed that " it could lead to the return of hundreds of thousands of dollars . " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : it 's not just liechtenstein 's scenic beauty that attracts the rich and famous the list is believed to contain the names of more than 700 wealthy germans as well as well-heeled tax cheats from other nations .
the disclosure has prompted a massive investigation in germany and frayed ties between berlin and liechtenstein capital , vaduz . germany 's handelsblatt business daily reported that finland , sweden and norway had signaled interest in getting their hands on the list of bank clients . joining the german crackdown on tax evaders , the british government 's tax agency said on monday it too had paid for information on secret liechtenstein bank accounts held by british citizens .
media reports said britain paid a whistleblower 100,000 pounds -lrb- 132,931 euros , $ 196,000 -rrb- for details of liechtenstein accounts held by 100 wealthy britons .
unpaid taxes in the affair could amount to as much as 100 million pounds , reports said . the financial times reported that britain had refused two years ago to pay the whistleblower but changed its mind after germany shelled out money to get similar information . the tax scandal also made waves across the atlantic as a senior us lawmaker said last week he would launch an investigation into american citizens also believed to have hid assets at lgt . high-profile victim the investigation into the tax evasion scandal , considered one of the biggest in german history , began earlier this month with raids on the home and offices of klaus zumwinkel , the high-profile boss of deutsche post , europe 's largest postal service , who is suspected of having dodged taxes to the tune of 1 million euros .
zumwinkel has since resigned his post . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : zumwinkel 's fall from grace was rapid ever since , german authorities have been conducting raids across the country on private individuals for allegedly hiding money in accounts liechtenstein 's biggest private bank , the lgt group , which specializes in setting up foundations and is owned by liechtenstein 's royal family . the affair has angered ordinary germans and sparked a heated debate about the ethics and accountability of the country 's highly-paid business elite . anger over " stolen information " equally , the german government 's payment for the incriminating information , which was allegedly stolen from the liechtenstein bank by the former lgt employee , has come under intense scrutiny . on monday , the lgt bank voiced anger at how the " stolen information " was being shared around european capitals . " apparently , the stolen data material has also been illegally disclosed , directly or indirectly , to other authorities , " the bank said in a statement .
" lgt regards such methods as being extremely offensive . " the affair has also raised questions about banking secrecy laws enjoyed by some european nations .
liechtenstein is one of only three countries on the oecd 's tax-haven black-list , alongside andorra and monaco .
germany has vowed to broaden efforts to crack down on tax evasion to countries such as switzerland , luxembourg and austria as well . switzerland and luxembourg have distanced themselves from the charges .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de afghanistan -pipe- 25.02.2008 german military reaches out to afghans on air großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the soldiers distribute radios to the people as germany prepares to send combat troops to northern afghanistan , its military also aims to win over the country by radio . captain sebastian knepper works on the radio program that the german military , the bundeswehr , broadcasts in afghanistan .
last year he spent several months producing the show on site in the north of the country . dw-world.de : why does the german military produce a radio program for afghans ?
is that typical for regions where it has troops stationed ? sebastian knepper : it 's clear to the soldiers why they 're on the mission , but it 's sometimes not clear to the local people .
it 's their right to know why the german military is there and we have to explain to the people what our mission is .
our intent is to provide them with reliable and factual information .
getting trustworthy information is an important issue in becoming an open , democratic society .
that 's the reason why the german military always deploys soldiers like me to countries where they 're involved , in order to set up the kind of information structure that is found in developed countries like germany . it all started in somalia in 1993 .
the branch i work in , called operative information , has grown since then .
it 's proven to be a good way to explain to the people -lsb- where we have troops stationed -rsb- why we 're there , but also to react to actions by insurgents or terrorists groups .
we inform the people of the facts surrounding the incidents and do n't let the insurgents get in the people 's heads . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : german troops are stationed in the north we provide information they can sometimes only get from us , because there is no real infrastructure for tv or other media . what do you mean by " information ? "
the word " propaganda " certainly comes to mind with such a program . it 's like a normal radio broadcast in germany .
we provide local news from their province or town , we provide the news from around afghanistan and from all over the world .
the radio hour is divided into four quarters and there is a news section in each quarter .
we mix it up with entertainment and music . who are your listeners ? those who can receive our signal .
we have one station in the capital , kabul , and four more in the north , the territory that is run by the germans .
there are other radio stations run by our allies all over afghanistan . the illiteracy rate is quite high in afghanistan and the tv infrastructure is not as good as in europe , so radio is the easiest way to reach the people .
when soldiers go out to the villages , they give away radios that the people can use to listen to our program . so it 's popular ? it 's quite popular .
we do n't have exact figures , but the latest poll from 2005 showed that the bbc 's program is the most listened to , but the bundeswehr 's " voice of freedom " program came in second .
that represents only five years of work to create a radio program there from scratch . it sounds like a difficult job to produce a program from germany in a foreign language for people living in a different culture .
how do you overcome this challenge ? while we 're in germany , we prepare for the next region we 'll be stationed in .
it 's the soldier stationed in afghanistan who works on a daily basis on the program .
he works together with the local journalists that produce the program in the local languages - in afghanistan these are dari and pashto . we produce extra material here in germany , like a program called " world of knowledge , " with afghan refugees living here , but most of the work is done in afghanistan . who are the local journalists you partner with in afghanistan ? we have an afghan staff .
when i was there last year , we had 13 journalists working in mazar-i-sharif .
they come to work each day , except fridays , and do the program . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : radio is popular because the illiteracy rate is high , said knepper what is essential to know about afghan culture , the political situation there or the media landscape when producing a radio program that 's interesting to the people ? in afghanistan , there 's a lot more talk on the radio .
there 's also a lot of music - both afghan and western music .
but they talk for a long time .
on a german radio program , you would n't have a piece longer than 90 seconds , but in afghanistan sometimes the pieces last for three to five minutes .
maybe it 's a cultural thing - they can concentrate longer than people -lsb- in germany -rsb- . what was your daily job like ? my daily job was to get an overview of the latest local news in the region i was responsible for in the north .
we have correspondents and freelancers providing us daily with news from various provinces .
this has to be checked , and i decided which news to include in our program , as well as what kind of entertainment to use . what criteria do you have for selecting news pieces ? the pieces have to stick to our goals , which are democracy , openness and rule of law .
that is our mandate in these countries .
it was my main job to check whether the news - and the music , as well - kept with these goals . do you think the bundeswehr 's work will help establish a freer and more stable media in afghanistan in the future ? it 's the first step .
we ca n't think short-term .
in the long-term , it 's essential for an open society to have a valid media landscape .
we also contribute by engaging and educating local journalists . what did you learn during your own stay in afghanistan ? the people there are more relaxed .
they 're satisfied with much less than people here in our western society .
it 's a war-torn country and people just want to have a stable and peaceful environment to work and live in .
it was impressive to see how eager the people are for peace . click on the link below to listen to an excerpt from the dari-language news program , which reports on the opening of a new school for girls sponsored by the international security assistance force in afghanistan -lrb- isaf -rrb- . interview : kate bowen send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

on sunday , feb .
24 , such a movie won an oscar for best foreign-language film . germany 's nazi past has been a recurrent theme in films made in the country in recent years .
from " downfall , " which controversially portrayed the human side of hitler , to a recent irreverent comedy about the nazi dictator called " mein führer : the truly truest truth about adolf hitler , " german films have been breaking new ground by using humor and irony to tackle issues still sensitive in the country .
the latest film , " the counterfeiters , " sheds light on a little-known chapter of nazi history . it tells the spectacular tale of the largest forgery operation of all time , conducted from within the squalor of one of hitler 's concentration camps .
for the last three years of the second world war , 142 prisoners in the sachsenhausen camp , north of berlin , were forced by their captors to counterfeit millions of british and us banknotes in an attempt to bring the enemy economies to their knees .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : a film scene depicting the wooden huts of the workshop it was an ambitious plan , but the most astonishing thing about it was the way in which it was executed .
in two shielded wooden huts within the barbed wire confines of the camp , the men - some of them were trained printers while others had experiences in counterfeiting - were granted a life of relative comfort and provided enough food , soft beds and proper toilets .
in return they used their professional expertise to forge money .
a first-rate printing workshop was set up inside the two huts and the counterfeiters became part of a state secret which kept them alive while thousands of prisoners were being murdered and starved to death around them .
the men came to call the workshop their " golden cage . "
the devil 's workshop the film , directed by austrian stefan ruzowitzky , is based on a true account of the forgery workshop as told in adolf burger 's book " des teufels werkstatt " -lrb- the devil 's workshop -rrb- .
it follows a character called salomon sorowitsch , loosely based on a notorious counterfeiter of that time named salomon smolianoff .
the existence of the concentration camp forgery mill is a relatively little-known chapter in nazi history , but the producers of " the counterfeiters , " babette schröder and nina bohlmann , immediately recognized the potential of the story when they came across burger 's book .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the sachsenhausen concentration camp schröder and bohlmann said they first read the book six years ago and thought the story would make an interesting movie .
after considering different ways of reworking the material , they approached adolf burger about adapting it for the silver screen .
they also talked to ruzowitzky , who said he was immediately drawn by the universal nature of the material .
" asking whether people should play table-tennis in a concentration camp when others around them are being tortured to death is the same as asking whether we should be allowed to live such affluent , protected lives when there is so much suffering the world , " ruzowitzky said .
issues of conscience burger worked with ruzowitzky as an advisor on the script and accompanied the production as it progressed .
although some of the historical details , such as the prisoners ' release , are not entirely in keeping with what really happened , schröder and bohlmann have tried to show the issues of conscience facing the counterfeiters .
" what fascinated us about the story was that there were two huts in the middle of this huge concentration camp in which the prisoners were allowed to live under better conditions than everyone else , " the producer-duo said .
" they knew about the atrocities on the far side of their wooden walls , they could hear it day by day , but they could n't do anything about it . "
dangerous game of sabotage bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : karl markovics plays salomon sorowitsch during their period of " privileged " imprisonment , burger and his fellow prisoners knew that if they co-operated with their captors , they stood a chance of survival , but that if they sabotaged the efforts to flood the allied economies , they would face certain death .
for some , questions of conscience were at play ; for others , the survival instinct was the greatest .
for producers schröder and bohlmann , it was the character of salomon smolinoff that was the most interesting .
author adolf burger describes in his book how the counterfeiter labored to produce the perfect dollar note .
the results however were never quite satisfactory because other prisoners were sabotaging his efforts without his knowledge , the producer-duo said .
their stalling tactics could not go on forever , and ultimately the dollar did go into production in sachsenhausen .
but by then the allies were well on their way to berlin and there was n't enough time to mass produce the counterfeited notes .
the bills they did manage to print , along with the 134 million british pounds , stamps and other forged documents are believed to have been sunk in austria 's lake toplitz .
reaching a wide audience bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : a film scene from " the counterfeiters " in a note of introduction to his book , burger states : " this book was written in order that people do n't forget what happened . "
the makers and producers of the film have taken that message to heart .
" we have to tell the stories of the holocaust , and we are morally obliged to do it in such a way that we reach as many people as possible , " ruzowitzky said .
" in that sense even a film about the holocaust should contain elements of excitement and entertainment .
' the counterfeiters ' is an entertaining film .

on sunday , feb .
24 , such a movie won an oscar for best foreign-language film . germany 's nazi past has been a recurrent theme in films made in the country in recent years .
from " downfall , " which controversially portrayed the human side of hitler , to a recent irreverent comedy about the nazi dictator called " mein führer : the truly truest truth about adolf hitler , " german films have been breaking new ground by using humor and irony to tackle issues still sensitive in the country .
the latest film , " the counterfeiters , " sheds light on a little-known chapter of nazi history . it tells the spectacular tale of the largest forgery operation of all time , conducted from within the squalor of one of hitler 's concentration camps .
for the last three years of the second world war , 142 prisoners in the sachsenhausen camp , north of berlin , were forced by their captors to counterfeit millions of british and us banknotes in an attempt to bring the enemy economies to their knees .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : a film scene depicting the wooden huts of the workshop it was an ambitious plan , but the most astonishing thing about it was the way in which it was executed .
in two shielded wooden huts within the barbed wire confines of the camp , the men - some of them were trained printers while others had experiences in counterfeiting - were granted a life of relative comfort and provided enough food , soft beds and proper toilets .
in return they used their professional expertise to forge money .
a first-rate printing workshop was set up inside the two huts and the counterfeiters became part of a state secret which kept them alive while thousands of prisoners were being murdered and starved to death around them .
the men came to call the workshop their " golden cage . "
the devil 's workshop the film , directed by austrian stefan ruzowitzky , is based on a true account of the forgery workshop as told in adolf burger 's book " des teufels werkstatt " -lrb- the devil 's workshop -rrb- .
it follows a character called salomon sorowitsch , loosely based on a notorious counterfeiter of that time named salomon smolianoff .
the existence of the concentration camp forgery mill is a relatively little-known chapter in nazi history , but the producers of " the counterfeiters , " babette schröder and nina bohlmann , immediately recognized the potential of the story when they came across burger 's book .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the sachsenhausen concentration camp schröder and bohlmann said they first read the book six years ago and thought the story would make an interesting movie .
after considering different ways of reworking the material , they approached adolf burger about adapting it for the silver screen .
they also talked to ruzowitzky , who said he was immediately drawn by the universal nature of the material .
" asking whether people should play table-tennis in a concentration camp when others around them are being tortured to death is the same as asking whether we should be allowed to live such affluent , protected lives when there is so much suffering the world , " ruzowitzky said .
issues of conscience burger worked with ruzowitzky as an advisor on the script and accompanied the production as it progressed .
although some of the historical details , such as the prisoners ' release , are not entirely in keeping with what really happened , schröder and bohlmann have tried to show the issues of conscience facing the counterfeiters .
" what fascinated us about the story was that there were two huts in the middle of this huge concentration camp in which the prisoners were allowed to live under better conditions than everyone else , " the producer-duo said .
" they knew about the atrocities on the far side of their wooden walls , they could hear it day by day , but they could n't do anything about it . "
dangerous game of sabotage bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : karl markovics plays salomon sorowitsch during their period of " privileged " imprisonment , burger and his fellow prisoners knew that if they co-operated with their captors , they stood a chance of survival , but that if they sabotaged the efforts to flood the allied economies , they would face certain death .
for some , questions of conscience were at play ; for others , the survival instinct was the greatest .
for producers schröder and bohlmann , it was the character of salomon smolinoff that was the most interesting .
author adolf burger describes in his book how the counterfeiter labored to produce the perfect dollar note .
the results however were never quite satisfactory because other prisoners were sabotaging his efforts without his knowledge , the producer-duo said .
their stalling tactics could not go on forever , and ultimately the dollar did go into production in sachsenhausen .
but by then the allies were well on their way to berlin and there was n't enough time to mass produce the counterfeited notes .
the bills they did manage to print , along with the 134 million british pounds , stamps and other forged documents are believed to have been sunk in austria 's lake toplitz .
reaching a wide audience bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : a film scene from " the counterfeiters " in a note of introduction to his book , burger states : " this book was written in order that people do n't forget what happened . "
the makers and producers of the film have taken that message to heart .
" we have to tell the stories of the holocaust , and we are morally obliged to do it in such a way that we reach as many people as possible , " ruzowitzky said .
" in that sense even a film about the holocaust should contain elements of excitement and entertainment .
' the counterfeiters ' is an entertaining film .

on sunday , feb .
24 , such a movie won an oscar for best foreign-language film . germany 's nazi past has been a recurrent theme in films made in the country in recent years .
from " downfall , " which controversially portrayed the human side of hitler , to a recent irreverent comedy about the nazi dictator called " mein führer : the truly truest truth about adolf hitler , " german films have been breaking new ground by using humor and irony to tackle issues still sensitive in the country .
the latest film , " the counterfeiters , " sheds light on a little-known chapter of nazi history . it tells the spectacular tale of the largest forgery operation of all time , conducted from within the squalor of one of hitler 's concentration camps .
for the last three years of the second world war , 142 prisoners in the sachsenhausen camp , north of berlin , were forced by their captors to counterfeit millions of british and us banknotes in an attempt to bring the enemy economies to their knees .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : a film scene depicting the wooden huts of the workshop it was an ambitious plan , but the most astonishing thing about it was the way in which it was executed .
in two shielded wooden huts within the barbed wire confines of the camp , the men - some of them were trained printers while others had experiences in counterfeiting - were granted a life of relative comfort and provided enough food , soft beds and proper toilets .
in return they used their professional expertise to forge money .
a first-rate printing workshop was set up inside the two huts and the counterfeiters became part of a state secret which kept them alive while thousands of prisoners were being murdered and starved to death around them .
the men came to call the workshop their " golden cage . "
the devil 's workshop the film , directed by austrian stefan ruzowitzky , is based on a true account of the forgery workshop as told in adolf burger 's book " des teufels werkstatt " -lrb- the devil 's workshop -rrb- .
it follows a character called salomon sorowitsch , loosely based on a notorious counterfeiter of that time named salomon smolianoff .
the existence of the concentration camp forgery mill is a relatively little-known chapter in nazi history , but the producers of " the counterfeiters , " babette schröder and nina bohlmann , immediately recognized the potential of the story when they came across burger 's book .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the sachsenhausen concentration camp schröder and bohlmann said they first read the book six years ago and thought the story would make an interesting movie .
after considering different ways of reworking the material , they approached adolf burger about adapting it for the silver screen .
they also talked to ruzowitzky , who said he was immediately drawn by the universal nature of the material .
" asking whether people should play table-tennis in a concentration camp when others around them are being tortured to death is the same as asking whether we should be allowed to live such affluent , protected lives when there is so much suffering the world , " ruzowitzky said .
issues of conscience burger worked with ruzowitzky as an advisor on the script and accompanied the production as it progressed .
although some of the historical details , such as the prisoners ' release , are not entirely in keeping with what really happened , schröder and bohlmann have tried to show the issues of conscience facing the counterfeiters .

on sunday , feb .
24 , such a movie won an oscar for best foreign-language film . germany 's nazi past has been a recurrent theme in films made in the country in recent years .
from " downfall , " which controversially portrayed the human side of hitler , to a recent irreverent comedy about the nazi dictator called " mein führer : the truly truest truth about adolf hitler , " german films have been breaking new ground by using humor and irony to tackle issues still sensitive in the country .
the latest film , " the counterfeiters , " sheds light on a little-known chapter of nazi history . it tells the spectacular tale of the largest forgery operation of all time , conducted from within the squalor of one of hitler 's concentration camps .
for the last three years of the second world war , 142 prisoners in the sachsenhausen camp , north of berlin , were forced by their captors to counterfeit millions of british and us banknotes in an attempt to bring the enemy economies to their knees .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : a film scene depicting the wooden huts of the workshop it was an ambitious plan , but the most astonishing thing about it was the way in which it was executed .
in two shielded wooden huts within the barbed wire confines of the camp , the men - some of them were trained printers while others had experiences in counterfeiting - were granted a life of relative comfort and provided enough food , soft beds and proper toilets .
in return they used their professional expertise to forge money .
a first-rate printing workshop was set up inside the two huts and the counterfeiters became part of a state secret which kept them alive while thousands of prisoners were being murdered and starved to death around them .
the men came to call the workshop their " golden cage . "
the devil 's workshop the film , directed by austrian stefan ruzowitzky , is based on a true account of the forgery workshop as told in adolf burger 's book " des teufels werkstatt " -lrb- the devil 's workshop -rrb- .
it follows a character called salomon sorowitsch , loosely based on a notorious counterfeiter of that time named salomon smolianoff .
the existence of the concentration camp forgery mill is a relatively little-known chapter in nazi history , but the producers of " the counterfeiters , " babette schröder and nina bohlmann , immediately recognized the potential of the story when they came across burger 's book .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the sachsenhausen concentration camp schröder and bohlmann said they first read the book six years ago and thought the story would make an interesting movie .
after considering different ways of reworking the material , they approached adolf burger about adapting it for the silver screen .
they also talked to ruzowitzky , who said he was immediately drawn by the universal nature of the material .
" asking whether people should play table-tennis in a concentration camp when others around them are being tortured to death is the same as asking whether we should be allowed to live such affluent , protected lives when there is so much suffering the world , " ruzowitzky said .
issues of conscience burger worked with ruzowitzky as an advisor on the script and accompanied the production as it progressed .
although some of the historical details , such as the prisoners ' release , are not entirely in keeping with what really happened , schröder and bohlmann have tried to show the issues of conscience facing the counterfeiters .
" what fascinated us about the story was that there were two huts in the middle of this huge concentration camp in which the prisoners were allowed to live under better conditions than everyone else , " the producer-duo said .
" they knew about the atrocities on the far side of their wooden walls , they could hear it day by day , but they could n't do anything about it . "
dangerous game of sabotage bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : karl markovics plays salomon sorowitsch during their period of " privileged " imprisonment , burger and his fellow prisoners knew that if they co-operated with their captors , they stood a chance of survival , but that if they sabotaged the efforts to flood the allied economies , they would face certain death .
for some , questions of conscience were at play ; for others , the survival instinct was the greatest .
for producers schröder and bohlmann , it was the character of salomon smolinoff that was the most interesting .
author adolf burger describes in his book how the counterfeiter labored to produce the perfect dollar note .
the results however were never quite satisfactory because other prisoners were sabotaging his efforts without his knowledge , the producer-duo said .
their stalling tactics could not go on forever , and ultimately the dollar did go into production in sachsenhausen .
but by then the allies were well on their way to berlin and there was n't enough time to mass produce the counterfeited notes .
the bills they did manage to print , along with the 134 million british pounds , stamps and other forged documents are believed to have been sunk in austria 's lake toplitz .
reaching a wide audience bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : a film scene from " the counterfeiters " in a note of introduction to his book , burger states : " this book was written in order that people do n't forget what happened . "
the makers and producers of the film have taken that message to heart .
" we have to tell the stories of the holocaust , and we are morally obliged to do it in such a way that we reach as many people as possible , " ruzowitzky said .
" in that sense even a film about the holocaust should contain elements of excitement and entertainment .
' the counterfeiters ' is an entertaining film .

on sunday , feb .
24 , such a movie won an oscar for best foreign-language film . germany 's nazi past has been a recurrent theme in films made in the country in recent years .
from " downfall , " which controversially portrayed the human side of hitler , to a recent irreverent comedy about the nazi dictator called " mein führer : the truly truest truth about adolf hitler , " german films have been breaking new ground by using humor and irony to tackle issues still sensitive in the country .
the latest film , " the counterfeiters , " sheds light on a little-known chapter of nazi history . it tells the spectacular tale of the largest forgery operation of all time , conducted from within the squalor of one of hitler 's concentration camps .
for the last three years of the second world war , 142 prisoners in the sachsenhausen camp , north of berlin , were forced by their captors to counterfeit millions of british and us banknotes in an attempt to bring the enemy economies to their knees .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : a film scene depicting the wooden huts of the workshop it was an ambitious plan , but the most astonishing thing about it was the way in which it was executed .
in two shielded wooden huts within the barbed wire confines of the camp , the men - some of them were trained printers while others had experiences in counterfeiting - were granted a life of relative comfort and provided enough food , soft beds and proper toilets .
in return they used their professional expertise to forge money .
a first-rate printing workshop was set up inside the two huts and the counterfeiters became part of a state secret which kept them alive while thousands of prisoners were being murdered and starved to death around them .
the men came to call the workshop their " golden cage . "
the devil 's workshop the film , directed by austrian stefan ruzowitzky , is based on a true account of the forgery workshop as told in adolf burger 's book " des teufels werkstatt " -lrb- the devil 's workshop -rrb- .
it follows a character called salomon sorowitsch , loosely based on a notorious counterfeiter of that time named salomon smolianoff .
the existence of the concentration camp forgery mill is a relatively little-known chapter in nazi history , but the producers of " the counterfeiters , " babette schröder and nina bohlmann , immediately recognized the potential of the story when they came across burger 's book .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the sachsenhausen concentration camp schröder and bohlmann said they first read the book six years ago and thought the story would make an interesting movie .
after considering different ways of reworking the material , they approached adolf burger about adapting it for the silver screen .
they also talked to ruzowitzky , who said he was immediately drawn by the universal nature of the material .
" asking whether people should play table-tennis in a concentration camp when others around them are being tortured to death is the same as asking whether we should be allowed to live such affluent , protected lives when there is so much suffering the world , " ruzowitzky said .
issues of conscience burger worked with ruzowitzky as an advisor on the script and accompanied the production as it progressed .
although some of the historical details , such as the prisoners ' release , are not entirely in keeping with what really happened , schröder and bohlmann have tried to show the issues of conscience facing the counterfeiters .
" what fascinated us about the story was that there were two huts in the middle of this huge concentration camp in which the prisoners were allowed to live under better conditions than everyone else , " the producer-duo said .
" they knew about the atrocities on the far side of their wooden walls , they could hear it day by day , but they could n't do anything about it . "
dangerous game of sabotage bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : karl markovics plays salomon sorowitsch during their period of " privileged " imprisonment , burger and his fellow prisoners knew that if they co-operated with their captors , they stood a chance of survival , but that if they sabotaged the efforts to flood the allied economies , they would face certain death .
for some , questions of conscience were at play ; for others , the survival instinct was the greatest .
for producers schröder and bohlmann , it was the character of salomon smolinoff that was the most interesting .
author adolf burger describes in his book how the counterfeiter labored to produce the perfect dollar note .
the results however were never quite satisfactory because other prisoners were sabotaging his efforts without his knowledge , the producer-duo said .
their stalling tactics could not go on forever , and ultimately the dollar did go into production in sachsenhausen .
but by then the allies were well on their way to berlin and there was n't enough time to mass produce the counterfeited notes .

bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : a film scene depicting the wooden huts of the workshop it was an ambitious plan , but the most astonishing thing about it was the way in which it was executed .
in two shielded wooden huts within the barbed wire confines of the camp , the men - some of them were trained printers while others had experiences in counterfeiting - were granted a life of relative comfort and provided enough food , soft beds and proper toilets .
in return they used their professional expertise to forge money .
a first-rate printing workshop was set up inside the two huts and the counterfeiters became part of a state secret which kept them alive while thousands of prisoners were being murdered and starved to death around them .
the men came to call the workshop their " golden cage . "
the devil 's workshop the film , directed by austrian stefan ruzowitzky , is based on a true account of the forgery workshop as told in adolf burger 's book " des teufels werkstatt " -lrb- the devil 's workshop -rrb- .
it follows a character called salomon sorowitsch , loosely based on a notorious counterfeiter of that time named salomon smolianoff .
the existence of the concentration camp forgery mill is a relatively little-known chapter in nazi history , but the producers of " the counterfeiters , " babette schröder and nina bohlmann , immediately recognized the potential of the story when they came across burger 's book .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the sachsenhausen concentration camp schröder and bohlmann said they first read the book six years ago and thought the story would make an interesting movie .
after considering different ways of reworking the material , they approached adolf burger about adapting it for the silver screen .
they also talked to ruzowitzky , who said he was immediately drawn by the universal nature of the material .
" asking whether people should play table-tennis in a concentration camp when others around them are being tortured to death is the same as asking whether we should be allowed to live such affluent , protected lives when there is so much suffering the world , " ruzowitzky said .
issues of conscience burger worked with ruzowitzky as an advisor on the script and accompanied the production as it progressed .
although some of the historical details , such as the prisoners ' release , are not entirely in keeping with what really happened , schröder and bohlmann have tried to show the issues of conscience facing the counterfeiters .
" what fascinated us about the story was that there were two huts in the middle of this huge concentration camp in which the prisoners were allowed to live under better conditions than everyone else , " the producer-duo said .
" they knew about the atrocities on the far side of their wooden walls , they could hear it day by day , but they could n't do anything about it . "
dangerous game of sabotage bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : karl markovics plays salomon sorowitsch during their period of " privileged " imprisonment , burger and his fellow prisoners knew that if they co-operated with their captors , they stood a chance of survival , but that if they sabotaged the efforts to flood the allied economies , they would face certain death .
for some , questions of conscience were at play ; for others , the survival instinct was the greatest .
for producers schröder and bohlmann , it was the character of salomon smolinoff that was the most interesting .
author adolf burger describes in his book how the counterfeiter labored to produce the perfect dollar note .
the results however were never quite satisfactory because other prisoners were sabotaging his efforts without his knowledge , the producer-duo said .
their stalling tactics could not go on forever , and ultimately the dollar did go into production in sachsenhausen .
but by then the allies were well on their way to berlin and there was n't enough time to mass produce the counterfeited notes .
the bills they did manage to print , along with the 134 million british pounds , stamps and other forged documents are believed to have been sunk in austria 's lake toplitz .
reaching a wide audience bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : a film scene from " the counterfeiters " in a note of introduction to his book , burger states : " this book was written in order that people do n't forget what happened . "
the makers and producers of the film have taken that message to heart .
" we have to tell the stories of the holocaust , and we are morally obliged to do it in such a way that we reach as many people as possible , " ruzowitzky said .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de afghanistan -pipe- 25.02.2008 german military reaches out to afghans on air großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the soldiers distribute radios to the people as germany prepares to send combat troops to northern afghanistan , its military also aims to win over the country by radio . captain sebastian knepper works on the radio program that the german military , the bundeswehr , broadcasts in afghanistan .
last year he spent several months producing the show on site in the north of the country . dw-world.de : why does the german military produce a radio program for afghans ?
is that typical for regions where it has troops stationed ? sebastian knepper : it 's clear to the soldiers why they 're on the mission , but it 's sometimes not clear to the local people .
it 's their right to know why the german military is there and we have to explain to the people what our mission is .
our intent is to provide them with reliable and factual information .
getting trustworthy information is an important issue in becoming an open , democratic society .
that 's the reason why the german military always deploys soldiers like me to countries where they 're involved , in order to set up the kind of information structure that is found in developed countries like germany . it all started in somalia in 1993 .
the branch i work in , called operative information , has grown since then .
it 's proven to be a good way to explain to the people -lsb- where we have troops stationed -rsb- why we 're there , but also to react to actions by insurgents or terrorists groups .
we inform the people of the facts surrounding the incidents and do n't let the insurgents get in the people 's heads . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : german troops are stationed in the north we provide information they can sometimes only get from us , because there is no real infrastructure for tv or other media . what do you mean by " information ? "
the word " propaganda " certainly comes to mind with such a program . it 's like a normal radio broadcast in germany .
we provide local news from their province or town , we provide the news from around afghanistan and from all over the world .
the radio hour is divided into four quarters and there is a news section in each quarter .
we mix it up with entertainment and music . who are your listeners ? those who can receive our signal .
we have one station in the capital , kabul , and four more in the north , the territory that is run by the germans .
there are other radio stations run by our allies all over afghanistan . the illiteracy rate is quite high in afghanistan and the tv infrastructure is not as good as in europe , so radio is the easiest way to reach the people .
when soldiers go out to the villages , they give away radios that the people can use to listen to our program . so it 's popular ? it 's quite popular .
we do n't have exact figures , but the latest poll from 2005 showed that the bbc 's program is the most listened to , but the bundeswehr 's " voice of freedom " program came in second .
that represents only five years of work to create a radio program there from scratch . it sounds like a difficult job to produce a program from germany in a foreign language for people living in a different culture .
how do you overcome this challenge ? while we 're in germany , we prepare for the next region we 'll be stationed in .
it 's the soldier stationed in afghanistan who works on a daily basis on the program .
he works together with the local journalists that produce the program in the local languages - in afghanistan these are dari and pashto . we produce extra material here in germany , like a program called " world of knowledge , " with afghan refugees living here , but most of the work is done in afghanistan . who are the local journalists you partner with in afghanistan ? we have an afghan staff .
when i was there last year , we had 13 journalists working in mazar-i-sharif .
they come to work each day , except fridays , and do the program . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : radio is popular because the illiteracy rate is high , said knepper what is essential to know about afghan culture , the political situation there or the media landscape when producing a radio program that 's interesting to the people ? in afghanistan , there 's a lot more talk on the radio .
there 's also a lot of music - both afghan and western music .
but they talk for a long time .
on a german radio program , you would n't have a piece longer than 90 seconds , but in afghanistan sometimes the pieces last for three to five minutes .
maybe it 's a cultural thing - they can concentrate longer than people -lsb- in germany -rsb- . what was your daily job like ? my daily job was to get an overview of the latest local news in the region i was responsible for in the north .
we have correspondents and freelancers providing us daily with news from various provinces .
this has to be checked , and i decided which news to include in our program , as well as what kind of entertainment to use . what criteria do you have for selecting news pieces ? the pieces have to stick to our goals , which are democracy , openness and rule of law .
that is our mandate in these countries .
it was my main job to check whether the news - and the music , as well - kept with these goals . do you think the bundeswehr 's work will help establish a freer and more stable media in afghanistan in the future ? it 's the first step .
we ca n't think short-term .
in the long-term , it 's essential for an open society to have a valid media landscape .
we also contribute by engaging and educating local journalists . what did you learn during your own stay in afghanistan ? the people there are more relaxed .
they 're satisfied with much less than people here in our western society .
it 's a war-torn country and people just want to have a stable and peaceful environment to work and live in .
it was impressive to see how eager the people are for peace . click on the link below to listen to an excerpt from the dari-language news program , which reports on the opening of a new school for girls sponsored by the international security assistance force in afghanistan -lrb- isaf -rrb- . interview : kate bowen send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

on sunday , feb .
24 , such a movie won an oscar for best foreign-language film . germany 's nazi past has been a recurrent theme in films made in the country in recent years .
from " downfall , " which controversially portrayed the human side of hitler , to a recent irreverent comedy about the nazi dictator called " mein führer : the truly truest truth about adolf hitler , " german films have been breaking new ground by using humor and irony to tackle issues still sensitive in the country .
the latest film , " the counterfeiters , " sheds light on a little-known chapter of nazi history . it tells the spectacular tale of the largest forgery operation of all time , conducted from within the squalor of one of hitler 's concentration camps .
for the last three years of the second world war , 142 prisoners in the sachsenhausen camp , north of berlin , were forced by their captors to counterfeit millions of british and us banknotes in an attempt to bring the enemy economies to their knees .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : a film scene depicting the wooden huts of the workshop it was an ambitious plan , but the most astonishing thing about it was the way in which it was executed .
in two shielded wooden huts within the barbed wire confines of the camp , the men - some of them were trained printers while others had experiences in counterfeiting - were granted a life of relative comfort and provided enough food , soft beds and proper toilets .
in return they used their professional expertise to forge money .
a first-rate printing workshop was set up inside the two huts and the counterfeiters became part of a state secret which kept them alive while thousands of prisoners were being murdered and starved to death around them .
the men came to call the workshop their " golden cage . "
the devil 's workshop the film , directed by austrian stefan ruzowitzky , is based on a true account of the forgery workshop as told in adolf burger 's book " des teufels werkstatt " -lrb- the devil 's workshop -rrb- .
it follows a character called salomon sorowitsch , loosely based on a notorious counterfeiter of that time named salomon smolianoff .
the existence of the concentration camp forgery mill is a relatively little-known chapter in nazi history , but the producers of " the counterfeiters , " babette schröder and nina bohlmann , immediately recognized the potential of the story when they came across burger 's book .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the sachsenhausen concentration camp schröder and bohlmann said they first read the book six years ago and thought the story would make an interesting movie .
after considering different ways of reworking the material , they approached adolf burger about adapting it for the silver screen .
they also talked to ruzowitzky , who said he was immediately drawn by the universal nature of the material .
" asking whether people should play table-tennis in a concentration camp when others around them are being tortured to death is the same as asking whether we should be allowed to live such affluent , protected lives when there is so much suffering the world , " ruzowitzky said .
issues of conscience burger worked with ruzowitzky as an advisor on the script and accompanied the production as it progressed .
although some of the historical details , such as the prisoners ' release , are not entirely in keeping with what really happened , schröder and bohlmann have tried to show the issues of conscience facing the counterfeiters .
" what fascinated us about the story was that there were two huts in the middle of this huge concentration camp in which the prisoners were allowed to live under better conditions than everyone else , " the producer-duo said .
" they knew about the atrocities on the far side of their wooden walls , they could hear it day by day , but they could n't do anything about it . "
dangerous game of sabotage bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : karl markovics plays salomon sorowitsch during their period of " privileged " imprisonment , burger and his fellow prisoners knew that if they co-operated with their captors , they stood a chance of survival , but that if they sabotaged the efforts to flood the allied economies , they would face certain death .
for some , questions of conscience were at play ; for others , the survival instinct was the greatest .
for producers schröder and bohlmann , it was the character of salomon smolinoff that was the most interesting .
author adolf burger describes in his book how the counterfeiter labored to produce the perfect dollar note .
the results however were never quite satisfactory because other prisoners were sabotaging his efforts without his knowledge , the producer-duo said .
their stalling tactics could not go on forever , and ultimately the dollar did go into production in sachsenhausen .
but by then the allies were well on their way to berlin and there was n't enough time to mass produce the counterfeited notes .
the bills they did manage to print , along with the 134 million british pounds , stamps and other forged documents are believed to have been sunk in austria 's lake toplitz .
reaching a wide audience bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : a film scene from " the counterfeiters " in a note of introduction to his book , burger states : " this book was written in order that people do n't forget what happened . "
the makers and producers of the film have taken that message to heart .
" we have to tell the stories of the holocaust , and we are morally obliged to do it in such a way that we reach as many people as possible , " ruzowitzky said .
" in that sense even a film about the holocaust should contain elements of excitement and entertainment .
' the counterfeiters ' is an entertaining film .

so many people have a part of this , chief among them cormac mccarthy who wrote a wonderful book that was an honour to make into a movie producer scott rudin pays tribute to the author of no country for old men as he picks up the award for best film ethan and i have been making stories with movie cameras since we were kids ... honestly , what we do now does n't feel that much different to what we were doing then joel coen receiving the best director oscar , won with brother ethan for no country for old men that 's the closest i 'll ever come to getting a knighthood daniel day-lewis on picking up his best actor oscar from the queen star helen mirren this is for the writers .
i especially want to thank my fellow nominees because i worship you guys and i 'm learning from you every day juno writer diablo cody remembers the writers ' strike as she picks up the best original screenplay oscar truth is , i think my dear wife , anne , was hoping i 'd make a romantic comedy .
but after guantanamo , abu ghraib , extraordinary rendition , that simply was n't possible film-maker alex gibney picks up the documentary feature award for taxi to the dark side , about the death in us custody of an afghan taxi driver we made this film two years ago ; we shot it on two handycams .
it took us three weeks to make ; we made it for a hundred grand .
we never thought we 'd ever come into a room like this and be in front of you people irishman glen hansard , who won best song - along with co-star marketa irglova - for falling slowly from their film once there 've been some great austrian film-makers working here ... most of them had to leave my country because of the nazis , so it sort of makes sense that the first austrian movie to win an oscar is about the nazis ' crimes stefan ruzowitzky , writer and director of the counterfeiters , picking up the oscar for best foreign language film well , i 'm speechless now .
thank you , life ; thank you , love ; and it is true there are some angels in this city marion cotillard on winning best actress for her role as edith piaf in la vie en rose i think whatever success we 've had in this area has been entirely attributable to how selective we are .
we 've only adapted homer and cormac mccarthy joel coen as he and brother ethan win best adapted screenplay for their take on mccarthy 's no country for old men seeing you climb into that rubber batsuit from batman and robin - the one with the nipples - every morning under your costume , on the set , off the set , hanging upside down at lunch .
you rock , man best supporting actress tilda swinton thanks co-star george clooney , in her winner 's speech , for providing light relief during the filming of michael clayton thank you to the coens for being crazy enough to think that i could do that and put one of the most horrible haircuts in history over my head javier bardem , picking up his best supporting actor award , on the haircut of his hitman character anton chigurh in no country for old men in case you 're wondering what we all do here during the commercial breaks , mostly we just sit around making catty remarks about the outfits you 're all wearing at home presenter jon stewart on advertisement breaks thank you , jon , for that kind introduction - you never cease to amaze me with your constant need for attention award presenter and star of the us version of the office , steve carell , responding to stewart 's introduction thank god .
i 've finally grown up .
i 've never felt grown up - i 'd feel angry if i felt grown up best actor nominee george clooney , on the red carpet , on finally being nominated in the best actor category we were asleep and , of course , dad was waiting up to hear what happened .
then we just heard him scream and we thought , ' do you know what ?
i might just be nominated for an oscar ' saoirse ronan , 13 , on how she found out about her best supporting actress nomination i think most of the people here are quite excited .
there 's not that many people that are over it , even if they 're doing an impression of being over it atonement star james mcavoy on acting cool i watch it while it 's being put together but once it 's done i feel like it 's none of my business any more daniel day-lewis on why he does not watch his finished films i did celebrate - some running charades -lsb- party game -rsb- , maybe a couple of drinks .

by alexandra fullerton fashion stylist it is true that without the films , the oscars could not take place .
however , it is arguable that the red carpet arrivals - and more specifically what the stars are wearing - have eclipsed the gongs themselves .
at the 80th academy awards in los angeles the a-list arrivals opted for an array of show-stopping gowns for the most glamorous occasion in the film industry 's calendar .
the oscars are one of the only events where full-length gowns are appropriate and expected .
this year the majority of stars opted for floor-grazing gowns , with only julie christie bucking the trend in a knee-length frock .
her pink suede gloves , which clashed with her maroon taffeta dress , were one of the few off-notes in an otherwise exemplary red carpet showing .
the battle for biggest colour of the night was fought out by black and red .
jennifer garner , hilary swank and penelope cruz chose dresses in the former shade , while dame helen mirren , heidi klum and miley cyrus opted to be scarlet women for the evening .
deceptively simple garner 's jet-black oscar de la renta gown , which was put together by celebrity stylist rachel zoe , was a deceptively simple strapless number .
the tight bandaged bodice ended in layers of intricate ruched tiers , while her necklace , from van cleef and arpels , included a jaw-dropping 61 carat of diamonds .
swank also opted for the serious shade in a one-shouldered versace frock , dotted with rosettes and finished in a modest train .
as one of the catwalk 's biggest trends , feathers were bound to turn up on some stylish stars at the ceremony .
having chosen a feather-heavy dress for last year 's awards , cruz was obviously a fan of the tickly detail .
this year she chose a glamorous fishtail gown overloaded with tulle , ruching and feathers .
pregnant jessica alba also picked a frock with a flurry of feathers from marchesa .
hollywood sparkle the plum shade complemented her olive skin , while her plaited hair and gold hoop earrings from cartier added a grecian feel to her look .
marchesa , a british label , is a new red carpet favourite and is designed by miramax boss harvey weinstein 's wife , georgina chapman , and keren craig .
anne hathaway , who attended to present an award , also picked a show-stopping scarlet frock from the brand .
it was covered with intricate floral rosettes which climbed over her shoulder with grecian-inspired draping .
adding a touch of old-school hollywood sparkle to the proceedings was renee zellweger , in a silver sequined sheath and vintage diamond cartier brooches .
the strapless dress by carolina herrera , a red carpet favourite for the actress , was daringly split to the thigh revealing more than a sliver of zellweger 's legs .
best actress nominee marion cotillard also shone in a sequin-encrusted dress .
the french star always picks a gallic label for her red carpet appearances and eschewed recent favourite chanel for a jean-paul gaultier gown .
the fishtail shape and white pearlised sequins , embroidered in a pattern reminiscent of fish-scales , made her look like a mermaid .
if you were looking for tips for dressing a baby bump , then this year 's oscar 's provided a masterclass , with empire-line shapes proving to be most flattering .
mum-to-be cate blanchett wore a navy satin gown from belgian designer dries van noten - a leftfield choice for red carpet dressing - while nicole kidman , also pregnant , diverted attention from her bump with a cascading diamond necklace .
critics verdict amy adams , nominated twice in the music categories , looked stunning in a forest-green double-faced satin gown by hip new york duo proenza schouler .
their signature sculpted-bust detailing looked modern and fresh alongside the deep green shade .
accessorised with a miniature gold bag from fred leighton , adams admitted there was actually nothing in it .
cameron diaz , who presented the best cinematographer award , wore a sugar-pink christian dior gown , but cleverly avoided slipping into saccharine territory with the addition of some edgy origami-style pleats .
topped off with bulgari jewels she looked cool and relaxed on the red carpet .
at the oscars there is always a dress that divides the critics into " love it " or " hate it " camps .
this year 's best supporting actress , tilda swinton , seems to have taken that honour .
her jet black dress was an on-trend one-sleeve style from lanvin .
daring and fashion-forward , it proved to be a refreshing change from the sea of safe strapless gowns that paraded down the theatre carpet , but drew harsh comments from critics for resembling a " garbage bag " .
considering the awards were nearly a no-go owing to the writers ' strike , red carpet watchers across the world can breathe a sigh of relief .
after all , it would have been a shame for all of those dresses to remain in the wardrobes of the a-list , would it not ?

by alexandra fullerton fashion stylist marion cotillard was among the red carpet fashion successes in pictures it is true that without the films , the oscars could not take place .
however , it is arguable that the red carpet arrivals - and more specifically what the stars are wearing - have eclipsed the gongs themselves .
at the 80th academy awards in los angeles the a-list arrivals opted for an array of show-stopping gowns for the most glamorous occasion in the film industry 's calendar .
the oscars are one of the only events where full-length gowns are appropriate and expected .
this year the majority of stars opted for floor-grazing gowns , with only julie christie bucking the trend in a knee-length frock .
her pink suede gloves , which clashed with her maroon taffeta dress , were one of the few off-notes in an otherwise exemplary red carpet showing .
the battle for biggest colour of the night was fought out by black and red .
jennifer garner , hilary swank and penelope cruz chose dresses in the former shade , while dame helen mirren , heidi klum and miley cyrus opted to be scarlet women for the evening .
deceptively simple garner 's jet-black oscar de la renta gown , which was put together by celebrity stylist rachel zoe , was a deceptively simple strapless number .
the tight bandaged bodice ended in layers of intricate ruched tiers , while her necklace , from van cleef and arpels , included a jaw-dropping 61 carat of diamonds .
anne hathaway presented the award for best animated feature swank also opted for the serious shade in a one-shouldered versace frock , dotted with rosettes and finished in a modest train .
as one of the catwalk 's biggest trends , feathers were bound to turn up on some stylish stars at the ceremony .
having chosen a feather-heavy dress for last year 's awards , cruz was obviously a fan of the tickly detail .
this year she chose a glamorous fishtail gown overloaded with tulle , ruching and feathers .
pregnant jessica alba also picked a frock with a flurry of feathers from marchesa .
hollywood sparkle the plum shade complemented her olive skin , while her plaited hair and gold hoop earrings from cartier added a grecian feel to her look .
marchesa , a british label , is a new red carpet favourite and is designed by miramax boss harvey weinstein 's wife , georgina chapman , and keren craig .
anne hathaway , who attended to present an award , also picked a show-stopping scarlet frock from the brand .
it was covered with intricate floral rosettes which climbed over her shoulder with grecian-inspired draping .
tilda swinton took the gong for best supporting actress adding a touch of old-school hollywood sparkle to the proceedings was renee zellweger , in a silver sequined sheath and vintage diamond cartier brooches .
the strapless dress by carolina herrera , a red carpet favourite for the actress , was daringly split to the thigh revealing more than a sliver of zellweger 's legs .
best actress nominee marion cotillard also shone in a sequin-encrusted dress .
the french star always picks a gallic label for her red carpet appearances and eschewed recent favourite chanel for a jean-paul gaultier gown .
the fishtail shape and white pearlised sequins , embroidered in a pattern reminiscent of fish-scales , made her look like a mermaid .
if you were looking for tips for dressing a baby bump , then this year 's oscar 's provided a masterclass , with empire-line shapes proving to be most flattering .
mum-to-be cate blanchett wore a navy satin gown from belgian designer dries van noten - a leftfield choice for red carpet dressing - while nicole kidman , also pregnant , diverted attention from her bump with a cascading diamond necklace .
critics verdict amy adams , nominated twice in the music categories , looked stunning in a forest-green double-faced satin gown by hip new york duo proenza schouler .
their signature sculpted-bust detailing looked modern and fresh alongside the deep green shade .
accessorised with a miniature gold bag from fred leighton , adams admitted there was actually nothing in it .
cate blanchett showed how to grace the red carpet whilst pregnant cameron diaz , who presented the best cinematographer award , wore a sugar-pink christian dior gown , but cleverly avoided slipping into saccharine territory with the addition of some edgy origami-style pleats .
topped off with bulgari jewels she looked cool and relaxed on the red carpet .
at the oscars there is always a dress that divides the critics into " love it " or " hate it " camps .
this year 's best supporting actress , tilda swinton , seems to have taken that honour .
her jet black dress was an on-trend one-sleeve style from lanvin .
daring and fashion-forward , it proved to be a refreshing change from the sea of safe strapless gowns that paraded down the theatre carpet , but drew harsh comments from critics for resembling a " garbage bag " .
considering the awards were nearly a no-go owing to the writers ' strike , red carpet watchers across the world can breathe a sigh of relief .
after all , it would have been a shame for all of those dresses to remain in the wardrobes of the a-list , would it not ?

tilda swinton took the gong for best supporting actress adding a touch of old-school hollywood sparkle to the proceedings was renee zellweger , in a silver sequined sheath and vintage diamond cartier brooches .
the strapless dress by carolina herrera , a red carpet favourite for the actress , was daringly split to the thigh revealing more than a sliver of zellweger 's legs .
best actress nominee marion cotillard also shone in a sequin-encrusted dress .
the french star always picks a gallic label for her red carpet appearances and eschewed recent favourite chanel for a jean-paul gaultier gown .
the fishtail shape and white pearlised sequins , embroidered in a pattern reminiscent of fish-scales , made her look like a mermaid .
if you were looking for tips for dressing a baby bump , then this year 's oscar 's provided a masterclass , with empire-line shapes proving to be most flattering .
mum-to-be cate blanchett wore a navy satin gown from belgian designer dries van noten - a leftfield choice for red carpet dressing - while nicole kidman , also pregnant , diverted attention from her bump with a cascading diamond necklace .
critics verdict amy adams , nominated twice in the music categories , looked stunning in a forest-green double-faced satin gown by hip new york duo proenza schouler .
their signature sculpted-bust detailing looked modern and fresh alongside the deep green shade .
accessorised with a miniature gold bag from fred leighton , adams admitted there was actually nothing in it .
cate blanchett showed how to grace the red carpet whilst pregnant cameron diaz , who presented the best cinematographer award , wore a sugar-pink christian dior gown , but cleverly avoided slipping into saccharine territory with the addition of some edgy origami-style pleats .
topped off with bulgari jewels she looked cool and relaxed on the red carpet .
at the oscars there is always a dress that divides the critics into " love it " or " hate it " camps .
this year 's best supporting actress , tilda swinton , seems to have taken that honour .
her jet black dress was an on-trend one-sleeve style from lanvin .
daring and fashion-forward , it proved to be a refreshing change from the sea of safe strapless gowns that paraded down the theatre carpet , but drew harsh comments from critics for resembling a " garbage bag " .
considering the awards were nearly a no-go owing to the writers ' strike , red carpet watchers across the world can breathe a sigh of relief .
after all , it would have been a shame for all of those dresses to remain in the wardrobes of the a-list , would it not ?

jon stewart is known as the host of satirical tv series the daily show between the montages , interviews and ad breaks , viewers would have been forgiven for missing him .
two years ago , stewart had struggled on his debut , with sketches falling flat and a number of lines bombing .
but this time he was sparkling .
the nerves shed , he got into his stride early on by riffing on the writers ' strike with lines such as : " i 'm happy to say the fight is over - so tonight , welcome to the make-up sex . "
and he remained sharp , witty and engaging , striking exactly the right tone between irreverence and the genuine thrill of being at the centre of a broadcast being watched by one in six of the planet 's residents .
crucially - 2008 being an election year - he was on his home turf with a couple of good political jokes .
there was a somewhat predictable gag about oscar 's 80th birthday - " making him a frontrunner for the republican nomination " .
but better was his description of away from her .
" it was about a woman who forgets her husband .
hillary clinton called it the feelgood movie of the year . "
norbit stewart also showed he was now just as comfortable with hollywood humour , including probably one of the best lines ever uttered by any host .
" even norbit got a nomination , which i think is great .
too often the academy ignores movies that are n't good . "
and he could even segue between the two themes , describing the slate of nominated films as " psychopathic killer movies " .
marketa irglova was allowed to return to the stage by jon stewart " does this town need a hug ?
all i can say is , thank god for teen pregnancy , " he added , in a reference to juno .
could we tell the writers had had so much less time to put together these quips ?
not at all .
unfortunately , the impact of the strike soon became visible elsewhere - in the exhausting number of video clips and general pre-recorded backslapping .
shot in case the strike had not been resolved - stewart said as much himself - the producers of the show had clearly decided to cram most of them in anyway .
on the oscars ' 80th birthday , a few clips of past ceremonies are fine .
but did we really need to know how sir elton john felt on winning in 1994 , or what barbra streisand thought about having to share her award all of 40 years ago ?
worst was an extraordinarily tedious sequence featuring the academy 's president that was little more than an extended ad for a major accountancy firm .
" wow .
that was amazing , " stewart deadpanned afterwards .
shocked reaction all this extra flannel - there seemed to be more ad breaks this year too - put real pressure on the awards presenters and the recipients .
and this was a shame , because events inside the theatre produced some memorable moments , starting with tilda swinton 's genuinely astounded reaction to her win for her role in michael clayton .
similarly shocked was marketa irglova , jointly picking up her oscar for best song , who stepped up to the microphone but was cut off by the orchestra .
charmingly , stewart later allowed her back on stage to give a little speech , which must be some sort of first .
in fact it was the speeches which allowed stewart to show off his wit and to wander off script .
john travolta -lrb- left -rrb- joked with stewart that his plane was outside responding to javier bardem delivering half his speech in spanish , he said , " i took spanish in high school .
i believe he told his mother where the library was . "
had more of this quick humour been given time , the 80th oscars would have ranked as among the best .
ultimately , the show was summed up by a moment when stewart sarcastically introduced " oscar 's salute to binoculars and periscopes " , his eyes rolling at the absurdity of the idea - only for the eyewear montage to begin anyway .
but perhaps in a year when the awards themselves were so predictable , perhaps it was only apt that the show itself had been so pre-packaged .
jon stewart 's best lines " they said that having the oscars helped end the strike .
so before we spend the next four to five hours giving each other golden statues , let 's take a moment to congratulations ourselves . "
" -lsb- away from her -rsb- was about a woman who forgets her husband .

anton chigur - " combining hannibal lecter 's murderousness with dorothy hamill 's wedgecut " .

angelina jolie . "
" in case you 're wondering what we do in the commercial breaks , we sit here making catty remarks about the outfits you 're wearing at home . "

jon stewart is known as the host of satirical tv series the daily show between the montages , interviews and ad breaks , viewers would have been forgiven for missing him .
two years ago , stewart had struggled on his debut , with sketches falling flat and a number of lines bombing .
but this time he was sparkling .
the nerves shed , he got into his stride early on by riffing on the writers ' strike with lines such as : " i 'm happy to say the fight is over - so tonight , welcome to the make-up sex . "
and he remained sharp , witty and engaging , striking exactly the right tone between irreverence and the genuine thrill of being at the centre of a broadcast being watched by one in six of the planet 's residents .
crucially - 2008 being an election year - he was on his home turf with a couple of good political jokes .
there was a somewhat predictable gag about oscar 's 80th birthday - " making him a frontrunner for the republican nomination " .
but better was his description of away from her .
" it was about a woman who forgets her husband .
hillary clinton called it the feelgood movie of the year . "
norbit stewart also showed he was now just as comfortable with hollywood humour , including probably one of the best lines ever uttered by any host .
" even norbit got a nomination , which i think is great .
too often the academy ignores movies that are n't good . "
and he could even segue between the two themes , describing the slate of nominated films as " psychopathic killer movies " .
marketa irglova was allowed to return to the stage by jon stewart " does this town need a hug ?
all i can say is , thank god for teen pregnancy , " he added , in a reference to juno .
could we tell the writers had had so much less time to put together these quips ?
not at all .
unfortunately , the impact of the strike soon became visible elsewhere - in the exhausting number of video clips and general pre-recorded backslapping .
shot in case the strike had not been resolved - stewart said as much himself - the producers of the show had clearly decided to cram most of them in anyway .
on the oscars ' 80th birthday , a few clips of past ceremonies are fine .
but did we really need to know how sir elton john felt on winning in 1994 , or what barbra streisand thought about having to share her award all of 40 years ago ?
worst was an extraordinarily tedious sequence featuring the academy 's president that was little more than an extended ad for a major accountancy firm .
" wow .
that was amazing , " stewart deadpanned afterwards .
shocked reaction all this extra flannel - there seemed to be more ad breaks this year too - put real pressure on the awards presenters and the recipients .
and this was a shame , because events inside the theatre produced some memorable moments , starting with tilda swinton 's genuinely astounded reaction to her win for her role in michael clayton .
similarly shocked was marketa irglova , jointly picking up her oscar for best song , who stepped up to the microphone but was cut off by the orchestra .
charmingly , stewart later allowed her back on stage to give a little speech , which must be some sort of first .
in fact it was the speeches which allowed stewart to show off his wit and to wander off script .
john travolta -lrb- left -rrb- joked with stewart that his plane was outside responding to javier bardem delivering half his speech in spanish , he said , " i took spanish in high school .
i believe he told his mother where the library was . "
had more of this quick humour been given time , the 80th oscars would have ranked as among the best .
ultimately , the show was summed up by a moment when stewart sarcastically introduced " oscar 's salute to binoculars and periscopes " , his eyes rolling at the absurdity of the idea - only for the eyewear montage to begin anyway .
but perhaps in a year when the awards themselves were so predictable , perhaps it was only apt that the show itself had been so pre-packaged .
jon stewart 's best lines " they said that having the oscars helped end the strike .
so before we spend the next four to five hours giving each other golden statues , let 's take a moment to congratulations ourselves . "
" -lsb- away from her -rsb- was about a woman who forgets her husband .
hillary clinton called it the feelgood movie of the year . "
anton chigur - " combining hannibal lecter 's murderousness with dorothy hamill 's wedgecut " .
" this is the environmentally-conscious green oscars .

" and the baby goes to ...
angelina jolie . "
" in case you 're wondering what we do in the commercial breaks , we sit here making catty remarks about the outfits you 're wearing at home . "
" our next presenter -lsb- penelope cruz -rsb- speaks four languages , and earlier tonight she told me " i 'm calling security " in all four of them . "
" tom hanks has won two oscars but is not nominated tonight - so if you ask me , he 's got no place being here . "

simple software can highlight those whose abnormal blood sugar tests have not yet been followed up .
dr tim holt , who led the project , even found six patients who had been missed at his own practice , the british journal of general practice reported .
diabetes uk said early diagnosis was vital to limit diabetes-related damage . "
the study demonstrates the power of information technology to assist practice teams in the early detection of diabetes " dr tim holt study leader the government is currently looking at ways to increase the amount of health screening carried out at gp practices .
however , the study suggested that blood tests of thousands of patients showing signs of early type ii diabetes were already available to doctors - but not being followed up .
the computer software developed by dr holt , from the university of warwick , and colleagues at nottingham university , looked for patients who had undergone a blood test more than a year ago , and shown some hint of raised blood sugar levels , but who had not been seen by their doctor with diabetes in mind .
in a sample of 3.6 million anonymised records taken from the database at the university , they found almost 33,000 with " borderline " results which would normally require a re-test , and 3,700 whose results suggested more strongly they had undiagnosed diabetes .
if every practice in the country was using the system , said dr holt , he would expect to see half a million " possibles " and 60,000 " probables " .
he said : " the study demonstrates the power of information technology to assist practice teams in the early detection of diabetes .
" there are lots of reasons why a raised blood sugar level might not be followed up .
" for example , the doctor might be investigating another problem , and order blood tests for something else , with the ' glucose ' box ticked as well .
" the patient , also might think that a note from the surgery asking them to come in about their raised blood glucose level was unimportant compared with their other problem . "
under control dr holt tried the system at his own surgery in warwickshire , and identified six patients who might be developing the condition .
one of them , peter alexander , was diagnosed , and now has his diabetes under control .
" i wish that this system had been introduced nationwide much earlier , " he said .
the charity diabetes uk has been calling for more screening for type ii diabetes , and said it was vital that patients were caught before the symptoms of the disease became apparent .
its chief executive douglas smallwood said : " diabetes is a serious condition which can lead to devastating complications such as blindness , amputations , heart and kidney disease .
" the earlier people are diagnosed , the earlier they can get on with managing the condition and reduce their risk of developing complications . "
" identifying people at higher risk of type 2 diabetes is also a massive step forward .
in many cases , leading a healthy lifestyle and managing weight can prevent or delay onset of the condition , so targeting these people is vital . "
the largest gp computer software supplier , emis , has already installed the software into all the gp practices it serves .

simple software can highlight those whose abnormal blood sugar tests have not yet been followed up .
dr tim holt , who led the project , even found six patients who had been missed at his own practice , the british journal of general practice reported .
diabetes uk said early diagnosis was vital to limit diabetes-related damage .
the study demonstrates the power of information technology to assist practice teams in the early detection of diabetes dr tim holt study leader the government is currently looking at ways to increase the amount of health screening carried out at gp practices .
however , the study suggested that blood tests of thousands of patients showing signs of early type ii diabetes were already available to doctors - but not being followed up .
the computer software developed by dr holt , from the university of warwick , and colleagues at nottingham university , looked for patients who had undergone a blood test more than a year ago , and shown some hint of raised blood sugar levels , but who had not been seen by their doctor with diabetes in mind .
in a sample of 3.6 million anonymised records taken from the database at the university , they found almost 33,000 with " borderline " results which would normally require a re-test , and 3,700 whose results suggested more strongly they had undiagnosed diabetes .
if every practice in the country was using the system , said dr holt , he would expect to see half a million " possibles " and 60,000 " probables " .
he said : " the study demonstrates the power of information technology to assist practice teams in the early detection of diabetes .
" there are lots of reasons why a raised blood sugar level might not be followed up .
" for example , the doctor might be investigating another problem , and order blood tests for something else , with the ' glucose ' box ticked as well .
" the patient , also might think that a note from the surgery asking them to come in about their raised blood glucose level was unimportant compared with their other problem . "
under control dr holt tried the system at his own surgery in warwickshire , and identified six patients who might be developing the condition .
one of them , peter alexander , was diagnosed , and now has his diabetes under control .
" i wish that this system had been introduced nationwide much earlier , " he said .
the charity diabetes uk has been calling for more screening for type ii diabetes , and said it was vital that patients were caught before the symptoms of the disease became apparent .
its chief executive douglas smallwood said : " diabetes is a serious condition which can lead to devastating complications such as blindness , amputations , heart and kidney disease .
" the earlier people are diagnosed , the earlier they can get on with managing the condition and reduce their risk of developing complications . "
" identifying people at higher risk of type 2 diabetes is also a massive step forward .
in many cases , leading a healthy lifestyle and managing weight can prevent or delay onset of the condition , so targeting these people is vital . "
the largest gp computer software supplier , emis , has already installed the software into all the gp practices it serves .

mr lee - who turned 66 on the day he was elected president - was born in the japanese city of osaka in 1941 , during japan 's occupation of the korean peninsula .
his parents returned to a life of poverty in korea shortly after the end of world war ii - his mother earning a living as a street-food vendor .
i will become a president who rebuilds the republic of korea and helps the people regain their lost smiles lee myung-bak mr lee put himself through university in seoul during the 1960s , working as a labourer during the day and studying at night .
he led student protests against the authoritarian government , and received a police caution in 1962 .
after graduation , he took a job with hyundai , the car manufacturer .
a decade later , he had become the firm 's youngest-ever chief executive .
while at hyundai , he earned the nickname " the bulldozer " for his ability to drive through major projects .
as mayor of seoul , from 2002 to 2006 , he carried on in a similar vein - spearheading a huge project to open up a scenic stream through the heart of the capital .
this boosted his green credentials , while earning him the epithet " hero of the environment " from time magazine .
but just as south korea 's main business interests have suffered serious corruption scandals in recent years , so mr lee 's own scruples have come under scrutiny .
shortly before taking office as president , he was investigated in connection with a stock market fraud , but was subsequently cleared of all charges .
tough stance as president-elect for the conservative grand national party , he pledged to make south korea the world 's seventh largest economy - it currently stands at 13 - and to achieve 7 % annual growth .
" i will become a president who rebuilds the republic of korea and helps the people regain their lost smiles , " he promised .
the married father-of-three vowed to create thousands of new jobs , and said he would spend about 14bn won on improving the transport infrastructure and attracting foreign investment .
he has promised closer ties with the us and a tougher line on north korea , arguing that economic aid should be tied to pyongyang 's willingness to give up its nuclear weapons programme .
however , he has also said he is in favour of setting up a 37.5bn won investment fund for north korea if it abandons the programme .
mr lee has a declared personal fortune of 35bn won -lrb- £ 18m ; $ 37m -rrb- .

no country for old men has won four oscars , including best film and best director , a category awarded jointly to brothers joel and ethan coen .
javier bardem also won best supporting actor for his role as a hitman in the film , thanking his family in spanish .
all of the acting prizes went to europe , with uk stars daniel day-lewis and tilda swinton named best actor and best supporting actress respectively .
france 's marion cotillard earned the best actress prize for la vie en rose .
" i 'm speechless now , " said cotillard , who played legendary torch singer edith piaf in the movie .
" thank you life , thank you love .
it is true there are some angels in this city . "
top oscars 2008 best film no country for old men best actor daniel day-lewis -lrb- pictured -rrb- best actress marion cotillard best supporting actor javier bardem best supporting actress tilda swinton profiles : winners / nominees send us your comments day-lewis , who picked up his oscar from dame helen mirren , joked it was " the closest i 'll ever come to getting a knighthood " .
it was the 50-year-old 's second academy award , having been recognised for my left foot in 1990 .
elsewhere at the ceremony , exotic dancer-turned-scriptwriter diablo cody took best original screenplay for the quirky , verbose comedy juno - her first ever movie .
" i 'm shocked by the popularity of the film , " she said .
" i mean , when you write basically an independent movie about , you know , a pregnant teenager and you make it for seven million dollars you never , ever think it 's going to become this phenomenon . "
birthday the ceremony , at the kodak theater in hollywood , marked the 80th anniversary of the academy awards .
organisers celebrated " oscar 's birthday " with film montages celebrating past winners and memorable oscar moments - including the streaker who ran behind david niven during 1974 's ceremony .
however , this year 's understated show was unlikely to provide many clips for future compilations .
it was put together in just a matter of weeks after the writers ' strike - which had threatened to force the cancellation of hollywood 's biggest night - was called off .
that meant there were no large-scale song-and-dance numbers or lovingly-crafted movie spoofs from host jon stewart .
returning for his second stint at the helm of the awards show , stewart acknowledged the impact of the strike on hollywood .
" these past three and a half months have been very tough .
the town was torn apart by a bitter writers ' strike , " he said .
" but i 'm happy to say that the fight is over .
so tonight , welcome to the make-up sex . "
no country for old men , a thriller about a drugs deal gone wrong , had long been the frontrunner to win best film .
its win cements the reputation of the coen siblings as hollywood 's favourite leftfield film-makers .
accepting their award , older brother joel recalled that the duo had been making films since childhood .
" what we do now does n't feel that much different from what we were doing then , " he said .
" we 're very thankful to all of you out there for continuing to let us play in our corner of the sandbox . "
tilda swinton gave the most spirited speech of the night while picking up her best supporting actress award .
" i have an american agent who is the spitting image of this , " she said , referring to her oscar statuette .
" really , truly .
the same shape head and , it has to be said , the buttocks . "
she also poked fun at her michael clayton co-star george clooney , by referring back to his critically-derided stint as superhero batman .
" seeing you climb into that rubber batsuit from batman and robin , the one with the nipples , every morning under your costume , on the set , off the set , hanging upside-down at lunch ...
you rock , man . "
parties one awkward moment came as musical duo glen hansard and marketa irglova ran out of time during their acceptance speech for most original song .
iglova made an unprecendented return to the stage singer 's second chance hansard , who sings for irish band the frames , had just finished his thank-yous and stepped aside for petite irglova to make her speech when the orchestra struck up , forcing her off stage .
after a commercial break , irglova was invited back to rapturous applause from the audience .
" the fact that we 're standing here tonight , the fact that we 're able to hold this , it 's just proof that no matter how far out your dreams are , it 's possible , " she said .
with the main ceremony over , a question mark still lingers over the glitzy post-oscars parties .
the high-profile vanity fair bash was cancelled during the writers ' strike .
other casualties included people magazine 's party , and that of socialite dani jannssen , whose annual gathering attracts the likes of jack nicholson and clint eastwood .
however , pop stars madonna and prince have stepped into the breach with hastily-arranged parties in their hollywood homes .

international dignitaries including japanese prime minister yasuo fukuda and us secretary of state condoleezza rice attended the seoul inauguration .
mr lee , who heads the conservative grand national party , promised to revive his country 's economy and take a tougher line towards north korea .
the former hyundai executive was recently cleared over a fraud inquiry .
mr lee was facing allegations of links to a 2001 share-rigging scandal , for which an ex-business partner of his is on trial .
' the bulldozer ' at least 45,000 people attended the inauguration ceremony , to watch 66-year-old mr lee succeed roh moo-hyun as south korea 's 10th president .
nicknamed " the bulldozer " for his dogged work at hyundai and as mayor of seoul - and his ability to push through unpopular policies - mr lee is the first conservative politician to lead the country in a decade .
profile : lee myung-bak he is also the first to come from a business background .
most previous leaders were either ex-generals or former rights activists .
in his inauguration speech , president lee said he would lead south korea to become an advanced nation and would push to revive the country 's economic success .
addressing the crowds , he said : " economic revival is our most urgent task . "
" we must move from the age of ideology into the age of pragmatism , " he said , in a veiled criticism of the past administration .
the new president promised to have stronger ties with the united states and take a tougher line on neighbouring north korea .
after the south 's decade-long " sunshine policy " of engagement with the north - which critics have derided for giving unconditional aid while getting little in return - mr lee wants to tie south korean aid more closely to nuclear disarmament .
