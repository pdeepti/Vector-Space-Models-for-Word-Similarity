some are even doing well on the us market , where a recession is looming . total sales in germany 's auto sector rose by 17 percent in the first two months of this year , according to germany 's national car industry association , vda .
the jump trailed a year of slow sales due to a 19-percent value-added tax hike in january 2007 . " that is the best start to a new year since 2003 , " said vda president matthias wissman . daimler this week said its luxury flagship brand mercedes-benz sold 96,600 cars world-wide last month , representing a 17.7 percent increase over last year , largely due to the popularity of its c-class . only mercedes gains in the us sales of is smart fortwo brand also did well , doubling overall to 8,800 sold .

general motors and fiat are considered likely candidates , as bmw already excluded a partnership with audi and talks with mercedes have been thorny . creating partnerships is part of the munich carmaker 's restructuring plan .
its subsidiary mini has collaborated with citroen since december 2004 in building motors for smaller models .
the plan also includes cutting 8,100 jobs world-wide , 2,500 in germany , in an effort to save six billion euros -lrb- over $ 9 billion -rrb- by 2012 . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : with an annual output of 100,000 cars , porsche is significantly smaller than vw despite a two-percent setback on the us market , reithofer said his firm continues to do good business in the us .

" we 're not just talking about a few hundred million euros . " porsche to buy majority share of vw audi also has ambitious plans to pick up sales in the us , despite a 6.9 percent drop there in february .
it has said it wants to increase us sales from 93,000 to 200,000 by the year 2015 and is considering setting up a production plant there . german luxury sportscar maker porsche reported an impressive 44-percent increase in first half earnings , in part due to the success of volkswagen , where it has had a one-third share .

the euro hit an all-time high of 1.52 against the dollar last month . most of daimlers ' us sales fell into the luxury category , however , where buyers are less affected by market swings .
mercedes-benz posted a three percent rise in the us , the only german carmaker to post figures in the black on the other side of the atlantic . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : bmw 's restructuring plans are likely to lead to massive job cuts during the auto salon car show in geneva , mercedes-benz announced it is planning to release a lithium-ion hybrid version of its s-class luxury car in 2009 .
though the sedan would emit 190 grams of carbon dioxide per kilometer , much more than many smaller vehicles , it claims to be the most efficient luxury car in the world . bmw ponders new partnership munich-based bmw also announced a 14 percent rise in sales so far this year . bmw chief norbert reithofer sparked speculation this week in geneva by saying that promising discussions had been held with a potential new partner , which he declined to name .
general motors and fiat are considered likely candidates , as bmw already excluded a partnership with audi and talks with mercedes have been thorny . creating partnerships is part of the munich carmaker 's restructuring plan .
its subsidiary mini has collaborated with citroen since december 2004 in building motors for smaller models .
the plan also includes cutting 8,100 jobs world-wide , 2,500 in germany , in an effort to save six billion euros -lrb- over $ 9 billion -rrb- by 2012 . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : with an annual output of 100,000 cars , porsche is significantly smaller than vw despite a two-percent setback on the us market , reithofer said his firm continues to do good business in the us . " bmw will be profitable in the us in 2008 , " he said .
" we 're not just talking about a few hundred million euros . " porsche to buy majority share of vw audi also has ambitious plans to pick up sales in the us , despite a 6.9 percent drop there in february .
it has said it wants to increase us sales from 93,000 to 200,000 by the year 2015 and is considering setting up a production plant there . german luxury sportscar maker porsche reported an impressive 44-percent increase in first half earnings , in part due to the success of volkswagen , where it has had a one-third share .
earlier this week , the company unveiled plans to raise its share in the wolfsburg brand to over 50 percent , creating what porsche ceo wendelin wiedeking called a " collegial partnership " and not a takeover . dw staff -lrb- kjb -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

but russian president vladimir putin dispelled western hopes of a softer tone in foreign policy by his successor , dmitry medvedev . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : tension was palpable between merkel and putin " i have the feeling that some of our partners can not wait for me to stop exercising my powers so that they can deal with another person , " putin said .
" i am long accustomed to the label by which it is difficult to work with a former kgb agent . "
" dmitry medvedev will be free to demonstrate his liberal views , " putin said after talks with merkel with whom he has a frosty relationship due to the german chancellor 's frankness in addressing human rights and lack of freedoms in russia . " but he -lrb- medvedev -rrb- is no less a russian nationalist , in the good sense of the word , than i am , and i do not think that with him the partnership will be more simple . "
" open doors " to medvedev medvedev 's statements seemed to confirm putin 's predictions about russia 's next president . a 42-year-old former lawyer , medvedev told merkel he intended to seek continuity in foreign affairs .
" i am assuming we will have a continuation of that cooperation which you have had with president putin ... you have had big negotiations and that makes my task easier . "
merkel said she saw medvedev as her " immediate partner in dialogue " ahead of the group of eight 's meeting in japan later this year .
the german chancellor underscored that medvedev would find " open doors " in germany , adding an open and critical dialogue was important .
putin hits out at nato there are hopes that medvedev 's controversial election may yet usher in a more diplomatic and construction stance in moscow towards the west after clashes with putin over kosovo independence and us plans to place a missile shield in central europe .
but putin , who is expected to wield considerable influence when he steps down in may to become medvedev 's prime minister , lashed out at the western military alliance nato , which he accused of attempting to become a " substitute for the united nations . "
" an endless expansion of the military bloc under modern conditions where there is no confrontation between two hostile systems - we can that is not only unfeasible but harmful and counterproductive , " putin said .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : russia , a strong serbian ally , refuses to accept kosovo 's indepedence the russian president was equally belligerent on kosovo 's recently declared independence , warning it would encourage separatism in europe .
he warned russia would only recognize kosovo in accordance with international law .
" separatism in europe has received an additional push .
this has -lrb- relevance -rrb- for britain , for spain , for belgium , " putin said at a news conference with merkel .
" this is ... a harmful and dangerous precedent . "
merkel wants russia , europe to work together merkel adopted a more conciliatory tone , saying russia and europe needed to improve cooperation both with regards to russian energy exports to europe and other major international issues . germany is russia 's single biggest trading partner and relies heavily on moscow for gas and oil supplies .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : germany is heavily reliant on russia for gas supplies " germany and russia , europe and russia , are interdependent .
we must find a way to go forward together .
there are many things to do , " she said at the start of talks with putin just outside moscow .
however merkel also alluded to east-west strains that have worsened during putin 's tenure .
" since i 've been in power we 've found a way to discuss together and to raise critical issues in an open and sincere way , " she said .
" it 's always a joy and sometimes a challenge . "
high hopes medvedev may herald new era earlier this week , merkel congratulated medvedev on his landslide victory , while expressing concern about alleged election irregularities .
" the chancellor would like to form an impression of what the russian political landscape will look like in future , " german government spokesman ulrich wilhelm said ahead of merkel 's one-day visit to russia .
" she is looking forward to learn more about dmitry medvedev 's stated plans to entrench the rule of law and to modernise the russian state and economy , " he said .
" the chancellor will certainly raise the domestic situation after the election , as well as the election itself , where we have criticised a whole range of aspects . "
in berlin too , expectations are high that merkel may open a new chapter with medvedev .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : despite a flawed poll , europe hopes to build better relations with russia under medvedev " there 's hope the new start will mean a move away from some of the tough tones , whoch might have been due to election campaigning , " gernot erler , germany 's deputy foreign minister , told reuters in an interview this week .
germany 's foreign minister frank-walter steinmeier called on europe to engage in an updated version of the realism-driving " ostpolitik " employed during the cold war towards communist eastern europe .
" we want to add to this tradition .
let us begin with our relationship with russia , " steinmeier said this week in a speech in berlin .
" i also wished that the vote had been freer , fairer and more democratic .
but russia is and remains an indispensable partner if we wish to establish a peaceful order throughout europe . "
he signalled that the german government hopes medvedev will promote democracy in russia and strengthen ties with europe .
" dmitry medvedev has made clear his wish to modernize the country .
he has stressed that the rule of law must be of utmost importance in russia , and has expressed the wish for a renewed partnership with europe . " dw staff -lrb- sp -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

but many oppose the plans . merk told german sports magazine , kicker , this week that he has drawn up a plan in which each team as well as the referee will be allowed two challenges each for a match total of six in disputed incidents .
the three-time world referee of the year said that only one challenge should be allowed in the final 10 minutes to avoid time-wasting tactics .
" the decision must come quickly , and that is possible with today 's technology , " said merk .
the replay judges are to be the mandatory referee observer , a member of the national soccer league and a former player or journalist .
big mistake during bundesliga game merk , 45 , has long been toying with the idea , but made his proposal public after committing a big mistake himself last saturday in the bundesliga when he allowed werder bremen 's goal against borussia dortmund even though scorer markus rosenberg was clearly offside .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : some fans can feel strongly about what they see as the ref 's unfair decision " you have to think about changes .
they must be as non-invasive as possible but provide maximum efficiency , " merk told kicker .
merk admitted that not all mistakes can be erased through his scheme .
but he insisted that " we must act on behalf of football if we have the chance to erase two or three of five mistakes . "
merk 's proposals for replays - which are used in sports such as tennis and american football - have drawn mixed reactions .
the world soccer governing body fifa firmly opposed all calls for replays and is only ready to introduce a chip ball to determine goals .
" getting upset is part of the game " the german soccer federation , dfb , has asked merk to make his dossier available to them before making any comments while merk said that some referees support his plans .
news reports quoted coaches felix magath -lrb- wolfsburg -rrb- thomas doll -lrb- dortmund -rrb- as supporting merk , while bayern munich general manager uli hoeness and his mainz 05 counterpart christian heidel expressed doubts .
" it has always been part of football to get upset about decisions from the referees , " said heidel .
but merk would not buy this view : " i am surprised by statements that mistakes are part of football , " he said .
" i too want football to remain a fast game , emotional and with as few breaks as possible .
but you have to think about changes . " dw staff / dpa -lrb- sp -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

the three-time world referee of the year said that only one challenge should be allowed in the final 10 minutes to avoid time-wasting tactics .

the replay judges are to be the mandatory referee observer , a member of the national soccer league and a former player or journalist .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de soccer -pipe- 08.03.2008 germany soccer referee calls for video replays großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : ref markus merk shows a yellow card during the world cup 2006 germany 's best known soccer referee , markus merk , this week reiterated calls for video replays to correct blatant officiating mistakes during soccer matches .
but many oppose the plans . merk told german sports magazine , kicker , this week that he has drawn up a plan in which each team as well as the referee will be allowed two challenges each for a match total of six in disputed incidents .
the three-time world referee of the year said that only one challenge should be allowed in the final 10 minutes to avoid time-wasting tactics .
" the decision must come quickly , and that is possible with today 's technology , " said merk .
the replay judges are to be the mandatory referee observer , a member of the national soccer league and a former player or journalist .
big mistake during bundesliga game merk , 45 , has long been toying with the idea , but made his proposal public after committing a big mistake himself last saturday in the bundesliga when he allowed werder bremen 's goal against borussia dortmund even though scorer markus rosenberg was clearly offside .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : some fans can feel strongly about what they see as the ref 's unfair decision " you have to think about changes .
they must be as non-invasive as possible but provide maximum efficiency , " merk told kicker .
merk admitted that not all mistakes can be erased through his scheme .
but he insisted that " we must act on behalf of football if we have the chance to erase two or three of five mistakes . "
merk 's proposals for replays - which are used in sports such as tennis and american football - have drawn mixed reactions .
the world soccer governing body fifa firmly opposed all calls for replays and is only ready to introduce a chip ball to determine goals .
" getting upset is part of the game " the german soccer federation , dfb , has asked merk to make his dossier available to them before making any comments while merk said that some referees support his plans .
news reports quoted coaches felix magath -lrb- wolfsburg -rrb- thomas doll -lrb- dortmund -rrb- as supporting merk , while bayern munich general manager uli hoeness and his mainz 05 counterpart christian heidel expressed doubts .
" it has always been part of football to get upset about decisions from the referees , " said heidel .
but merk would not buy this view : " i am surprised by statements that mistakes are part of football , " he said .
" i too want football to remain a fast game , emotional and with as few breaks as possible .
but you have to think about changes . " dw staff / dpa -lrb- sp -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

but russian president vladimir putin dispelled western hopes of a softer tone in foreign policy by his successor , dmitry medvedev . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : tension was palpable between merkel and putin " i have the feeling that some of our partners can not wait for me to stop exercising my powers so that they can deal with another person , " putin said .
" i am long accustomed to the label by which it is difficult to work with a former kgb agent . "
" dmitry medvedev will be free to demonstrate his liberal views , " putin said after talks with merkel with whom he has a frosty relationship due to the german chancellor 's frankness in addressing human rights and lack of freedoms in russia .

this has -lrb- relevance -rrb- for britain , for spain , for belgium , " putin said at a news conference with merkel .
" this is ... a harmful and dangerous precedent . "
merkel wants russia , europe to work together merkel adopted a more conciliatory tone , saying russia and europe needed to improve cooperation both with regards to russian energy exports to europe and other major international issues . germany is russia 's single biggest trading partner and relies heavily on moscow for gas and oil supplies .

but russian president vladimir putin dispelled western hopes of a softer tone in foreign policy by his successor , dmitry medvedev . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : tension was palpable between merkel and putin " i have the feeling that some of our partners can not wait for me to stop exercising my powers so that they can deal with another person , " putin said .
" i am long accustomed to the label by which it is difficult to work with a former kgb agent . "
" dmitry medvedev will be free to demonstrate his liberal views , " putin said after talks with merkel with whom he has a frosty relationship due to the german chancellor 's frankness in addressing human rights and lack of freedoms in russia . " but he -lrb- medvedev -rrb- is no less a russian nationalist , in the good sense of the word , than i am , and i do not think that with him the partnership will be more simple . "
" open doors " to medvedev medvedev 's statements seemed to confirm putin 's predictions about russia 's next president . a 42-year-old former lawyer , medvedev told merkel he intended to seek continuity in foreign affairs .
" i am assuming we will have a continuation of that cooperation which you have had with president putin ... you have had big negotiations and that makes my task easier . "
merkel said she saw medvedev as her " immediate partner in dialogue " ahead of the group of eight 's meeting in japan later this year .
the german chancellor underscored that medvedev would find " open doors " in germany , adding an open and critical dialogue was important .
putin hits out at nato there are hopes that medvedev 's controversial election may yet usher in a more diplomatic and construction stance in moscow towards the west after clashes with putin over kosovo independence and us plans to place a missile shield in central europe .
but putin , who is expected to wield considerable influence when he steps down in may to become medvedev 's prime minister , lashed out at the western military alliance nato , which he accused of attempting to become a " substitute for the united nations . "
" an endless expansion of the military bloc under modern conditions where there is no confrontation between two hostile systems - we can that is not only unfeasible but harmful and counterproductive , " putin said .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : russia , a strong serbian ally , refuses to accept kosovo 's indepedence the russian president was equally belligerent on kosovo 's recently declared independence , warning it would encourage separatism in europe .
he warned russia would only recognize kosovo in accordance with international law .
" separatism in europe has received an additional push .
this has -lrb- relevance -rrb- for britain , for spain , for belgium , " putin said at a news conference with merkel .
" this is ... a harmful and dangerous precedent . "
merkel wants russia , europe to work together merkel adopted a more conciliatory tone , saying russia and europe needed to improve cooperation both with regards to russian energy exports to europe and other major international issues . germany is russia 's single biggest trading partner and relies heavily on moscow for gas and oil supplies .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : germany is heavily reliant on russia for gas supplies " germany and russia , europe and russia , are interdependent .
we must find a way to go forward together .
there are many things to do , " she said at the start of talks with putin just outside moscow .
however merkel also alluded to east-west strains that have worsened during putin 's tenure .
" since i 've been in power we 've found a way to discuss together and to raise critical issues in an open and sincere way , " she said .
" it 's always a joy and sometimes a challenge . "
high hopes medvedev may herald new era earlier this week , merkel congratulated medvedev on his landslide victory , while expressing concern about alleged election irregularities .
" the chancellor would like to form an impression of what the russian political landscape will look like in future , " german government spokesman ulrich wilhelm said ahead of merkel 's one-day visit to russia .
" she is looking forward to learn more about dmitry medvedev 's stated plans to entrench the rule of law and to modernise the russian state and economy , " he said .
" the chancellor will certainly raise the domestic situation after the election , as well as the election itself , where we have criticised a whole range of aspects . "
in berlin too , expectations are high that merkel may open a new chapter with medvedev .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : despite a flawed poll , europe hopes to build better relations with russia under medvedev " there 's hope the new start will mean a move away from some of the tough tones , whoch might have been due to election campaigning , " gernot erler , germany 's deputy foreign minister , told reuters in an interview this week .
germany 's foreign minister frank-walter steinmeier called on europe to engage in an updated version of the realism-driving " ostpolitik " employed during the cold war towards communist eastern europe .

but russian president vladimir putin dispelled western hopes of a softer tone in foreign policy by his successor , dmitry medvedev . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : tension was palpable between merkel and putin " i have the feeling that some of our partners can not wait for me to stop exercising my powers so that they can deal with another person , " putin said .
" i am long accustomed to the label by which it is difficult to work with a former kgb agent . "
" dmitry medvedev will be free to demonstrate his liberal views , " putin said after talks with merkel with whom he has a frosty relationship due to the german chancellor 's frankness in addressing human rights and lack of freedoms in russia . " but he -lrb- medvedev -rrb- is no less a russian nationalist , in the good sense of the word , than i am , and i do not think that with him the partnership will be more simple . "
" open doors " to medvedev medvedev 's statements seemed to confirm putin 's predictions about russia 's next president . a 42-year-old former lawyer , medvedev told merkel he intended to seek continuity in foreign affairs .
" i am assuming we will have a continuation of that cooperation which you have had with president putin ... you have had big negotiations and that makes my task easier . "
merkel said she saw medvedev as her " immediate partner in dialogue " ahead of the group of eight 's meeting in japan later this year .
the german chancellor underscored that medvedev would find " open doors " in germany , adding an open and critical dialogue was important .
putin hits out at nato there are hopes that medvedev 's controversial election may yet usher in a more diplomatic and construction stance in moscow towards the west after clashes with putin over kosovo independence and us plans to place a missile shield in central europe .
but putin , who is expected to wield considerable influence when he steps down in may to become medvedev 's prime minister , lashed out at the western military alliance nato , which he accused of attempting to become a " substitute for the united nations . "
" an endless expansion of the military bloc under modern conditions where there is no confrontation between two hostile systems - we can that is not only unfeasible but harmful and counterproductive , " putin said .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : russia , a strong serbian ally , refuses to accept kosovo 's indepedence the russian president was equally belligerent on kosovo 's recently declared independence , warning it would encourage separatism in europe .
he warned russia would only recognize kosovo in accordance with international law .
" separatism in europe has received an additional push .
this has -lrb- relevance -rrb- for britain , for spain , for belgium , " putin said at a news conference with merkel .
" this is ... a harmful and dangerous precedent . "
merkel wants russia , europe to work together merkel adopted a more conciliatory tone , saying russia and europe needed to improve cooperation both with regards to russian energy exports to europe and other major international issues . germany is russia 's single biggest trading partner and relies heavily on moscow for gas and oil supplies .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de soccer -pipe- 08.03.2008 germany soccer referee calls for video replays großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : ref markus merk shows a yellow card during the world cup 2006 germany 's best known soccer referee , markus merk , this week reiterated calls for video replays to correct blatant officiating mistakes during soccer matches .
but many oppose the plans . merk told german sports magazine , kicker , this week that he has drawn up a plan in which each team as well as the referee will be allowed two challenges each for a match total of six in disputed incidents .
the three-time world referee of the year said that only one challenge should be allowed in the final 10 minutes to avoid time-wasting tactics .
" the decision must come quickly , and that is possible with today 's technology , " said merk .
the replay judges are to be the mandatory referee observer , a member of the national soccer league and a former player or journalist .
big mistake during bundesliga game merk , 45 , has long been toying with the idea , but made his proposal public after committing a big mistake himself last saturday in the bundesliga when he allowed werder bremen 's goal against borussia dortmund even though scorer markus rosenberg was clearly offside .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : some fans can feel strongly about what they see as the ref 's unfair decision " you have to think about changes .
they must be as non-invasive as possible but provide maximum efficiency , " merk told kicker .
merk admitted that not all mistakes can be erased through his scheme .
but he insisted that " we must act on behalf of football if we have the chance to erase two or three of five mistakes . "
merk 's proposals for replays - which are used in sports such as tennis and american football - have drawn mixed reactions .
the world soccer governing body fifa firmly opposed all calls for replays and is only ready to introduce a chip ball to determine goals .
" getting upset is part of the game " the german soccer federation , dfb , has asked merk to make his dossier available to them before making any comments while merk said that some referees support his plans .
news reports quoted coaches felix magath -lrb- wolfsburg -rrb- thomas doll -lrb- dortmund -rrb- as supporting merk , while bayern munich general manager uli hoeness and his mainz 05 counterpart christian heidel expressed doubts .
" it has always been part of football to get upset about decisions from the referees , " said heidel .
but merk would not buy this view : " i am surprised by statements that mistakes are part of football , " he said .
" i too want football to remain a fast game , emotional and with as few breaks as possible .
but you have to think about changes . " dw staff / dpa -lrb- sp -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

but russian president vladimir putin dispelled western hopes of a softer tone in foreign policy by his successor , dmitry medvedev . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : tension was palpable between merkel and putin " i have the feeling that some of our partners can not wait for me to stop exercising my powers so that they can deal with another person , " putin said .
" i am long accustomed to the label by which it is difficult to work with a former kgb agent . "
" dmitry medvedev will be free to demonstrate his liberal views , " putin said after talks with merkel with whom he has a frosty relationship due to the german chancellor 's frankness in addressing human rights and lack of freedoms in russia . " but he -lrb- medvedev -rrb- is no less a russian nationalist , in the good sense of the word , than i am , and i do not think that with him the partnership will be more simple . "
" open doors " to medvedev medvedev 's statements seemed to confirm putin 's predictions about russia 's next president . a 42-year-old former lawyer , medvedev told merkel he intended to seek continuity in foreign affairs .
" i am assuming we will have a continuation of that cooperation which you have had with president putin ... you have had big negotiations and that makes my task easier . "
merkel said she saw medvedev as her " immediate partner in dialogue " ahead of the group of eight 's meeting in japan later this year .
the german chancellor underscored that medvedev would find " open doors " in germany , adding an open and critical dialogue was important .
putin hits out at nato there are hopes that medvedev 's controversial election may yet usher in a more diplomatic and construction stance in moscow towards the west after clashes with putin over kosovo independence and us plans to place a missile shield in central europe .
but putin , who is expected to wield considerable influence when he steps down in may to become medvedev 's prime minister , lashed out at the western military alliance nato , which he accused of attempting to become a " substitute for the united nations . "
" an endless expansion of the military bloc under modern conditions where there is no confrontation between two hostile systems - we can that is not only unfeasible but harmful and counterproductive , " putin said .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : russia , a strong serbian ally , refuses to accept kosovo 's indepedence the russian president was equally belligerent on kosovo 's recently declared independence , warning it would encourage separatism in europe .
he warned russia would only recognize kosovo in accordance with international law .
" separatism in europe has received an additional push .
this has -lrb- relevance -rrb- for britain , for spain , for belgium , " putin said at a news conference with merkel .
" this is ... a harmful and dangerous precedent . "
merkel wants russia , europe to work together merkel adopted a more conciliatory tone , saying russia and europe needed to improve cooperation both with regards to russian energy exports to europe and other major international issues . germany is russia 's single biggest trading partner and relies heavily on moscow for gas and oil supplies .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : germany is heavily reliant on russia for gas supplies " germany and russia , europe and russia , are interdependent .
we must find a way to go forward together .
there are many things to do , " she said at the start of talks with putin just outside moscow .
however merkel also alluded to east-west strains that have worsened during putin 's tenure .
" since i 've been in power we 've found a way to discuss together and to raise critical issues in an open and sincere way , " she said .
" it 's always a joy and sometimes a challenge . "
high hopes medvedev may herald new era earlier this week , merkel congratulated medvedev on his landslide victory , while expressing concern about alleged election irregularities .
" the chancellor would like to form an impression of what the russian political landscape will look like in future , " german government spokesman ulrich wilhelm said ahead of merkel 's one-day visit to russia .
" she is looking forward to learn more about dmitry medvedev 's stated plans to entrench the rule of law and to modernise the russian state and economy , " he said .
" the chancellor will certainly raise the domestic situation after the election , as well as the election itself , where we have criticised a whole range of aspects . "
in berlin too , expectations are high that merkel may open a new chapter with medvedev .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : despite a flawed poll , europe hopes to build better relations with russia under medvedev " there 's hope the new start will mean a move away from some of the tough tones , whoch might have been due to election campaigning , " gernot erler , germany 's deputy foreign minister , told reuters in an interview this week .
germany 's foreign minister frank-walter steinmeier called on europe to engage in an updated version of the realism-driving " ostpolitik " employed during the cold war towards communist eastern europe .
" we want to add to this tradition .
let us begin with our relationship with russia , " steinmeier said this week in a speech in berlin .
" i also wished that the vote had been freer , fairer and more democratic .
but russia is and remains an indispensable partner if we wish to establish a peaceful order throughout europe . "
he signalled that the german government hopes medvedev will promote democracy in russia and strengthen ties with europe .
" dmitry medvedev has made clear his wish to modernize the country .
he has stressed that the rule of law must be of utmost importance in russia , and has expressed the wish for a renewed partnership with europe . " dw staff -lrb- sp -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

but russian president vladimir putin dispelled western hopes of a softer tone in foreign policy by his successor , dmitry medvedev . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : tension was palpable between merkel and putin " i have the feeling that some of our partners can not wait for me to stop exercising my powers so that they can deal with another person , " putin said .
" i am long accustomed to the label by which it is difficult to work with a former kgb agent . "
" dmitry medvedev will be free to demonstrate his liberal views , " putin said after talks with merkel with whom he has a frosty relationship due to the german chancellor 's frankness in addressing human rights and lack of freedoms in russia . " but he -lrb- medvedev -rrb- is no less a russian nationalist , in the good sense of the word , than i am , and i do not think that with him the partnership will be more simple . "
" open doors " to medvedev medvedev 's statements seemed to confirm putin 's predictions about russia 's next president . a 42-year-old former lawyer , medvedev told merkel he intended to seek continuity in foreign affairs .
" i am assuming we will have a continuation of that cooperation which you have had with president putin ... you have had big negotiations and that makes my task easier . "
merkel said she saw medvedev as her " immediate partner in dialogue " ahead of the group of eight 's meeting in japan later this year .
the german chancellor underscored that medvedev would find " open doors " in germany , adding an open and critical dialogue was important .
putin hits out at nato there are hopes that medvedev 's controversial election may yet usher in a more diplomatic and construction stance in moscow towards the west after clashes with putin over kosovo independence and us plans to place a missile shield in central europe .
but putin , who is expected to wield considerable influence when he steps down in may to become medvedev 's prime minister , lashed out at the western military alliance nato , which he accused of attempting to become a " substitute for the united nations . "
" an endless expansion of the military bloc under modern conditions where there is no confrontation between two hostile systems - we can that is not only unfeasible but harmful and counterproductive , " putin said .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : russia , a strong serbian ally , refuses to accept kosovo 's indepedence the russian president was equally belligerent on kosovo 's recently declared independence , warning it would encourage separatism in europe .
he warned russia would only recognize kosovo in accordance with international law .
" separatism in europe has received an additional push .
this has -lrb- relevance -rrb- for britain , for spain , for belgium , " putin said at a news conference with merkel .
" this is ... a harmful and dangerous precedent . "
merkel wants russia , europe to work together merkel adopted a more conciliatory tone , saying russia and europe needed to improve cooperation both with regards to russian energy exports to europe and other major international issues . germany is russia 's single biggest trading partner and relies heavily on moscow for gas and oil supplies .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : germany is heavily reliant on russia for gas supplies " germany and russia , europe and russia , are interdependent .
we must find a way to go forward together .
there are many things to do , " she said at the start of talks with putin just outside moscow .
however merkel also alluded to east-west strains that have worsened during putin 's tenure .
" since i 've been in power we 've found a way to discuss together and to raise critical issues in an open and sincere way , " she said .
" it 's always a joy and sometimes a challenge . "
high hopes medvedev may herald new era earlier this week , merkel congratulated medvedev on his landslide victory , while expressing concern about alleged election irregularities .
" the chancellor would like to form an impression of what the russian political landscape will look like in future , " german government spokesman ulrich wilhelm said ahead of merkel 's one-day visit to russia .
" she is looking forward to learn more about dmitry medvedev 's stated plans to entrench the rule of law and to modernise the russian state and economy , " he said .
" the chancellor will certainly raise the domestic situation after the election , as well as the election itself , where we have criticised a whole range of aspects . "
in berlin too , expectations are high that merkel may open a new chapter with medvedev .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : despite a flawed poll , europe hopes to build better relations with russia under medvedev " there 's hope the new start will mean a move away from some of the tough tones , whoch might have been due to election campaigning , " gernot erler , germany 's deputy foreign minister , told reuters in an interview this week .
germany 's foreign minister frank-walter steinmeier called on europe to engage in an updated version of the realism-driving " ostpolitik " employed during the cold war towards communist eastern europe .
" we want to add to this tradition .
let us begin with our relationship with russia , " steinmeier said this week in a speech in berlin .
" i also wished that the vote had been freer , fairer and more democratic .
but russia is and remains an indispensable partner if we wish to establish a peaceful order throughout europe . "
he signalled that the german government hopes medvedev will promote democracy in russia and strengthen ties with europe .
" dmitry medvedev has made clear his wish to modernize the country .
he has stressed that the rule of law must be of utmost importance in russia , and has expressed the wish for a renewed partnership with europe . " dw staff -lrb- sp -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

but many oppose the plans . merk told german sports magazine , kicker , this week that he has drawn up a plan in which each team as well as the referee will be allowed two challenges each for a match total of six in disputed incidents .
the three-time world referee of the year said that only one challenge should be allowed in the final 10 minutes to avoid time-wasting tactics .
" the decision must come quickly , and that is possible with today 's technology , " said merk .
the replay judges are to be the mandatory referee observer , a member of the national soccer league and a former player or journalist .
big mistake during bundesliga game merk , 45 , has long been toying with the idea , but made his proposal public after committing a big mistake himself last saturday in the bundesliga when he allowed werder bremen 's goal against borussia dortmund even though scorer markus rosenberg was clearly offside .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : some fans can feel strongly about what they see as the ref 's unfair decision " you have to think about changes .
they must be as non-invasive as possible but provide maximum efficiency , " merk told kicker .
merk admitted that not all mistakes can be erased through his scheme .
but he insisted that " we must act on behalf of football if we have the chance to erase two or three of five mistakes . "
merk 's proposals for replays - which are used in sports such as tennis and american football - have drawn mixed reactions .
the world soccer governing body fifa firmly opposed all calls for replays and is only ready to introduce a chip ball to determine goals .
" getting upset is part of the game " the german soccer federation , dfb , has asked merk to make his dossier available to them before making any comments while merk said that some referees support his plans .
news reports quoted coaches felix magath -lrb- wolfsburg -rrb- thomas doll -lrb- dortmund -rrb- as supporting merk , while bayern munich general manager uli hoeness and his mainz 05 counterpart christian heidel expressed doubts .
" it has always been part of football to get upset about decisions from the referees , " said heidel .

" there was probably never a time in human history that the topic of men and women was n't laden with cliches , " said onur gunturkun , a bio-psychologist at the ruhr university bochum .
" for the most part , the books on the market -lsb- in germany -rsb- at the moment are an embarrassment .
what stands out about these books is that they , as always , contain a kernel of truth , which is , however , generalized in a fully unacceptable way . " gunturkun specializes in research into male and female brains . " we ca n't say there are no biological differences .
there are .
but we also ca n't say : since there are these biological differences , the destinies of men and woman have been predetermined .
we are actually absolutely free . " but this freedom only exists in theory , according to american sociologist heather hofmeister . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : relatively few women can be found in the top echelons of germany 's medical institutes " women have good abilities in math .
but they often end up thinking that they are not as good , because girls are n't supposed to be good at math is the message from society .
so we close out opportunities for young men and young women , because they are men or women . "
cyclical differences neuroscientist gunturkun has examined the math cliche and discovered that men do indeed often surpass women in solving spatial tasks , but only at certain times of the month . " we were able to show that women during menstruation were as good as men at these tasks , " he said .
" that is , it 's a myth that women simply ca n't do it .
there are only certain times when they ca n't .
namely around the 20th day of their cycles , they were indeed clearly worse . " sociologist hofmeister maintains that deep-seated role assignments hinder social progress .
and they exist even in countries considered to be enlightened and modern .
in germany , austria and switzerland girls continue to be pressured into defining themselves based on the role of the " good mother . "
in contrast , society views women who are successful in their careers with suspicion . that also explains the relatively low number of women in leadership positions in these countries , according to henning sass of aachen 's university clinic .
sixty-five percent of students are female in the first years of medical studies , while at the upper ranks of the medical profession , only 5 percent of the professors , chief and senior physicians are women .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : cliches discourage girls from pursuing scientific subjects sass believes the striking numbers do reflect biological differences between the genders . " male behavior is more strongly determined by conflict , rivalry , aggressiveness , wanting to dominate , wanting to assert oneself , to stand one 's ground , to reach a leadership position , " he said .
socio-cultural constructs but others disagree .
biological differences are only relevant when it comes to reproduction , according to wassilios fthenakis , a socio-anthropologist at italy 's free university in bozen-bolzano .
his research has convinced him that other differences between men and women are socio-cultural constructions , behaviors which even the smallest child has internalized . fthenakis observed children playing and repeatedly witnessed the same behavior : boys who played with dolls or perfume and girls who took an interest in building bricks were shunned by their peers . " when you observe these children , you see that they succumb to pressure from the group not to show such behavior , " he said .
" thus the children are forced to either play with adults or to play alone , so no one notices what they do , or even to disavow their behavior .
that is : they lie . "
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : peer pressure keeps boys and girls in " their place , " fthenakis said fthenakis developed new educational plans for the german states of hesse and bavaria as well as for the south tyrol region of italy .
he calls for breaking down socially defined structures among infants .
every child , male or female , must be accepted and encouraged as an individual , regardless of gender , he argues .
and he 's seen that such an approach works , at a kindergarten in melbourne , australia . " i 've never seen a kindergarten where the harmony and the good relations between boys and girls was so exceptional as it was there .
it was an encouraging example that we should take seriously , and -lsb- we -rsb- should consider carefully how we treat boys and girls today . " miriam schack -lrb- ncy -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

some are even doing well on the us market , where a recession is looming . total sales in germany 's auto sector rose by 17 percent in the first two months of this year , according to germany 's national car industry association , vda .
the jump trailed a year of slow sales due to a 19-percent value-added tax hike in january 2007 . " that is the best start to a new year since 2003 , " said vda president matthias wissman . daimler this week said its luxury flagship brand mercedes-benz sold 96,600 cars world-wide last month , representing a 17.7 percent increase over last year , largely due to the popularity of its c-class . only mercedes gains in the us sales of is smart fortwo brand also did well , doubling overall to 8,800 sold .
1,800 of the economy vehicles were purchased in the us , where buying power is slipping and the economy is said to be nearing a recession .
the euro hit an all-time high of 1.52 against the dollar last month . most of daimlers ' us sales fell into the luxury category , however , where buyers are less affected by market swings .
mercedes-benz posted a three percent rise in the us , the only german carmaker to post figures in the black on the other side of the atlantic . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : bmw 's restructuring plans are likely to lead to massive job cuts during the auto salon car show in geneva , mercedes-benz announced it is planning to release a lithium-ion hybrid version of its s-class luxury car in 2009 .
though the sedan would emit 190 grams of carbon dioxide per kilometer , much more than many smaller vehicles , it claims to be the most efficient luxury car in the world . bmw ponders new partnership munich-based bmw also announced a 14 percent rise in sales so far this year . bmw chief norbert reithofer sparked speculation this week in geneva by saying that promising discussions had been held with a potential new partner , which he declined to name .
general motors and fiat are considered likely candidates , as bmw already excluded a partnership with audi and talks with mercedes have been thorny . creating partnerships is part of the munich carmaker 's restructuring plan .
its subsidiary mini has collaborated with citroen since december 2004 in building motors for smaller models .
the plan also includes cutting 8,100 jobs world-wide , 2,500 in germany , in an effort to save six billion euros -lrb- over $ 9 billion -rrb- by 2012 . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : with an annual output of 100,000 cars , porsche is significantly smaller than vw despite a two-percent setback on the us market , reithofer said his firm continues to do good business in the us . " bmw will be profitable in the us in 2008 , " he said .
" we 're not just talking about a few hundred million euros . " porsche to buy majority share of vw audi also has ambitious plans to pick up sales in the us , despite a 6.9 percent drop there in february .
it has said it wants to increase us sales from 93,000 to 200,000 by the year 2015 and is considering setting up a production plant there . german luxury sportscar maker porsche reported an impressive 44-percent increase in first half earnings , in part due to the success of volkswagen , where it has had a one-third share .
earlier this week , the company unveiled plans to raise its share in the wolfsburg brand to over 50 percent , creating what porsche ceo wendelin wiedeking called a " collegial partnership " and not a takeover . dw staff -lrb- kjb -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

but russian president vladimir putin dispelled western hopes of a softer tone in foreign policy by his successor , dmitry medvedev . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : tension was palpable between merkel and putin " i have the feeling that some of our partners can not wait for me to stop exercising my powers so that they can deal with another person , " putin said .
" i am long accustomed to the label by which it is difficult to work with a former kgb agent . "
" dmitry medvedev will be free to demonstrate his liberal views , " putin said after talks with merkel with whom he has a frosty relationship due to the german chancellor 's frankness in addressing human rights and lack of freedoms in russia . " but he -lrb- medvedev -rrb- is no less a russian nationalist , in the good sense of the word , than i am , and i do not think that with him the partnership will be more simple . "
" open doors " to medvedev medvedev 's statements seemed to confirm putin 's predictions about russia 's next president . a 42-year-old former lawyer , medvedev told merkel he intended to seek continuity in foreign affairs .
" i am assuming we will have a continuation of that cooperation which you have had with president putin ... you have had big negotiations and that makes my task easier . "
merkel said she saw medvedev as her " immediate partner in dialogue " ahead of the group of eight 's meeting in japan later this year .
the german chancellor underscored that medvedev would find " open doors " in germany , adding an open and critical dialogue was important .
putin hits out at nato there are hopes that medvedev 's controversial election may yet usher in a more diplomatic and construction stance in moscow towards the west after clashes with putin over kosovo independence and us plans to place a missile shield in central europe .
but putin , who is expected to wield considerable influence when he steps down in may to become medvedev 's prime minister , lashed out at the western military alliance nato , which he accused of attempting to become a " substitute for the united nations . "
" an endless expansion of the military bloc under modern conditions where there is no confrontation between two hostile systems - we can that is not only unfeasible but harmful and counterproductive , " putin said .

however merkel also alluded to east-west strains that have worsened during putin 's tenure .
" since i 've been in power we 've found a way to discuss together and to raise critical issues in an open and sincere way , " she said .
" it 's always a joy and sometimes a challenge . "

but many oppose the plans . merk told german sports magazine , kicker , this week that he has drawn up a plan in which each team as well as the referee will be allowed two challenges each for a match total of six in disputed incidents .
the three-time world referee of the year said that only one challenge should be allowed in the final 10 minutes to avoid time-wasting tactics .
" the decision must come quickly , and that is possible with today 's technology , " said merk .
the replay judges are to be the mandatory referee observer , a member of the national soccer league and a former player or journalist .
big mistake during bundesliga game merk , 45 , has long been toying with the idea , but made his proposal public after committing a big mistake himself last saturday in the bundesliga when he allowed werder bremen 's goal against borussia dortmund even though scorer markus rosenberg was clearly offside .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : some fans can feel strongly about what they see as the ref 's unfair decision " you have to think about changes .
they must be as non-invasive as possible but provide maximum efficiency , " merk told kicker .
merk admitted that not all mistakes can be erased through his scheme .
but he insisted that " we must act on behalf of football if we have the chance to erase two or three of five mistakes . "
merk 's proposals for replays - which are used in sports such as tennis and american football - have drawn mixed reactions .
the world soccer governing body fifa firmly opposed all calls for replays and is only ready to introduce a chip ball to determine goals .
" getting upset is part of the game " the german soccer federation , dfb , has asked merk to make his dossier available to them before making any comments while merk said that some referees support his plans .
news reports quoted coaches felix magath -lrb- wolfsburg -rrb- thomas doll -lrb- dortmund -rrb- as supporting merk , while bayern munich general manager uli hoeness and his mainz 05 counterpart christian heidel expressed doubts .
" it has always been part of football to get upset about decisions from the referees , " said heidel .
but merk would not buy this view : " i am surprised by statements that mistakes are part of football , " he said .
" i too want football to remain a fast game , emotional and with as few breaks as possible .
but you have to think about changes . " dw staff / dpa -lrb- sp -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

some are even doing well on the us market , where a recession is looming . total sales in germany 's auto sector rose by 17 percent in the first two months of this year , according to germany 's national car industry association , vda .
the jump trailed a year of slow sales due to a 19-percent value-added tax hike in january 2007 . " that is the best start to a new year since 2003 , " said vda president matthias wissman . daimler this week said its luxury flagship brand mercedes-benz sold 96,600 cars world-wide last month , representing a 17.7 percent increase over last year , largely due to the popularity of its c-class . only mercedes gains in the us sales of is smart fortwo brand also did well , doubling overall to 8,800 sold .
1,800 of the economy vehicles were purchased in the us , where buying power is slipping and the economy is said to be nearing a recession .
the euro hit an all-time high of 1.52 against the dollar last month . most of daimlers ' us sales fell into the luxury category , however , where buyers are less affected by market swings .
mercedes-benz posted a three percent rise in the us , the only german carmaker to post figures in the black on the other side of the atlantic . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : bmw 's restructuring plans are likely to lead to massive job cuts during the auto salon car show in geneva , mercedes-benz announced it is planning to release a lithium-ion hybrid version of its s-class luxury car in 2009 .
though the sedan would emit 190 grams of carbon dioxide per kilometer , much more than many smaller vehicles , it claims to be the most efficient luxury car in the world . bmw ponders new partnership munich-based bmw also announced a 14 percent rise in sales so far this year . bmw chief norbert reithofer sparked speculation this week in geneva by saying that promising discussions had been held with a potential new partner , which he declined to name .

but many oppose the plans . merk told german sports magazine , kicker , this week that he has drawn up a plan in which each team as well as the referee will be allowed two challenges each for a match total of six in disputed incidents .
the three-time world referee of the year said that only one challenge should be allowed in the final 10 minutes to avoid time-wasting tactics .
" the decision must come quickly , and that is possible with today 's technology , " said merk .
the replay judges are to be the mandatory referee observer , a member of the national soccer league and a former player or journalist .

but he insisted that " we must act on behalf of football if we have the chance to erase two or three of five mistakes . "
merk 's proposals for replays - which are used in sports such as tennis and american football - have drawn mixed reactions .
the world soccer governing body fifa firmly opposed all calls for replays and is only ready to introduce a chip ball to determine goals .

some are even doing well on the us market , where a recession is looming . total sales in germany 's auto sector rose by 17 percent in the first two months of this year , according to germany 's national car industry association , vda .
the jump trailed a year of slow sales due to a 19-percent value-added tax hike in january 2007 . " that is the best start to a new year since 2003 , " said vda president matthias wissman . daimler this week said its luxury flagship brand mercedes-benz sold 96,600 cars world-wide last month , representing a 17.7 percent increase over last year , largely due to the popularity of its c-class . only mercedes gains in the us sales of is smart fortwo brand also did well , doubling overall to 8,800 sold .

though the sedan would emit 190 grams of carbon dioxide per kilometer , much more than many smaller vehicles , it claims to be the most efficient luxury car in the world . bmw ponders new partnership munich-based bmw also announced a 14 percent rise in sales so far this year . bmw chief norbert reithofer sparked speculation this week in geneva by saying that promising discussions had been held with a potential new partner , which he declined to name .
general motors and fiat are considered likely candidates , as bmw already excluded a partnership with audi and talks with mercedes have been thorny . creating partnerships is part of the munich carmaker 's restructuring plan .
its subsidiary mini has collaborated with citroen since december 2004 in building motors for smaller models .
the plan also includes cutting 8,100 jobs world-wide , 2,500 in germany , in an effort to save six billion euros -lrb- over $ 9 billion -rrb- by 2012 . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : with an annual output of 100,000 cars , porsche is significantly smaller than vw despite a two-percent setback on the us market , reithofer said his firm continues to do good business in the us .

" we 're not just talking about a few hundred million euros . " porsche to buy majority share of vw audi also has ambitious plans to pick up sales in the us , despite a 6.9 percent drop there in february .
it has said it wants to increase us sales from 93,000 to 200,000 by the year 2015 and is considering setting up a production plant there . german luxury sportscar maker porsche reported an impressive 44-percent increase in first half earnings , in part due to the success of volkswagen , where it has had a one-third share .
earlier this week , the company unveiled plans to raise its share in the wolfsburg brand to over 50 percent , creating what porsche ceo wendelin wiedeking called a " collegial partnership " and not a takeover . dw staff -lrb- kjb -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

but russian president vladimir putin dispelled western hopes of a softer tone in foreign policy by his successor , dmitry medvedev . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : tension was palpable between merkel and putin " i have the feeling that some of our partners can not wait for me to stop exercising my powers so that they can deal with another person , " putin said .
" i am long accustomed to the label by which it is difficult to work with a former kgb agent . "
" dmitry medvedev will be free to demonstrate his liberal views , " putin said after talks with merkel with whom he has a frosty relationship due to the german chancellor 's frankness in addressing human rights and lack of freedoms in russia . " but he -lrb- medvedev -rrb- is no less a russian nationalist , in the good sense of the word , than i am , and i do not think that with him the partnership will be more simple . "
" open doors " to medvedev medvedev 's statements seemed to confirm putin 's predictions about russia 's next president . a 42-year-old former lawyer , medvedev told merkel he intended to seek continuity in foreign affairs .
" i am assuming we will have a continuation of that cooperation which you have had with president putin ... you have had big negotiations and that makes my task easier . "

the german chancellor underscored that medvedev would find " open doors " in germany , adding an open and critical dialogue was important .

some are even doing well on the us market , where a recession is looming . total sales in germany 's auto sector rose by 17 percent in the first two months of this year , according to germany 's national car industry association , vda .
the jump trailed a year of slow sales due to a 19-percent value-added tax hike in january 2007 . " that is the best start to a new year since 2003 , " said vda president matthias wissman . daimler this week said its luxury flagship brand mercedes-benz sold 96,600 cars world-wide last month , representing a 17.7 percent increase over last year , largely due to the popularity of its c-class . only mercedes gains in the us sales of is smart fortwo brand also did well , doubling overall to 8,800 sold .
1,800 of the economy vehicles were purchased in the us , where buying power is slipping and the economy is said to be nearing a recession .
the euro hit an all-time high of 1.52 against the dollar last month . most of daimlers ' us sales fell into the luxury category , however , where buyers are less affected by market swings .
mercedes-benz posted a three percent rise in the us , the only german carmaker to post figures in the black on the other side of the atlantic . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : bmw 's restructuring plans are likely to lead to massive job cuts during the auto salon car show in geneva , mercedes-benz announced it is planning to release a lithium-ion hybrid version of its s-class luxury car in 2009 .
though the sedan would emit 190 grams of carbon dioxide per kilometer , much more than many smaller vehicles , it claims to be the most efficient luxury car in the world . bmw ponders new partnership munich-based bmw also announced a 14 percent rise in sales so far this year . bmw chief norbert reithofer sparked speculation this week in geneva by saying that promising discussions had been held with a potential new partner , which he declined to name .
general motors and fiat are considered likely candidates , as bmw already excluded a partnership with audi and talks with mercedes have been thorny . creating partnerships is part of the munich carmaker 's restructuring plan .
its subsidiary mini has collaborated with citroen since december 2004 in building motors for smaller models .
the plan also includes cutting 8,100 jobs world-wide , 2,500 in germany , in an effort to save six billion euros -lrb- over $ 9 billion -rrb- by 2012 . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : with an annual output of 100,000 cars , porsche is significantly smaller than vw despite a two-percent setback on the us market , reithofer said his firm continues to do good business in the us . " bmw will be profitable in the us in 2008 , " he said .
" we 're not just talking about a few hundred million euros . " porsche to buy majority share of vw audi also has ambitious plans to pick up sales in the us , despite a 6.9 percent drop there in february .
it has said it wants to increase us sales from 93,000 to 200,000 by the year 2015 and is considering setting up a production plant there . german luxury sportscar maker porsche reported an impressive 44-percent increase in first half earnings , in part due to the success of volkswagen , where it has had a one-third share .
earlier this week , the company unveiled plans to raise its share in the wolfsburg brand to over 50 percent , creating what porsche ceo wendelin wiedeking called a " collegial partnership " and not a takeover . dw staff -lrb- kjb -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

" i am long accustomed to the label by which it is difficult to work with a former kgb agent . "
" dmitry medvedev will be free to demonstrate his liberal views , " putin said after talks with merkel with whom he has a frosty relationship due to the german chancellor 's frankness in addressing human rights and lack of freedoms in russia . " but he -lrb- medvedev -rrb- is no less a russian nationalist , in the good sense of the word , than i am , and i do not think that with him the partnership will be more simple . "
" open doors " to medvedev medvedev 's statements seemed to confirm putin 's predictions about russia 's next president . a 42-year-old former lawyer , medvedev told merkel he intended to seek continuity in foreign affairs .
" i am assuming we will have a continuation of that cooperation which you have had with president putin ... you have had big negotiations and that makes my task easier . "
merkel said she saw medvedev as her " immediate partner in dialogue " ahead of the group of eight 's meeting in japan later this year .
the german chancellor underscored that medvedev would find " open doors " in germany , adding an open and critical dialogue was important .
putin hits out at nato there are hopes that medvedev 's controversial election may yet usher in a more diplomatic and construction stance in moscow towards the west after clashes with putin over kosovo independence and us plans to place a missile shield in central europe .
but putin , who is expected to wield considerable influence when he steps down in may to become medvedev 's prime minister , lashed out at the western military alliance nato , which he accused of attempting to become a " substitute for the united nations . "
" an endless expansion of the military bloc under modern conditions where there is no confrontation between two hostile systems - we can that is not only unfeasible but harmful and counterproductive , " putin said .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : russia , a strong serbian ally , refuses to accept kosovo 's indepedence the russian president was equally belligerent on kosovo 's recently declared independence , warning it would encourage separatism in europe .
he warned russia would only recognize kosovo in accordance with international law .
" separatism in europe has received an additional push .
this has -lrb- relevance -rrb- for britain , for spain , for belgium , " putin said at a news conference with merkel .
" this is ... a harmful and dangerous precedent . "
merkel wants russia , europe to work together merkel adopted a more conciliatory tone , saying russia and europe needed to improve cooperation both with regards to russian energy exports to europe and other major international issues . germany is russia 's single biggest trading partner and relies heavily on moscow for gas and oil supplies .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : germany is heavily reliant on russia for gas supplies " germany and russia , europe and russia , are interdependent .
we must find a way to go forward together .
there are many things to do , " she said at the start of talks with putin just outside moscow .

" she is looking forward to learn more about dmitry medvedev 's stated plans to entrench the rule of law and to modernise the russian state and economy , " he said .
" the chancellor will certainly raise the domestic situation after the election , as well as the election itself , where we have criticised a whole range of aspects . "
in berlin too , expectations are high that merkel may open a new chapter with medvedev .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : despite a flawed poll , europe hopes to build better relations with russia under medvedev " there 's hope the new start will mean a move away from some of the tough tones , whoch might have been due to election campaigning , " gernot erler , germany 's deputy foreign minister , told reuters in an interview this week .
germany 's foreign minister frank-walter steinmeier called on europe to engage in an updated version of the realism-driving " ostpolitik " employed during the cold war towards communist eastern europe .
" we want to add to this tradition .
let us begin with our relationship with russia , " steinmeier said this week in a speech in berlin .

some are even doing well on the us market , where a recession is looming . total sales in germany 's auto sector rose by 17 percent in the first two months of this year , according to germany 's national car industry association , vda .
the jump trailed a year of slow sales due to a 19-percent value-added tax hike in january 2007 . " that is the best start to a new year since 2003 , " said vda president matthias wissman . daimler this week said its luxury flagship brand mercedes-benz sold 96,600 cars world-wide last month , representing a 17.7 percent increase over last year , largely due to the popularity of its c-class . only mercedes gains in the us sales of is smart fortwo brand also did well , doubling overall to 8,800 sold .
1,800 of the economy vehicles were purchased in the us , where buying power is slipping and the economy is said to be nearing a recession .
the euro hit an all-time high of 1.52 against the dollar last month . most of daimlers ' us sales fell into the luxury category , however , where buyers are less affected by market swings .
mercedes-benz posted a three percent rise in the us , the only german carmaker to post figures in the black on the other side of the atlantic . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : bmw 's restructuring plans are likely to lead to massive job cuts during the auto salon car show in geneva , mercedes-benz announced it is planning to release a lithium-ion hybrid version of its s-class luxury car in 2009 .
though the sedan would emit 190 grams of carbon dioxide per kilometer , much more than many smaller vehicles , it claims to be the most efficient luxury car in the world . bmw ponders new partnership munich-based bmw also announced a 14 percent rise in sales so far this year . bmw chief norbert reithofer sparked speculation this week in geneva by saying that promising discussions had been held with a potential new partner , which he declined to name .
general motors and fiat are considered likely candidates , as bmw already excluded a partnership with audi and talks with mercedes have been thorny . creating partnerships is part of the munich carmaker 's restructuring plan .
its subsidiary mini has collaborated with citroen since december 2004 in building motors for smaller models .
the plan also includes cutting 8,100 jobs world-wide , 2,500 in germany , in an effort to save six billion euros -lrb- over $ 9 billion -rrb- by 2012 . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : with an annual output of 100,000 cars , porsche is significantly smaller than vw despite a two-percent setback on the us market , reithofer said his firm continues to do good business in the us . " bmw will be profitable in the us in 2008 , " he said .

" there was probably never a time in human history that the topic of men and women was n't laden with cliches , " said onur gunturkun , a bio-psychologist at the ruhr university bochum .
" for the most part , the books on the market -lsb- in germany -rsb- at the moment are an embarrassment .
what stands out about these books is that they , as always , contain a kernel of truth , which is , however , generalized in a fully unacceptable way . " gunturkun specializes in research into male and female brains . " we ca n't say there are no biological differences .
there are .
but we also ca n't say : since there are these biological differences , the destinies of men and woman have been predetermined .
we are actually absolutely free . " but this freedom only exists in theory , according to american sociologist heather hofmeister . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : relatively few women can be found in the top echelons of germany 's medical institutes " women have good abilities in math .
but they often end up thinking that they are not as good , because girls are n't supposed to be good at math is the message from society .
so we close out opportunities for young men and young women , because they are men or women . "
cyclical differences neuroscientist gunturkun has examined the math cliche and discovered that men do indeed often surpass women in solving spatial tasks , but only at certain times of the month . " we were able to show that women during menstruation were as good as men at these tasks , " he said .
" that is , it 's a myth that women simply ca n't do it .
there are only certain times when they ca n't .
namely around the 20th day of their cycles , they were indeed clearly worse . " sociologist hofmeister maintains that deep-seated role assignments hinder social progress .
and they exist even in countries considered to be enlightened and modern .
in germany , austria and switzerland girls continue to be pressured into defining themselves based on the role of the " good mother . "
in contrast , society views women who are successful in their careers with suspicion . that also explains the relatively low number of women in leadership positions in these countries , according to henning sass of aachen 's university clinic .
sixty-five percent of students are female in the first years of medical studies , while at the upper ranks of the medical profession , only 5 percent of the professors , chief and senior physicians are women .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : cliches discourage girls from pursuing scientific subjects sass believes the striking numbers do reflect biological differences between the genders . " male behavior is more strongly determined by conflict , rivalry , aggressiveness , wanting to dominate , wanting to assert oneself , to stand one 's ground , to reach a leadership position , " he said .
socio-cultural constructs but others disagree .
biological differences are only relevant when it comes to reproduction , according to wassilios fthenakis , a socio-anthropologist at italy 's free university in bozen-bolzano .
his research has convinced him that other differences between men and women are socio-cultural constructions , behaviors which even the smallest child has internalized . fthenakis observed children playing and repeatedly witnessed the same behavior : boys who played with dolls or perfume and girls who took an interest in building bricks were shunned by their peers . " when you observe these children , you see that they succumb to pressure from the group not to show such behavior , " he said .
" thus the children are forced to either play with adults or to play alone , so no one notices what they do , or even to disavow their behavior .
that is : they lie . "
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : peer pressure keeps boys and girls in " their place , " fthenakis said fthenakis developed new educational plans for the german states of hesse and bavaria as well as for the south tyrol region of italy .
he calls for breaking down socially defined structures among infants .
every child , male or female , must be accepted and encouraged as an individual , regardless of gender , he argues .
and he 's seen that such an approach works , at a kindergarten in melbourne , australia . " i 've never seen a kindergarten where the harmony and the good relations between boys and girls was so exceptional as it was there .
it was an encouraging example that we should take seriously , and -lsb- we -rsb- should consider carefully how we treat boys and girls today . " miriam schack -lrb- ncy -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

but many oppose the plans . merk told german sports magazine , kicker , this week that he has drawn up a plan in which each team as well as the referee will be allowed two challenges each for a match total of six in disputed incidents .
the three-time world referee of the year said that only one challenge should be allowed in the final 10 minutes to avoid time-wasting tactics .
" the decision must come quickly , and that is possible with today 's technology , " said merk .
the replay judges are to be the mandatory referee observer , a member of the national soccer league and a former player or journalist .

but he insisted that " we must act on behalf of football if we have the chance to erase two or three of five mistakes . "
merk 's proposals for replays - which are used in sports such as tennis and american football - have drawn mixed reactions .
the world soccer governing body fifa firmly opposed all calls for replays and is only ready to introduce a chip ball to determine goals .
" getting upset is part of the game " the german soccer federation , dfb , has asked merk to make his dossier available to them before making any comments while merk said that some referees support his plans .

but many oppose the plans . merk told german sports magazine , kicker , this week that he has drawn up a plan in which each team as well as the referee will be allowed two challenges each for a match total of six in disputed incidents .
the three-time world referee of the year said that only one challenge should be allowed in the final 10 minutes to avoid time-wasting tactics .
" the decision must come quickly , and that is possible with today 's technology , " said merk .
the replay judges are to be the mandatory referee observer , a member of the national soccer league and a former player or journalist .
big mistake during bundesliga game merk , 45 , has long been toying with the idea , but made his proposal public after committing a big mistake himself last saturday in the bundesliga when he allowed werder bremen 's goal against borussia dortmund even though scorer markus rosenberg was clearly offside .

the world soccer governing body fifa firmly opposed all calls for replays and is only ready to introduce a chip ball to determine goals .
" getting upset is part of the game " the german soccer federation , dfb , has asked merk to make his dossier available to them before making any comments while merk said that some referees support his plans .
news reports quoted coaches felix magath -lrb- wolfsburg -rrb- thomas doll -lrb- dortmund -rrb- as supporting merk , while bayern munich general manager uli hoeness and his mainz 05 counterpart christian heidel expressed doubts .
" it has always been part of football to get upset about decisions from the referees , " said heidel .

but russian president vladimir putin dispelled western hopes of a softer tone in foreign policy by his successor , dmitry medvedev . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : tension was palpable between merkel and putin " i have the feeling that some of our partners can not wait for me to stop exercising my powers so that they can deal with another person , " putin said .
" i am long accustomed to the label by which it is difficult to work with a former kgb agent . "
" dmitry medvedev will be free to demonstrate his liberal views , " putin said after talks with merkel with whom he has a frosty relationship due to the german chancellor 's frankness in addressing human rights and lack of freedoms in russia . " but he -lrb- medvedev -rrb- is no less a russian nationalist , in the good sense of the word , than i am , and i do not think that with him the partnership will be more simple . "
" open doors " to medvedev medvedev 's statements seemed to confirm putin 's predictions about russia 's next president . a 42-year-old former lawyer , medvedev told merkel he intended to seek continuity in foreign affairs .
" i am assuming we will have a continuation of that cooperation which you have had with president putin ... you have had big negotiations and that makes my task easier . "
merkel said she saw medvedev as her " immediate partner in dialogue " ahead of the group of eight 's meeting in japan later this year .
the german chancellor underscored that medvedev would find " open doors " in germany , adding an open and critical dialogue was important .
putin hits out at nato there are hopes that medvedev 's controversial election may yet usher in a more diplomatic and construction stance in moscow towards the west after clashes with putin over kosovo independence and us plans to place a missile shield in central europe .
but putin , who is expected to wield considerable influence when he steps down in may to become medvedev 's prime minister , lashed out at the western military alliance nato , which he accused of attempting to become a " substitute for the united nations . "
" an endless expansion of the military bloc under modern conditions where there is no confrontation between two hostile systems - we can that is not only unfeasible but harmful and counterproductive , " putin said .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : russia , a strong serbian ally , refuses to accept kosovo 's indepedence the russian president was equally belligerent on kosovo 's recently declared independence , warning it would encourage separatism in europe .
he warned russia would only recognize kosovo in accordance with international law .
" separatism in europe has received an additional push .
this has -lrb- relevance -rrb- for britain , for spain , for belgium , " putin said at a news conference with merkel .
" this is ... a harmful and dangerous precedent . "
merkel wants russia , europe to work together merkel adopted a more conciliatory tone , saying russia and europe needed to improve cooperation both with regards to russian energy exports to europe and other major international issues . germany is russia 's single biggest trading partner and relies heavily on moscow for gas and oil supplies .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : germany is heavily reliant on russia for gas supplies " germany and russia , europe and russia , are interdependent .
we must find a way to go forward together .
there are many things to do , " she said at the start of talks with putin just outside moscow .
however merkel also alluded to east-west strains that have worsened during putin 's tenure .
" since i 've been in power we 've found a way to discuss together and to raise critical issues in an open and sincere way , " she said .
" it 's always a joy and sometimes a challenge . "
high hopes medvedev may herald new era earlier this week , merkel congratulated medvedev on his landslide victory , while expressing concern about alleged election irregularities .
" the chancellor would like to form an impression of what the russian political landscape will look like in future , " german government spokesman ulrich wilhelm said ahead of merkel 's one-day visit to russia .
" she is looking forward to learn more about dmitry medvedev 's stated plans to entrench the rule of law and to modernise the russian state and economy , " he said .
" the chancellor will certainly raise the domestic situation after the election , as well as the election itself , where we have criticised a whole range of aspects . "
in berlin too , expectations are high that merkel may open a new chapter with medvedev .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : despite a flawed poll , europe hopes to build better relations with russia under medvedev " there 's hope the new start will mean a move away from some of the tough tones , whoch might have been due to election campaigning , " gernot erler , germany 's deputy foreign minister , told reuters in an interview this week .
germany 's foreign minister frank-walter steinmeier called on europe to engage in an updated version of the realism-driving " ostpolitik " employed during the cold war towards communist eastern europe .
" we want to add to this tradition .
let us begin with our relationship with russia , " steinmeier said this week in a speech in berlin .
" i also wished that the vote had been freer , fairer and more democratic .
but russia is and remains an indispensable partner if we wish to establish a peaceful order throughout europe . "
he signalled that the german government hopes medvedev will promote democracy in russia and strengthen ties with europe .
" dmitry medvedev has made clear his wish to modernize the country .
he has stressed that the rule of law must be of utmost importance in russia , and has expressed the wish for a renewed partnership with europe . " dw staff -lrb- sp -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

the national electoral court has postponed a referendum on a new draft constitution planned for 4 may , saying there is not enough time to prepare .
mr morales has faced sustained opposition to his plans from the resource-rich east of the country .

" no technical , operative , legal or political conditions exist to allow it to go forward , " he said .
he added that the referendum failed to meet a constitutional requirement that it be held at least 90 days after being approved by congress .
the draft constitution was approved last year by a constitutional assembly which has been boycotted by opposition groups .
the president can not afford to let down his supporters , say analysts it would grant greater powers , and a bigger share of bolivia 's land and resources , to the country 's indigenous groups - who make up the majority of the population but have long been marginalised by the country 's european-descended elite .
but opponents in four eastern states - also home to a large part of bolivia 's oil and gas deposits - say it would unfairly privilege indigenous groups over the rest of the population .

" this summit was a gift from god , " he was quoted by reuters as saying after shaking hands with his colombian and ecuadorean counterparts at a summit .
the crisis began after colombian troops killed raul reyes - the farc rebels ' second most important man - in ecuador .
it has now emerged that four mexicans may have been killed in the raid .
mexico has ordered an investigation , and ecuador has yet to confirm the identity of those killed last saturday .
a fifth member of the mexican group - who were all students - is recovering in a hospital in ecuador 's capital , quito .
colombia 's government has also announced that another commander of the farc left-wing rebels has been killed .
ivan rios - the youngest in the seven-member farc secretariat - was killed by his own men in the province of caldas , said defence minister juan manuel santos .
it was not clear why he was killed .
verbal sparring there were heated exchanges at the rio group summit of latin american leaders in dominican republic that had originally been planned to discuss energy and other issues .
but the crisis became the worst political spat in the region for years .
venezuela and ecuador cut diplomatic ties with bogota and sent troops to their borders after the colombian operation which left 20 farc rebels dead .
pride fuels tensions borders a sensitive issue in quotes : summit sparring nicaragua 's president daniel ortega , who had also broken off diplomatic ties with colombia , said they would be re-established after the presidents shook hands .
the handshakes were broadcast live on television across latin america in response to a special request from the summit 's host , dominican republic president leonel fernandez .
" we are all happy , " mr chavez said afterwards .
" peace !
we must unite and integrate . "
ecuadorean president rafael correa and his colombian counterpart alvaro uribe had clashed at the opening of the summit .
mr correa condemned colombia 's " aggression " , while mr uribe accused his opposite number of having links with the farc rebels .
the colombian president said he had not warned ecuador before the raid because mr correa had not co-operated in the fight against terrorism .
he also claimed material seized in the operation proved links between mr correa 's government and the rebels .
mr correa rejected the claims , saying his hands were not " stained with blood " .
he admitted there had been communications with farc , but only because his government was trying to secure the release of hostages held by the rebels , including former colombian presidential candidate ingrid betancourt .
but before shaking hands , to applause from the summit delegates , mr correa said : " with the commitment of never attacking a brother country again and by asking forgiveness , we can consider this very serious incident resolved . "
the bbc 's jeremy mcdermott says president uribe 's huge gamble in ordering the air strike that killed reyes appears to have paid off .
he said mr uribe knew it would lead to a diplomatic incident with ecuador , but perhaps did not realise that venezuela and nicaragua would also break off diplomatic relations .

so imagine what it must have been like for the latest teenage graduates of the vale of glamorgan romance academy .
they have been speaking frankly about their relationships with a group of strangers and peers for the last 15 weeks .
the project , which was inspired by the bbc2 documentary no sex please we 're teenagers , is aimed at reducing teenage pregnancies and educating youngsters about relationship pressures .
a christian-influenced approach is adopted at the romance academy with candidates being challenged to stay celibate for the duration of the course .
members of the group , all aged 14 to 18 and split 50-50 between the sexes , visit sti -lrb- sexually transmitted infections -rrb- clinics , meet a midwife , and some take a realistic baby doll home for the weekend to experience being a young parent .
a salsa lesson , photo-shoot and talks on parenting are also all part of the experience .
my mum said to me that she wishes she had something similar when she was younger becky thomas as well as educational aspects , the group discusses cultural and media views of sex and how it can influence people ; role models , stereotypes and bullying are examined and they go for an activity weekend away together .
" we want young people to see that sex is an important part of life and loving relationships but that they should n't feel pressured into it if they do n't want to do it , " said youth worker nathan scott-cook , 35 , who runs the penarth group alongside chloe roberts .
but what did two recent graduates of the academy think of their experience ?
was the romance academy merely an elongated sex education lesson ?
" no ! " seems to be the resounding answer from becky thomas and sioned young , both 15 and pupils at ysgol gyfun bro morgannwg in barry .
the girls , who heard about the academy from a friend , said sex education at their school would benefit from an injection of some of the project 's discussion topics and activities .
' biology lesson ' " it is so impersonal in school , " said sioned .
" there it 's just the facts , it 's like a biology lesson .
" among your classmates i also think you 're expected to behave in a certain way , but this was more intimate .
you could talk about things you could never say in school . "
becky added : " we were in this group with other people we did n't know and in some ways this made it easier for us .
" the first session when we took our celibacy pledge was pretty in-your-face and incredibly frank . "
sioned said any revelations made were treated with respect and trust built up between the group of 12 quickly .
" if someone said something , this encouraged someone else to say something too .
it was like a domino effect , " she said .
nathan scott-cook and chloe roberts run the penarth academy the group 's members were picked by organisers from a range of backgrounds and experiences .
becky admitted there were some members of the group who , on first glance , she would n't have hung around with .
" some of the lads who came looked kind of tough .
but they were really funny and they made the meetings , " she said .
" the academy gave us the chance to get to know the person , not the label . "
sioned added : " it made you look at things in a completely different way .
it 's not like we go sleeping around , but we all got something out of it sioned young " a youth worker called dewi came to talk to us about drugs .
he was n't telling us not to do drugs , but instead told us about his experiences .
" he was not being patronising , he was trusting us with information and leaving it up to us to make our own decision . "
becky said the academy had made her think more about the consequences of her actions .
" if i did have sex , how would i feel after ?
would i regret it or would i feel nice about it ? " she said .
" you learn to value yourself more and it makes you question whether you want to take a relationship further .
" my mum said to me that she wishes she had something similar when she was younger . "

a new romance academy has just begun in nearby cowbridge and a fourth penarth-based project will begin later this year .

but can his visit help the island still suffering the devastating effects of a volcanic eruption in 1997 ?
as you fly over montserrat the first thing that strikes you is the soufriere hills volcano - it dominates the skyline as do the plumes of smoke coming from it .
the second thing is the colour of the island .
it looks as though it has been split into two halves .
one side is verdant and green , the other ashen and grey , not fully alive nor fully dead .
it is a stark contrast that sums up the island 's future .
missing people after being dormant for hundreds of years , the volcano suddenly became active in 1995 - but it was an eruption two years later , leaving 19 people dead , that started an exodus from the island .
plymouth , the historic capital , was buried under feet of mud and ash and the damage affected most of the south coast .
now just less than half the island is inhabitable .
montserratians left in their thousands , some heading to the us or other caribbean islands .
there is no economic activity on the island bennette roach many settled in the uk as britain eventually gave passports to islanders who wanted to leave .
two thirds of the population decided to go , taking the population from more than 12,000 before to around 5,000 now .
despite the fact that volcanic activity on the island has decreased over the years , few people have returned home .
the opportunities that they found abroad just do not exist on an island where the biggest employer is the government .
bennette roach is the editor of the island 's only newspaper , the montserrat reporter .
" it 's a paradise for anyone who is visiting .
it 's a great place to visit .
even when i go to england i meet people and they say , ' i 'd love to come back home - but what to ? '
there is no economic activity on the island . "
the eruption destroyed much of the agricultural land on the island , it closed the medical school , and many people from the us , canada and europe who had retired there also went home .
the once growing tourist industry is now non-existent .
nature 's worst more than a decade later the economy still has not recovered and there is a sense that the people can not take much more .
in 1990 hurricane hugo hit the island destroying 90 % of the infrastructure and , just as things were looking up , the volcano came alive again .
there is a generation whose parents stayed and battled through the worst nature had to throw at them who just do n't want the fight .
the last few years have seen an increase in young people leaving the island as they look for more to do .
british and eu aid has done a lot to rebuild what was lost but there is a sense that , when the volcano erupted , it created a shift in the attitude of some of the island 's people .
montserrat 's capital , plymouth , was shrouded in ash they had lost everything and now those that remain face a choice - do they stay or do they follow their countrymen and women and head abroad ?
montserrat 's national anthem is god save the queen , and a visit by prince charles and the duchess of cornwall should be a big event on the island .
as a british overseas territory the links to britain should be strong but some people do not see how the visit will make any impact .
john black has lived on the island all his life .
he asks : " what can prince charles do ?
he 's no humanitarian , he 's not going to be able to help us .
we 'll be nice to him but it 's not colonial times , he 's a visitor and we 're nice to them . "
many parts of the caribbean look to britain as the motherland , but here it 's different .
montserrat 's links to ireland date back to the early settlers of the island in the 17th century .
even now you 'll still meet people with the name patrick and siobhan and your passport gets stamped with a shamrock when you arrive at the small airstrip in gerald 's .
prince charles and the duchess of cornwall are also just in time for the st patrick 's day celebrations .
montserratians party for a week before the big day and it 's one of the only places in the world outside ireland where it 's a national holiday - but not for traditional reasons .
legend has it that slaves chose st patrick 's day to mount a rebellion because they believed that , with celebrations happening , their masters would be too drunk to put down the revolt .
the rebellion failed but it 's still a day which is celebrated by descendants of those who fought for their freedom .
eddie , a local businessman , says the royal visit will be good .
" it 'll promote the island . "
but will it make a difference ?
" things here will get better - it 's just a matter of time .
when , though , i do n't know . "

but can his visit help the island still suffering the devastating effects of a volcanic eruption in 1997 ?
as you fly over montserrat the first thing that strikes you is the soufriere hills volcano - it dominates the skyline as do the plumes of smoke coming from it .
the second thing is the colour of the island .
it looks as though it has been split into two halves .
one side is verdant and green , the other ashen and grey , not fully alive nor fully dead .
it is a stark contrast that sums up the island 's future .
missing people after being dormant for hundreds of years , the volcano suddenly became active in 1995 - but it was an eruption two years later , leaving 19 people dead , that started an exodus from the island .
plymouth , the historic capital , was buried under feet of mud and ash and the damage affected most of the south coast .
now just less than half the island is inhabitable .
montserratians left in their thousands , some heading to the us or other caribbean islands .
there is no economic activity on the island bennette roach many settled in the uk as britain eventually gave passports to islanders who wanted to leave .
two thirds of the population decided to go , taking the population from more than 12,000 before to around 5,000 now .
despite the fact that volcanic activity on the island has decreased over the years , few people have returned home .
the opportunities that they found abroad just do not exist on an island where the biggest employer is the government .
bennette roach is the editor of the island 's only newspaper , the montserrat reporter .
" it 's a paradise for anyone who is visiting .
it 's a great place to visit .
even when i go to england i meet people and they say , ' i 'd love to come back home - but what to ? '
there is no economic activity on the island . "
the eruption destroyed much of the agricultural land on the island , it closed the medical school , and many people from the us , canada and europe who had retired there also went home .
the once growing tourist industry is now non-existent .
nature 's worst more than a decade later the economy still has not recovered and there is a sense that the people can not take much more .
in 1990 hurricane hugo hit the island destroying 90 % of the infrastructure and , just as things were looking up , the volcano came alive again .
there is a generation whose parents stayed and battled through the worst nature had to throw at them who just do n't want the fight .
the last few years have seen an increase in young people leaving the island as they look for more to do .
british and eu aid has done a lot to rebuild what was lost but there is a sense that , when the volcano erupted , it created a shift in the attitude of some of the island 's people .
montserrat 's capital , plymouth , was shrouded in ash they had lost everything and now those that remain face a choice - do they stay or do they follow their countrymen and women and head abroad ?
montserrat 's national anthem is god save the queen , and a visit by prince charles and the duchess of cornwall should be a big event on the island .
as a british overseas territory the links to britain should be strong but some people do not see how the visit will make any impact .
john black has lived on the island all his life .
he asks : " what can prince charles do ?
he 's no humanitarian , he 's not going to be able to help us .
we 'll be nice to him but it 's not colonial times , he 's a visitor and we 're nice to them . "
many parts of the caribbean look to britain as the motherland , but here it 's different .
montserrat 's links to ireland date back to the early settlers of the island in the 17th century .
even now you 'll still meet people with the name patrick and siobhan and your passport gets stamped with a shamrock when you arrive at the small airstrip in gerald 's .
prince charles and the duchess of cornwall are also just in time for the st patrick 's day celebrations .
montserratians party for a week before the big day and it 's one of the only places in the world outside ireland where it 's a national holiday - but not for traditional reasons .
legend has it that slaves chose st patrick 's day to mount a rebellion because they believed that , with celebrations happening , their masters would be too drunk to put down the revolt .
the rebellion failed but it 's still a day which is celebrated by descendants of those who fought for their freedom .
eddie , a local businessman , says the royal visit will be good .
" it 'll promote the island . "
but will it make a difference ?

but can his visit help the island still suffering the devastating effects of a volcanic eruption in 1997 ?
as you fly over montserrat the first thing that strikes you is the soufriere hills volcano - it dominates the skyline as do the plumes of smoke coming from it .
the second thing is the colour of the island .
it looks as though it has been split into two halves .
one side is verdant and green , the other ashen and grey , not fully alive nor fully dead .
it is a stark contrast that sums up the island 's future .
missing people after being dormant for hundreds of years , the volcano suddenly became active in 1995 - but it was an eruption two years later , leaving 19 people dead , that started an exodus from the island .
plymouth , the historic capital , was buried under feet of mud and ash and the damage affected most of the south coast .
now just less than half the island is inhabitable .
montserratians left in their thousands , some heading to the us or other caribbean islands .
there is no economic activity on the island bennette roach many settled in the uk as britain eventually gave passports to islanders who wanted to leave .
two thirds of the population decided to go , taking the population from more than 12,000 before to around 5,000 now .
despite the fact that volcanic activity on the island has decreased over the years , few people have returned home .
the opportunities that they found abroad just do not exist on an island where the biggest employer is the government .
bennette roach is the editor of the island 's only newspaper , the montserrat reporter .
" it 's a paradise for anyone who is visiting .
it 's a great place to visit .
even when i go to england i meet people and they say , ' i 'd love to come back home - but what to ? '
there is no economic activity on the island . "
the eruption destroyed much of the agricultural land on the island , it closed the medical school , and many people from the us , canada and europe who had retired there also went home .
the once growing tourist industry is now non-existent .
nature 's worst more than a decade later the economy still has not recovered and there is a sense that the people can not take much more .

missing people after being dormant for hundreds of years , the volcano suddenly became active in 1995 - but it was an eruption two years later , leaving 19 people dead , that started an exodus from the island .
plymouth , the historic capital , was buried under feet of mud and ash and the damage affected most of the south coast .
now just less than half the island is inhabitable .
montserratians left in their thousands , some heading to the us or other caribbean islands . "
there is no economic activity on the island " bennette roach many settled in the uk as britain eventually gave passports to islanders who wanted to leave .
two thirds of the population decided to go , taking the population from more than 12,000 before to around 5,000 now .
despite the fact that volcanic activity on the island has decreased over the years , few people have returned home .
the opportunities that they found abroad just do not exist on an island where the biggest employer is the government .
bennette roach is the editor of the island 's only newspaper , the montserrat reporter .
" it 's a paradise for anyone who is visiting .
it 's a great place to visit .
even when i go to england i meet people and they say , ' i 'd love to come back home - but what to ? '
there is no economic activity on the island . "
the eruption destroyed much of the agricultural land on the island , it closed the medical school , and many people from the us , canada and europe who had retired there also went home .
the once growing tourist industry is now non-existent .
nature 's worst more than a decade later the economy still has not recovered and there is a sense that the people can not take much more .
in 1990 hurricane hugo hit the island destroying 90 % of the infrastructure and , just as things were looking up , the volcano came alive again .
there is a generation whose parents stayed and battled through the worst nature had to throw at them who just do n't want the fight .
the last few years have seen an increase in young people leaving the island as they look for more to do .
british and eu aid has done a lot to rebuild what was lost but there is a sense that , when the volcano erupted , it created a shift in the attitude of some of the island 's people .
they had lost everything and now those that remain face a choice - do they stay or do they follow their countrymen and women and head abroad ?
montserrat 's national anthem is god save the queen , and a visit by prince charles and the duchess of cornwall should be a big event on the island .
as a british overseas territory the links to britain should be strong but some people do not see how the visit will make any impact .
john black has lived on the island all his life .
he asks : " what can prince charles do ?
he 's no humanitarian , he 's not going to be able to help us .
we 'll be nice to him but it 's not colonial times , he 's a visitor and we 're nice to them . "
many parts of the caribbean look to britain as the motherland , but here it 's different .
montserrat 's links to ireland date back to the early settlers of the island in the 17th century .
even now you 'll still meet people with the name patrick and siobhan and your passport gets stamped with a shamrock when you arrive at the small airstrip in gerald 's .
prince charles and the duchess of cornwall are also just in time for the st patrick 's day celebrations .
montserratians party for a week before the big day and it 's one of the only places in the world outside ireland where it 's a national holiday - but not for traditional reasons .
legend has it that slaves chose st patrick 's day to mount a rebellion because they believed that , with celebrations happening , their masters would be too drunk to put down the revolt .
the rebellion failed but it 's still a day which is celebrated by descendants of those who fought for their freedom .
eddie , a local businessman , says the royal visit will be good .
" it 'll promote the island . "
but will it make a difference ?
" things here will get better - it 's just a matter of time .
when , though , i do n't know . "

he told the bbc scotland news website about his experiences following the fair trade routes for his product from kenya . "
it is clear that scotland cares about fair trade .
from the highest levels of scottish government to school pupils , i have been amazed by the enthusiasm and knowledge about fair trade i have found here .
i did not expect this .
i now know fair trade enjoys a high profile in scotland and many people already have a sophisticated understanding of the products they can buy and the impact this has .
this has become clear to me , as i have spoken at events like the fairtrade experience in glasgow and to school pupils in venues like edinburgh zoo , stirling , oban and many other places .
at rosebank primary school in dundee , i was almost moved to tears when a group of seventh year pupils gave me fair trade boxes they had decorated and filled themselves , which i will take home to a school in kenya .
i have been in the tea industry in kenya for 30 years .
it was through my past role as general manager of sales and marketing at the kenya tea development agency , the largest small-scale tea management agency in the world , that fair trade was introduced to tea-producing in kenya five years ago .
at that time , we identified the most disadvantaged tea-producing factory in my area and established a pilot programme to help them work to produce tea for the fair trade market . "
i have learnt that scotland is working to become one of the world 's first fair trade nations " since then , the social impact of fair trade in that first factory has been enormous .
schools have been built and existing schools improved .
dispensaries , water systems , roads , school bursaries for the poorest in society and feeding centres for those with hiv / aids have been put in place .
all these projects have been funded by the social premium paid through fair trade , all of them democratically decided upon by the producers themselves .
although many were initially sceptical about fair trade , other factories are now aiming to be registered with the international fairtrade labelling organisation .
ten out of over 50 small-scale tea-producing factories in kenya are fair trade and another nine are waiting to be .
anyone can come to kenya and see that fair trade is helping people create a better life and those who are not yet part of the fair trade system want to be .
what we need is a larger market for fair trade so that more people can benefit .
fair trade bridges the gap between producers and consumers .
it creates an awareness that the person who grew your tea , coffee , or cotton has a name , a face , and a life .
many of them live below the poverty level .
their lives are difficult .
fair trade not only mitigates the pangs of poverty , it helps them gain an education and improve their environment and community .
you may have heard the saying , ' teach a man to fish and he will have fish forever . '
what we in africa need is trade , not aid .
what we need is a fair price for the goods we produce .
i have seen scottish cities , universities and schools that have already become fair trade .
this has taken tremendous education , effort and commitment .
i have learnt that scotland is working to become one of the world 's first fair trade nations .
this shows scotland is committed to helping others make a fair wage for their products .
it does make a difference . "

the lib dem leader insisted he had no regrets after 15 of his mps defied him to vote for an eu treaty referendum .
and he defended a commons walkout last week saying people could expect more protests against the political " establishment " under his leadership .
he was speaking as the party gathers in liverpool for its spring conference .
the lib dems staged their commons protest after they were refused permission to table an amendment calling for a referendum on britain 's future in europe .
the protest - led by the party 's foreign affairs spokesman ed davey , who was barred from taking further part in the debate , is reported to have been opposed by mr clegg 's predecessor as lib dem leader sir menzies campbell .
' principled party ' but speaking to reporters in liverpool , mr clegg said he had " no regrets " about the incident .
" you are going to get a lot more of that , " said the lib dem leader .
" when you have a system that is as sclerotic as this - tied up between the two parties - it is quite right for a principled party such as the liberal democrats , which believes in political reform from saying , from time to time , ' hang on , this is an absolute joke " ' .
aides said mr clegg would set out specific proposals on fighting what he saw as britain 's outdated and hidebound political system in his keynote speech to the conference on sunday .
they cited mr clegg 's pledge to go to jail rather than carry an id card - or treasury spokesman vince cable 's boycott of an official dinner for the saudi royal family - as examples of what the party leadership had in mind .
' honest debate ' they also insisted the lib dems would continue to campaign for an " in or out vote " on europe if and when the lisbon treaty has been ratified .
three lib dem mps quit the frontbench in order to support the failed tory attempt to force a referendum on the lisbon treaty .
the lib dems insist their position - opposing a referendum on the lisbon treaty but backing a vote on the wider question of whether britain should remain in the eu - would provoke the " honest " debate that voters wanted .
but opposition critics have accused the party of pushing for an " in or out " vote to paper over their divisions on the lisbon treaty .
mr clegg said he had known " for months " that he faced a rebellion on the eu treaty referendum but he refused to be drawn on how many of his mps would have voted for one if they had not been ordered to abstain on a three-line whip .
' establishment collusion ' he said he had tried to " maximise the amount of unity while at the same time knowing it would not be complete " .
asked why he had not simply given his mps a free vote , he said europe was " crucial to the party 's identity " and not an " issue of individual conscience " .
he said he had spoken to the frontbench rebels who had not quit but had not decided on what sanction , if any , he would take against them .
labour easily defeated a conservative amendment calling for a referendum on the lisbon treaty in wednesday 's vote despite a rebellion by 15 lib dem and 29 labour mps .
in a speech to activists on friday evening , mr clegg restated his commitment to an " in or out " vote - and tackled critics of his handling of the vote head-on .
" i can take the negative headlines .
we 've faced down the collusion of the establishment parties at westminster before and i will not be afraid to do it again , " he said at a rally in a side room at the liverpool arena .

dr steve ryan , medical director of liverpool 's alder hey hospital , says bronchitis , asthma and ear infections could be cut if parents quit smoking .
he said parents often lied about whether they smoke near their children .
the british lung foundation says 17,000 under-fives are treated every year for exposure to second-hand smoke .
speaking to bbc radio five live , he said out of the 35,000 children the hospital treats every year , 2,000 are there because they have been exposed to their parents ' smoke .
he said between a quarter and a third of those suffering from certain conditions such as chest infections and asthma were the victims of passive smoking .
' high intensity ' parents often know the health implications of smoking around their children , he added .
" people feel guilty , " he told bbc news .
" if it was easy , they would give up .
looking after children is good fun but it can be stressful and for some , cigarettes are a way of relieving that stress . "
" a good tip for parents is always put on another layer of clothes when smoking outside " dr steve ryan medical director , alder hey hospital he does not think legislation is the answer but believes parents should be aware of the various levels of risk .
the top level , he said , was parents smoking in cars , where children were " trapped " and exposed to a " high intensity " of fumes .
mothers smoking is a greater risk than fathers smoking , and smoking in the same room as your child is also high risk , he added .
" having smoke on your clothes is a lower risk , " he said .
" but a good tip for parents is always put on another layer of clothes when smoking outside .
our staff are made to put a coat on when they go out to smoke during their breaks . "
medical conditions amanda sandford from smoking campaign group ash said an estimated half of all children are exposed to smoke in the home .
" it is clearly a widespread problem and i do n't think people realise that so many children are regularly breathing in smoke , " she said . "
we need to publicise the fact that every cigarette you smoke is a cigarette that your child is smoking also " ent surgeon martin birchall " about a quarter of adults smoke and there are more among young adults , people between 25-34 , the age at which they are more likely to be parents with younger children . "
she added that now smoking was banned in enclosed public places , parents should treat their home like the workplace , and smoke outside .
research published in 2005 suggested children exposed to their parents ' smoking were three times more likely to develop lung cancer later in life .
the government 's independent scientific committee on tobacco and health concluded in 2004 that exposure to second-hand smoke can cause a number of serious medical conditions , including lung cancer , heart disease and childhood respiratory disease .
' banging the drum ' martin birchall , an ear nose and throat -lrb- ent -rrb- surgeon and professor at bristol university , said the childhood development period was " precious " .
he said : " passive smoking at home , exposing children to smoke they can not escape from , increases the risk of them getting ear disease , sticky runny noses and sore throats , and further down the track , some of these ent symptoms can in due course led on to worse diseases such as asthma . "
he added : " we need to keep banging the drum .
we need to publicise the fact that every cigarette you smoke is a cigarette that your child is smoking also . "
a department of health spokesperson said : " second-hand smoke kills .
we must continue to help people understand the dangers of second-hand smoke , especially for the health of their children .
" the £ 56m we invested in nhs stop smoking services last year was money well spent - we are well on track to meet our target to reduce the proportion of smokers in england to 21 per cent by 2010 . "
