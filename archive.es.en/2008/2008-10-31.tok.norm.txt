program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de in focus : sixtieth anniversary of the berlin airlift 60th anniversary berlin airlift the berlin airlift was america 's finest hour 60 years ago the berlin airlift in numbers us , germany celebrate 60 years of berlin airlift history -pipe- 31.10.2008 berlin bids bon voyage to historic tempelhof airport großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : there will be no more planes , vintage or otherwise , landing at tempelhof what was once europe 's largest airport was be mothballed on thursday , oct .
30 , when the last flight left tempelhof .
the airport played a central role in berlin 's history , but its future remains unclear . the night of wednesday was the last time people not flying to or from tempelhof were be allowed in the building , and the final take-offs followed one day later , marked by a farewell gala . supporters of the airport tried to save it , but a public referendum in april 2008 that would have called for its preservation failed to attract enough votes . the city of berlin and the german government , who own tempelhof , have wanted to close it for years , citing costs and declining passenger numbers .
last year a mere 350,000 passengers flew through tempelhof , compared with 19 million for berlin 's two other airports . but many people still feel very passionate about tempelhof .
berlin mayor klaus wowereit has reportedly received death threats about the closure . and no less an expert on architecture than norman foster , the englishman who designed the new glass dome on berlin 's reichstag has called it " the mother of all airports . " mother 's history bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : berlin residents associate the airport with the airlift planes were taking off and landing at tempelhof in 1923 .
but it first took on the dimensions for which it became famous a decade later under the nazis , when architect ernst sagebiel built its 286,000-square-meter main building . that made tempelhof the largest building in the world in terms of square area .
it still ranks among the world 's top 20 and is regarded by many as an architectural masterpiece . after world war two , what had been a symbol of fascist monumentalism became the central point of the 1948-49 berlin airlift , in which the allies kept the german capital supplied with necessities despite a soviet blockade of the western part of the city . from 1950 to 1975 , the airport was the center of commercial air traffic in berlin .
it was then replaced in that function by the more modern tegel airport since its relatively short runways precluded larger passengers planes from taking off or landing . but tempelhof reopened to commercial passengers in 1985 and was used mostly by short-haul business commuters and vacationers . plans to permanently shut tempelhof began gaining momentum in 1996 , and the city of berlin and the city 's airport holding company estimate that it has run between 10 million and 15 million euros -lrb- $ 12.7 million and $ 19 million -rrb- in the red every year . berlin is hoping to build a massive new airport on the city 's eastern fringe by 2011 . uncertain future bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : a film studio may take over part of tempelhof 's unique architecture no one knows what will become of the more 3.5-million-square-meter site when planes no longer take off and land there . there has been talk of using parts of the main terminal building for a cultural forum , and the film studios in nearby babelsberg have also discussed using the facility for shooting movies and producing and storing props and costumes . the external grounds could be converted into a park and / or developed as housing property .
the city of berlin plans to stage an open competition to solicit ideas for how the site should be used and is currently having the tempelhof complex surveyed to determine its exact value . but delays in utilizing tempelhof are themselves costly .
architects estimate the annual costs caused by the facility in its dormant state at 11.85 million euros - roughly what tempelhof was losing while it was in operation . the building itself is listed , ensuring that the airport which saw so much history remains at least partially preserved for future generations . dw staff -lrb- jc -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

the news ended speculation that ballack may resign as captain or even be stripped of this position after criticizing loew last week in a newspaper interview over his selection criteria and attitude towards players .
even his future in the team was put into question .
" michael ballack remains my captain .
but as captain he must play by the rules , " said loew .
ballack , 32 , said : " i realize it was not ok to go public .
i regret that this led to the impression that i wanted to criticise joachim loew in his position as coach , " the skipper said .
" i apologized to joachim loew .
he is the coach , he makes the decisions and we have to respect them . "
the chelsea midfielder had spoken out in the frankfurter allgemeine zeitung daily last week , expressing his dissent that loew benched his long-time midfield partner torsten frings at two world cup qualifiers .
ballack said that loew did not show enough respect for veteran germany players , but loew insisted that no player is guaranteed of a place in the starting 11 .
ballack apologized on the weekend but loew insisted on a meeting between the two in germany .
with chelsea 's consent , the currently injured ballack flew to frankfurt in a private jet on thursday and returned to london immediately afterwards .
" he knows that he can raise every issue internally .
but all decisions are made by our coaches - and i made that clear to michael , " loew said .
loew gave an indication of the seriousness of the conflict when he expressed his joy that " a great international player , who has played a main role in our success over the last years , remains available for the team and will help us meet our goals on the road to the 2010 world cup . "
ballack said : " i have no doubt after the talk with joachim loew that we can both realise our goals in the national team in a good atmosphere . "
ballack is germany 's only entry in the 23-player shortlist for the world footballer of the year award .
but he is yet to win a major international title on club or country level .

" i apologized to joachim loew .
he is the coach , he makes the decisions and we have to respect them . "
the chelsea midfielder had spoken out in the frankfurter allgemeine zeitung daily last week , expressing his dissent that loew benched his long-time midfield partner torsten frings at two world cup qualifiers .
ballack said that loew did not show enough respect for veteran germany players , but loew insisted that no player is guaranteed of a place in the starting 11 .
ballack apologized on the weekend but loew insisted on a meeting between the two in germany .
with chelsea 's consent , the currently injured ballack flew to frankfurt in a private jet on thursday and returned to london immediately afterwards .
" he knows that he can raise every issue internally .
but all decisions are made by our coaches - and i made that clear to michael , " loew said .
loew gave an indication of the seriousness of the conflict when he expressed his joy that " a great international player , who has played a main role in our success over the last years , remains available for the team and will help us meet our goals on the road to the 2010 world cup . "
ballack said : " i have no doubt after the talk with joachim loew that we can both realise our goals in the national team in a good atmosphere . "
ballack is germany 's only entry in the 23-player shortlist for the world footballer of the year award .
but he is yet to win a major international title on club or country level .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de opinion -pipe- 31.10.2008 opinion : drop in unemployment a temporary snap-shot großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the number of unemployed people in germany has sunk below three million for the first time since november 1992 .
but although it 's a nice snap-shot , the worst is yet to come , says dw 's rolf wenkel . despite the financial crisis and an economic slowdown , the number of people without jobs in october decreased by 84,000 to 2.997 million .
in comparison to september , the unemployment rate sank by 0.2 percent to 7.2 percent , according to a statement from the federal employment office that was released in on thursday , oct .
30 in nuremberg .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the job market statisticians have provided us with some good news : for the first time in 16 years , the number of unemployed people has dipped below the symbolic number of three million .
but experts predict this will be the last positive surprise that can be expected from the job market for a long time .
after all , the job market has a delayed reaction of several months when it comes to economic changes .
everyone is saying that the financial crisis will spill over into the real economy .
the economics research institute and the economics minster have drastically lowered their growth prognoses .
this surely holds consequences for the employment market .
the only question is how serious the impact will be .
in the best-case scenario , the impressive job creation of recent years will simply come to a stand-still and the unemployment rate will stagnate .
in the worst-case scenario , reduced working hours , which are now being implemented in the automobile industry , wo n't do the trick .
if companies have their backs up against a wall , jobs will be cuts and the unemployment rate will increase significantly once again .
but there 's a lot to be said for the fact that the german job market is better equipped for a dreary global economic condition this time around .
in the past , each external shock on the job market would mean another blow to unemployment . as much as some unions and socio-politicians may despise them , the job market reforms from the 2010 agenda have made the german employment market significantly more robust and flexible – and they 've paved the way for impressive success .
almost 250,000 new jobs have been created since 2004 , and by no means only in the low wage sector .
unemployment decreased by 22 percent between 2004 and 2007 .
the cost of unemployment for public funds decreased in the same time period to just under 25 million euros -lrb- $ 31.7 million -rrb- , or 27 percent .
a demographic factor also comes into play : germany is getting older and fewer new generations are coming out of schools and universities .
in this year alone , approximately 80,000 fewer people entered the job market as in the previous year .
many went into retirement . the nuremberg institute for job market and career research estimates that this number will be at 130,000 next year .
that 's a number which significantly reduces the size of the job market , even if the financial crisis penetrates the real economy harder than we can imagine it doing today .
and there is another argument that suggests the looming recession might only put a small damper on the job market .
the lack of skilled workers has persuaded many companies to rethink their strategies .
they now think similarly to the way medium-sized machine manufacturers have been for a long time .
these manufacturers have been used to extreme economic vacillations in their branch for years and carry their employees with them through bad times because they know that when things improve , they 'll need their workers again .
those who are quick to lay-off employees will have difficulties later , because skilled workers are both costly and difficult to find .
perhaps this can also be a model for the future of listed companies in the course of the cleanup following the financial crisis .
this could be a time when disastrous things like shareholder value and pure thought in the quarterly results are challenged and neatly trimmed down .
in any case , it would be nice .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de opinion -pipe- 31.10.2008 opinion : drop in unemployment a temporary snap-shot großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the number of unemployed people in germany has sunk below three million for the first time since november 1992 .
but although it 's a nice snap-shot , the worst is yet to come , says dw 's rolf wenkel . despite the financial crisis and an economic slowdown , the number of people without jobs in october decreased by 84,000 to 2.997 million .
in comparison to september , the unemployment rate sank by 0.2 percent to 7.2 percent , according to a statement from the federal employment office that was released in on thursday , oct .
30 in nuremberg .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the job market statisticians have provided us with some good news : for the first time in 16 years , the number of unemployed people has dipped below the symbolic number of three million .
but experts predict this will be the last positive surprise that can be expected from the job market for a long time .
after all , the job market has a delayed reaction of several months when it comes to economic changes .
everyone is saying that the financial crisis will spill over into the real economy .
the economics research institute and the economics minster have drastically lowered their growth prognoses .
this surely holds consequences for the employment market .
the only question is how serious the impact will be .
in the best-case scenario , the impressive job creation of recent years will simply come to a stand-still and the unemployment rate will stagnate .
in the worst-case scenario , reduced working hours , which are now being implemented in the automobile industry , wo n't do the trick .
if companies have their backs up against a wall , jobs will be cuts and the unemployment rate will increase significantly once again .
but there 's a lot to be said for the fact that the german job market is better equipped for a dreary global economic condition this time around .
in the past , each external shock on the job market would mean another blow to unemployment . as much as some unions and socio-politicians may despise them , the job market reforms from the 2010 agenda have made the german employment market significantly more robust and flexible – and they 've paved the way for impressive success .
almost 250,000 new jobs have been created since 2004 , and by no means only in the low wage sector .
unemployment decreased by 22 percent between 2004 and 2007 .
the cost of unemployment for public funds decreased in the same time period to just under 25 million euros -lrb- $ 31.7 million -rrb- , or 27 percent .
a demographic factor also comes into play : germany is getting older and fewer new generations are coming out of schools and universities .
in this year alone , approximately 80,000 fewer people entered the job market as in the previous year .
many went into retirement . the nuremberg institute for job market and career research estimates that this number will be at 130,000 next year .
that 's a number which significantly reduces the size of the job market , even if the financial crisis penetrates the real economy harder than we can imagine it doing today .
and there is another argument that suggests the looming recession might only put a small damper on the job market .
the lack of skilled workers has persuaded many companies to rethink their strategies .
they now think similarly to the way medium-sized machine manufacturers have been for a long time .
these manufacturers have been used to extreme economic vacillations in their branch for years and carry their employees with them through bad times because they know that when things improve , they 'll need their workers again .
those who are quick to lay-off employees will have difficulties later , because skilled workers are both costly and difficult to find .
perhaps this can also be a model for the future of listed companies in the course of the cleanup following the financial crisis .
this could be a time when disastrous things like shareholder value and pure thought in the quarterly results are challenged and neatly trimmed down .
in any case , it would be nice .

analysts had also expected inflation to come in at 3.2 percent in october . another reduction in borrowing costs by the ecb would also form part of a new wave of rate cuts by the world 's leading central banks with the us federal reserve on wednesday joining the monetary authorities in norway and china in reducing the cost of money .
the bank of england along with the monetary authorities in switzerland are also expected to follow up this week 's rate cut moves .
oil prices fall as demand drops the drop in euro zone inflation follows the recent fall in energy costs , with oil prices hovering at about $ 65 -lrb- 51 euros -rrb- a barrel in late european trading thursday on the prospects that slowing global economic growth will curb demand .

in harmonized european terms , annual german inflation fell from 3 percent in september to 2.5 percent this month , its lowest in more than a year .
ecb chief jean claude trichet signaled monday that the bank 's rate-setting council might deliver another cut in borrowing costs at its meeting next month with analysts speculating that further reductions could be in the pipeline .
" i consider possible that the governing council will decrease interest rates once again at its next meeting on nov .
6 , " said trichet .
" it is not a certainty , it is a possibility , " he said .
analysts believe the grim economic outlook combined with dwindling inflation gives the ecb scope to follow up the 50-basis cut it delivered in july as part of a coordinated action by the world 's leading central banks to shore up the global economy with another 50-basis points cut next thursday .
confidence crisis in france and germany indeed , since july the economic climate in the euro zone has continued to worsen with business confidence in germany and france falling sharply amid signs that consumers in the currency bloc 's two biggest economies were also growing concerned about a looming recession .
economic confidence in europe plummeted in october to its lowest level in 15 years , a key survey released thursday said .
as a reminder of europe 's grim economic prospects , data also published friday showed german retail sales dropped by a more-than- forecast 2.3 per cent in september when the world financial crisis triggered a round of global share market turmoil .

but although it 's a nice snap-shot , the worst is yet to come , says dw 's rolf wenkel . despite the financial crisis and an economic slowdown , the number of people without jobs in october decreased by 84,000 to 2.997 million .
in comparison to september , the unemployment rate sank by 0.2 percent to 7.2 percent , according to a statement from the federal employment office that was released in on thursday , oct .
30 in nuremberg .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the job market statisticians have provided us with some good news : for the first time in 16 years , the number of unemployed people has dipped below the symbolic number of three million .
but experts predict this will be the last positive surprise that can be expected from the job market for a long time .
after all , the job market has a delayed reaction of several months when it comes to economic changes .
everyone is saying that the financial crisis will spill over into the real economy .
the economics research institute and the economics minster have drastically lowered their growth prognoses .
this surely holds consequences for the employment market .
the only question is how serious the impact will be .
in the best-case scenario , the impressive job creation of recent years will simply come to a stand-still and the unemployment rate will stagnate .
in the worst-case scenario , reduced working hours , which are now being implemented in the automobile industry , wo n't do the trick .
if companies have their backs up against a wall , jobs will be cuts and the unemployment rate will increase significantly once again .
but there 's a lot to be said for the fact that the german job market is better equipped for a dreary global economic condition this time around .
in the past , each external shock on the job market would mean another blow to unemployment . as much as some unions and socio-politicians may despise them , the job market reforms from the 2010 agenda have made the german employment market significantly more robust and flexible – and they 've paved the way for impressive success .
almost 250,000 new jobs have been created since 2004 , and by no means only in the low wage sector .
unemployment decreased by 22 percent between 2004 and 2007 .
the cost of unemployment for public funds decreased in the same time period to just under 25 million euros -lrb- $ 31.7 million -rrb- , or 27 percent .
a demographic factor also comes into play : germany is getting older and fewer new generations are coming out of schools and universities .
in this year alone , approximately 80,000 fewer people entered the job market as in the previous year .
many went into retirement . the nuremberg institute for job market and career research estimates that this number will be at 130,000 next year .
that 's a number which significantly reduces the size of the job market , even if the financial crisis penetrates the real economy harder than we can imagine it doing today .
and there is another argument that suggests the looming recession might only put a small damper on the job market .
the lack of skilled workers has persuaded many companies to rethink their strategies .
they now think similarly to the way medium-sized machine manufacturers have been for a long time .
these manufacturers have been used to extreme economic vacillations in their branch for years and carry their employees with them through bad times because they know that when things improve , they 'll need their workers again .
those who are quick to lay-off employees will have difficulties later , because skilled workers are both costly and difficult to find .
perhaps this can also be a model for the future of listed companies in the course of the cleanup following the financial crisis .
this could be a time when disastrous things like shareholder value and pure thought in the quarterly results are challenged and neatly trimmed down .
in any case , it would be nice .

analysts had also expected inflation to come in at 3.2 percent in october . another reduction in borrowing costs by the ecb would also form part of a new wave of rate cuts by the world 's leading central banks with the us federal reserve on wednesday joining the monetary authorities in norway and china in reducing the cost of money .
the bank of england along with the monetary authorities in switzerland are also expected to follow up this week 's rate cut moves .

bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : due to the current fianancial situation , demand for oil will curb analysts have predicted that the drop in energy prices and slowing global growth could result in further falls in inflation in the coming months .
in harmonized european terms , annual german inflation fell from 3 percent in september to 2.5 percent this month , its lowest in more than a year .
ecb chief jean claude trichet signaled monday that the bank 's rate-setting council might deliver another cut in borrowing costs at its meeting next month with analysts speculating that further reductions could be in the pipeline .
" i consider possible that the governing council will decrease interest rates once again at its next meeting on nov .
6 , " said trichet .
" it is not a certainty , it is a possibility , " he said .
analysts believe the grim economic outlook combined with dwindling inflation gives the ecb scope to follow up the 50-basis cut it delivered in july as part of a coordinated action by the world 's leading central banks to shore up the global economy with another 50-basis points cut next thursday .
confidence crisis in france and germany indeed , since july the economic climate in the euro zone has continued to worsen with business confidence in germany and france falling sharply amid signs that consumers in the currency bloc 's two biggest economies were also growing concerned about a looming recession .

john clancy , a spokesman for eu development and humanitarian aid commissioner louis michel , said : " presidents kabila and kagame have given their agreement to commissioner michel to attend such an international summit . "
in a statement in kinshasa on friday , michel called for a summit to be held in nairobi , bringing together regional leaders and international organisations , to resolve the conflict in the east of congo .
the eastern congolese city of goma has become the epicenter of a humanitarian tragedy after tens of thousands of people fled an offensive by rebels of the national congress for the defense of the people that routed government forces in nord-kivu province . europe launches diplomatic drive europe on friday reasserted its commitment to diplomacy and political solutions to the violence in congo but ruled out a troop deployment to reinforce overstretched un forces in the region .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : kouchner warned of leaving action until it was too late france , which holds the rotating eu presidency , has proposed sending up to 1,500 european troops on a humanitarian mission to goma but britain and germany have voiced serious reservations .
while calling for an increase in troops , french foreign minister bernhard kouchner and eu foreign policy chief javier solana agreed the priority should be placed on providing aid , not fighting rebels .
kouchner added that while military personnel would likely make up the force , its mission would be to help refugees . " this response in our point of view should be humanitarian ... the name of these tactical groups - battlegroups - should not lead you to imagine that we are going to send troops to fight alongside the monuc , " he said , referring to the 17,000-strong un peacekeeping force already in congo . kouchner said the eu force would only be a small element of a larger , political solution between warring parties in congo and neighboring states . germany questions expanding eu deployment but germany remains opposed to the idea of an eu force .
german government spokesman jens ploetner said on friday that a 17,000-strong un mission , monuc , was already on the ground and said a deployment of eu troops could have " consequences for the credibility of monuc in the long run . " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : german foreign minister steinmeier called for rwanda 's help in the drc " those who hastily say that the existing mission is insufficient must expect that that will have consequences once monuc is back to carrying out its mission alone , " he said . german development minister heidemarie wieczorek-zeul reinforced german doubts by also questioning the logic behind increasing the eu presence in drc . " i personally can ’ t judge whether a special eu contingent is required to help restore peace in the drc , whether german troops should be part of such a mission , or whether a larger monuc force will do , " she said thursday .
" but violence has to stop as soon as possible .
the international community can not afford to sit back and simply watch once again . " kouchner , miliband to head to congo france 's foreign minister bernard kouchner and his british counterpart david miliband were preparing to head to strife-torn democratic republic of congo and rwanda on friday . kouchner 's spokesman , eric chevallier , told reporters in paris that the pair would visit the congolese capital kinshasa and the eastern city of goma , which is besieged by rebel forces .
officials confirmed they would also go to rwanda . " the mission will have several goals , " chevallier said .
" the first is to carry a clear political message from europe to demand that the situation stabilizes and the different actors agree to talk to each other more . bildunterschrift : tens of thousands of displaced people are fleeing the fighting in congo " the second is to get an update on the situation of the civilian population .
europe has decided to make an important contribution to the humanitarian effort in goma . " thirdly , we will evaluate the security situation .
in this regard , the goal is to study the security dynamic on the ground , " he added . french fm warns of unprecedented african " massacre " before leaving for drc , kouchner said the eastern region of the country is the scene of a " massacre " on a scale rarely seen in africa . " this is a massacre such as africa has probably never seen , which is taking place virtually before our eyes , " kouchner told europe 1 radio .
" it is out of the question that we let this happen . " a foreign office spokesman , commenting before miliband left for congo said that the eu delegation was " not going to set unrealistic ambitions for the visit but the fact that they are going illustrates the level of concern . " the eu delegation " will impress upon the leaders of both countries the seriousness of the situation in eastern democratic republic of congo -lrb- and -rrb- the need to engage urgently to find a solution to the underlying problem , " he added . eu-brokered ceasefire in tatters though the european union brokered a peace treaty in january that was signed by dozens of militias , including the rebel group responsible for the 1994 genocide in neighboring rwanda , the country has slid back into conflict . fighting in recent days has led to a stand-off between rebels and the un , as the latter rushes to aid nearly 30,000 displaced persons in what un secretary-general ban ki-moon is calling a humanitarian crisis of " catastrophic dimensions . " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the fighting against the congolese army is said to have ended a ceasefire came into effect on wednesday , calming attacks , but the latest round of violence had already provoked a crisis for aid agencies , some of whom have moved operations across the border to rwanda . eu frees up funding for aid the european commission responded to reports of the aid crisis thursday by saying it would give 4 million euros -lrb- $ 5.2 million -rrb- in emergency assistance to help the democratic republic of congo to cope with the conflict in its troubled east . " we are facing a critical humanitarian situation , " spokesman john clancy told journalists in brussels .
" the commission can announce emergency financial aid of a total 4 million euros . " he said 12 million of the 514 million euros earmarked for the country under the european commission 's 2008-2013 spending plans would specifically go towards helping the population of the war-torn east . germany has reportedly contributed 67.5 million euros to monuc in 2008 and just increased its humanitarian aid for drc to 5.7 million euros . dw staff -lrb- cat / nda -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

john clancy , a spokesman for eu development and humanitarian aid commissioner louis michel , said : " presidents kabila and kagame have given their agreement to commissioner michel to attend such an international summit . "
in a statement in kinshasa on friday , michel called for a summit to be held in nairobi , bringing together regional leaders and international organisations , to resolve the conflict in the east of congo .
the eastern congolese city of goma has become the epicenter of a humanitarian tragedy after tens of thousands of people fled an offensive by rebels of the national congress for the defense of the people that routed government forces in nord-kivu province . europe launches diplomatic drive europe on friday reasserted its commitment to diplomacy and political solutions to the violence in congo but ruled out a troop deployment to reinforce overstretched un forces in the region .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : kouchner warned of leaving action until it was too late france , which holds the rotating eu presidency , has proposed sending up to 1,500 european troops on a humanitarian mission to goma but britain and germany have voiced serious reservations .
while calling for an increase in troops , french foreign minister bernhard kouchner and eu foreign policy chief javier solana agreed the priority should be placed on providing aid , not fighting rebels .
kouchner added that while military personnel would likely make up the force , its mission would be to help refugees . " this response in our point of view should be humanitarian ... the name of these tactical groups - battlegroups - should not lead you to imagine that we are going to send troops to fight alongside the monuc , " he said , referring to the 17,000-strong un peacekeeping force already in congo . kouchner said the eu force would only be a small element of a larger , political solution between warring parties in congo and neighboring states . germany questions expanding eu deployment but germany remains opposed to the idea of an eu force .
german government spokesman jens ploetner said on friday that a 17,000-strong un mission , monuc , was already on the ground and said a deployment of eu troops could have " consequences for the credibility of monuc in the long run . " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : german foreign minister steinmeier called for rwanda 's help in the drc " those who hastily say that the existing mission is insufficient must expect that that will have consequences once monuc is back to carrying out its mission alone , " he said . german development minister heidemarie wieczorek-zeul reinforced german doubts by also questioning the logic behind increasing the eu presence in drc . " i personally can ’ t judge whether a special eu contingent is required to help restore peace in the drc , whether german troops should be part of such a mission , or whether a larger monuc force will do , " she said thursday .
" but violence has to stop as soon as possible .
the international community can not afford to sit back and simply watch once again . " kouchner , miliband to head to congo france 's foreign minister bernard kouchner and his british counterpart david miliband were preparing to head to strife-torn democratic republic of congo and rwanda on friday . kouchner 's spokesman , eric chevallier , told reporters in paris that the pair would visit the congolese capital kinshasa and the eastern city of goma , which is besieged by rebel forces .
officials confirmed they would also go to rwanda . " the mission will have several goals , " chevallier said .
" the first is to carry a clear political message from europe to demand that the situation stabilizes and the different actors agree to talk to each other more . bildunterschrift : tens of thousands of displaced people are fleeing the fighting in congo " the second is to get an update on the situation of the civilian population .
europe has decided to make an important contribution to the humanitarian effort in goma . " thirdly , we will evaluate the security situation .
in this regard , the goal is to study the security dynamic on the ground , " he added . french fm warns of unprecedented african " massacre " before leaving for drc , kouchner said the eastern region of the country is the scene of a " massacre " on a scale rarely seen in africa . " this is a massacre such as africa has probably never seen , which is taking place virtually before our eyes , " kouchner told europe 1 radio .
" it is out of the question that we let this happen . " a foreign office spokesman , commenting before miliband left for congo said that the eu delegation was " not going to set unrealistic ambitions for the visit but the fact that they are going illustrates the level of concern . " the eu delegation " will impress upon the leaders of both countries the seriousness of the situation in eastern democratic republic of congo -lrb- and -rrb- the need to engage urgently to find a solution to the underlying problem , " he added . eu-brokered ceasefire in tatters though the european union brokered a peace treaty in january that was signed by dozens of militias , including the rebel group responsible for the 1994 genocide in neighboring rwanda , the country has slid back into conflict . fighting in recent days has led to a stand-off between rebels and the un , as the latter rushes to aid nearly 30,000 displaced persons in what un secretary-general ban ki-moon is calling a humanitarian crisis of " catastrophic dimensions . " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the fighting against the congolese army is said to have ended a ceasefire came into effect on wednesday , calming attacks , but the latest round of violence had already provoked a crisis for aid agencies , some of whom have moved operations across the border to rwanda . eu frees up funding for aid the european commission responded to reports of the aid crisis thursday by saying it would give 4 million euros -lrb- $ 5.2 million -rrb- in emergency assistance to help the democratic republic of congo to cope with the conflict in its troubled east . " we are facing a critical humanitarian situation , " spokesman john clancy told journalists in brussels .
" the commission can announce emergency financial aid of a total 4 million euros . " he said 12 million of the 514 million euros earmarked for the country under the european commission 's 2008-2013 spending plans would specifically go towards helping the population of the war-torn east . germany has reportedly contributed 67.5 million euros to monuc in 2008 and just increased its humanitarian aid for drc to 5.7 million euros . dw staff -lrb- cat / nda -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

the new polish soccer chief is already considering other options . former polish soccer great grzegorz lato , the newly-elected head of the polish soccer federation -lrb- pzpn -rrb- , immediately began courting controversy after his appointment on thursday , oct .
29 by suggesting poland would turn to germany as its co-host for euro 2012 should original co-organizers ukraine prove incapable .
lato , a legendary player and top scorer at the 1974 world cup , took over from michal listkiewicz as president of the ailing pzpn , taking on the role of his country 's top official overseeing the run-up to poland 's first ever hosting of the european championships .
lato was voted in at a gathering of 113 pzpn delegates in warsaw after listkiewicz stepped down amid a corruption investigation .
" germany could join it -lrb- the plan to organize euro 2012 -rrb- , " lato told polish television when asked him what could happen should ukraine be unable to honor their original commitment .
lato added , however , that poland would be able to organize the tournament itself should it need to but expressed his hope that " ukraine would be able to finish the preparations in time . "
lato 's comments were described as " harmful " to the project by poland 's interior minister grzegorz schetyna and that the championship was a " mutual project and has a chance only when we treat it as such . "
ukraine feeling the pinch bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : grigori surkis , president of the ukraine fa , in happier times ukraine 's euro 2012 plans had earlier been thrown into doubt by a statement by its tournament organizer evgeny villinsky who said financial problems had meant ukraine 's preparations to host the tournament had come to a halt .
according to the interfax-ukraine news agency , villinsky added that the global financial crisis and ill-advised management were the reasons for the stopping of preparatory work .
the statement hinting at a cooperation agreement with germany added to the unease in certain circles over lato 's appointment the former striker quickly came under fire after being named pzpn president , mainly from politicians who claimed he was not up to the task of ridding polish soccer of corruption .
slawomir nowak , top aide to polish prime minister donald tusk , said that lato 's appointment was an obvious defeat for those who had ideas to improve the organization .
" this probably is n't the best news for polish soccer , " he told radio zet .
" we 'll have to wait longer for the process and cleaning up ... of polish soccer . "
interior minister schetyna told the polish press agency that lato was a " step backwards " for the federation , and that pzpn should " open itself to new solutions and new people , and this is n't happening . "
elzbieta jakubiak , head of a parliament sports commission , said lato wo n't make the needed changes as head of pzpn .
lato said he would resign in a year if the organization made no improvement , and called on other officials to work together and make euro 2012 " our shared success . "
polish corruption causing tensions bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : games in poland are suspected of being fixed the new pzpn president takes over at time of unprecedented tension between the government , the national soccer federation and world soccer 's governing body , fifa .
the sports ministry recently made a motion to suspend pzpn officials in an effort to clamp down on corruption , but fifa warned poland would lose upcoming world cup qualifying games and rights to euro 2012 unless it reinstated the officials .
fifa , which does n't tolerate political interference in soccer issues , withdrew the ultimatum after a letter from the ministry that showed a " positive evolution " in the situation .
the investigation into polish soccer was launched in may 2005 , and so far has charged nearly 100 people including referees , officials and federation members .
justice minister zbigniew cwiakalski said on friday there will " certainly " be more charges in the ongoing investigation that looks at years 2003 and 2004 .
" there were entire rounds that were fixed in certain clubs , " cwiakalski told polish radio .
" all the matches - one by one - were decided before they took place . "
cwiakalski said he did n't have proof that the pzpn was involved in the corruption , but admitted he could n't imagine " professionals did n't know about something that took place on a large scale in their surroundings .

john clancy , a spokesman for eu development and humanitarian aid commissioner louis michel , said : " presidents kabila and kagame have given their agreement to commissioner michel to attend such an international summit . "
in a statement in kinshasa on friday , michel called for a summit to be held in nairobi , bringing together regional leaders and international organisations , to resolve the conflict in the east of congo .
the eastern congolese city of goma has become the epicenter of a humanitarian tragedy after tens of thousands of people fled an offensive by rebels of the national congress for the defense of the people that routed government forces in nord-kivu province . europe launches diplomatic drive europe on friday reasserted its commitment to diplomacy and political solutions to the violence in congo but ruled out a troop deployment to reinforce overstretched un forces in the region .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : kouchner warned of leaving action until it was too late france , which holds the rotating eu presidency , has proposed sending up to 1,500 european troops on a humanitarian mission to goma but britain and germany have voiced serious reservations .
while calling for an increase in troops , french foreign minister bernhard kouchner and eu foreign policy chief javier solana agreed the priority should be placed on providing aid , not fighting rebels .
kouchner added that while military personnel would likely make up the force , its mission would be to help refugees . " this response in our point of view should be humanitarian ... the name of these tactical groups - battlegroups - should not lead you to imagine that we are going to send troops to fight alongside the monuc , " he said , referring to the 17,000-strong un peacekeeping force already in congo . kouchner said the eu force would only be a small element of a larger , political solution between warring parties in congo and neighboring states . germany questions expanding eu deployment but germany remains opposed to the idea of an eu force .
german government spokesman jens ploetner said on friday that a 17,000-strong un mission , monuc , was already on the ground and said a deployment of eu troops could have " consequences for the credibility of monuc in the long run . " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : german foreign minister steinmeier called for rwanda 's help in the drc " those who hastily say that the existing mission is insufficient must expect that that will have consequences once monuc is back to carrying out its mission alone , " he said . german development minister heidemarie wieczorek-zeul reinforced german doubts by also questioning the logic behind increasing the eu presence in drc . " i personally can ’ t judge whether a special eu contingent is required to help restore peace in the drc , whether german troops should be part of such a mission , or whether a larger monuc force will do , " she said thursday .
" but violence has to stop as soon as possible .
the international community can not afford to sit back and simply watch once again . " kouchner , miliband to head to congo france 's foreign minister bernard kouchner and his british counterpart david miliband were preparing to head to strife-torn democratic republic of congo and rwanda on friday . kouchner 's spokesman , eric chevallier , told reporters in paris that the pair would visit the congolese capital kinshasa and the eastern city of goma , which is besieged by rebel forces .
officials confirmed they would also go to rwanda . " the mission will have several goals , " chevallier said .
" the first is to carry a clear political message from europe to demand that the situation stabilizes and the different actors agree to talk to each other more . bildunterschrift : tens of thousands of displaced people are fleeing the fighting in congo " the second is to get an update on the situation of the civilian population .
europe has decided to make an important contribution to the humanitarian effort in goma . " thirdly , we will evaluate the security situation .
in this regard , the goal is to study the security dynamic on the ground , " he added . french fm warns of unprecedented african " massacre " before leaving for drc , kouchner said the eastern region of the country is the scene of a " massacre " on a scale rarely seen in africa . " this is a massacre such as africa has probably never seen , which is taking place virtually before our eyes , " kouchner told europe 1 radio .
" it is out of the question that we let this happen . " a foreign office spokesman , commenting before miliband left for congo said that the eu delegation was " not going to set unrealistic ambitions for the visit but the fact that they are going illustrates the level of concern . " the eu delegation " will impress upon the leaders of both countries the seriousness of the situation in eastern democratic republic of congo -lrb- and -rrb- the need to engage urgently to find a solution to the underlying problem , " he added . eu-brokered ceasefire in tatters though the european union brokered a peace treaty in january that was signed by dozens of militias , including the rebel group responsible for the 1994 genocide in neighboring rwanda , the country has slid back into conflict . fighting in recent days has led to a stand-off between rebels and the un , as the latter rushes to aid nearly 30,000 displaced persons in what un secretary-general ban ki-moon is calling a humanitarian crisis of " catastrophic dimensions . " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the fighting against the congolese army is said to have ended a ceasefire came into effect on wednesday , calming attacks , but the latest round of violence had already provoked a crisis for aid agencies , some of whom have moved operations across the border to rwanda . eu frees up funding for aid the european commission responded to reports of the aid crisis thursday by saying it would give 4 million euros -lrb- $ 5.2 million -rrb- in emergency assistance to help the democratic republic of congo to cope with the conflict in its troubled east . " we are facing a critical humanitarian situation , " spokesman john clancy told journalists in brussels .
" the commission can announce emergency financial aid of a total 4 million euros . " he said 12 million of the 514 million euros earmarked for the country under the european commission 's 2008-2013 spending plans would specifically go towards helping the population of the war-torn east . germany has reportedly contributed 67.5 million euros to monuc in 2008 and just increased its humanitarian aid for drc to 5.7 million euros . dw staff -lrb- cat / nda -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de opinion -pipe- 31.10.2008 opinion : drop in unemployment a temporary snap-shot großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the number of unemployed people in germany has sunk below three million for the first time since november 1992 .
but although it 's a nice snap-shot , the worst is yet to come , says dw 's rolf wenkel . despite the financial crisis and an economic slowdown , the number of people without jobs in october decreased by 84,000 to 2.997 million .
in comparison to september , the unemployment rate sank by 0.2 percent to 7.2 percent , according to a statement from the federal employment office that was released in on thursday , oct .
30 in nuremberg .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the job market statisticians have provided us with some good news : for the first time in 16 years , the number of unemployed people has dipped below the symbolic number of three million .
but experts predict this will be the last positive surprise that can be expected from the job market for a long time .
after all , the job market has a delayed reaction of several months when it comes to economic changes .
everyone is saying that the financial crisis will spill over into the real economy .
the economics research institute and the economics minster have drastically lowered their growth prognoses .
this surely holds consequences for the employment market .
the only question is how serious the impact will be .
in the best-case scenario , the impressive job creation of recent years will simply come to a stand-still and the unemployment rate will stagnate .
in the worst-case scenario , reduced working hours , which are now being implemented in the automobile industry , wo n't do the trick .
if companies have their backs up against a wall , jobs will be cuts and the unemployment rate will increase significantly once again .
but there 's a lot to be said for the fact that the german job market is better equipped for a dreary global economic condition this time around .
in the past , each external shock on the job market would mean another blow to unemployment . as much as some unions and socio-politicians may despise them , the job market reforms from the 2010 agenda have made the german employment market significantly more robust and flexible – and they 've paved the way for impressive success .
almost 250,000 new jobs have been created since 2004 , and by no means only in the low wage sector .
unemployment decreased by 22 percent between 2004 and 2007 .
the cost of unemployment for public funds decreased in the same time period to just under 25 million euros -lrb- $ 31.7 million -rrb- , or 27 percent .
a demographic factor also comes into play : germany is getting older and fewer new generations are coming out of schools and universities .
in this year alone , approximately 80,000 fewer people entered the job market as in the previous year .
many went into retirement . the nuremberg institute for job market and career research estimates that this number will be at 130,000 next year .
that 's a number which significantly reduces the size of the job market , even if the financial crisis penetrates the real economy harder than we can imagine it doing today .
and there is another argument that suggests the looming recession might only put a small damper on the job market .
the lack of skilled workers has persuaded many companies to rethink their strategies .
they now think similarly to the way medium-sized machine manufacturers have been for a long time .
these manufacturers have been used to extreme economic vacillations in their branch for years and carry their employees with them through bad times because they know that when things improve , they 'll need their workers again .
those who are quick to lay-off employees will have difficulties later , because skilled workers are both costly and difficult to find .
perhaps this can also be a model for the future of listed companies in the course of the cleanup following the financial crisis .
this could be a time when disastrous things like shareholder value and pure thought in the quarterly results are challenged and neatly trimmed down .
in any case , it would be nice .

analysts had also expected inflation to come in at 3.2 percent in october . another reduction in borrowing costs by the ecb would also form part of a new wave of rate cuts by the world 's leading central banks with the us federal reserve on wednesday joining the monetary authorities in norway and china in reducing the cost of money .
the bank of england along with the monetary authorities in switzerland are also expected to follow up this week 's rate cut moves .

ecb chief jean claude trichet signaled monday that the bank 's rate-setting council might deliver another cut in borrowing costs at its meeting next month with analysts speculating that further reductions could be in the pipeline .
" i consider possible that the governing council will decrease interest rates once again at its next meeting on nov .
6 , " said trichet .
" it is not a certainty , it is a possibility , " he said .
analysts believe the grim economic outlook combined with dwindling inflation gives the ecb scope to follow up the 50-basis cut it delivered in july as part of a coordinated action by the world 's leading central banks to shore up the global economy with another 50-basis points cut next thursday .
confidence crisis in france and germany indeed , since july the economic climate in the euro zone has continued to worsen with business confidence in germany and france falling sharply amid signs that consumers in the currency bloc 's two biggest economies were also growing concerned about a looming recession .

the three fragile old planes had been scheduled to leave during thursday 's closing ceremonies , but were left parked on the apron apparently because of the terrible weather .
now , with most of the airport staff gone , they face being dismantled and removed by road to some other airfield .
there they will have their wings reattached and allowed to take-off .
a berlin airports spokesman said that no date had been set for trucks to pick up the stranded planes .
others cleared for take-off bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : this dc-4 was allowed to leave ; others were n't so lucky just to rub salt into the wounds , the closing ceremonies culminated with two antique planes taking to the air at 11.55 pm and the runway landing lights being switched off at midnight , which suggested that rather than conditions being too dicey for the stranded planes , someone just forgot they were there .
the last two planes were a us-made douglas dc-3 , as used in the 1948-49 berlin airlift , and a german ju-52 , a type that carried passengers from 1932 onward for lufthansa .
the airport was the entry point for 2.3 million tons of airborne relief during the airlift soon after world war ii . dw staff -lrb- nda -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

the new polish soccer chief is already considering other options . former polish soccer great grzegorz lato , the newly-elected head of the polish soccer federation -lrb- pzpn -rrb- , immediately began courting controversy after his appointment on thursday , oct .
29 by suggesting poland would turn to germany as its co-host for euro 2012 should original co-organizers ukraine prove incapable .
lato , a legendary player and top scorer at the 1974 world cup , took over from michal listkiewicz as president of the ailing pzpn , taking on the role of his country 's top official overseeing the run-up to poland 's first ever hosting of the european championships .
lato was voted in at a gathering of 113 pzpn delegates in warsaw after listkiewicz stepped down amid a corruption investigation .
" germany could join it -lrb- the plan to organize euro 2012 -rrb- , " lato told polish television when asked him what could happen should ukraine be unable to honor their original commitment .
lato added , however , that poland would be able to organize the tournament itself should it need to but expressed his hope that " ukraine would be able to finish the preparations in time . "
lato 's comments were described as " harmful " to the project by poland 's interior minister grzegorz schetyna and that the championship was a " mutual project and has a chance only when we treat it as such . "
ukraine feeling the pinch bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : grigori surkis , president of the ukraine fa , in happier times ukraine 's euro 2012 plans had earlier been thrown into doubt by a statement by its tournament organizer evgeny villinsky who said financial problems had meant ukraine 's preparations to host the tournament had come to a halt .
according to the interfax-ukraine news agency , villinsky added that the global financial crisis and ill-advised management were the reasons for the stopping of preparatory work .
the statement hinting at a cooperation agreement with germany added to the unease in certain circles over lato 's appointment the former striker quickly came under fire after being named pzpn president , mainly from politicians who claimed he was not up to the task of ridding polish soccer of corruption .
slawomir nowak , top aide to polish prime minister donald tusk , said that lato 's appointment was an obvious defeat for those who had ideas to improve the organization .
" this probably is n't the best news for polish soccer , " he told radio zet .
" we 'll have to wait longer for the process and cleaning up ... of polish soccer . "
interior minister schetyna told the polish press agency that lato was a " step backwards " for the federation , and that pzpn should " open itself to new solutions and new people , and this is n't happening . "
elzbieta jakubiak , head of a parliament sports commission , said lato wo n't make the needed changes as head of pzpn .
lato said he would resign in a year if the organization made no improvement , and called on other officials to work together and make euro 2012 " our shared success . "
polish corruption causing tensions bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : games in poland are suspected of being fixed the new pzpn president takes over at time of unprecedented tension between the government , the national soccer federation and world soccer 's governing body , fifa .
the sports ministry recently made a motion to suspend pzpn officials in an effort to clamp down on corruption , but fifa warned poland would lose upcoming world cup qualifying games and rights to euro 2012 unless it reinstated the officials .
fifa , which does n't tolerate political interference in soccer issues , withdrew the ultimatum after a letter from the ministry that showed a " positive evolution " in the situation .
the investigation into polish soccer was launched in may 2005 , and so far has charged nearly 100 people including referees , officials and federation members .
justice minister zbigniew cwiakalski said on friday there will " certainly " be more charges in the ongoing investigation that looks at years 2003 and 2004 .
" there were entire rounds that were fixed in certain clubs , " cwiakalski told polish radio .
" all the matches - one by one - were decided before they took place . "
cwiakalski said he did n't have proof that the pzpn was involved in the corruption , but admitted he could n't imagine " professionals did n't know about something that took place on a large scale in their surroundings .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de opinion -pipe- 31.10.2008 opinion : drop in unemployment a temporary snap-shot großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the number of unemployed people in germany has sunk below three million for the first time since november 1992 .
but although it 's a nice snap-shot , the worst is yet to come , says dw 's rolf wenkel . despite the financial crisis and an economic slowdown , the number of people without jobs in october decreased by 84,000 to 2.997 million .
in comparison to september , the unemployment rate sank by 0.2 percent to 7.2 percent , according to a statement from the federal employment office that was released in on thursday , oct .
30 in nuremberg .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the job market statisticians have provided us with some good news : for the first time in 16 years , the number of unemployed people has dipped below the symbolic number of three million .
but experts predict this will be the last positive surprise that can be expected from the job market for a long time .
after all , the job market has a delayed reaction of several months when it comes to economic changes .
everyone is saying that the financial crisis will spill over into the real economy .
the economics research institute and the economics minster have drastically lowered their growth prognoses .
this surely holds consequences for the employment market .
the only question is how serious the impact will be .
in the best-case scenario , the impressive job creation of recent years will simply come to a stand-still and the unemployment rate will stagnate .
in the worst-case scenario , reduced working hours , which are now being implemented in the automobile industry , wo n't do the trick .
if companies have their backs up against a wall , jobs will be cuts and the unemployment rate will increase significantly once again .
but there 's a lot to be said for the fact that the german job market is better equipped for a dreary global economic condition this time around .
in the past , each external shock on the job market would mean another blow to unemployment . as much as some unions and socio-politicians may despise them , the job market reforms from the 2010 agenda have made the german employment market significantly more robust and flexible – and they 've paved the way for impressive success .
almost 250,000 new jobs have been created since 2004 , and by no means only in the low wage sector .
unemployment decreased by 22 percent between 2004 and 2007 .
the cost of unemployment for public funds decreased in the same time period to just under 25 million euros -lrb- $ 31.7 million -rrb- , or 27 percent .
a demographic factor also comes into play : germany is getting older and fewer new generations are coming out of schools and universities .
in this year alone , approximately 80,000 fewer people entered the job market as in the previous year .
many went into retirement . the nuremberg institute for job market and career research estimates that this number will be at 130,000 next year .
that 's a number which significantly reduces the size of the job market , even if the financial crisis penetrates the real economy harder than we can imagine it doing today .
and there is another argument that suggests the looming recession might only put a small damper on the job market .
the lack of skilled workers has persuaded many companies to rethink their strategies .
they now think similarly to the way medium-sized machine manufacturers have been for a long time .
these manufacturers have been used to extreme economic vacillations in their branch for years and carry their employees with them through bad times because they know that when things improve , they 'll need their workers again .
those who are quick to lay-off employees will have difficulties later , because skilled workers are both costly and difficult to find .
perhaps this can also be a model for the future of listed companies in the course of the cleanup following the financial crisis .
this could be a time when disastrous things like shareholder value and pure thought in the quarterly results are challenged and neatly trimmed down .
in any case , it would be nice .

in august the stock had hovered near 200 euros . deutsche boerse , the company running the exchange , this week ordered volkswagen 's market capitalization weighting reduced from 27 to 10 per cent in the 30-share dax . beefing up that rule friday , it said a stock would be dropped completely from the index if its capitalization exceeded 10 per cent of the dax at the close of a day 's trading or if its 30-day volatility exceeded 250 per cent . that would imply reducing the index to 29 shares , taking pressure off index-tracker investment funds which attempt to mimic the changes in the index .

the new polish soccer chief is already considering other options . former polish soccer great grzegorz lato , the newly-elected head of the polish soccer federation -lrb- pzpn -rrb- , immediately began courting controversy after his appointment on thursday , oct .
29 by suggesting poland would turn to germany as its co-host for euro 2012 should original co-organizers ukraine prove incapable .
lato , a legendary player and top scorer at the 1974 world cup , took over from michal listkiewicz as president of the ailing pzpn , taking on the role of his country 's top official overseeing the run-up to poland 's first ever hosting of the european championships .
lato was voted in at a gathering of 113 pzpn delegates in warsaw after listkiewicz stepped down amid a corruption investigation .
" germany could join it -lrb- the plan to organize euro 2012 -rrb- , " lato told polish television when asked him what could happen should ukraine be unable to honor their original commitment .
lato added , however , that poland would be able to organize the tournament itself should it need to but expressed his hope that " ukraine would be able to finish the preparations in time . "
lato 's comments were described as " harmful " to the project by poland 's interior minister grzegorz schetyna and that the championship was a " mutual project and has a chance only when we treat it as such . "
ukraine feeling the pinch bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : grigori surkis , president of the ukraine fa , in happier times ukraine 's euro 2012 plans had earlier been thrown into doubt by a statement by its tournament organizer evgeny villinsky who said financial problems had meant ukraine 's preparations to host the tournament had come to a halt .
according to the interfax-ukraine news agency , villinsky added that the global financial crisis and ill-advised management were the reasons for the stopping of preparatory work .
the statement hinting at a cooperation agreement with germany added to the unease in certain circles over lato 's appointment the former striker quickly came under fire after being named pzpn president , mainly from politicians who claimed he was not up to the task of ridding polish soccer of corruption .
slawomir nowak , top aide to polish prime minister donald tusk , said that lato 's appointment was an obvious defeat for those who had ideas to improve the organization .
" this probably is n't the best news for polish soccer , " he told radio zet .
" we 'll have to wait longer for the process and cleaning up ... of polish soccer . "
interior minister schetyna told the polish press agency that lato was a " step backwards " for the federation , and that pzpn should " open itself to new solutions and new people , and this is n't happening . "
elzbieta jakubiak , head of a parliament sports commission , said lato wo n't make the needed changes as head of pzpn .
lato said he would resign in a year if the organization made no improvement , and called on other officials to work together and make euro 2012 " our shared success . "
polish corruption causing tensions bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : games in poland are suspected of being fixed the new pzpn president takes over at time of unprecedented tension between the government , the national soccer federation and world soccer 's governing body , fifa .
the sports ministry recently made a motion to suspend pzpn officials in an effort to clamp down on corruption , but fifa warned poland would lose upcoming world cup qualifying games and rights to euro 2012 unless it reinstated the officials .
fifa , which does n't tolerate political interference in soccer issues , withdrew the ultimatum after a letter from the ministry that showed a " positive evolution " in the situation .
the investigation into polish soccer was launched in may 2005 , and so far has charged nearly 100 people including referees , officials and federation members .
justice minister zbigniew cwiakalski said on friday there will " certainly " be more charges in the ongoing investigation that looks at years 2003 and 2004 .
" there were entire rounds that were fixed in certain clubs , " cwiakalski told polish radio .
" all the matches - one by one - were decided before they took place . "
cwiakalski said he did n't have proof that the pzpn was involved in the corruption , but admitted he could n't imagine " professionals did n't know about something that took place on a large scale in their surroundings .

30 , when the last flight left tempelhof .
the airport played a central role in berlin 's history , but its future remains unclear . the night of wednesday was the last time people not flying to or from tempelhof were be allowed in the building , and the final take-offs followed one day later , marked by a farewell gala . supporters of the airport tried to save it , but a public referendum in april 2008 that would have called for its preservation failed to attract enough votes . the city of berlin and the german government , who own tempelhof , have wanted to close it for years , citing costs and declining passenger numbers .
last year a mere 350,000 passengers flew through tempelhof , compared with 19 million for berlin 's two other airports . but many people still feel very passionate about tempelhof .
berlin mayor klaus wowereit has reportedly received death threats about the closure . and no less an expert on architecture than norman foster , the englishman who designed the new glass dome on berlin 's reichstag has called it " the mother of all airports . " mother 's history bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : berlin residents associate the airport with the airlift planes were taking off and landing at tempelhof in 1923 .
but it first took on the dimensions for which it became famous a decade later under the nazis , when architect ernst sagebiel built its 286,000-square-meter main building . that made tempelhof the largest building in the world in terms of square area .
it still ranks among the world 's top 20 and is regarded by many as an architectural masterpiece . after world war two , what had been a symbol of fascist monumentalism became the central point of the 1948-49 berlin airlift , in which the allies kept the german capital supplied with necessities despite a soviet blockade of the western part of the city . from 1950 to 1975 , the airport was the center of commercial air traffic in berlin .
it was then replaced in that function by the more modern tegel airport since its relatively short runways precluded larger passengers planes from taking off or landing . but tempelhof reopened to commercial passengers in 1985 and was used mostly by short-haul business commuters and vacationers . plans to permanently shut tempelhof began gaining momentum in 1996 , and the city of berlin and the city 's airport holding company estimate that it has run between 10 million and 15 million euros -lrb- $ 12.7 million and $ 19 million -rrb- in the red every year . berlin is hoping to build a massive new airport on the city 's eastern fringe by 2011 . uncertain future bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : a film studio may take over part of tempelhof 's unique architecture no one knows what will become of the more 3.5-million-square-meter site when planes no longer take off and land there . there has been talk of using parts of the main terminal building for a cultural forum , and the film studios in nearby babelsberg have also discussed using the facility for shooting movies and producing and storing props and costumes . the external grounds could be converted into a park and / or developed as housing property .
the city of berlin plans to stage an open competition to solicit ideas for how the site should be used and is currently having the tempelhof complex surveyed to determine its exact value . but delays in utilizing tempelhof are themselves costly .
architects estimate the annual costs caused by the facility in its dormant state at 11.85 million euros - roughly what tempelhof was losing while it was in operation . the building itself is listed , ensuring that the airport which saw so much history remains at least partially preserved for future generations . dw staff -lrb- jc -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

the liquidity guarantee is expected to be in place by mid-november , a hre statement said .
while other regional banks in germany have said they are considering requesting help from the government 's rescue plan for the banking sector , including bayernlb which has applied for 5.4 billion euros -lrb- $ 6.8 billion -rrb- in aid , hre is the first private german financial institution to take advantage of the rescue package .
the german government revealed the rescue package , which includes 400 billion euros in loan guarantees and up to 80 billion euros in capital injections , earlier this month .
hre bailout the biggest in german history bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : hre was just one of a number of high-profile casualties hre is already the subject of a rescue plan worked out by the government , the german central bank and a financing consortium that 's worth 50 billion euros .
the short-term guarantee unveiled late on thursday will keep hre going until the full sum is available .
the real-estate lender became the subject of the biggest financial rescue in german history earlier this month after its inability to refinance the debts of its depfa subsidiary dragged it into the global financial turmoil .
the german-irish subsidiary , which specializes in financing of public works projects , was acquired by hre in october 2007 . dw staff -lrb- nda -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de africa -pipe- 31.10.2008 eu rules out congo troop deployment despite crisis großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the eu and us rule out troop deployments despite un forces being overstretched the european union has decided against a possible deployment to congo in favor of diplomatic solutions and says the presidents of congo and rwanda have agreed to an emergency summit to end the conflict . the presidents of the democratic republic of congo and rwanda , joseph kabila and paul kagame , have agreed to attend an emergency summit on the crisis in congo , the european commission said friday .
john clancy , a spokesman for eu development and humanitarian aid commissioner louis michel , said : " presidents kabila and kagame have given their agreement to commissioner michel to attend such an international summit . "
in a statement in kinshasa on friday , michel called for a summit to be held in nairobi , bringing together regional leaders and international organisations , to resolve the conflict in the east of congo .
the eastern congolese city of goma has become the epicenter of a humanitarian tragedy after tens of thousands of people fled an offensive by rebels of the national congress for the defense of the people that routed government forces in nord-kivu province . europe launches diplomatic drive europe on friday reasserted its commitment to diplomacy and political solutions to the violence in congo but ruled out a troop deployment to reinforce overstretched un forces in the region .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : kouchner warned of leaving action until it was too late france , which holds the rotating eu presidency , has proposed sending up to 1,500 european troops on a humanitarian mission to goma but britain and germany have voiced serious reservations .
while calling for an increase in troops , french foreign minister bernhard kouchner and eu foreign policy chief javier solana agreed the priority should be placed on providing aid , not fighting rebels .
kouchner added that while military personnel would likely make up the force , its mission would be to help refugees . " this response in our point of view should be humanitarian ... the name of these tactical groups - battlegroups - should not lead you to imagine that we are going to send troops to fight alongside the monuc , " he said , referring to the 17,000-strong un peacekeeping force already in congo . kouchner said the eu force would only be a small element of a larger , political solution between warring parties in congo and neighboring states . germany questions expanding eu deployment but germany remains opposed to the idea of an eu force .
german government spokesman jens ploetner said on friday that a 17,000-strong un mission , monuc , was already on the ground and said a deployment of eu troops could have " consequences for the credibility of monuc in the long run . " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : german foreign minister steinmeier called for rwanda 's help in the drc " those who hastily say that the existing mission is insufficient must expect that that will have consequences once monuc is back to carrying out its mission alone , " he said . german development minister heidemarie wieczorek-zeul reinforced german doubts by also questioning the logic behind increasing the eu presence in drc . " i personally can ’ t judge whether a special eu contingent is required to help restore peace in the drc , whether german troops should be part of such a mission , or whether a larger monuc force will do , " she said thursday .
" but violence has to stop as soon as possible .
the international community can not afford to sit back and simply watch once again . " kouchner , miliband to head to congo france 's foreign minister bernard kouchner and his british counterpart david miliband were preparing to head to strife-torn democratic republic of congo and rwanda on friday . kouchner 's spokesman , eric chevallier , told reporters in paris that the pair would visit the congolese capital kinshasa and the eastern city of goma , which is besieged by rebel forces .
officials confirmed they would also go to rwanda . " the mission will have several goals , " chevallier said .
" the first is to carry a clear political message from europe to demand that the situation stabilizes and the different actors agree to talk to each other more . bildunterschrift : tens of thousands of displaced people are fleeing the fighting in congo " the second is to get an update on the situation of the civilian population .
europe has decided to make an important contribution to the humanitarian effort in goma . " thirdly , we will evaluate the security situation .
in this regard , the goal is to study the security dynamic on the ground , " he added . french fm warns of unprecedented african " massacre " before leaving for drc , kouchner said the eastern region of the country is the scene of a " massacre " on a scale rarely seen in africa . " this is a massacre such as africa has probably never seen , which is taking place virtually before our eyes , " kouchner told europe 1 radio .
" it is out of the question that we let this happen . " a foreign office spokesman , commenting before miliband left for congo said that the eu delegation was " not going to set unrealistic ambitions for the visit but the fact that they are going illustrates the level of concern .

john clancy , a spokesman for eu development and humanitarian aid commissioner louis michel , said : " presidents kabila and kagame have given their agreement to commissioner michel to attend such an international summit . "
in a statement in kinshasa on friday , michel called for a summit to be held in nairobi , bringing together regional leaders and international organisations , to resolve the conflict in the east of congo .
the eastern congolese city of goma has become the epicenter of a humanitarian tragedy after tens of thousands of people fled an offensive by rebels of the national congress for the defense of the people that routed government forces in nord-kivu province . europe launches diplomatic drive europe on friday reasserted its commitment to diplomacy and political solutions to the violence in congo but ruled out a troop deployment to reinforce overstretched un forces in the region .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : kouchner warned of leaving action until it was too late france , which holds the rotating eu presidency , has proposed sending up to 1,500 european troops on a humanitarian mission to goma but britain and germany have voiced serious reservations .
while calling for an increase in troops , french foreign minister bernhard kouchner and eu foreign policy chief javier solana agreed the priority should be placed on providing aid , not fighting rebels .
kouchner added that while military personnel would likely make up the force , its mission would be to help refugees . " this response in our point of view should be humanitarian ... the name of these tactical groups - battlegroups - should not lead you to imagine that we are going to send troops to fight alongside the monuc , " he said , referring to the 17,000-strong un peacekeeping force already in congo . kouchner said the eu force would only be a small element of a larger , political solution between warring parties in congo and neighboring states . germany questions expanding eu deployment but germany remains opposed to the idea of an eu force .
german government spokesman jens ploetner said on friday that a 17,000-strong un mission , monuc , was already on the ground and said a deployment of eu troops could have " consequences for the credibility of monuc in the long run . " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : german foreign minister steinmeier called for rwanda 's help in the drc " those who hastily say that the existing mission is insufficient must expect that that will have consequences once monuc is back to carrying out its mission alone , " he said . german development minister heidemarie wieczorek-zeul reinforced german doubts by also questioning the logic behind increasing the eu presence in drc . " i personally can ’ t judge whether a special eu contingent is required to help restore peace in the drc , whether german troops should be part of such a mission , or whether a larger monuc force will do , " she said thursday .
" but violence has to stop as soon as possible .
the international community can not afford to sit back and simply watch once again . " kouchner , miliband to head to congo france 's foreign minister bernard kouchner and his british counterpart david miliband were preparing to head to strife-torn democratic republic of congo and rwanda on friday . kouchner 's spokesman , eric chevallier , told reporters in paris that the pair would visit the congolese capital kinshasa and the eastern city of goma , which is besieged by rebel forces .
officials confirmed they would also go to rwanda . " the mission will have several goals , " chevallier said .
" the first is to carry a clear political message from europe to demand that the situation stabilizes and the different actors agree to talk to each other more . bildunterschrift : tens of thousands of displaced people are fleeing the fighting in congo " the second is to get an update on the situation of the civilian population .
europe has decided to make an important contribution to the humanitarian effort in goma . " thirdly , we will evaluate the security situation .
in this regard , the goal is to study the security dynamic on the ground , " he added . french fm warns of unprecedented african " massacre " before leaving for drc , kouchner said the eastern region of the country is the scene of a " massacre " on a scale rarely seen in africa . " this is a massacre such as africa has probably never seen , which is taking place virtually before our eyes , " kouchner told europe 1 radio .
" it is out of the question that we let this happen . " a foreign office spokesman , commenting before miliband left for congo said that the eu delegation was " not going to set unrealistic ambitions for the visit but the fact that they are going illustrates the level of concern . " the eu delegation " will impress upon the leaders of both countries the seriousness of the situation in eastern democratic republic of congo -lrb- and -rrb- the need to engage urgently to find a solution to the underlying problem , " he added . eu-brokered ceasefire in tatters though the european union brokered a peace treaty in january that was signed by dozens of militias , including the rebel group responsible for the 1994 genocide in neighboring rwanda , the country has slid back into conflict . fighting in recent days has led to a stand-off between rebels and the un , as the latter rushes to aid nearly 30,000 displaced persons in what un secretary-general ban ki-moon is calling a humanitarian crisis of " catastrophic dimensions .

the news ended speculation that ballack may resign as captain or even be stripped of this position after criticizing loew last week in a newspaper interview over his selection criteria and attitude towards players .
even his future in the team was put into question .
" michael ballack remains my captain .
but as captain he must play by the rules , " said loew .
ballack , 32 , said : " i realize it was not ok to go public .
i regret that this led to the impression that i wanted to criticise joachim loew in his position as coach , " the skipper said .
" i apologized to joachim loew .
he is the coach , he makes the decisions and we have to respect them . "
the chelsea midfielder had spoken out in the frankfurter allgemeine zeitung daily last week , expressing his dissent that loew benched his long-time midfield partner torsten frings at two world cup qualifiers .
ballack said that loew did not show enough respect for veteran germany players , but loew insisted that no player is guaranteed of a place in the starting 11 .
ballack apologized on the weekend but loew insisted on a meeting between the two in germany .
with chelsea 's consent , the currently injured ballack flew to frankfurt in a private jet on thursday and returned to london immediately afterwards .
" he knows that he can raise every issue internally .
but all decisions are made by our coaches - and i made that clear to michael , " loew said .
loew gave an indication of the seriousness of the conflict when he expressed his joy that " a great international player , who has played a main role in our success over the last years , remains available for the team and will help us meet our goals on the road to the 2010 world cup . "
ballack said : " i have no doubt after the talk with joachim loew that we can both realise our goals in the national team in a good atmosphere . "
ballack is germany 's only entry in the 23-player shortlist for the world footballer of the year award .
but he is yet to win a major international title on club or country level .
given his age , the 2010 world cup could be his last big event in germany 's colors . dpa news agency -lrb- sp -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de in focus : sixtieth anniversary of the berlin airlift 60th anniversary berlin airlift the berlin airlift was america 's finest hour 60 years ago the berlin airlift in numbers us , germany celebrate 60 years of berlin airlift history -pipe- 31.10.2008 berlin bids bon voyage to historic tempelhof airport großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : there will be no more planes , vintage or otherwise , landing at tempelhof what was once europe 's largest airport was be mothballed on thursday , oct .
30 , when the last flight left tempelhof .
the airport played a central role in berlin 's history , but its future remains unclear . the night of wednesday was the last time people not flying to or from tempelhof were be allowed in the building , and the final take-offs followed one day later , marked by a farewell gala . supporters of the airport tried to save it , but a public referendum in april 2008 that would have called for its preservation failed to attract enough votes . the city of berlin and the german government , who own tempelhof , have wanted to close it for years , citing costs and declining passenger numbers .
last year a mere 350,000 passengers flew through tempelhof , compared with 19 million for berlin 's two other airports . but many people still feel very passionate about tempelhof .
berlin mayor klaus wowereit has reportedly received death threats about the closure . and no less an expert on architecture than norman foster , the englishman who designed the new glass dome on berlin 's reichstag has called it " the mother of all airports . " mother 's history bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : berlin residents associate the airport with the airlift planes were taking off and landing at tempelhof in 1923 .
but it first took on the dimensions for which it became famous a decade later under the nazis , when architect ernst sagebiel built its 286,000-square-meter main building . that made tempelhof the largest building in the world in terms of square area .
it still ranks among the world 's top 20 and is regarded by many as an architectural masterpiece . after world war two , what had been a symbol of fascist monumentalism became the central point of the 1948-49 berlin airlift , in which the allies kept the german capital supplied with necessities despite a soviet blockade of the western part of the city . from 1950 to 1975 , the airport was the center of commercial air traffic in berlin .
it was then replaced in that function by the more modern tegel airport since its relatively short runways precluded larger passengers planes from taking off or landing . but tempelhof reopened to commercial passengers in 1985 and was used mostly by short-haul business commuters and vacationers . plans to permanently shut tempelhof began gaining momentum in 1996 , and the city of berlin and the city 's airport holding company estimate that it has run between 10 million and 15 million euros -lrb- $ 12.7 million and $ 19 million -rrb- in the red every year . berlin is hoping to build a massive new airport on the city 's eastern fringe by 2011 . uncertain future bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : a film studio may take over part of tempelhof 's unique architecture no one knows what will become of the more 3.5-million-square-meter site when planes no longer take off and land there . there has been talk of using parts of the main terminal building for a cultural forum , and the film studios in nearby babelsberg have also discussed using the facility for shooting movies and producing and storing props and costumes . the external grounds could be converted into a park and / or developed as housing property .
the city of berlin plans to stage an open competition to solicit ideas for how the site should be used and is currently having the tempelhof complex surveyed to determine its exact value . but delays in utilizing tempelhof are themselves costly .
architects estimate the annual costs caused by the facility in its dormant state at 11.85 million euros - roughly what tempelhof was losing while it was in operation . the building itself is listed , ensuring that the airport which saw so much history remains at least partially preserved for future generations . dw staff -lrb- jc -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

german employers had argued that the credit crunch and financial meltdown is making bigger offers unrealistic . late thursday , employers tabled an offer of 2.9 percent wage hikes for the next 14 months in south-western state of baden-wuerttemberg , home to automakers daimler ag and porsche se . ig metall 's regional branch immediately rejected the offer . " what employers have offered today ... is not an offer , but an invitation to a labor dispute , " werner neugebauer , who heads ig metall 's bavarian branch , said . union wants eight-percent hike ig metall is seeking an 8 percent salary increase over the next 12 months , arguing it is justified on the basis of a 220 percent increase in companies ' profits between 2004-2007 - a time when wages effectively increased by only 8.7 percent . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the ig metall trade union asked for an 8 percent wage increase weeks ago berthold huber , head of the ig metall union , told friday 's bild newspaper that if no pay deal is reached , " the real wave of strikes " would start monday . " this offer by the employers is indecent because it would mean real wage losses for staff " due to inflation , he said .
" it is irresponsible because it would choke off economic growth .
the conflict can not be resolved this way - i see no solution without work stoppages . " ig metall in the south-west is germany 's trend-setter in wage-fixing , striking deals that are usually copied by manufacturing industry elsewhere in the country and emulated in other business sectors where unions are less militant . nationwide , ig metall represents 3.6 million workers , not all of them card-carrying union members . the negotiations are likely to set a benchmark for subsequent pay talks in other sectors , and are sure to affect the powerhouses of german industry such as siemens , bmw , daimler and volkswagen . german carmakers have seen sales slump as the financial crisis begins to bite .
concerns are mounting that germany 's all-important exports of cars , trucks and industrial plants may soon plummet as global demand falls .

analysts had also expected inflation to come in at 3.2 percent in october . another reduction in borrowing costs by the ecb would also form part of a new wave of rate cuts by the world 's leading central banks with the us federal reserve on wednesday joining the monetary authorities in norway and china in reducing the cost of money .
the bank of england along with the monetary authorities in switzerland are also expected to follow up this week 's rate cut moves .

ecb chief jean claude trichet signaled monday that the bank 's rate-setting council might deliver another cut in borrowing costs at its meeting next month with analysts speculating that further reductions could be in the pipeline .
" i consider possible that the governing council will decrease interest rates once again at its next meeting on nov .
6 , " said trichet .
" it is not a certainty , it is a possibility , " he said .
analysts believe the grim economic outlook combined with dwindling inflation gives the ecb scope to follow up the 50-basis cut it delivered in july as part of a coordinated action by the world 's leading central banks to shore up the global economy with another 50-basis points cut next thursday .
confidence crisis in france and germany indeed , since july the economic climate in the euro zone has continued to worsen with business confidence in germany and france falling sharply amid signs that consumers in the currency bloc 's two biggest economies were also growing concerned about a looming recession .
economic confidence in europe plummeted in october to its lowest level in 15 years , a key survey released thursday said .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de soccer -pipe- 31.10.2008 apologetic ballack to remain germany captain großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : loew and ballack buried the hatchet in a meeting on friday michael ballack will remain germany captain after apologizing for recent public criticism of coach joachim loew , the german fa said in a statement on friday . the german soccer federation dfb said in a statement that ballack and loew buried the hatchet when they met thursday at the dfb headquarters in frankfurt .
the news ended speculation that ballack may resign as captain or even be stripped of this position after criticizing loew last week in a newspaper interview over his selection criteria and attitude towards players .
even his future in the team was put into question .
" michael ballack remains my captain .
but as captain he must play by the rules , " said loew .
ballack , 32 , said : " i realize it was not ok to go public .
i regret that this led to the impression that i wanted to criticise joachim loew in his position as coach , " the skipper said .
" i apologized to joachim loew .
he is the coach , he makes the decisions and we have to respect them . "
the chelsea midfielder had spoken out in the frankfurter allgemeine zeitung daily last week , expressing his dissent that loew benched his long-time midfield partner torsten frings at two world cup qualifiers .
ballack said that loew did not show enough respect for veteran germany players , but loew insisted that no player is guaranteed of a place in the starting 11 .
ballack apologized on the weekend but loew insisted on a meeting between the two in germany .
with chelsea 's consent , the currently injured ballack flew to frankfurt in a private jet on thursday and returned to london immediately afterwards .
" he knows that he can raise every issue internally .
but all decisions are made by our coaches - and i made that clear to michael , " loew said .
loew gave an indication of the seriousness of the conflict when he expressed his joy that " a great international player , who has played a main role in our success over the last years , remains available for the team and will help us meet our goals on the road to the 2010 world cup . "

german employers had argued that the credit crunch and financial meltdown is making bigger offers unrealistic . late thursday , employers tabled an offer of 2.9 percent wage hikes for the next 14 months in south-western state of baden-wuerttemberg , home to automakers daimler ag and porsche se . ig metall 's regional branch immediately rejected the offer . " what employers have offered today ... is not an offer , but an invitation to a labor dispute , " werner neugebauer , who heads ig metall 's bavarian branch , said . union wants eight-percent hike ig metall is seeking an 8 percent salary increase over the next 12 months , arguing it is justified on the basis of a 220 percent increase in companies ' profits between 2004-2007 - a time when wages effectively increased by only 8.7 percent . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the ig metall trade union asked for an 8 percent wage increase weeks ago berthold huber , head of the ig metall union , told friday 's bild newspaper that if no pay deal is reached , " the real wave of strikes " would start monday . " this offer by the employers is indecent because it would mean real wage losses for staff " due to inflation , he said .
" it is irresponsible because it would choke off economic growth .
the conflict can not be resolved this way - i see no solution without work stoppages . " ig metall in the south-west is germany 's trend-setter in wage-fixing , striking deals that are usually copied by manufacturing industry elsewhere in the country and emulated in other business sectors where unions are less militant . nationwide , ig metall represents 3.6 million workers , not all of them card-carrying union members . the negotiations are likely to set a benchmark for subsequent pay talks in other sectors , and are sure to affect the powerhouses of german industry such as siemens , bmw , daimler and volkswagen . german carmakers have seen sales slump as the financial crisis begins to bite .
concerns are mounting that germany 's all-important exports of cars , trucks and industrial plants may soon plummet as global demand falls .
the conflict comes amid recession fears after the government in mid-october slashed its growth forecast for next year to 0.2 percent from 1.2 percent previously . dw staff -lrb- sp -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

john clancy , a spokesman for eu development and humanitarian aid commissioner louis michel , said : " presidents kabila and kagame have given their agreement to commissioner michel to attend such an international summit . "
in a statement in kinshasa on friday , michel called for a summit to be held in nairobi , bringing together regional leaders and international organisations , to resolve the conflict in the east of congo .
the eastern congolese city of goma has become the epicenter of a humanitarian tragedy after tens of thousands of people fled an offensive by rebels of the national congress for the defense of the people that routed government forces in nord-kivu province . europe launches diplomatic drive europe on friday reasserted its commitment to diplomacy and political solutions to the violence in congo but ruled out a troop deployment to reinforce overstretched un forces in the region .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : kouchner warned of leaving action until it was too late france , which holds the rotating eu presidency , has proposed sending up to 1,500 european troops on a humanitarian mission to goma but britain and germany have voiced serious reservations .
while calling for an increase in troops , french foreign minister bernhard kouchner and eu foreign policy chief javier solana agreed the priority should be placed on providing aid , not fighting rebels .
kouchner added that while military personnel would likely make up the force , its mission would be to help refugees . " this response in our point of view should be humanitarian ... the name of these tactical groups - battlegroups - should not lead you to imagine that we are going to send troops to fight alongside the monuc , " he said , referring to the 17,000-strong un peacekeeping force already in congo . kouchner said the eu force would only be a small element of a larger , political solution between warring parties in congo and neighboring states . germany questions expanding eu deployment but germany remains opposed to the idea of an eu force .
german government spokesman jens ploetner said on friday that a 17,000-strong un mission , monuc , was already on the ground and said a deployment of eu troops could have " consequences for the credibility of monuc in the long run . " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : german foreign minister steinmeier called for rwanda 's help in the drc " those who hastily say that the existing mission is insufficient must expect that that will have consequences once monuc is back to carrying out its mission alone , " he said . german development minister heidemarie wieczorek-zeul reinforced german doubts by also questioning the logic behind increasing the eu presence in drc . " i personally can ’ t judge whether a special eu contingent is required to help restore peace in the drc , whether german troops should be part of such a mission , or whether a larger monuc force will do , " she said thursday .
" but violence has to stop as soon as possible .
the international community can not afford to sit back and simply watch once again . " kouchner , miliband to head to congo france 's foreign minister bernard kouchner and his british counterpart david miliband were preparing to head to strife-torn democratic republic of congo and rwanda on friday . kouchner 's spokesman , eric chevallier , told reporters in paris that the pair would visit the congolese capital kinshasa and the eastern city of goma , which is besieged by rebel forces .
officials confirmed they would also go to rwanda . " the mission will have several goals , " chevallier said .
" the first is to carry a clear political message from europe to demand that the situation stabilizes and the different actors agree to talk to each other more . bildunterschrift : tens of thousands of displaced people are fleeing the fighting in congo " the second is to get an update on the situation of the civilian population .
europe has decided to make an important contribution to the humanitarian effort in goma . " thirdly , we will evaluate the security situation .
in this regard , the goal is to study the security dynamic on the ground , " he added . french fm warns of unprecedented african " massacre " before leaving for drc , kouchner said the eastern region of the country is the scene of a " massacre " on a scale rarely seen in africa . " this is a massacre such as africa has probably never seen , which is taking place virtually before our eyes , " kouchner told europe 1 radio .
" it is out of the question that we let this happen . " a foreign office spokesman , commenting before miliband left for congo said that the eu delegation was " not going to set unrealistic ambitions for the visit but the fact that they are going illustrates the level of concern . " the eu delegation " will impress upon the leaders of both countries the seriousness of the situation in eastern democratic republic of congo -lrb- and -rrb- the need to engage urgently to find a solution to the underlying problem , " he added . eu-brokered ceasefire in tatters though the european union brokered a peace treaty in january that was signed by dozens of militias , including the rebel group responsible for the 1994 genocide in neighboring rwanda , the country has slid back into conflict . fighting in recent days has led to a stand-off between rebels and the un , as the latter rushes to aid nearly 30,000 displaced persons in what un secretary-general ban ki-moon is calling a humanitarian crisis of " catastrophic dimensions . " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the fighting against the congolese army is said to have ended a ceasefire came into effect on wednesday , calming attacks , but the latest round of violence had already provoked a crisis for aid agencies , some of whom have moved operations across the border to rwanda . eu frees up funding for aid the european commission responded to reports of the aid crisis thursday by saying it would give 4 million euros -lrb- $ 5.2 million -rrb- in emergency assistance to help the democratic republic of congo to cope with the conflict in its troubled east . " we are facing a critical humanitarian situation , " spokesman john clancy told journalists in brussels .
" the commission can announce emergency financial aid of a total 4 million euros . " he said 12 million of the 514 million euros earmarked for the country under the european commission 's 2008-2013 spending plans would specifically go towards helping the population of the war-torn east . germany has reportedly contributed 67.5 million euros to monuc in 2008 and just increased its humanitarian aid for drc to 5.7 million euros . dw staff -lrb- cat / nda -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

german employers had argued that the credit crunch and financial meltdown is making bigger offers unrealistic . late thursday , employers tabled an offer of 2.9 percent wage hikes for the next 14 months in south-western state of baden-wuerttemberg , home to automakers daimler ag and porsche se . ig metall 's regional branch immediately rejected the offer . " what employers have offered today ... is not an offer , but an invitation to a labor dispute , " werner neugebauer , who heads ig metall 's bavarian branch , said . union wants eight-percent hike ig metall is seeking an 8 percent salary increase over the next 12 months , arguing it is justified on the basis of a 220 percent increase in companies ' profits between 2004-2007 - a time when wages effectively increased by only 8.7 percent . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the ig metall trade union asked for an 8 percent wage increase weeks ago berthold huber , head of the ig metall union , told friday 's bild newspaper that if no pay deal is reached , " the real wave of strikes " would start monday . " this offer by the employers is indecent because it would mean real wage losses for staff " due to inflation , he said .
" it is irresponsible because it would choke off economic growth .
the conflict can not be resolved this way - i see no solution without work stoppages . " ig metall in the south-west is germany 's trend-setter in wage-fixing , striking deals that are usually copied by manufacturing industry elsewhere in the country and emulated in other business sectors where unions are less militant . nationwide , ig metall represents 3.6 million workers , not all of them card-carrying union members . the negotiations are likely to set a benchmark for subsequent pay talks in other sectors , and are sure to affect the powerhouses of german industry such as siemens , bmw , daimler and volkswagen . german carmakers have seen sales slump as the financial crisis begins to bite .
concerns are mounting that germany 's all-important exports of cars , trucks and industrial plants may soon plummet as global demand falls .
the conflict comes amid recession fears after the government in mid-october slashed its growth forecast for next year to 0.2 percent from 1.2 percent previously . dw staff -lrb- sp -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de opinion -pipe- 31.10.2008 opinion : drop in unemployment a temporary snap-shot großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the number of unemployed people in germany has sunk below three million for the first time since november 1992 .
but although it 's a nice snap-shot , the worst is yet to come , says dw 's rolf wenkel . despite the financial crisis and an economic slowdown , the number of people without jobs in october decreased by 84,000 to 2.997 million .
in comparison to september , the unemployment rate sank by 0.2 percent to 7.2 percent , according to a statement from the federal employment office that was released in on thursday , oct .
30 in nuremberg .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the job market statisticians have provided us with some good news : for the first time in 16 years , the number of unemployed people has dipped below the symbolic number of three million .
but experts predict this will be the last positive surprise that can be expected from the job market for a long time .
after all , the job market has a delayed reaction of several months when it comes to economic changes .
everyone is saying that the financial crisis will spill over into the real economy .
the economics research institute and the economics minster have drastically lowered their growth prognoses .
this surely holds consequences for the employment market .
the only question is how serious the impact will be .
in the best-case scenario , the impressive job creation of recent years will simply come to a stand-still and the unemployment rate will stagnate .
in the worst-case scenario , reduced working hours , which are now being implemented in the automobile industry , wo n't do the trick .
if companies have their backs up against a wall , jobs will be cuts and the unemployment rate will increase significantly once again .
but there 's a lot to be said for the fact that the german job market is better equipped for a dreary global economic condition this time around .
in the past , each external shock on the job market would mean another blow to unemployment . as much as some unions and socio-politicians may despise them , the job market reforms from the 2010 agenda have made the german employment market significantly more robust and flexible – and they 've paved the way for impressive success .
almost 250,000 new jobs have been created since 2004 , and by no means only in the low wage sector .
unemployment decreased by 22 percent between 2004 and 2007 .
the cost of unemployment for public funds decreased in the same time period to just under 25 million euros -lrb- $ 31.7 million -rrb- , or 27 percent .
a demographic factor also comes into play : germany is getting older and fewer new generations are coming out of schools and universities .
in this year alone , approximately 80,000 fewer people entered the job market as in the previous year .
many went into retirement . the nuremberg institute for job market and career research estimates that this number will be at 130,000 next year .
that 's a number which significantly reduces the size of the job market , even if the financial crisis penetrates the real economy harder than we can imagine it doing today .
and there is another argument that suggests the looming recession might only put a small damper on the job market .
the lack of skilled workers has persuaded many companies to rethink their strategies .
they now think similarly to the way medium-sized machine manufacturers have been for a long time .
these manufacturers have been used to extreme economic vacillations in their branch for years and carry their employees with them through bad times because they know that when things improve , they 'll need their workers again .
those who are quick to lay-off employees will have difficulties later , because skilled workers are both costly and difficult to find .
perhaps this can also be a model for the future of listed companies in the course of the cleanup following the financial crisis .
this could be a time when disastrous things like shareholder value and pure thought in the quarterly results are challenged and neatly trimmed down .
in any case , it would be nice .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de africa -pipe- 31.10.2008 eu rules out congo troop deployment despite crisis großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the eu and us rule out troop deployments despite un forces being overstretched the european union has decided against a possible deployment to congo in favor of diplomatic solutions and says the presidents of congo and rwanda have agreed to an emergency summit to end the conflict . the presidents of the democratic republic of congo and rwanda , joseph kabila and paul kagame , have agreed to attend an emergency summit on the crisis in congo , the european commission said friday .
john clancy , a spokesman for eu development and humanitarian aid commissioner louis michel , said : " presidents kabila and kagame have given their agreement to commissioner michel to attend such an international summit . "
in a statement in kinshasa on friday , michel called for a summit to be held in nairobi , bringing together regional leaders and international organisations , to resolve the conflict in the east of congo .
the eastern congolese city of goma has become the epicenter of a humanitarian tragedy after tens of thousands of people fled an offensive by rebels of the national congress for the defense of the people that routed government forces in nord-kivu province . europe launches diplomatic drive europe on friday reasserted its commitment to diplomacy and political solutions to the violence in congo but ruled out a troop deployment to reinforce overstretched un forces in the region .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : kouchner warned of leaving action until it was too late france , which holds the rotating eu presidency , has proposed sending up to 1,500 european troops on a humanitarian mission to goma but britain and germany have voiced serious reservations .
while calling for an increase in troops , french foreign minister bernhard kouchner and eu foreign policy chief javier solana agreed the priority should be placed on providing aid , not fighting rebels .
kouchner added that while military personnel would likely make up the force , its mission would be to help refugees . " this response in our point of view should be humanitarian ... the name of these tactical groups - battlegroups - should not lead you to imagine that we are going to send troops to fight alongside the monuc , " he said , referring to the 17,000-strong un peacekeeping force already in congo . kouchner said the eu force would only be a small element of a larger , political solution between warring parties in congo and neighboring states . germany questions expanding eu deployment but germany remains opposed to the idea of an eu force .
german government spokesman jens ploetner said on friday that a 17,000-strong un mission , monuc , was already on the ground and said a deployment of eu troops could have " consequences for the credibility of monuc in the long run . " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : german foreign minister steinmeier called for rwanda 's help in the drc " those who hastily say that the existing mission is insufficient must expect that that will have consequences once monuc is back to carrying out its mission alone , " he said . german development minister heidemarie wieczorek-zeul reinforced german doubts by also questioning the logic behind increasing the eu presence in drc . " i personally can ’ t judge whether a special eu contingent is required to help restore peace in the drc , whether german troops should be part of such a mission , or whether a larger monuc force will do , " she said thursday .
" but violence has to stop as soon as possible .
the international community can not afford to sit back and simply watch once again . " kouchner , miliband to head to congo france 's foreign minister bernard kouchner and his british counterpart david miliband were preparing to head to strife-torn democratic republic of congo and rwanda on friday . kouchner 's spokesman , eric chevallier , told reporters in paris that the pair would visit the congolese capital kinshasa and the eastern city of goma , which is besieged by rebel forces .
officials confirmed they would also go to rwanda . " the mission will have several goals , " chevallier said .
" the first is to carry a clear political message from europe to demand that the situation stabilizes and the different actors agree to talk to each other more . bildunterschrift : tens of thousands of displaced people are fleeing the fighting in congo " the second is to get an update on the situation of the civilian population .
europe has decided to make an important contribution to the humanitarian effort in goma . " thirdly , we will evaluate the security situation .
in this regard , the goal is to study the security dynamic on the ground , " he added . french fm warns of unprecedented african " massacre " before leaving for drc , kouchner said the eastern region of the country is the scene of a " massacre " on a scale rarely seen in africa . " this is a massacre such as africa has probably never seen , which is taking place virtually before our eyes , " kouchner told europe 1 radio .
" it is out of the question that we let this happen . " a foreign office spokesman , commenting before miliband left for congo said that the eu delegation was " not going to set unrealistic ambitions for the visit but the fact that they are going illustrates the level of concern . " the eu delegation " will impress upon the leaders of both countries the seriousness of the situation in eastern democratic republic of congo -lrb- and -rrb- the need to engage urgently to find a solution to the underlying problem , " he added . eu-brokered ceasefire in tatters though the european union brokered a peace treaty in january that was signed by dozens of militias , including the rebel group responsible for the 1994 genocide in neighboring rwanda , the country has slid back into conflict . fighting in recent days has led to a stand-off between rebels and the un , as the latter rushes to aid nearly 30,000 displaced persons in what un secretary-general ban ki-moon is calling a humanitarian crisis of " catastrophic dimensions . " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the fighting against the congolese army is said to have ended a ceasefire came into effect on wednesday , calming attacks , but the latest round of violence had already provoked a crisis for aid agencies , some of whom have moved operations across the border to rwanda . eu frees up funding for aid the european commission responded to reports of the aid crisis thursday by saying it would give 4 million euros -lrb- $ 5.2 million -rrb- in emergency assistance to help the democratic republic of congo to cope with the conflict in its troubled east . " we are facing a critical humanitarian situation , " spokesman john clancy told journalists in brussels .
" the commission can announce emergency financial aid of a total 4 million euros . " he said 12 million of the 514 million euros earmarked for the country under the european commission 's 2008-2013 spending plans would specifically go towards helping the population of the war-torn east . germany has reportedly contributed 67.5 million euros to monuc in 2008 and just increased its humanitarian aid for drc to 5.7 million euros . dw staff -lrb- cat / nda -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

john clancy , a spokesman for eu development and humanitarian aid commissioner louis michel , said : " presidents kabila and kagame have given their agreement to commissioner michel to attend such an international summit . "
in a statement in kinshasa on friday , michel called for a summit to be held in nairobi , bringing together regional leaders and international organisations , to resolve the conflict in the east of congo .
the eastern congolese city of goma has become the epicenter of a humanitarian tragedy after tens of thousands of people fled an offensive by rebels of the national congress for the defense of the people that routed government forces in nord-kivu province . europe launches diplomatic drive europe on friday reasserted its commitment to diplomacy and political solutions to the violence in congo but ruled out a troop deployment to reinforce overstretched un forces in the region .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : kouchner warned of leaving action until it was too late france , which holds the rotating eu presidency , has proposed sending up to 1,500 european troops on a humanitarian mission to goma but britain and germany have voiced serious reservations .
while calling for an increase in troops , french foreign minister bernhard kouchner and eu foreign policy chief javier solana agreed the priority should be placed on providing aid , not fighting rebels .
kouchner added that while military personnel would likely make up the force , its mission would be to help refugees . " this response in our point of view should be humanitarian ... the name of these tactical groups - battlegroups - should not lead you to imagine that we are going to send troops to fight alongside the monuc , " he said , referring to the 17,000-strong un peacekeeping force already in congo . kouchner said the eu force would only be a small element of a larger , political solution between warring parties in congo and neighboring states . germany questions expanding eu deployment but germany remains opposed to the idea of an eu force .
german government spokesman jens ploetner said on friday that a 17,000-strong un mission , monuc , was already on the ground and said a deployment of eu troops could have " consequences for the credibility of monuc in the long run . " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : german foreign minister steinmeier called for rwanda 's help in the drc " those who hastily say that the existing mission is insufficient must expect that that will have consequences once monuc is back to carrying out its mission alone , " he said . german development minister heidemarie wieczorek-zeul reinforced german doubts by also questioning the logic behind increasing the eu presence in drc . " i personally can ’ t judge whether a special eu contingent is required to help restore peace in the drc , whether german troops should be part of such a mission , or whether a larger monuc force will do , " she said thursday .
" but violence has to stop as soon as possible .
the international community can not afford to sit back and simply watch once again . " kouchner , miliband to head to congo france 's foreign minister bernard kouchner and his british counterpart david miliband were preparing to head to strife-torn democratic republic of congo and rwanda on friday . kouchner 's spokesman , eric chevallier , told reporters in paris that the pair would visit the congolese capital kinshasa and the eastern city of goma , which is besieged by rebel forces .
officials confirmed they would also go to rwanda . " the mission will have several goals , " chevallier said .
" the first is to carry a clear political message from europe to demand that the situation stabilizes and the different actors agree to talk to each other more . bildunterschrift : tens of thousands of displaced people are fleeing the fighting in congo " the second is to get an update on the situation of the civilian population .
europe has decided to make an important contribution to the humanitarian effort in goma . " thirdly , we will evaluate the security situation .
in this regard , the goal is to study the security dynamic on the ground , " he added . french fm warns of unprecedented african " massacre " before leaving for drc , kouchner said the eastern region of the country is the scene of a " massacre " on a scale rarely seen in africa . " this is a massacre such as africa has probably never seen , which is taking place virtually before our eyes , " kouchner told europe 1 radio .
" it is out of the question that we let this happen . " a foreign office spokesman , commenting before miliband left for congo said that the eu delegation was " not going to set unrealistic ambitions for the visit but the fact that they are going illustrates the level of concern . " the eu delegation " will impress upon the leaders of both countries the seriousness of the situation in eastern democratic republic of congo -lrb- and -rrb- the need to engage urgently to find a solution to the underlying problem , " he added . eu-brokered ceasefire in tatters though the european union brokered a peace treaty in january that was signed by dozens of militias , including the rebel group responsible for the 1994 genocide in neighboring rwanda , the country has slid back into conflict . fighting in recent days has led to a stand-off between rebels and the un , as the latter rushes to aid nearly 30,000 displaced persons in what un secretary-general ban ki-moon is calling a humanitarian crisis of " catastrophic dimensions . " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the fighting against the congolese army is said to have ended a ceasefire came into effect on wednesday , calming attacks , but the latest round of violence had already provoked a crisis for aid agencies , some of whom have moved operations across the border to rwanda . eu frees up funding for aid the european commission responded to reports of the aid crisis thursday by saying it would give 4 million euros -lrb- $ 5.2 million -rrb- in emergency assistance to help the democratic republic of congo to cope with the conflict in its troubled east . " we are facing a critical humanitarian situation , " spokesman john clancy told journalists in brussels .
" the commission can announce emergency financial aid of a total 4 million euros . " he said 12 million of the 514 million euros earmarked for the country under the european commission 's 2008-2013 spending plans would specifically go towards helping the population of the war-torn east . germany has reportedly contributed 67.5 million euros to monuc in 2008 and just increased its humanitarian aid for drc to 5.7 million euros . dw staff -lrb- cat / nda -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

in august the stock had hovered near 200 euros . deutsche boerse , the company running the exchange , this week ordered volkswagen 's market capitalization weighting reduced from 27 to 10 per cent in the 30-share dax . beefing up that rule friday , it said a stock would be dropped completely from the index if its capitalization exceeded 10 per cent of the dax at the close of a day 's trading or if its 30-day volatility exceeded 250 per cent . that would imply reducing the index to 29 shares , taking pressure off index-tracker investment funds which attempt to mimic the changes in the index .
the rules also apply to two other indexes , the mdax and sdax . normally the indexes are only reshuffled on certain fixed dates every few months . protests by funds the rule change came after protests from funds that the situation was unfair .
there have also been calls for german law to be changed so that companies such as porsche would have to disclose their positions earlier . the shortage of volkswagen stock drove hedge funds to desperately buy the shares this week almost regardless of price .
porsche said later it would release some options to ease the price . on a day when most other stocks plunged , volkswagen rose and the dax as a result closed 10 per cent higher . dpa news agency -lrb- sp -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de opinion -pipe- 31.10.2008 opinion : drop in unemployment a temporary snap-shot großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the number of unemployed people in germany has sunk below three million for the first time since november 1992 .
but although it 's a nice snap-shot , the worst is yet to come , says dw 's rolf wenkel . despite the financial crisis and an economic slowdown , the number of people without jobs in october decreased by 84,000 to 2.997 million .
in comparison to september , the unemployment rate sank by 0.2 percent to 7.2 percent , according to a statement from the federal employment office that was released in on thursday , oct .
30 in nuremberg .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the job market statisticians have provided us with some good news : for the first time in 16 years , the number of unemployed people has dipped below the symbolic number of three million .
but experts predict this will be the last positive surprise that can be expected from the job market for a long time .
after all , the job market has a delayed reaction of several months when it comes to economic changes .
everyone is saying that the financial crisis will spill over into the real economy .
the economics research institute and the economics minster have drastically lowered their growth prognoses .
this surely holds consequences for the employment market .
the only question is how serious the impact will be .
in the best-case scenario , the impressive job creation of recent years will simply come to a stand-still and the unemployment rate will stagnate .
in the worst-case scenario , reduced working hours , which are now being implemented in the automobile industry , wo n't do the trick .
if companies have their backs up against a wall , jobs will be cuts and the unemployment rate will increase significantly once again .
but there 's a lot to be said for the fact that the german job market is better equipped for a dreary global economic condition this time around .
in the past , each external shock on the job market would mean another blow to unemployment . as much as some unions and socio-politicians may despise them , the job market reforms from the 2010 agenda have made the german employment market significantly more robust and flexible – and they 've paved the way for impressive success .
almost 250,000 new jobs have been created since 2004 , and by no means only in the low wage sector .
unemployment decreased by 22 percent between 2004 and 2007 .
the cost of unemployment for public funds decreased in the same time period to just under 25 million euros -lrb- $ 31.7 million -rrb- , or 27 percent .
a demographic factor also comes into play : germany is getting older and fewer new generations are coming out of schools and universities .
in this year alone , approximately 80,000 fewer people entered the job market as in the previous year .
many went into retirement . the nuremberg institute for job market and career research estimates that this number will be at 130,000 next year .
that 's a number which significantly reduces the size of the job market , even if the financial crisis penetrates the real economy harder than we can imagine it doing today .
and there is another argument that suggests the looming recession might only put a small damper on the job market .
the lack of skilled workers has persuaded many companies to rethink their strategies .
they now think similarly to the way medium-sized machine manufacturers have been for a long time .
these manufacturers have been used to extreme economic vacillations in their branch for years and carry their employees with them through bad times because they know that when things improve , they 'll need their workers again .
those who are quick to lay-off employees will have difficulties later , because skilled workers are both costly and difficult to find .
perhaps this can also be a model for the future of listed companies in the course of the cleanup following the financial crisis .
this could be a time when disastrous things like shareholder value and pure thought in the quarterly results are challenged and neatly trimmed down .
in any case , it would be nice .

the rules also apply to two other indexes , the mdax and sdax . normally the indexes are only reshuffled on certain fixed dates every few months . protests by funds the rule change came after protests from funds that the situation was unfair .
there have also been calls for german law to be changed so that companies such as porsche would have to disclose their positions earlier . the shortage of volkswagen stock drove hedge funds to desperately buy the shares this week almost regardless of price .

the news ended speculation that ballack may resign as captain or even be stripped of this position after criticizing loew last week in a newspaper interview over his selection criteria and attitude towards players .
even his future in the team was put into question .
" michael ballack remains my captain .
but as captain he must play by the rules , " said loew .
ballack , 32 , said : " i realize it was not ok to go public .
i regret that this led to the impression that i wanted to criticise joachim loew in his position as coach , " the skipper said .
" i apologized to joachim loew .
he is the coach , he makes the decisions and we have to respect them . "
the chelsea midfielder had spoken out in the frankfurter allgemeine zeitung daily last week , expressing his dissent that loew benched his long-time midfield partner torsten frings at two world cup qualifiers .
ballack said that loew did not show enough respect for veteran germany players , but loew insisted that no player is guaranteed of a place in the starting 11 .
ballack apologized on the weekend but loew insisted on a meeting between the two in germany .
with chelsea 's consent , the currently injured ballack flew to frankfurt in a private jet on thursday and returned to london immediately afterwards .
" he knows that he can raise every issue internally .
but all decisions are made by our coaches - and i made that clear to michael , " loew said .
loew gave an indication of the seriousness of the conflict when he expressed his joy that " a great international player , who has played a main role in our success over the last years , remains available for the team and will help us meet our goals on the road to the 2010 world cup . "
ballack said : " i have no doubt after the talk with joachim loew that we can both realise our goals in the national team in a good atmosphere . "
ballack is germany 's only entry in the 23-player shortlist for the world footballer of the year award .
but he is yet to win a major international title on club or country level .
given his age , the 2010 world cup could be his last big event in germany 's colors . dpa news agency -lrb- sp -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

the news ended speculation that ballack may resign as captain or even be stripped of this position after criticizing loew last week in a newspaper interview over his selection criteria and attitude towards players .
even his future in the team was put into question .
" michael ballack remains my captain .
but as captain he must play by the rules , " said loew .
ballack , 32 , said : " i realize it was not ok to go public .
i regret that this led to the impression that i wanted to criticise joachim loew in his position as coach , " the skipper said .
" i apologized to joachim loew .
he is the coach , he makes the decisions and we have to respect them . "
the chelsea midfielder had spoken out in the frankfurter allgemeine zeitung daily last week , expressing his dissent that loew benched his long-time midfield partner torsten frings at two world cup qualifiers .
ballack said that loew did not show enough respect for veteran germany players , but loew insisted that no player is guaranteed of a place in the starting 11 .
ballack apologized on the weekend but loew insisted on a meeting between the two in germany .
with chelsea 's consent , the currently injured ballack flew to frankfurt in a private jet on thursday and returned to london immediately afterwards .
" he knows that he can raise every issue internally .
but all decisions are made by our coaches - and i made that clear to michael , " loew said .
loew gave an indication of the seriousness of the conflict when he expressed his joy that " a great international player , who has played a main role in our success over the last years , remains available for the team and will help us meet our goals on the road to the 2010 world cup . "
ballack said : " i have no doubt after the talk with joachim loew that we can both realise our goals in the national team in a good atmosphere . "
ballack is germany 's only entry in the 23-player shortlist for the world footballer of the year award .
but he is yet to win a major international title on club or country level .
given his age , the 2010 world cup could be his last big event in germany 's colors . dpa news agency -lrb- sp -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

the news ended speculation that ballack may resign as captain or even be stripped of this position after criticizing loew last week in a newspaper interview over his selection criteria and attitude towards players .
even his future in the team was put into question .
" michael ballack remains my captain .
but as captain he must play by the rules , " said loew .
ballack , 32 , said : " i realize it was not ok to go public .
i regret that this led to the impression that i wanted to criticise joachim loew in his position as coach , " the skipper said .
" i apologized to joachim loew .
he is the coach , he makes the decisions and we have to respect them . "
the chelsea midfielder had spoken out in the frankfurter allgemeine zeitung daily last week , expressing his dissent that loew benched his long-time midfield partner torsten frings at two world cup qualifiers .
ballack said that loew did not show enough respect for veteran germany players , but loew insisted that no player is guaranteed of a place in the starting 11 .
ballack apologized on the weekend but loew insisted on a meeting between the two in germany .
with chelsea 's consent , the currently injured ballack flew to frankfurt in a private jet on thursday and returned to london immediately afterwards .
" he knows that he can raise every issue internally .
but all decisions are made by our coaches - and i made that clear to michael , " loew said .
loew gave an indication of the seriousness of the conflict when he expressed his joy that " a great international player , who has played a main role in our success over the last years , remains available for the team and will help us meet our goals on the road to the 2010 world cup . "
ballack said : " i have no doubt after the talk with joachim loew that we can both realise our goals in the national team in a good atmosphere . "
ballack is germany 's only entry in the 23-player shortlist for the world footballer of the year award .
but he is yet to win a major international title on club or country level .
given his age , the 2010 world cup could be his last big event in germany 's colors . dpa news agency -lrb- sp -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

" there were entire rounds that were fixed in certain clubs , " cwiakalski told polish radio .
" all the matches - one by one - were decided before they took place . "
cwiakalski said he did n't have proof that the pzpn was involved in the corruption , but admitted he could n't imagine " professionals did n't know about something that took place on a large scale in their surroundings .

but although it 's a nice snap-shot , the worst is yet to come , says dw 's rolf wenkel . despite the financial crisis and an economic slowdown , the number of people without jobs in october decreased by 84,000 to 2.997 million .
in comparison to september , the unemployment rate sank by 0.2 percent to 7.2 percent , according to a statement from the federal employment office that was released in on thursday , oct .
30 in nuremberg .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the job market statisticians have provided us with some good news : for the first time in 16 years , the number of unemployed people has dipped below the symbolic number of three million .
but experts predict this will be the last positive surprise that can be expected from the job market for a long time .
after all , the job market has a delayed reaction of several months when it comes to economic changes .
everyone is saying that the financial crisis will spill over into the real economy .
the economics research institute and the economics minster have drastically lowered their growth prognoses .
this surely holds consequences for the employment market .
the only question is how serious the impact will be .
in the best-case scenario , the impressive job creation of recent years will simply come to a stand-still and the unemployment rate will stagnate .
in the worst-case scenario , reduced working hours , which are now being implemented in the automobile industry , wo n't do the trick .
if companies have their backs up against a wall , jobs will be cuts and the unemployment rate will increase significantly once again .
but there 's a lot to be said for the fact that the german job market is better equipped for a dreary global economic condition this time around .
in the past , each external shock on the job market would mean another blow to unemployment . as much as some unions and socio-politicians may despise them , the job market reforms from the 2010 agenda have made the german employment market significantly more robust and flexible – and they 've paved the way for impressive success .
almost 250,000 new jobs have been created since 2004 , and by no means only in the low wage sector .
unemployment decreased by 22 percent between 2004 and 2007 .
the cost of unemployment for public funds decreased in the same time period to just under 25 million euros -lrb- $ 31.7 million -rrb- , or 27 percent .
a demographic factor also comes into play : germany is getting older and fewer new generations are coming out of schools and universities .
in this year alone , approximately 80,000 fewer people entered the job market as in the previous year .
many went into retirement . the nuremberg institute for job market and career research estimates that this number will be at 130,000 next year .
that 's a number which significantly reduces the size of the job market , even if the financial crisis penetrates the real economy harder than we can imagine it doing today .
and there is another argument that suggests the looming recession might only put a small damper on the job market .
the lack of skilled workers has persuaded many companies to rethink their strategies .
they now think similarly to the way medium-sized machine manufacturers have been for a long time .
these manufacturers have been used to extreme economic vacillations in their branch for years and carry their employees with them through bad times because they know that when things improve , they 'll need their workers again .
those who are quick to lay-off employees will have difficulties later , because skilled workers are both costly and difficult to find .
perhaps this can also be a model for the future of listed companies in the course of the cleanup following the financial crisis .
this could be a time when disastrous things like shareholder value and pure thought in the quarterly results are challenged and neatly trimmed down .
in any case , it would be nice .

in comparison to september , the unemployment rate sank by 0.2 percent to 7.2 percent , according to a statement from the federal employment office that was released in on thursday , oct .
30 in nuremberg .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the job market statisticians have provided us with some good news : for the first time in 16 years , the number of unemployed people has dipped below the symbolic number of three million .
but experts predict this will be the last positive surprise that can be expected from the job market for a long time .
after all , the job market has a delayed reaction of several months when it comes to economic changes .
everyone is saying that the financial crisis will spill over into the real economy .
the economics research institute and the economics minster have drastically lowered their growth prognoses .
this surely holds consequences for the employment market .
the only question is how serious the impact will be .
in the best-case scenario , the impressive job creation of recent years will simply come to a stand-still and the unemployment rate will stagnate .
in the worst-case scenario , reduced working hours , which are now being implemented in the automobile industry , wo n't do the trick .
if companies have their backs up against a wall , jobs will be cuts and the unemployment rate will increase significantly once again .
but there 's a lot to be said for the fact that the german job market is better equipped for a dreary global economic condition this time around .
in the past , each external shock on the job market would mean another blow to unemployment . as much as some unions and socio-politicians may despise them , the job market reforms from the 2010 agenda have made the german employment market significantly more robust and flexible – and they 've paved the way for impressive success .
almost 250,000 new jobs have been created since 2004 , and by no means only in the low wage sector .
unemployment decreased by 22 percent between 2004 and 2007 .
the cost of unemployment for public funds decreased in the same time period to just under 25 million euros -lrb- $ 31.7 million -rrb- , or 27 percent .
a demographic factor also comes into play : germany is getting older and fewer new generations are coming out of schools and universities .
in this year alone , approximately 80,000 fewer people entered the job market as in the previous year .
many went into retirement . the nuremberg institute for job market and career research estimates that this number will be at 130,000 next year .
that 's a number which significantly reduces the size of the job market , even if the financial crisis penetrates the real economy harder than we can imagine it doing today .
and there is another argument that suggests the looming recession might only put a small damper on the job market .
the lack of skilled workers has persuaded many companies to rethink their strategies .
they now think similarly to the way medium-sized machine manufacturers have been for a long time .
these manufacturers have been used to extreme economic vacillations in their branch for years and carry their employees with them through bad times because they know that when things improve , they 'll need their workers again .
those who are quick to lay-off employees will have difficulties later , because skilled workers are both costly and difficult to find .
perhaps this can also be a model for the future of listed companies in the course of the cleanup following the financial crisis .
this could be a time when disastrous things like shareholder value and pure thought in the quarterly results are challenged and neatly trimmed down .
in any case , it would be nice .

the news ended speculation that ballack may resign as captain or even be stripped of this position after criticizing loew last week in a newspaper interview over his selection criteria and attitude towards players .
even his future in the team was put into question .
" michael ballack remains my captain .
but as captain he must play by the rules , " said loew .
ballack , 32 , said : " i realize it was not ok to go public .
i regret that this led to the impression that i wanted to criticise joachim loew in his position as coach , " the skipper said .
" i apologized to joachim loew .
he is the coach , he makes the decisions and we have to respect them . "
the chelsea midfielder had spoken out in the frankfurter allgemeine zeitung daily last week , expressing his dissent that loew benched his long-time midfield partner torsten frings at two world cup qualifiers .
ballack said that loew did not show enough respect for veteran germany players , but loew insisted that no player is guaranteed of a place in the starting 11 .
ballack apologized on the weekend but loew insisted on a meeting between the two in germany .
with chelsea 's consent , the currently injured ballack flew to frankfurt in a private jet on thursday and returned to london immediately afterwards .
" he knows that he can raise every issue internally .
but all decisions are made by our coaches - and i made that clear to michael , " loew said .
loew gave an indication of the seriousness of the conflict when he expressed his joy that " a great international player , who has played a main role in our success over the last years , remains available for the team and will help us meet our goals on the road to the 2010 world cup . "
ballack said : " i have no doubt after the talk with joachim loew that we can both realise our goals in the national team in a good atmosphere . "
ballack is germany 's only entry in the 23-player shortlist for the world footballer of the year award .
but he is yet to win a major international title on club or country level .
given his age , the 2010 world cup could be his last big event in germany 's colors . dpa news agency -lrb- sp -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

30 , when the last flight left tempelhof .
the airport played a central role in berlin 's history , but its future remains unclear . the night of wednesday was the last time people not flying to or from tempelhof were be allowed in the building , and the final take-offs followed one day later , marked by a farewell gala . supporters of the airport tried to save it , but a public referendum in april 2008 that would have called for its preservation failed to attract enough votes . the city of berlin and the german government , who own tempelhof , have wanted to close it for years , citing costs and declining passenger numbers .
last year a mere 350,000 passengers flew through tempelhof , compared with 19 million for berlin 's two other airports . but many people still feel very passionate about tempelhof .
berlin mayor klaus wowereit has reportedly received death threats about the closure . and no less an expert on architecture than norman foster , the englishman who designed the new glass dome on berlin 's reichstag has called it " the mother of all airports .

john clancy , a spokesman for eu development and humanitarian aid commissioner louis michel , said : " presidents kabila and kagame have given their agreement to commissioner michel to attend such an international summit . "
in a statement in kinshasa on friday , michel called for a summit to be held in nairobi , bringing together regional leaders and international organisations , to resolve the conflict in the east of congo .
the eastern congolese city of goma has become the epicenter of a humanitarian tragedy after tens of thousands of people fled an offensive by rebels of the national congress for the defense of the people that routed government forces in nord-kivu province . europe launches diplomatic drive europe on friday reasserted its commitment to diplomacy and political solutions to the violence in congo but ruled out a troop deployment to reinforce overstretched un forces in the region .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : kouchner warned of leaving action until it was too late france , which holds the rotating eu presidency , has proposed sending up to 1,500 european troops on a humanitarian mission to goma but britain and germany have voiced serious reservations .
while calling for an increase in troops , french foreign minister bernhard kouchner and eu foreign policy chief javier solana agreed the priority should be placed on providing aid , not fighting rebels .
kouchner added that while military personnel would likely make up the force , its mission would be to help refugees . " this response in our point of view should be humanitarian ... the name of these tactical groups - battlegroups - should not lead you to imagine that we are going to send troops to fight alongside the monuc , " he said , referring to the 17,000-strong un peacekeeping force already in congo . kouchner said the eu force would only be a small element of a larger , political solution between warring parties in congo and neighboring states . germany questions expanding eu deployment but germany remains opposed to the idea of an eu force .
german government spokesman jens ploetner said on friday that a 17,000-strong un mission , monuc , was already on the ground and said a deployment of eu troops could have " consequences for the credibility of monuc in the long run . " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : german foreign minister steinmeier called for rwanda 's help in the drc " those who hastily say that the existing mission is insufficient must expect that that will have consequences once monuc is back to carrying out its mission alone , " he said . german development minister heidemarie wieczorek-zeul reinforced german doubts by also questioning the logic behind increasing the eu presence in drc . " i personally can ’ t judge whether a special eu contingent is required to help restore peace in the drc , whether german troops should be part of such a mission , or whether a larger monuc force will do , " she said thursday .
" but violence has to stop as soon as possible .
the international community can not afford to sit back and simply watch once again . " kouchner , miliband to head to congo france 's foreign minister bernard kouchner and his british counterpart david miliband were preparing to head to strife-torn democratic republic of congo and rwanda on friday . kouchner 's spokesman , eric chevallier , told reporters in paris that the pair would visit the congolese capital kinshasa and the eastern city of goma , which is besieged by rebel forces .
officials confirmed they would also go to rwanda . " the mission will have several goals , " chevallier said .
" the first is to carry a clear political message from europe to demand that the situation stabilizes and the different actors agree to talk to each other more . bildunterschrift : tens of thousands of displaced people are fleeing the fighting in congo " the second is to get an update on the situation of the civilian population .
europe has decided to make an important contribution to the humanitarian effort in goma . " thirdly , we will evaluate the security situation .
in this regard , the goal is to study the security dynamic on the ground , " he added . french fm warns of unprecedented african " massacre " before leaving for drc , kouchner said the eastern region of the country is the scene of a " massacre " on a scale rarely seen in africa . " this is a massacre such as africa has probably never seen , which is taking place virtually before our eyes , " kouchner told europe 1 radio .
" it is out of the question that we let this happen . " a foreign office spokesman , commenting before miliband left for congo said that the eu delegation was " not going to set unrealistic ambitions for the visit but the fact that they are going illustrates the level of concern . " the eu delegation " will impress upon the leaders of both countries the seriousness of the situation in eastern democratic republic of congo -lrb- and -rrb- the need to engage urgently to find a solution to the underlying problem , " he added . eu-brokered ceasefire in tatters though the european union brokered a peace treaty in january that was signed by dozens of militias , including the rebel group responsible for the 1994 genocide in neighboring rwanda , the country has slid back into conflict . fighting in recent days has led to a stand-off between rebels and the un , as the latter rushes to aid nearly 30,000 displaced persons in what un secretary-general ban ki-moon is calling a humanitarian crisis of " catastrophic dimensions . " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the fighting against the congolese army is said to have ended a ceasefire came into effect on wednesday , calming attacks , but the latest round of violence had already provoked a crisis for aid agencies , some of whom have moved operations across the border to rwanda . eu frees up funding for aid the european commission responded to reports of the aid crisis thursday by saying it would give 4 million euros -lrb- $ 5.2 million -rrb- in emergency assistance to help the democratic republic of congo to cope with the conflict in its troubled east . " we are facing a critical humanitarian situation , " spokesman john clancy told journalists in brussels .
" the commission can announce emergency financial aid of a total 4 million euros . " he said 12 million of the 514 million euros earmarked for the country under the european commission 's 2008-2013 spending plans would specifically go towards helping the population of the war-torn east . germany has reportedly contributed 67.5 million euros to monuc in 2008 and just increased its humanitarian aid for drc to 5.7 million euros . dw staff -lrb- cat / nda -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

john clancy , a spokesman for eu development and humanitarian aid commissioner louis michel , said : " presidents kabila and kagame have given their agreement to commissioner michel to attend such an international summit . "
in a statement in kinshasa on friday , michel called for a summit to be held in nairobi , bringing together regional leaders and international organisations , to resolve the conflict in the east of congo .
the eastern congolese city of goma has become the epicenter of a humanitarian tragedy after tens of thousands of people fled an offensive by rebels of the national congress for the defense of the people that routed government forces in nord-kivu province . europe launches diplomatic drive europe on friday reasserted its commitment to diplomacy and political solutions to the violence in congo but ruled out a troop deployment to reinforce overstretched un forces in the region .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : kouchner warned of leaving action until it was too late france , which holds the rotating eu presidency , has proposed sending up to 1,500 european troops on a humanitarian mission to goma but britain and germany have voiced serious reservations .
while calling for an increase in troops , french foreign minister bernhard kouchner and eu foreign policy chief javier solana agreed the priority should be placed on providing aid , not fighting rebels .
kouchner added that while military personnel would likely make up the force , its mission would be to help refugees . " this response in our point of view should be humanitarian ... the name of these tactical groups - battlegroups - should not lead you to imagine that we are going to send troops to fight alongside the monuc , " he said , referring to the 17,000-strong un peacekeeping force already in congo . kouchner said the eu force would only be a small element of a larger , political solution between warring parties in congo and neighboring states . germany questions expanding eu deployment but germany remains opposed to the idea of an eu force .
german government spokesman jens ploetner said on friday that a 17,000-strong un mission , monuc , was already on the ground and said a deployment of eu troops could have " consequences for the credibility of monuc in the long run . " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : german foreign minister steinmeier called for rwanda 's help in the drc " those who hastily say that the existing mission is insufficient must expect that that will have consequences once monuc is back to carrying out its mission alone , " he said . german development minister heidemarie wieczorek-zeul reinforced german doubts by also questioning the logic behind increasing the eu presence in drc . " i personally can ’ t judge whether a special eu contingent is required to help restore peace in the drc , whether german troops should be part of such a mission , or whether a larger monuc force will do , " she said thursday .
" but violence has to stop as soon as possible .
the international community can not afford to sit back and simply watch once again . " kouchner , miliband to head to congo france 's foreign minister bernard kouchner and his british counterpart david miliband were preparing to head to strife-torn democratic republic of congo and rwanda on friday . kouchner 's spokesman , eric chevallier , told reporters in paris that the pair would visit the congolese capital kinshasa and the eastern city of goma , which is besieged by rebel forces .
officials confirmed they would also go to rwanda . " the mission will have several goals , " chevallier said .
" the first is to carry a clear political message from europe to demand that the situation stabilizes and the different actors agree to talk to each other more . bildunterschrift : tens of thousands of displaced people are fleeing the fighting in congo " the second is to get an update on the situation of the civilian population .
europe has decided to make an important contribution to the humanitarian effort in goma . " thirdly , we will evaluate the security situation .
in this regard , the goal is to study the security dynamic on the ground , " he added . french fm warns of unprecedented african " massacre " before leaving for drc , kouchner said the eastern region of the country is the scene of a " massacre " on a scale rarely seen in africa . " this is a massacre such as africa has probably never seen , which is taking place virtually before our eyes , " kouchner told europe 1 radio .
" it is out of the question that we let this happen . " a foreign office spokesman , commenting before miliband left for congo said that the eu delegation was " not going to set unrealistic ambitions for the visit but the fact that they are going illustrates the level of concern . " the eu delegation " will impress upon the leaders of both countries the seriousness of the situation in eastern democratic republic of congo -lrb- and -rrb- the need to engage urgently to find a solution to the underlying problem , " he added . eu-brokered ceasefire in tatters though the european union brokered a peace treaty in january that was signed by dozens of militias , including the rebel group responsible for the 1994 genocide in neighboring rwanda , the country has slid back into conflict . fighting in recent days has led to a stand-off between rebels and the un , as the latter rushes to aid nearly 30,000 displaced persons in what un secretary-general ban ki-moon is calling a humanitarian crisis of " catastrophic dimensions . " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the fighting against the congolese army is said to have ended a ceasefire came into effect on wednesday , calming attacks , but the latest round of violence had already provoked a crisis for aid agencies , some of whom have moved operations across the border to rwanda . eu frees up funding for aid the european commission responded to reports of the aid crisis thursday by saying it would give 4 million euros -lrb- $ 5.2 million -rrb- in emergency assistance to help the democratic republic of congo to cope with the conflict in its troubled east . " we are facing a critical humanitarian situation , " spokesman john clancy told journalists in brussels .
" the commission can announce emergency financial aid of a total 4 million euros . " he said 12 million of the 514 million euros earmarked for the country under the european commission 's 2008-2013 spending plans would specifically go towards helping the population of the war-torn east . germany has reportedly contributed 67.5 million euros to monuc in 2008 and just increased its humanitarian aid for drc to 5.7 million euros . dw staff -lrb- cat / nda -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

" bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : german foreign minister steinmeier called for rwanda 's help in the drc " those who hastily say that the existing mission is insufficient must expect that that will have consequences once monuc is back to carrying out its mission alone , " he said . german development minister heidemarie wieczorek-zeul reinforced german doubts by also questioning the logic behind increasing the eu presence in drc . " i personally can ’ t judge whether a special eu contingent is required to help restore peace in the drc , whether german troops should be part of such a mission , or whether a larger monuc force will do , " she said thursday .
" but violence has to stop as soon as possible .
the international community can not afford to sit back and simply watch once again . " kouchner , miliband to head to congo france 's foreign minister bernard kouchner and his british counterpart david miliband were preparing to head to strife-torn democratic republic of congo and rwanda on friday . kouchner 's spokesman , eric chevallier , told reporters in paris that the pair would visit the congolese capital kinshasa and the eastern city of goma , which is besieged by rebel forces .
officials confirmed they would also go to rwanda . " the mission will have several goals , " chevallier said .
" the first is to carry a clear political message from europe to demand that the situation stabilizes and the different actors agree to talk to each other more . bildunterschrift : tens of thousands of displaced people are fleeing the fighting in congo " the second is to get an update on the situation of the civilian population .
europe has decided to make an important contribution to the humanitarian effort in goma . " thirdly , we will evaluate the security situation .
in this regard , the goal is to study the security dynamic on the ground , " he added . french fm warns of unprecedented african " massacre " before leaving for drc , kouchner said the eastern region of the country is the scene of a " massacre " on a scale rarely seen in africa . " this is a massacre such as africa has probably never seen , which is taking place virtually before our eyes , " kouchner told europe 1 radio .
" it is out of the question that we let this happen . " a foreign office spokesman , commenting before miliband left for congo said that the eu delegation was " not going to set unrealistic ambitions for the visit but the fact that they are going illustrates the level of concern . " the eu delegation " will impress upon the leaders of both countries the seriousness of the situation in eastern democratic republic of congo -lrb- and -rrb- the need to engage urgently to find a solution to the underlying problem , " he added . eu-brokered ceasefire in tatters though the european union brokered a peace treaty in january that was signed by dozens of militias , including the rebel group responsible for the 1994 genocide in neighboring rwanda , the country has slid back into conflict . fighting in recent days has led to a stand-off between rebels and the un , as the latter rushes to aid nearly 30,000 displaced persons in what un secretary-general ban ki-moon is calling a humanitarian crisis of " catastrophic dimensions . " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the fighting against the congolese army is said to have ended a ceasefire came into effect on wednesday , calming attacks , but the latest round of violence had already provoked a crisis for aid agencies , some of whom have moved operations across the border to rwanda . eu frees up funding for aid the european commission responded to reports of the aid crisis thursday by saying it would give 4 million euros -lrb- $ 5.2 million -rrb- in emergency assistance to help the democratic republic of congo to cope with the conflict in its troubled east . " we are facing a critical humanitarian situation , " spokesman john clancy told journalists in brussels .
" the commission can announce emergency financial aid of a total 4 million euros . " he said 12 million of the 514 million euros earmarked for the country under the european commission 's 2008-2013 spending plans would specifically go towards helping the population of the war-torn east . germany has reportedly contributed 67.5 million euros to monuc in 2008 and just increased its humanitarian aid for drc to 5.7 million euros . dw staff -lrb- cat / nda -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de european championships -pipe- 31.10.2008 poland 's soccer chief looks to germany as euro 2012 co-host großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : grzegorz lato walked into a controversy shortly after taking over as pzpn president the global financial crisis has hampered ukraine 's preparations to co-host euro 2012 with neighboring poland .
the new polish soccer chief is already considering other options . former polish soccer great grzegorz lato , the newly-elected head of the polish soccer federation -lrb- pzpn -rrb- , immediately began courting controversy after his appointment on thursday , oct .
29 by suggesting poland would turn to germany as its co-host for euro 2012 should original co-organizers ukraine prove incapable .
lato , a legendary player and top scorer at the 1974 world cup , took over from michal listkiewicz as president of the ailing pzpn , taking on the role of his country 's top official overseeing the run-up to poland 's first ever hosting of the european championships .
lato was voted in at a gathering of 113 pzpn delegates in warsaw after listkiewicz stepped down amid a corruption investigation .
" germany could join it -lrb- the plan to organize euro 2012 -rrb- , " lato told polish television when asked him what could happen should ukraine be unable to honor their original commitment .
lato added , however , that poland would be able to organize the tournament itself should it need to but expressed his hope that " ukraine would be able to finish the preparations in time . "
lato 's comments were described as " harmful " to the project by poland 's interior minister grzegorz schetyna and that the championship was a " mutual project and has a chance only when we treat it as such . "
ukraine feeling the pinch bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : grigori surkis , president of the ukraine fa , in happier times ukraine 's euro 2012 plans had earlier been thrown into doubt by a statement by its tournament organizer evgeny villinsky who said financial problems had meant ukraine 's preparations to host the tournament had come to a halt .
according to the interfax-ukraine news agency , villinsky added that the global financial crisis and ill-advised management were the reasons for the stopping of preparatory work .
the statement hinting at a cooperation agreement with germany added to the unease in certain circles over lato 's appointment the former striker quickly came under fire after being named pzpn president , mainly from politicians who claimed he was not up to the task of ridding polish soccer of corruption .
slawomir nowak , top aide to polish prime minister donald tusk , said that lato 's appointment was an obvious defeat for those who had ideas to improve the organization .
" this probably is n't the best news for polish soccer , " he told radio zet .
" we 'll have to wait longer for the process and cleaning up ... of polish soccer . "
interior minister schetyna told the polish press agency that lato was a " step backwards " for the federation , and that pzpn should " open itself to new solutions and new people , and this is n't happening . "
elzbieta jakubiak , head of a parliament sports commission , said lato wo n't make the needed changes as head of pzpn .
lato said he would resign in a year if the organization made no improvement , and called on other officials to work together and make euro 2012 " our shared success . "
polish corruption causing tensions bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : games in poland are suspected of being fixed the new pzpn president takes over at time of unprecedented tension between the government , the national soccer federation and world soccer 's governing body , fifa .
the sports ministry recently made a motion to suspend pzpn officials in an effort to clamp down on corruption , but fifa warned poland would lose upcoming world cup qualifying games and rights to euro 2012 unless it reinstated the officials .
fifa , which does n't tolerate political interference in soccer issues , withdrew the ultimatum after a letter from the ministry that showed a " positive evolution " in the situation .
the investigation into polish soccer was launched in may 2005 , and so far has charged nearly 100 people including referees , officials and federation members .
justice minister zbigniew cwiakalski said on friday there will " certainly " be more charges in the ongoing investigation that looks at years 2003 and 2004 .
" there were entire rounds that were fixed in certain clubs , " cwiakalski told polish radio .
" all the matches - one by one - were decided before they took place . "
cwiakalski said he did n't have proof that the pzpn was involved in the corruption , but admitted he could n't imagine " professionals did n't know about something that took place on a large scale in their surroundings .

the new polish soccer chief is already considering other options . former polish soccer great grzegorz lato , the newly-elected head of the polish soccer federation -lrb- pzpn -rrb- , immediately began courting controversy after his appointment on thursday , oct .
29 by suggesting poland would turn to germany as its co-host for euro 2012 should original co-organizers ukraine prove incapable .
lato , a legendary player and top scorer at the 1974 world cup , took over from michal listkiewicz as president of the ailing pzpn , taking on the role of his country 's top official overseeing the run-up to poland 's first ever hosting of the european championships .
lato was voted in at a gathering of 113 pzpn delegates in warsaw after listkiewicz stepped down amid a corruption investigation .
" germany could join it -lrb- the plan to organize euro 2012 -rrb- , " lato told polish television when asked him what could happen should ukraine be unable to honor their original commitment .
lato added , however , that poland would be able to organize the tournament itself should it need to but expressed his hope that " ukraine would be able to finish the preparations in time . "
lato 's comments were described as " harmful " to the project by poland 's interior minister grzegorz schetyna and that the championship was a " mutual project and has a chance only when we treat it as such . "
ukraine feeling the pinch bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : grigori surkis , president of the ukraine fa , in happier times ukraine 's euro 2012 plans had earlier been thrown into doubt by a statement by its tournament organizer evgeny villinsky who said financial problems had meant ukraine 's preparations to host the tournament had come to a halt .
according to the interfax-ukraine news agency , villinsky added that the global financial crisis and ill-advised management were the reasons for the stopping of preparatory work .
the statement hinting at a cooperation agreement with germany added to the unease in certain circles over lato 's appointment the former striker quickly came under fire after being named pzpn president , mainly from politicians who claimed he was not up to the task of ridding polish soccer of corruption .
slawomir nowak , top aide to polish prime minister donald tusk , said that lato 's appointment was an obvious defeat for those who had ideas to improve the organization .
" this probably is n't the best news for polish soccer , " he told radio zet .
" we 'll have to wait longer for the process and cleaning up ... of polish soccer . "
interior minister schetyna told the polish press agency that lato was a " step backwards " for the federation , and that pzpn should " open itself to new solutions and new people , and this is n't happening . "
elzbieta jakubiak , head of a parliament sports commission , said lato wo n't make the needed changes as head of pzpn .
lato said he would resign in a year if the organization made no improvement , and called on other officials to work together and make euro 2012 " our shared success . "
polish corruption causing tensions bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : games in poland are suspected of being fixed the new pzpn president takes over at time of unprecedented tension between the government , the national soccer federation and world soccer 's governing body , fifa .
the sports ministry recently made a motion to suspend pzpn officials in an effort to clamp down on corruption , but fifa warned poland would lose upcoming world cup qualifying games and rights to euro 2012 unless it reinstated the officials .
fifa , which does n't tolerate political interference in soccer issues , withdrew the ultimatum after a letter from the ministry that showed a " positive evolution " in the situation .
the investigation into polish soccer was launched in may 2005 , and so far has charged nearly 100 people including referees , officials and federation members .
justice minister zbigniew cwiakalski said on friday there will " certainly " be more charges in the ongoing investigation that looks at years 2003 and 2004 .
" there were entire rounds that were fixed in certain clubs , " cwiakalski told polish radio .
" all the matches - one by one - were decided before they took place . "
cwiakalski said he did n't have proof that the pzpn was involved in the corruption , but admitted he could n't imagine " professionals did n't know about something that took place on a large scale in their surroundings .

john clancy , a spokesman for eu development and humanitarian aid commissioner louis michel , said : " presidents kabila and kagame have given their agreement to commissioner michel to attend such an international summit . "
in a statement in kinshasa on friday , michel called for a summit to be held in nairobi , bringing together regional leaders and international organisations , to resolve the conflict in the east of congo .
the eastern congolese city of goma has become the epicenter of a humanitarian tragedy after tens of thousands of people fled an offensive by rebels of the national congress for the defense of the people that routed government forces in nord-kivu province . europe launches diplomatic drive europe on friday reasserted its commitment to diplomacy and political solutions to the violence in congo but ruled out a troop deployment to reinforce overstretched un forces in the region .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : kouchner warned of leaving action until it was too late france , which holds the rotating eu presidency , has proposed sending up to 1,500 european troops on a humanitarian mission to goma but britain and germany have voiced serious reservations .
while calling for an increase in troops , french foreign minister bernhard kouchner and eu foreign policy chief javier solana agreed the priority should be placed on providing aid , not fighting rebels .
kouchner added that while military personnel would likely make up the force , its mission would be to help refugees . " this response in our point of view should be humanitarian ... the name of these tactical groups - battlegroups - should not lead you to imagine that we are going to send troops to fight alongside the monuc , " he said , referring to the 17,000-strong un peacekeeping force already in congo . kouchner said the eu force would only be a small element of a larger , political solution between warring parties in congo and neighboring states . germany questions expanding eu deployment but germany remains opposed to the idea of an eu force .
german government spokesman jens ploetner said on friday that a 17,000-strong un mission , monuc , was already on the ground and said a deployment of eu troops could have " consequences for the credibility of monuc in the long run . " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : german foreign minister steinmeier called for rwanda 's help in the drc " those who hastily say that the existing mission is insufficient must expect that that will have consequences once monuc is back to carrying out its mission alone , " he said . german development minister heidemarie wieczorek-zeul reinforced german doubts by also questioning the logic behind increasing the eu presence in drc . " i personally can ’ t judge whether a special eu contingent is required to help restore peace in the drc , whether german troops should be part of such a mission , or whether a larger monuc force will do , " she said thursday .
" but violence has to stop as soon as possible .
the international community can not afford to sit back and simply watch once again . " kouchner , miliband to head to congo france 's foreign minister bernard kouchner and his british counterpart david miliband were preparing to head to strife-torn democratic republic of congo and rwanda on friday . kouchner 's spokesman , eric chevallier , told reporters in paris that the pair would visit the congolese capital kinshasa and the eastern city of goma , which is besieged by rebel forces .
officials confirmed they would also go to rwanda . " the mission will have several goals , " chevallier said .
" the first is to carry a clear political message from europe to demand that the situation stabilizes and the different actors agree to talk to each other more . bildunterschrift : tens of thousands of displaced people are fleeing the fighting in congo " the second is to get an update on the situation of the civilian population .
europe has decided to make an important contribution to the humanitarian effort in goma . " thirdly , we will evaluate the security situation .
in this regard , the goal is to study the security dynamic on the ground , " he added . french fm warns of unprecedented african " massacre " before leaving for drc , kouchner said the eastern region of the country is the scene of a " massacre " on a scale rarely seen in africa . " this is a massacre such as africa has probably never seen , which is taking place virtually before our eyes , " kouchner told europe 1 radio .
" it is out of the question that we let this happen . " a foreign office spokesman , commenting before miliband left for congo said that the eu delegation was " not going to set unrealistic ambitions for the visit but the fact that they are going illustrates the level of concern . " the eu delegation " will impress upon the leaders of both countries the seriousness of the situation in eastern democratic republic of congo -lrb- and -rrb- the need to engage urgently to find a solution to the underlying problem , " he added . eu-brokered ceasefire in tatters though the european union brokered a peace treaty in january that was signed by dozens of militias , including the rebel group responsible for the 1994 genocide in neighboring rwanda , the country has slid back into conflict . fighting in recent days has led to a stand-off between rebels and the un , as the latter rushes to aid nearly 30,000 displaced persons in what un secretary-general ban ki-moon is calling a humanitarian crisis of " catastrophic dimensions . " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the fighting against the congolese army is said to have ended a ceasefire came into effect on wednesday , calming attacks , but the latest round of violence had already provoked a crisis for aid agencies , some of whom have moved operations across the border to rwanda . eu frees up funding for aid the european commission responded to reports of the aid crisis thursday by saying it would give 4 million euros -lrb- $ 5.2 million -rrb- in emergency assistance to help the democratic republic of congo to cope with the conflict in its troubled east . " we are facing a critical humanitarian situation , " spokesman john clancy told journalists in brussels .
" the commission can announce emergency financial aid of a total 4 million euros . " he said 12 million of the 514 million euros earmarked for the country under the european commission 's 2008-2013 spending plans would specifically go towards helping the population of the war-torn east . germany has reportedly contributed 67.5 million euros to monuc in 2008 and just increased its humanitarian aid for drc to 5.7 million euros . dw staff -lrb- cat / nda -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

john clancy , a spokesman for eu development and humanitarian aid commissioner louis michel , said : " presidents kabila and kagame have given their agreement to commissioner michel to attend such an international summit . "
in a statement in kinshasa on friday , michel called for a summit to be held in nairobi , bringing together regional leaders and international organisations , to resolve the conflict in the east of congo .
the eastern congolese city of goma has become the epicenter of a humanitarian tragedy after tens of thousands of people fled an offensive by rebels of the national congress for the defense of the people that routed government forces in nord-kivu province . europe launches diplomatic drive europe on friday reasserted its commitment to diplomacy and political solutions to the violence in congo but ruled out a troop deployment to reinforce overstretched un forces in the region .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : kouchner warned of leaving action until it was too late france , which holds the rotating eu presidency , has proposed sending up to 1,500 european troops on a humanitarian mission to goma but britain and germany have voiced serious reservations .
while calling for an increase in troops , french foreign minister bernhard kouchner and eu foreign policy chief javier solana agreed the priority should be placed on providing aid , not fighting rebels .
kouchner added that while military personnel would likely make up the force , its mission would be to help refugees . " this response in our point of view should be humanitarian ... the name of these tactical groups - battlegroups - should not lead you to imagine that we are going to send troops to fight alongside the monuc , " he said , referring to the 17,000-strong un peacekeeping force already in congo . kouchner said the eu force would only be a small element of a larger , political solution between warring parties in congo and neighboring states . germany questions expanding eu deployment but germany remains opposed to the idea of an eu force .
german government spokesman jens ploetner said on friday that a 17,000-strong un mission , monuc , was already on the ground and said a deployment of eu troops could have " consequences for the credibility of monuc in the long run . " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : german foreign minister steinmeier called for rwanda 's help in the drc " those who hastily say that the existing mission is insufficient must expect that that will have consequences once monuc is back to carrying out its mission alone , " he said . german development minister heidemarie wieczorek-zeul reinforced german doubts by also questioning the logic behind increasing the eu presence in drc . " i personally can ’ t judge whether a special eu contingent is required to help restore peace in the drc , whether german troops should be part of such a mission , or whether a larger monuc force will do , " she said thursday .
" but violence has to stop as soon as possible .
the international community can not afford to sit back and simply watch once again . " kouchner , miliband to head to congo france 's foreign minister bernard kouchner and his british counterpart david miliband were preparing to head to strife-torn democratic republic of congo and rwanda on friday . kouchner 's spokesman , eric chevallier , told reporters in paris that the pair would visit the congolese capital kinshasa and the eastern city of goma , which is besieged by rebel forces .
officials confirmed they would also go to rwanda . " the mission will have several goals , " chevallier said .
" the first is to carry a clear political message from europe to demand that the situation stabilizes and the different actors agree to talk to each other more . bildunterschrift : tens of thousands of displaced people are fleeing the fighting in congo " the second is to get an update on the situation of the civilian population .
europe has decided to make an important contribution to the humanitarian effort in goma . " thirdly , we will evaluate the security situation .
in this regard , the goal is to study the security dynamic on the ground , " he added . french fm warns of unprecedented african " massacre " before leaving for drc , kouchner said the eastern region of the country is the scene of a " massacre " on a scale rarely seen in africa . " this is a massacre such as africa has probably never seen , which is taking place virtually before our eyes , " kouchner told europe 1 radio .
" it is out of the question that we let this happen . " a foreign office spokesman , commenting before miliband left for congo said that the eu delegation was " not going to set unrealistic ambitions for the visit but the fact that they are going illustrates the level of concern . " the eu delegation " will impress upon the leaders of both countries the seriousness of the situation in eastern democratic republic of congo -lrb- and -rrb- the need to engage urgently to find a solution to the underlying problem , " he added . eu-brokered ceasefire in tatters though the european union brokered a peace treaty in january that was signed by dozens of militias , including the rebel group responsible for the 1994 genocide in neighboring rwanda , the country has slid back into conflict . fighting in recent days has led to a stand-off between rebels and the un , as the latter rushes to aid nearly 30,000 displaced persons in what un secretary-general ban ki-moon is calling a humanitarian crisis of " catastrophic dimensions . " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the fighting against the congolese army is said to have ended a ceasefire came into effect on wednesday , calming attacks , but the latest round of violence had already provoked a crisis for aid agencies , some of whom have moved operations across the border to rwanda . eu frees up funding for aid the european commission responded to reports of the aid crisis thursday by saying it would give 4 million euros -lrb- $ 5.2 million -rrb- in emergency assistance to help the democratic republic of congo to cope with the conflict in its troubled east . " we are facing a critical humanitarian situation , " spokesman john clancy told journalists in brussels .
" the commission can announce emergency financial aid of a total 4 million euros . " he said 12 million of the 514 million euros earmarked for the country under the european commission 's 2008-2013 spending plans would specifically go towards helping the population of the war-torn east . germany has reportedly contributed 67.5 million euros to monuc in 2008 and just increased its humanitarian aid for drc to 5.7 million euros . dw staff -lrb- cat / nda -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

john clancy , a spokesman for eu development and humanitarian aid commissioner louis michel , said : " presidents kabila and kagame have given their agreement to commissioner michel to attend such an international summit . "
in a statement in kinshasa on friday , michel called for a summit to be held in nairobi , bringing together regional leaders and international organisations , to resolve the conflict in the east of congo .
the eastern congolese city of goma has become the epicenter of a humanitarian tragedy after tens of thousands of people fled an offensive by rebels of the national congress for the defense of the people that routed government forces in nord-kivu province . europe launches diplomatic drive europe on friday reasserted its commitment to diplomacy and political solutions to the violence in congo but ruled out a troop deployment to reinforce overstretched un forces in the region .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : kouchner warned of leaving action until it was too late france , which holds the rotating eu presidency , has proposed sending up to 1,500 european troops on a humanitarian mission to goma but britain and germany have voiced serious reservations .
while calling for an increase in troops , french foreign minister bernhard kouchner and eu foreign policy chief javier solana agreed the priority should be placed on providing aid , not fighting rebels .
kouchner added that while military personnel would likely make up the force , its mission would be to help refugees . " this response in our point of view should be humanitarian ... the name of these tactical groups - battlegroups - should not lead you to imagine that we are going to send troops to fight alongside the monuc , " he said , referring to the 17,000-strong un peacekeeping force already in congo . kouchner said the eu force would only be a small element of a larger , political solution between warring parties in congo and neighboring states . germany questions expanding eu deployment but germany remains opposed to the idea of an eu force .
german government spokesman jens ploetner said on friday that a 17,000-strong un mission , monuc , was already on the ground and said a deployment of eu troops could have " consequences for the credibility of monuc in the long run . " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : german foreign minister steinmeier called for rwanda 's help in the drc " those who hastily say that the existing mission is insufficient must expect that that will have consequences once monuc is back to carrying out its mission alone , " he said . german development minister heidemarie wieczorek-zeul reinforced german doubts by also questioning the logic behind increasing the eu presence in drc . " i personally can ’ t judge whether a special eu contingent is required to help restore peace in the drc , whether german troops should be part of such a mission , or whether a larger monuc force will do , " she said thursday .
" but violence has to stop as soon as possible .
the international community can not afford to sit back and simply watch once again . " kouchner , miliband to head to congo france 's foreign minister bernard kouchner and his british counterpart david miliband were preparing to head to strife-torn democratic republic of congo and rwanda on friday . kouchner 's spokesman , eric chevallier , told reporters in paris that the pair would visit the congolese capital kinshasa and the eastern city of goma , which is besieged by rebel forces .
officials confirmed they would also go to rwanda . " the mission will have several goals , " chevallier said .
" the first is to carry a clear political message from europe to demand that the situation stabilizes and the different actors agree to talk to each other more . bildunterschrift : tens of thousands of displaced people are fleeing the fighting in congo " the second is to get an update on the situation of the civilian population .
europe has decided to make an important contribution to the humanitarian effort in goma . " thirdly , we will evaluate the security situation .
in this regard , the goal is to study the security dynamic on the ground , " he added . french fm warns of unprecedented african " massacre " before leaving for drc , kouchner said the eastern region of the country is the scene of a " massacre " on a scale rarely seen in africa . " this is a massacre such as africa has probably never seen , which is taking place virtually before our eyes , " kouchner told europe 1 radio .
" it is out of the question that we let this happen . " a foreign office spokesman , commenting before miliband left for congo said that the eu delegation was " not going to set unrealistic ambitions for the visit but the fact that they are going illustrates the level of concern . " the eu delegation " will impress upon the leaders of both countries the seriousness of the situation in eastern democratic republic of congo -lrb- and -rrb- the need to engage urgently to find a solution to the underlying problem , " he added . eu-brokered ceasefire in tatters though the european union brokered a peace treaty in january that was signed by dozens of militias , including the rebel group responsible for the 1994 genocide in neighboring rwanda , the country has slid back into conflict . fighting in recent days has led to a stand-off between rebels and the un , as the latter rushes to aid nearly 30,000 displaced persons in what un secretary-general ban ki-moon is calling a humanitarian crisis of " catastrophic dimensions . " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the fighting against the congolese army is said to have ended a ceasefire came into effect on wednesday , calming attacks , but the latest round of violence had already provoked a crisis for aid agencies , some of whom have moved operations across the border to rwanda . eu frees up funding for aid the european commission responded to reports of the aid crisis thursday by saying it would give 4 million euros -lrb- $ 5.2 million -rrb- in emergency assistance to help the democratic republic of congo to cope with the conflict in its troubled east . " we are facing a critical humanitarian situation , " spokesman john clancy told journalists in brussels .
" the commission can announce emergency financial aid of a total 4 million euros . " he said 12 million of the 514 million euros earmarked for the country under the european commission 's 2008-2013 spending plans would specifically go towards helping the population of the war-torn east . germany has reportedly contributed 67.5 million euros to monuc in 2008 and just increased its humanitarian aid for drc to 5.7 million euros . dw staff -lrb- cat / nda -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

analysts had also expected inflation to come in at 3.2 percent in october . another reduction in borrowing costs by the ecb would also form part of a new wave of rate cuts by the world 's leading central banks with the us federal reserve on wednesday joining the monetary authorities in norway and china in reducing the cost of money .
the bank of england along with the monetary authorities in switzerland are also expected to follow up this week 's rate cut moves .
oil prices fall as demand drops the drop in euro zone inflation follows the recent fall in energy costs , with oil prices hovering at about $ 65 -lrb- 51 euros -rrb- a barrel in late european trading thursday on the prospects that slowing global economic growth will curb demand .
in july , oil prices were heading towards $ 150 a barrel .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : due to the current fianancial situation , demand for oil will curb analysts have predicted that the drop in energy prices and slowing global growth could result in further falls in inflation in the coming months .
in harmonized european terms , annual german inflation fell from 3 percent in september to 2.5 percent this month , its lowest in more than a year .
ecb chief jean claude trichet signaled monday that the bank 's rate-setting council might deliver another cut in borrowing costs at its meeting next month with analysts speculating that further reductions could be in the pipeline .
" i consider possible that the governing council will decrease interest rates once again at its next meeting on nov .

the new polish soccer chief is already considering other options . former polish soccer great grzegorz lato , the newly-elected head of the polish soccer federation -lrb- pzpn -rrb- , immediately began courting controversy after his appointment on thursday , oct .
29 by suggesting poland would turn to germany as its co-host for euro 2012 should original co-organizers ukraine prove incapable .
lato , a legendary player and top scorer at the 1974 world cup , took over from michal listkiewicz as president of the ailing pzpn , taking on the role of his country 's top official overseeing the run-up to poland 's first ever hosting of the european championships .
lato was voted in at a gathering of 113 pzpn delegates in warsaw after listkiewicz stepped down amid a corruption investigation .
" germany could join it -lrb- the plan to organize euro 2012 -rrb- , " lato told polish television when asked him what could happen should ukraine be unable to honor their original commitment .
lato added , however , that poland would be able to organize the tournament itself should it need to but expressed his hope that " ukraine would be able to finish the preparations in time . "
lato 's comments were described as " harmful " to the project by poland 's interior minister grzegorz schetyna and that the championship was a " mutual project and has a chance only when we treat it as such . "
ukraine feeling the pinch bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : grigori surkis , president of the ukraine fa , in happier times ukraine 's euro 2012 plans had earlier been thrown into doubt by a statement by its tournament organizer evgeny villinsky who said financial problems had meant ukraine 's preparations to host the tournament had come to a halt .
according to the interfax-ukraine news agency , villinsky added that the global financial crisis and ill-advised management were the reasons for the stopping of preparatory work .
the statement hinting at a cooperation agreement with germany added to the unease in certain circles over lato 's appointment the former striker quickly came under fire after being named pzpn president , mainly from politicians who claimed he was not up to the task of ridding polish soccer of corruption .
slawomir nowak , top aide to polish prime minister donald tusk , said that lato 's appointment was an obvious defeat for those who had ideas to improve the organization .
" this probably is n't the best news for polish soccer , " he told radio zet .
" we 'll have to wait longer for the process and cleaning up ... of polish soccer . "
interior minister schetyna told the polish press agency that lato was a " step backwards " for the federation , and that pzpn should " open itself to new solutions and new people , and this is n't happening . "
elzbieta jakubiak , head of a parliament sports commission , said lato wo n't make the needed changes as head of pzpn .
lato said he would resign in a year if the organization made no improvement , and called on other officials to work together and make euro 2012 " our shared success . "
polish corruption causing tensions bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : games in poland are suspected of being fixed the new pzpn president takes over at time of unprecedented tension between the government , the national soccer federation and world soccer 's governing body , fifa .
the sports ministry recently made a motion to suspend pzpn officials in an effort to clamp down on corruption , but fifa warned poland would lose upcoming world cup qualifying games and rights to euro 2012 unless it reinstated the officials .
fifa , which does n't tolerate political interference in soccer issues , withdrew the ultimatum after a letter from the ministry that showed a " positive evolution " in the situation .
the investigation into polish soccer was launched in may 2005 , and so far has charged nearly 100 people including referees , officials and federation members .
justice minister zbigniew cwiakalski said on friday there will " certainly " be more charges in the ongoing investigation that looks at years 2003 and 2004 .
" there were entire rounds that were fixed in certain clubs , " cwiakalski told polish radio .
" all the matches - one by one - were decided before they took place . "
cwiakalski said he did n't have proof that the pzpn was involved in the corruption , but admitted he could n't imagine " professionals did n't know about something that took place on a large scale in their surroundings .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de european championships -pipe- 31.10.2008 poland 's soccer chief looks to germany as euro 2012 co-host großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : grzegorz lato walked into a controversy shortly after taking over as pzpn president the global financial crisis has hampered ukraine 's preparations to co-host euro 2012 with neighboring poland .
the new polish soccer chief is already considering other options . former polish soccer great grzegorz lato , the newly-elected head of the polish soccer federation -lrb- pzpn -rrb- , immediately began courting controversy after his appointment on thursday , oct .
29 by suggesting poland would turn to germany as its co-host for euro 2012 should original co-organizers ukraine prove incapable .
lato , a legendary player and top scorer at the 1974 world cup , took over from michal listkiewicz as president of the ailing pzpn , taking on the role of his country 's top official overseeing the run-up to poland 's first ever hosting of the european championships .
lato was voted in at a gathering of 113 pzpn delegates in warsaw after listkiewicz stepped down amid a corruption investigation .
" germany could join it -lrb- the plan to organize euro 2012 -rrb- , " lato told polish television when asked him what could happen should ukraine be unable to honor their original commitment .
lato added , however , that poland would be able to organize the tournament itself should it need to but expressed his hope that " ukraine would be able to finish the preparations in time . "
lato 's comments were described as " harmful " to the project by poland 's interior minister grzegorz schetyna and that the championship was a " mutual project and has a chance only when we treat it as such . "
ukraine feeling the pinch bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : grigori surkis , president of the ukraine fa , in happier times ukraine 's euro 2012 plans had earlier been thrown into doubt by a statement by its tournament organizer evgeny villinsky who said financial problems had meant ukraine 's preparations to host the tournament had come to a halt .
according to the interfax-ukraine news agency , villinsky added that the global financial crisis and ill-advised management were the reasons for the stopping of preparatory work .
the statement hinting at a cooperation agreement with germany added to the unease in certain circles over lato 's appointment the former striker quickly came under fire after being named pzpn president , mainly from politicians who claimed he was not up to the task of ridding polish soccer of corruption .
slawomir nowak , top aide to polish prime minister donald tusk , said that lato 's appointment was an obvious defeat for those who had ideas to improve the organization .
" this probably is n't the best news for polish soccer , " he told radio zet .
" we 'll have to wait longer for the process and cleaning up ... of polish soccer . "
interior minister schetyna told the polish press agency that lato was a " step backwards " for the federation , and that pzpn should " open itself to new solutions and new people , and this is n't happening . "
elzbieta jakubiak , head of a parliament sports commission , said lato wo n't make the needed changes as head of pzpn .
lato said he would resign in a year if the organization made no improvement , and called on other officials to work together and make euro 2012 " our shared success . "
polish corruption causing tensions bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : games in poland are suspected of being fixed the new pzpn president takes over at time of unprecedented tension between the government , the national soccer federation and world soccer 's governing body , fifa .
the sports ministry recently made a motion to suspend pzpn officials in an effort to clamp down on corruption , but fifa warned poland would lose upcoming world cup qualifying games and rights to euro 2012 unless it reinstated the officials .
fifa , which does n't tolerate political interference in soccer issues , withdrew the ultimatum after a letter from the ministry that showed a " positive evolution " in the situation .
the investigation into polish soccer was launched in may 2005 , and so far has charged nearly 100 people including referees , officials and federation members .
justice minister zbigniew cwiakalski said on friday there will " certainly " be more charges in the ongoing investigation that looks at years 2003 and 2004 .
" there were entire rounds that were fixed in certain clubs , " cwiakalski told polish radio .
" all the matches - one by one - were decided before they took place . "

ballack apologized on the weekend but loew insisted on a meeting between the two in germany .
with chelsea 's consent , the currently injured ballack flew to frankfurt in a private jet on thursday and returned to london immediately afterwards .
" he knows that he can raise every issue internally .
but all decisions are made by our coaches - and i made that clear to michael , " loew said .
loew gave an indication of the seriousness of the conflict when he expressed his joy that " a great international player , who has played a main role in our success over the last years , remains available for the team and will help us meet our goals on the road to the 2010 world cup . "
ballack said : " i have no doubt after the talk with joachim loew that we can both realise our goals in the national team in a good atmosphere . "
ballack is germany 's only entry in the 23-player shortlist for the world footballer of the year award .

" i apologized to joachim loew .
he is the coach , he makes the decisions and we have to respect them . "
the chelsea midfielder had spoken out in the frankfurter allgemeine zeitung daily last week , expressing his dissent that loew benched his long-time midfield partner torsten frings at two world cup qualifiers .
ballack said that loew did not show enough respect for veteran germany players , but loew insisted that no player is guaranteed of a place in the starting 11 .
ballack apologized on the weekend but loew insisted on a meeting between the two in germany .
with chelsea 's consent , the currently injured ballack flew to frankfurt in a private jet on thursday and returned to london immediately afterwards .
" he knows that he can raise every issue internally .
but all decisions are made by our coaches - and i made that clear to michael , " loew said .
loew gave an indication of the seriousness of the conflict when he expressed his joy that " a great international player , who has played a main role in our success over the last years , remains available for the team and will help us meet our goals on the road to the 2010 world cup . "
ballack said : " i have no doubt after the talk with joachim loew that we can both realise our goals in the national team in a good atmosphere . "
ballack is germany 's only entry in the 23-player shortlist for the world footballer of the year award .
but he is yet to win a major international title on club or country level .
given his age , the 2010 world cup could be his last big event in germany 's colors . dpa news agency -lrb- sp -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de opinion -pipe- 31.10.2008 opinion : drop in unemployment a temporary snap-shot großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the number of unemployed people in germany has sunk below three million for the first time since november 1992 .
but although it 's a nice snap-shot , the worst is yet to come , says dw 's rolf wenkel . despite the financial crisis and an economic slowdown , the number of people without jobs in october decreased by 84,000 to 2.997 million .
in comparison to september , the unemployment rate sank by 0.2 percent to 7.2 percent , according to a statement from the federal employment office that was released in on thursday , oct .
30 in nuremberg .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the job market statisticians have provided us with some good news : for the first time in 16 years , the number of unemployed people has dipped below the symbolic number of three million .
but experts predict this will be the last positive surprise that can be expected from the job market for a long time .
after all , the job market has a delayed reaction of several months when it comes to economic changes .
everyone is saying that the financial crisis will spill over into the real economy .
the economics research institute and the economics minster have drastically lowered their growth prognoses .
this surely holds consequences for the employment market .
the only question is how serious the impact will be .
in the best-case scenario , the impressive job creation of recent years will simply come to a stand-still and the unemployment rate will stagnate .
in the worst-case scenario , reduced working hours , which are now being implemented in the automobile industry , wo n't do the trick .
if companies have their backs up against a wall , jobs will be cuts and the unemployment rate will increase significantly once again .
but there 's a lot to be said for the fact that the german job market is better equipped for a dreary global economic condition this time around .
in the past , each external shock on the job market would mean another blow to unemployment . as much as some unions and socio-politicians may despise them , the job market reforms from the 2010 agenda have made the german employment market significantly more robust and flexible – and they 've paved the way for impressive success .
almost 250,000 new jobs have been created since 2004 , and by no means only in the low wage sector .
unemployment decreased by 22 percent between 2004 and 2007 .
the cost of unemployment for public funds decreased in the same time period to just under 25 million euros -lrb- $ 31.7 million -rrb- , or 27 percent .
a demographic factor also comes into play : germany is getting older and fewer new generations are coming out of schools and universities .
in this year alone , approximately 80,000 fewer people entered the job market as in the previous year .
many went into retirement . the nuremberg institute for job market and career research estimates that this number will be at 130,000 next year .
that 's a number which significantly reduces the size of the job market , even if the financial crisis penetrates the real economy harder than we can imagine it doing today .
and there is another argument that suggests the looming recession might only put a small damper on the job market .
the lack of skilled workers has persuaded many companies to rethink their strategies .
they now think similarly to the way medium-sized machine manufacturers have been for a long time .
these manufacturers have been used to extreme economic vacillations in their branch for years and carry their employees with them through bad times because they know that when things improve , they 'll need their workers again .
those who are quick to lay-off employees will have difficulties later , because skilled workers are both costly and difficult to find .
perhaps this can also be a model for the future of listed companies in the course of the cleanup following the financial crisis .
this could be a time when disastrous things like shareholder value and pure thought in the quarterly results are challenged and neatly trimmed down .
in any case , it would be nice .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de opinion -pipe- 31.10.2008 opinion : drop in unemployment a temporary snap-shot großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the number of unemployed people in germany has sunk below three million for the first time since november 1992 .
but although it 's a nice snap-shot , the worst is yet to come , says dw 's rolf wenkel . despite the financial crisis and an economic slowdown , the number of people without jobs in october decreased by 84,000 to 2.997 million .
in comparison to september , the unemployment rate sank by 0.2 percent to 7.2 percent , according to a statement from the federal employment office that was released in on thursday , oct .
30 in nuremberg .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the job market statisticians have provided us with some good news : for the first time in 16 years , the number of unemployed people has dipped below the symbolic number of three million .
but experts predict this will be the last positive surprise that can be expected from the job market for a long time .
after all , the job market has a delayed reaction of several months when it comes to economic changes .
everyone is saying that the financial crisis will spill over into the real economy .
the economics research institute and the economics minster have drastically lowered their growth prognoses .
this surely holds consequences for the employment market .
the only question is how serious the impact will be .
in the best-case scenario , the impressive job creation of recent years will simply come to a stand-still and the unemployment rate will stagnate .
in the worst-case scenario , reduced working hours , which are now being implemented in the automobile industry , wo n't do the trick .
if companies have their backs up against a wall , jobs will be cuts and the unemployment rate will increase significantly once again .
but there 's a lot to be said for the fact that the german job market is better equipped for a dreary global economic condition this time around .
in the past , each external shock on the job market would mean another blow to unemployment . as much as some unions and socio-politicians may despise them , the job market reforms from the 2010 agenda have made the german employment market significantly more robust and flexible – and they 've paved the way for impressive success .
almost 250,000 new jobs have been created since 2004 , and by no means only in the low wage sector .
unemployment decreased by 22 percent between 2004 and 2007 .
the cost of unemployment for public funds decreased in the same time period to just under 25 million euros -lrb- $ 31.7 million -rrb- , or 27 percent .
a demographic factor also comes into play : germany is getting older and fewer new generations are coming out of schools and universities .
in this year alone , approximately 80,000 fewer people entered the job market as in the previous year .
many went into retirement . the nuremberg institute for job market and career research estimates that this number will be at 130,000 next year .
that 's a number which significantly reduces the size of the job market , even if the financial crisis penetrates the real economy harder than we can imagine it doing today .
and there is another argument that suggests the looming recession might only put a small damper on the job market .
the lack of skilled workers has persuaded many companies to rethink their strategies .
they now think similarly to the way medium-sized machine manufacturers have been for a long time .
these manufacturers have been used to extreme economic vacillations in their branch for years and carry their employees with them through bad times because they know that when things improve , they 'll need their workers again .
those who are quick to lay-off employees will have difficulties later , because skilled workers are both costly and difficult to find .
perhaps this can also be a model for the future of listed companies in the course of the cleanup following the financial crisis .
this could be a time when disastrous things like shareholder value and pure thought in the quarterly results are challenged and neatly trimmed down .
in any case , it would be nice .

the news ended speculation that ballack may resign as captain or even be stripped of this position after criticizing loew last week in a newspaper interview over his selection criteria and attitude towards players .
even his future in the team was put into question .
" michael ballack remains my captain .
but as captain he must play by the rules , " said loew .
ballack , 32 , said : " i realize it was not ok to go public .
i regret that this led to the impression that i wanted to criticise joachim loew in his position as coach , " the skipper said .
" i apologized to joachim loew .
he is the coach , he makes the decisions and we have to respect them . "
the chelsea midfielder had spoken out in the frankfurter allgemeine zeitung daily last week , expressing his dissent that loew benched his long-time midfield partner torsten frings at two world cup qualifiers .
ballack said that loew did not show enough respect for veteran germany players , but loew insisted that no player is guaranteed of a place in the starting 11 .
ballack apologized on the weekend but loew insisted on a meeting between the two in germany .
with chelsea 's consent , the currently injured ballack flew to frankfurt in a private jet on thursday and returned to london immediately afterwards .
" he knows that he can raise every issue internally .
but all decisions are made by our coaches - and i made that clear to michael , " loew said .
loew gave an indication of the seriousness of the conflict when he expressed his joy that " a great international player , who has played a main role in our success over the last years , remains available for the team and will help us meet our goals on the road to the 2010 world cup . "
ballack said : " i have no doubt after the talk with joachim loew that we can both realise our goals in the national team in a good atmosphere . "
ballack is germany 's only entry in the 23-player shortlist for the world footballer of the year award .

the news ended speculation that ballack may resign as captain or even be stripped of this position after criticizing loew last week in a newspaper interview over his selection criteria and attitude towards players .
even his future in the team was put into question .
" michael ballack remains my captain .
but as captain he must play by the rules , " said loew .
ballack , 32 , said : " i realize it was not ok to go public .
i regret that this led to the impression that i wanted to criticise joachim loew in his position as coach , " the skipper said .
" i apologized to joachim loew .
he is the coach , he makes the decisions and we have to respect them . "
the chelsea midfielder had spoken out in the frankfurter allgemeine zeitung daily last week , expressing his dissent that loew benched his long-time midfield partner torsten frings at two world cup qualifiers .
ballack said that loew did not show enough respect for veteran germany players , but loew insisted that no player is guaranteed of a place in the starting 11 .
ballack apologized on the weekend but loew insisted on a meeting between the two in germany .
with chelsea 's consent , the currently injured ballack flew to frankfurt in a private jet on thursday and returned to london immediately afterwards .
" he knows that he can raise every issue internally .
but all decisions are made by our coaches - and i made that clear to michael , " loew said .
loew gave an indication of the seriousness of the conflict when he expressed his joy that " a great international player , who has played a main role in our success over the last years , remains available for the team and will help us meet our goals on the road to the 2010 world cup . "
ballack said : " i have no doubt after the talk with joachim loew that we can both realise our goals in the national team in a good atmosphere . "
ballack is germany 's only entry in the 23-player shortlist for the world footballer of the year award .
but he is yet to win a major international title on club or country level .
given his age , the 2010 world cup could be his last big event in germany 's colors . dpa news agency -lrb- sp -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de in focus : sixtieth anniversary of the berlin airlift 60th anniversary berlin airlift the berlin airlift was america 's finest hour 60 years ago the berlin airlift in numbers us , germany celebrate 60 years of berlin airlift history -pipe- 31.10.2008 berlin bids bon voyage to historic tempelhof airport großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : there will be no more planes , vintage or otherwise , landing at tempelhof what was once europe 's largest airport was be mothballed on thursday , oct .
30 , when the last flight left tempelhof .
the airport played a central role in berlin 's history , but its future remains unclear . the night of wednesday was the last time people not flying to or from tempelhof were be allowed in the building , and the final take-offs followed one day later , marked by a farewell gala . supporters of the airport tried to save it , but a public referendum in april 2008 that would have called for its preservation failed to attract enough votes . the city of berlin and the german government , who own tempelhof , have wanted to close it for years , citing costs and declining passenger numbers .
last year a mere 350,000 passengers flew through tempelhof , compared with 19 million for berlin 's two other airports . but many people still feel very passionate about tempelhof .
berlin mayor klaus wowereit has reportedly received death threats about the closure . and no less an expert on architecture than norman foster , the englishman who designed the new glass dome on berlin 's reichstag has called it " the mother of all airports . " mother 's history bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : berlin residents associate the airport with the airlift planes were taking off and landing at tempelhof in 1923 .
but it first took on the dimensions for which it became famous a decade later under the nazis , when architect ernst sagebiel built its 286,000-square-meter main building . that made tempelhof the largest building in the world in terms of square area .
it still ranks among the world 's top 20 and is regarded by many as an architectural masterpiece . after world war two , what had been a symbol of fascist monumentalism became the central point of the 1948-49 berlin airlift , in which the allies kept the german capital supplied with necessities despite a soviet blockade of the western part of the city . from 1950 to 1975 , the airport was the center of commercial air traffic in berlin .
it was then replaced in that function by the more modern tegel airport since its relatively short runways precluded larger passengers planes from taking off or landing . but tempelhof reopened to commercial passengers in 1985 and was used mostly by short-haul business commuters and vacationers . plans to permanently shut tempelhof began gaining momentum in 1996 , and the city of berlin and the city 's airport holding company estimate that it has run between 10 million and 15 million euros -lrb- $ 12.7 million and $ 19 million -rrb- in the red every year . berlin is hoping to build a massive new airport on the city 's eastern fringe by 2011 . uncertain future bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : a film studio may take over part of tempelhof 's unique architecture no one knows what will become of the more 3.5-million-square-meter site when planes no longer take off and land there . there has been talk of using parts of the main terminal building for a cultural forum , and the film studios in nearby babelsberg have also discussed using the facility for shooting movies and producing and storing props and costumes . the external grounds could be converted into a park and / or developed as housing property .
the city of berlin plans to stage an open competition to solicit ideas for how the site should be used and is currently having the tempelhof complex surveyed to determine its exact value . but delays in utilizing tempelhof are themselves costly .
architects estimate the annual costs caused by the facility in its dormant state at 11.85 million euros - roughly what tempelhof was losing while it was in operation . the building itself is listed , ensuring that the airport which saw so much history remains at least partially preserved for future generations . dw staff -lrb- jc -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de european championships -pipe- 31.10.2008 poland 's soccer chief looks to germany as euro 2012 co-host großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : grzegorz lato walked into a controversy shortly after taking over as pzpn president the global financial crisis has hampered ukraine 's preparations to co-host euro 2012 with neighboring poland .
the new polish soccer chief is already considering other options . former polish soccer great grzegorz lato , the newly-elected head of the polish soccer federation -lrb- pzpn -rrb- , immediately began courting controversy after his appointment on thursday , oct .
29 by suggesting poland would turn to germany as its co-host for euro 2012 should original co-organizers ukraine prove incapable .
lato , a legendary player and top scorer at the 1974 world cup , took over from michal listkiewicz as president of the ailing pzpn , taking on the role of his country 's top official overseeing the run-up to poland 's first ever hosting of the european championships .
lato was voted in at a gathering of 113 pzpn delegates in warsaw after listkiewicz stepped down amid a corruption investigation .
" germany could join it -lrb- the plan to organize euro 2012 -rrb- , " lato told polish television when asked him what could happen should ukraine be unable to honor their original commitment .
lato added , however , that poland would be able to organize the tournament itself should it need to but expressed his hope that " ukraine would be able to finish the preparations in time . "
lato 's comments were described as " harmful " to the project by poland 's interior minister grzegorz schetyna and that the championship was a " mutual project and has a chance only when we treat it as such . "
ukraine feeling the pinch bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : grigori surkis , president of the ukraine fa , in happier times ukraine 's euro 2012 plans had earlier been thrown into doubt by a statement by its tournament organizer evgeny villinsky who said financial problems had meant ukraine 's preparations to host the tournament had come to a halt .
according to the interfax-ukraine news agency , villinsky added that the global financial crisis and ill-advised management were the reasons for the stopping of preparatory work .
the statement hinting at a cooperation agreement with germany added to the unease in certain circles over lato 's appointment the former striker quickly came under fire after being named pzpn president , mainly from politicians who claimed he was not up to the task of ridding polish soccer of corruption .
slawomir nowak , top aide to polish prime minister donald tusk , said that lato 's appointment was an obvious defeat for those who had ideas to improve the organization .
" this probably is n't the best news for polish soccer , " he told radio zet .
" we 'll have to wait longer for the process and cleaning up ... of polish soccer . "
interior minister schetyna told the polish press agency that lato was a " step backwards " for the federation , and that pzpn should " open itself to new solutions and new people , and this is n't happening . "
elzbieta jakubiak , head of a parliament sports commission , said lato wo n't make the needed changes as head of pzpn .
lato said he would resign in a year if the organization made no improvement , and called on other officials to work together and make euro 2012 " our shared success . "
polish corruption causing tensions bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : games in poland are suspected of being fixed the new pzpn president takes over at time of unprecedented tension between the government , the national soccer federation and world soccer 's governing body , fifa .
the sports ministry recently made a motion to suspend pzpn officials in an effort to clamp down on corruption , but fifa warned poland would lose upcoming world cup qualifying games and rights to euro 2012 unless it reinstated the officials .
fifa , which does n't tolerate political interference in soccer issues , withdrew the ultimatum after a letter from the ministry that showed a " positive evolution " in the situation .
the investigation into polish soccer was launched in may 2005 , and so far has charged nearly 100 people including referees , officials and federation members .

lato was voted in at a gathering of 113 pzpn delegates in warsaw after listkiewicz stepped down amid a corruption investigation .

the new polish soccer chief is already considering other options . former polish soccer great grzegorz lato , the newly-elected head of the polish soccer federation -lrb- pzpn -rrb- , immediately began courting controversy after his appointment on thursday , oct .
29 by suggesting poland would turn to germany as its co-host for euro 2012 should original co-organizers ukraine prove incapable .
lato , a legendary player and top scorer at the 1974 world cup , took over from michal listkiewicz as president of the ailing pzpn , taking on the role of his country 's top official overseeing the run-up to poland 's first ever hosting of the european championships .
lato was voted in at a gathering of 113 pzpn delegates in warsaw after listkiewicz stepped down amid a corruption investigation .
" germany could join it -lrb- the plan to organize euro 2012 -rrb- , " lato told polish television when asked him what could happen should ukraine be unable to honor their original commitment .
lato added , however , that poland would be able to organize the tournament itself should it need to but expressed his hope that " ukraine would be able to finish the preparations in time . "
lato 's comments were described as " harmful " to the project by poland 's interior minister grzegorz schetyna and that the championship was a " mutual project and has a chance only when we treat it as such . "
ukraine feeling the pinch bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : grigori surkis , president of the ukraine fa , in happier times ukraine 's euro 2012 plans had earlier been thrown into doubt by a statement by its tournament organizer evgeny villinsky who said financial problems had meant ukraine 's preparations to host the tournament had come to a halt .
according to the interfax-ukraine news agency , villinsky added that the global financial crisis and ill-advised management were the reasons for the stopping of preparatory work .
the statement hinting at a cooperation agreement with germany added to the unease in certain circles over lato 's appointment the former striker quickly came under fire after being named pzpn president , mainly from politicians who claimed he was not up to the task of ridding polish soccer of corruption .
slawomir nowak , top aide to polish prime minister donald tusk , said that lato 's appointment was an obvious defeat for those who had ideas to improve the organization .
" this probably is n't the best news for polish soccer , " he told radio zet .
" we 'll have to wait longer for the process and cleaning up ... of polish soccer . "
interior minister schetyna told the polish press agency that lato was a " step backwards " for the federation , and that pzpn should " open itself to new solutions and new people , and this is n't happening . "
elzbieta jakubiak , head of a parliament sports commission , said lato wo n't make the needed changes as head of pzpn .
lato said he would resign in a year if the organization made no improvement , and called on other officials to work together and make euro 2012 " our shared success . "
polish corruption causing tensions bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : games in poland are suspected of being fixed the new pzpn president takes over at time of unprecedented tension between the government , the national soccer federation and world soccer 's governing body , fifa .
the sports ministry recently made a motion to suspend pzpn officials in an effort to clamp down on corruption , but fifa warned poland would lose upcoming world cup qualifying games and rights to euro 2012 unless it reinstated the officials .
fifa , which does n't tolerate political interference in soccer issues , withdrew the ultimatum after a letter from the ministry that showed a " positive evolution " in the situation .
the investigation into polish soccer was launched in may 2005 , and so far has charged nearly 100 people including referees , officials and federation members .
justice minister zbigniew cwiakalski said on friday there will " certainly " be more charges in the ongoing investigation that looks at years 2003 and 2004 .
" there were entire rounds that were fixed in certain clubs , " cwiakalski told polish radio .
" all the matches - one by one - were decided before they took place . "
cwiakalski said he did n't have proof that the pzpn was involved in the corruption , but admitted he could n't imagine " professionals did n't know about something that took place on a large scale in their surroundings .

but although it 's a nice snap-shot , the worst is yet to come , says dw 's rolf wenkel . despite the financial crisis and an economic slowdown , the number of people without jobs in october decreased by 84,000 to 2.997 million .
in comparison to september , the unemployment rate sank by 0.2 percent to 7.2 percent , according to a statement from the federal employment office that was released in on thursday , oct .
30 in nuremberg .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the job market statisticians have provided us with some good news : for the first time in 16 years , the number of unemployed people has dipped below the symbolic number of three million .
but experts predict this will be the last positive surprise that can be expected from the job market for a long time .
after all , the job market has a delayed reaction of several months when it comes to economic changes .
everyone is saying that the financial crisis will spill over into the real economy .
the economics research institute and the economics minster have drastically lowered their growth prognoses .
this surely holds consequences for the employment market .
the only question is how serious the impact will be .
in the best-case scenario , the impressive job creation of recent years will simply come to a stand-still and the unemployment rate will stagnate .
in the worst-case scenario , reduced working hours , which are now being implemented in the automobile industry , wo n't do the trick .
if companies have their backs up against a wall , jobs will be cuts and the unemployment rate will increase significantly once again .
but there 's a lot to be said for the fact that the german job market is better equipped for a dreary global economic condition this time around .
in the past , each external shock on the job market would mean another blow to unemployment . as much as some unions and socio-politicians may despise them , the job market reforms from the 2010 agenda have made the german employment market significantly more robust and flexible – and they 've paved the way for impressive success .
almost 250,000 new jobs have been created since 2004 , and by no means only in the low wage sector .
unemployment decreased by 22 percent between 2004 and 2007 .
the cost of unemployment for public funds decreased in the same time period to just under 25 million euros -lrb- $ 31.7 million -rrb- , or 27 percent .
a demographic factor also comes into play : germany is getting older and fewer new generations are coming out of schools and universities .
in this year alone , approximately 80,000 fewer people entered the job market as in the previous year .
many went into retirement . the nuremberg institute for job market and career research estimates that this number will be at 130,000 next year .
that 's a number which significantly reduces the size of the job market , even if the financial crisis penetrates the real economy harder than we can imagine it doing today .
and there is another argument that suggests the looming recession might only put a small damper on the job market .
the lack of skilled workers has persuaded many companies to rethink their strategies .
they now think similarly to the way medium-sized machine manufacturers have been for a long time .
these manufacturers have been used to extreme economic vacillations in their branch for years and carry their employees with them through bad times because they know that when things improve , they 'll need their workers again .
those who are quick to lay-off employees will have difficulties later , because skilled workers are both costly and difficult to find .
perhaps this can also be a model for the future of listed companies in the course of the cleanup following the financial crisis .
this could be a time when disastrous things like shareholder value and pure thought in the quarterly results are challenged and neatly trimmed down .
in any case , it would be nice .

but although it 's a nice snap-shot , the worst is yet to come , says dw 's rolf wenkel . despite the financial crisis and an economic slowdown , the number of people without jobs in october decreased by 84,000 to 2.997 million .
in comparison to september , the unemployment rate sank by 0.2 percent to 7.2 percent , according to a statement from the federal employment office that was released in on thursday , oct .
30 in nuremberg .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the job market statisticians have provided us with some good news : for the first time in 16 years , the number of unemployed people has dipped below the symbolic number of three million .
but experts predict this will be the last positive surprise that can be expected from the job market for a long time .
after all , the job market has a delayed reaction of several months when it comes to economic changes .
everyone is saying that the financial crisis will spill over into the real economy .
the economics research institute and the economics minster have drastically lowered their growth prognoses .
this surely holds consequences for the employment market .
the only question is how serious the impact will be .
in the best-case scenario , the impressive job creation of recent years will simply come to a stand-still and the unemployment rate will stagnate .
in the worst-case scenario , reduced working hours , which are now being implemented in the automobile industry , wo n't do the trick .
if companies have their backs up against a wall , jobs will be cuts and the unemployment rate will increase significantly once again .
but there 's a lot to be said for the fact that the german job market is better equipped for a dreary global economic condition this time around .
in the past , each external shock on the job market would mean another blow to unemployment . as much as some unions and socio-politicians may despise them , the job market reforms from the 2010 agenda have made the german employment market significantly more robust and flexible – and they 've paved the way for impressive success .
almost 250,000 new jobs have been created since 2004 , and by no means only in the low wage sector .
unemployment decreased by 22 percent between 2004 and 2007 .
the cost of unemployment for public funds decreased in the same time period to just under 25 million euros -lrb- $ 31.7 million -rrb- , or 27 percent .
a demographic factor also comes into play : germany is getting older and fewer new generations are coming out of schools and universities .
in this year alone , approximately 80,000 fewer people entered the job market as in the previous year .
many went into retirement . the nuremberg institute for job market and career research estimates that this number will be at 130,000 next year .
that 's a number which significantly reduces the size of the job market , even if the financial crisis penetrates the real economy harder than we can imagine it doing today .
and there is another argument that suggests the looming recession might only put a small damper on the job market .
the lack of skilled workers has persuaded many companies to rethink their strategies .
they now think similarly to the way medium-sized machine manufacturers have been for a long time .
these manufacturers have been used to extreme economic vacillations in their branch for years and carry their employees with them through bad times because they know that when things improve , they 'll need their workers again .
those who are quick to lay-off employees will have difficulties later , because skilled workers are both costly and difficult to find .
perhaps this can also be a model for the future of listed companies in the course of the cleanup following the financial crisis .
this could be a time when disastrous things like shareholder value and pure thought in the quarterly results are challenged and neatly trimmed down .
in any case , it would be nice .

german employers had argued that the credit crunch and financial meltdown is making bigger offers unrealistic . late thursday , employers tabled an offer of 2.9 percent wage hikes for the next 14 months in south-western state of baden-wuerttemberg , home to automakers daimler ag and porsche se . ig metall 's regional branch immediately rejected the offer . " what employers have offered today ... is not an offer , but an invitation to a labor dispute , " werner neugebauer , who heads ig metall 's bavarian branch , said . union wants eight-percent hike ig metall is seeking an 8 percent salary increase over the next 12 months , arguing it is justified on the basis of a 220 percent increase in companies ' profits between 2004-2007 - a time when wages effectively increased by only 8.7 percent . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the ig metall trade union asked for an 8 percent wage increase weeks ago berthold huber , head of the ig metall union , told friday 's bild newspaper that if no pay deal is reached , " the real wave of strikes " would start monday .

" it is irresponsible because it would choke off economic growth .
the conflict can not be resolved this way - i see no solution without work stoppages . " ig metall in the south-west is germany 's trend-setter in wage-fixing , striking deals that are usually copied by manufacturing industry elsewhere in the country and emulated in other business sectors where unions are less militant . nationwide , ig metall represents 3.6 million workers , not all of them card-carrying union members . the negotiations are likely to set a benchmark for subsequent pay talks in other sectors , and are sure to affect the powerhouses of german industry such as siemens , bmw , daimler and volkswagen . german carmakers have seen sales slump as the financial crisis begins to bite .
concerns are mounting that germany 's all-important exports of cars , trucks and industrial plants may soon plummet as global demand falls .

john clancy , a spokesman for eu development and humanitarian aid commissioner louis michel , said : " presidents kabila and kagame have given their agreement to commissioner michel to attend such an international summit . "
in a statement in kinshasa on friday , michel called for a summit to be held in nairobi , bringing together regional leaders and international organisations , to resolve the conflict in the east of congo .
the eastern congolese city of goma has become the epicenter of a humanitarian tragedy after tens of thousands of people fled an offensive by rebels of the national congress for the defense of the people that routed government forces in nord-kivu province . europe launches diplomatic drive europe on friday reasserted its commitment to diplomacy and political solutions to the violence in congo but ruled out a troop deployment to reinforce overstretched un forces in the region .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : kouchner warned of leaving action until it was too late france , which holds the rotating eu presidency , has proposed sending up to 1,500 european troops on a humanitarian mission to goma but britain and germany have voiced serious reservations .
while calling for an increase in troops , french foreign minister bernhard kouchner and eu foreign policy chief javier solana agreed the priority should be placed on providing aid , not fighting rebels .
kouchner added that while military personnel would likely make up the force , its mission would be to help refugees . " this response in our point of view should be humanitarian ... the name of these tactical groups - battlegroups - should not lead you to imagine that we are going to send troops to fight alongside the monuc , " he said , referring to the 17,000-strong un peacekeeping force already in congo . kouchner said the eu force would only be a small element of a larger , political solution between warring parties in congo and neighboring states . germany questions expanding eu deployment but germany remains opposed to the idea of an eu force .
german government spokesman jens ploetner said on friday that a 17,000-strong un mission , monuc , was already on the ground and said a deployment of eu troops could have " consequences for the credibility of monuc in the long run . " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : german foreign minister steinmeier called for rwanda 's help in the drc " those who hastily say that the existing mission is insufficient must expect that that will have consequences once monuc is back to carrying out its mission alone , " he said . german development minister heidemarie wieczorek-zeul reinforced german doubts by also questioning the logic behind increasing the eu presence in drc . " i personally can ’ t judge whether a special eu contingent is required to help restore peace in the drc , whether german troops should be part of such a mission , or whether a larger monuc force will do , " she said thursday .
" but violence has to stop as soon as possible .
the international community can not afford to sit back and simply watch once again . " kouchner , miliband to head to congo france 's foreign minister bernard kouchner and his british counterpart david miliband were preparing to head to strife-torn democratic republic of congo and rwanda on friday . kouchner 's spokesman , eric chevallier , told reporters in paris that the pair would visit the congolese capital kinshasa and the eastern city of goma , which is besieged by rebel forces .
officials confirmed they would also go to rwanda . " the mission will have several goals , " chevallier said .
" the first is to carry a clear political message from europe to demand that the situation stabilizes and the different actors agree to talk to each other more . bildunterschrift : tens of thousands of displaced people are fleeing the fighting in congo " the second is to get an update on the situation of the civilian population .
europe has decided to make an important contribution to the humanitarian effort in goma . " thirdly , we will evaluate the security situation .
in this regard , the goal is to study the security dynamic on the ground , " he added . french fm warns of unprecedented african " massacre " before leaving for drc , kouchner said the eastern region of the country is the scene of a " massacre " on a scale rarely seen in africa . " this is a massacre such as africa has probably never seen , which is taking place virtually before our eyes , " kouchner told europe 1 radio .
" it is out of the question that we let this happen . " a foreign office spokesman , commenting before miliband left for congo said that the eu delegation was " not going to set unrealistic ambitions for the visit but the fact that they are going illustrates the level of concern . " the eu delegation " will impress upon the leaders of both countries the seriousness of the situation in eastern democratic republic of congo -lrb- and -rrb- the need to engage urgently to find a solution to the underlying problem , " he added . eu-brokered ceasefire in tatters though the european union brokered a peace treaty in january that was signed by dozens of militias , including the rebel group responsible for the 1994 genocide in neighboring rwanda , the country has slid back into conflict . fighting in recent days has led to a stand-off between rebels and the un , as the latter rushes to aid nearly 30,000 displaced persons in what un secretary-general ban ki-moon is calling a humanitarian crisis of " catastrophic dimensions . " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the fighting against the congolese army is said to have ended a ceasefire came into effect on wednesday , calming attacks , but the latest round of violence had already provoked a crisis for aid agencies , some of whom have moved operations across the border to rwanda . eu frees up funding for aid the european commission responded to reports of the aid crisis thursday by saying it would give 4 million euros -lrb- $ 5.2 million -rrb- in emergency assistance to help the democratic republic of congo to cope with the conflict in its troubled east .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de in focus : sixtieth anniversary of the berlin airlift 60th anniversary berlin airlift the berlin airlift was america 's finest hour 60 years ago the berlin airlift in numbers us , germany celebrate 60 years of berlin airlift history -pipe- 31.10.2008 berlin bids bon voyage to historic tempelhof airport großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : there will be no more planes , vintage or otherwise , landing at tempelhof what was once europe 's largest airport was be mothballed on thursday , oct .
30 , when the last flight left tempelhof .
the airport played a central role in berlin 's history , but its future remains unclear . the night of wednesday was the last time people not flying to or from tempelhof were be allowed in the building , and the final take-offs followed one day later , marked by a farewell gala . supporters of the airport tried to save it , but a public referendum in april 2008 that would have called for its preservation failed to attract enough votes . the city of berlin and the german government , who own tempelhof , have wanted to close it for years , citing costs and declining passenger numbers .
last year a mere 350,000 passengers flew through tempelhof , compared with 19 million for berlin 's two other airports . but many people still feel very passionate about tempelhof .
berlin mayor klaus wowereit has reportedly received death threats about the closure . and no less an expert on architecture than norman foster , the englishman who designed the new glass dome on berlin 's reichstag has called it " the mother of all airports . " mother 's history bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : berlin residents associate the airport with the airlift planes were taking off and landing at tempelhof in 1923 .
but it first took on the dimensions for which it became famous a decade later under the nazis , when architect ernst sagebiel built its 286,000-square-meter main building . that made tempelhof the largest building in the world in terms of square area .
it still ranks among the world 's top 20 and is regarded by many as an architectural masterpiece . after world war two , what had been a symbol of fascist monumentalism became the central point of the 1948-49 berlin airlift , in which the allies kept the german capital supplied with necessities despite a soviet blockade of the western part of the city . from 1950 to 1975 , the airport was the center of commercial air traffic in berlin .

30 , when the last flight left tempelhof .
the airport played a central role in berlin 's history , but its future remains unclear . the night of wednesday was the last time people not flying to or from tempelhof were be allowed in the building , and the final take-offs followed one day later , marked by a farewell gala . supporters of the airport tried to save it , but a public referendum in april 2008 that would have called for its preservation failed to attract enough votes . the city of berlin and the german government , who own tempelhof , have wanted to close it for years , citing costs and declining passenger numbers .
last year a mere 350,000 passengers flew through tempelhof , compared with 19 million for berlin 's two other airports . but many people still feel very passionate about tempelhof .
berlin mayor klaus wowereit has reportedly received death threats about the closure . and no less an expert on architecture than norman foster , the englishman who designed the new glass dome on berlin 's reichstag has called it " the mother of all airports . " mother 's history bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : berlin residents associate the airport with the airlift planes were taking off and landing at tempelhof in 1923 .
but it first took on the dimensions for which it became famous a decade later under the nazis , when architect ernst sagebiel built its 286,000-square-meter main building . that made tempelhof the largest building in the world in terms of square area .
it still ranks among the world 's top 20 and is regarded by many as an architectural masterpiece . after world war two , what had been a symbol of fascist monumentalism became the central point of the 1948-49 berlin airlift , in which the allies kept the german capital supplied with necessities despite a soviet blockade of the western part of the city . from 1950 to 1975 , the airport was the center of commercial air traffic in berlin .
it was then replaced in that function by the more modern tegel airport since its relatively short runways precluded larger passengers planes from taking off or landing . but tempelhof reopened to commercial passengers in 1985 and was used mostly by short-haul business commuters and vacationers . plans to permanently shut tempelhof began gaining momentum in 1996 , and the city of berlin and the city 's airport holding company estimate that it has run between 10 million and 15 million euros -lrb- $ 12.7 million and $ 19 million -rrb- in the red every year . berlin is hoping to build a massive new airport on the city 's eastern fringe by 2011 . uncertain future bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : a film studio may take over part of tempelhof 's unique architecture no one knows what will become of the more 3.5-million-square-meter site when planes no longer take off and land there . there has been talk of using parts of the main terminal building for a cultural forum , and the film studios in nearby babelsberg have also discussed using the facility for shooting movies and producing and storing props and costumes . the external grounds could be converted into a park and / or developed as housing property .
the city of berlin plans to stage an open competition to solicit ideas for how the site should be used and is currently having the tempelhof complex surveyed to determine its exact value . but delays in utilizing tempelhof are themselves costly .
architects estimate the annual costs caused by the facility in its dormant state at 11.85 million euros - roughly what tempelhof was losing while it was in operation . the building itself is listed , ensuring that the airport which saw so much history remains at least partially preserved for future generations . dw staff -lrb- jc -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de opinion -pipe- 31.10.2008 opinion : drop in unemployment a temporary snap-shot großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the number of unemployed people in germany has sunk below three million for the first time since november 1992 .
but although it 's a nice snap-shot , the worst is yet to come , says dw 's rolf wenkel . despite the financial crisis and an economic slowdown , the number of people without jobs in october decreased by 84,000 to 2.997 million .
in comparison to september , the unemployment rate sank by 0.2 percent to 7.2 percent , according to a statement from the federal employment office that was released in on thursday , oct .
30 in nuremberg .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the job market statisticians have provided us with some good news : for the first time in 16 years , the number of unemployed people has dipped below the symbolic number of three million .
but experts predict this will be the last positive surprise that can be expected from the job market for a long time .
after all , the job market has a delayed reaction of several months when it comes to economic changes .
everyone is saying that the financial crisis will spill over into the real economy .
the economics research institute and the economics minster have drastically lowered their growth prognoses .
this surely holds consequences for the employment market .
the only question is how serious the impact will be .
in the best-case scenario , the impressive job creation of recent years will simply come to a stand-still and the unemployment rate will stagnate .
in the worst-case scenario , reduced working hours , which are now being implemented in the automobile industry , wo n't do the trick .
if companies have their backs up against a wall , jobs will be cuts and the unemployment rate will increase significantly once again .
but there 's a lot to be said for the fact that the german job market is better equipped for a dreary global economic condition this time around .
in the past , each external shock on the job market would mean another blow to unemployment . as much as some unions and socio-politicians may despise them , the job market reforms from the 2010 agenda have made the german employment market significantly more robust and flexible – and they 've paved the way for impressive success .
almost 250,000 new jobs have been created since 2004 , and by no means only in the low wage sector .
unemployment decreased by 22 percent between 2004 and 2007 .
the cost of unemployment for public funds decreased in the same time period to just under 25 million euros -lrb- $ 31.7 million -rrb- , or 27 percent .
a demographic factor also comes into play : germany is getting older and fewer new generations are coming out of schools and universities .
in this year alone , approximately 80,000 fewer people entered the job market as in the previous year .
many went into retirement . the nuremberg institute for job market and career research estimates that this number will be at 130,000 next year .
that 's a number which significantly reduces the size of the job market , even if the financial crisis penetrates the real economy harder than we can imagine it doing today .
and there is another argument that suggests the looming recession might only put a small damper on the job market .
the lack of skilled workers has persuaded many companies to rethink their strategies .
they now think similarly to the way medium-sized machine manufacturers have been for a long time .
these manufacturers have been used to extreme economic vacillations in their branch for years and carry their employees with them through bad times because they know that when things improve , they 'll need their workers again .
those who are quick to lay-off employees will have difficulties later , because skilled workers are both costly and difficult to find .
perhaps this can also be a model for the future of listed companies in the course of the cleanup following the financial crisis .
this could be a time when disastrous things like shareholder value and pure thought in the quarterly results are challenged and neatly trimmed down .
in any case , it would be nice .

the news ended speculation that ballack may resign as captain or even be stripped of this position after criticizing loew last week in a newspaper interview over his selection criteria and attitude towards players .
even his future in the team was put into question .
" michael ballack remains my captain .
but as captain he must play by the rules , " said loew .
ballack , 32 , said : " i realize it was not ok to go public .
i regret that this led to the impression that i wanted to criticise joachim loew in his position as coach , " the skipper said .
" i apologized to joachim loew .
he is the coach , he makes the decisions and we have to respect them . "
the chelsea midfielder had spoken out in the frankfurter allgemeine zeitung daily last week , expressing his dissent that loew benched his long-time midfield partner torsten frings at two world cup qualifiers .
ballack said that loew did not show enough respect for veteran germany players , but loew insisted that no player is guaranteed of a place in the starting 11 .
ballack apologized on the weekend but loew insisted on a meeting between the two in germany .
with chelsea 's consent , the currently injured ballack flew to frankfurt in a private jet on thursday and returned to london immediately afterwards .
" he knows that he can raise every issue internally .
but all decisions are made by our coaches - and i made that clear to michael , " loew said .
loew gave an indication of the seriousness of the conflict when he expressed his joy that " a great international player , who has played a main role in our success over the last years , remains available for the team and will help us meet our goals on the road to the 2010 world cup . "
ballack said : " i have no doubt after the talk with joachim loew that we can both realise our goals in the national team in a good atmosphere . "
ballack is germany 's only entry in the 23-player shortlist for the world footballer of the year award .
but he is yet to win a major international title on club or country level .
given his age , the 2010 world cup could be his last big event in germany 's colors . dpa news agency -lrb- sp -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

the new polish soccer chief is already considering other options . former polish soccer great grzegorz lato , the newly-elected head of the polish soccer federation -lrb- pzpn -rrb- , immediately began courting controversy after his appointment on thursday , oct .
29 by suggesting poland would turn to germany as its co-host for euro 2012 should original co-organizers ukraine prove incapable .
lato , a legendary player and top scorer at the 1974 world cup , took over from michal listkiewicz as president of the ailing pzpn , taking on the role of his country 's top official overseeing the run-up to poland 's first ever hosting of the european championships .
lato was voted in at a gathering of 113 pzpn delegates in warsaw after listkiewicz stepped down amid a corruption investigation .
" germany could join it -lrb- the plan to organize euro 2012 -rrb- , " lato told polish television when asked him what could happen should ukraine be unable to honor their original commitment .
lato added , however , that poland would be able to organize the tournament itself should it need to but expressed his hope that " ukraine would be able to finish the preparations in time . "
lato 's comments were described as " harmful " to the project by poland 's interior minister grzegorz schetyna and that the championship was a " mutual project and has a chance only when we treat it as such . "
ukraine feeling the pinch bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : grigori surkis , president of the ukraine fa , in happier times ukraine 's euro 2012 plans had earlier been thrown into doubt by a statement by its tournament organizer evgeny villinsky who said financial problems had meant ukraine 's preparations to host the tournament had come to a halt .
according to the interfax-ukraine news agency , villinsky added that the global financial crisis and ill-advised management were the reasons for the stopping of preparatory work .
the statement hinting at a cooperation agreement with germany added to the unease in certain circles over lato 's appointment the former striker quickly came under fire after being named pzpn president , mainly from politicians who claimed he was not up to the task of ridding polish soccer of corruption .
slawomir nowak , top aide to polish prime minister donald tusk , said that lato 's appointment was an obvious defeat for those who had ideas to improve the organization .
" this probably is n't the best news for polish soccer , " he told radio zet .
" we 'll have to wait longer for the process and cleaning up ... of polish soccer . "
interior minister schetyna told the polish press agency that lato was a " step backwards " for the federation , and that pzpn should " open itself to new solutions and new people , and this is n't happening . "
elzbieta jakubiak , head of a parliament sports commission , said lato wo n't make the needed changes as head of pzpn .
lato said he would resign in a year if the organization made no improvement , and called on other officials to work together and make euro 2012 " our shared success . "
polish corruption causing tensions bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : games in poland are suspected of being fixed the new pzpn president takes over at time of unprecedented tension between the government , the national soccer federation and world soccer 's governing body , fifa .
the sports ministry recently made a motion to suspend pzpn officials in an effort to clamp down on corruption , but fifa warned poland would lose upcoming world cup qualifying games and rights to euro 2012 unless it reinstated the officials .
fifa , which does n't tolerate political interference in soccer issues , withdrew the ultimatum after a letter from the ministry that showed a " positive evolution " in the situation .
the investigation into polish soccer was launched in may 2005 , and so far has charged nearly 100 people including referees , officials and federation members .
justice minister zbigniew cwiakalski said on friday there will " certainly " be more charges in the ongoing investigation that looks at years 2003 and 2004 .
" there were entire rounds that were fixed in certain clubs , " cwiakalski told polish radio .
" all the matches - one by one - were decided before they took place . "
cwiakalski said he did n't have proof that the pzpn was involved in the corruption , but admitted he could n't imagine " professionals did n't know about something that took place on a large scale in their surroundings .

in august the stock had hovered near 200 euros . deutsche boerse , the company running the exchange , this week ordered volkswagen 's market capitalization weighting reduced from 27 to 10 per cent in the 30-share dax . beefing up that rule friday , it said a stock would be dropped completely from the index if its capitalization exceeded 10 per cent of the dax at the close of a day 's trading or if its 30-day volatility exceeded 250 per cent . that would imply reducing the index to 29 shares , taking pressure off index-tracker investment funds which attempt to mimic the changes in the index .
the rules also apply to two other indexes , the mdax and sdax . normally the indexes are only reshuffled on certain fixed dates every few months . protests by funds the rule change came after protests from funds that the situation was unfair .
there have also been calls for german law to be changed so that companies such as porsche would have to disclose their positions earlier . the shortage of volkswagen stock drove hedge funds to desperately buy the shares this week almost regardless of price .
porsche said later it would release some options to ease the price . on a day when most other stocks plunged , volkswagen rose and the dax as a result closed 10 per cent higher . dpa news agency -lrb- sp -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

john clancy , a spokesman for eu development and humanitarian aid commissioner louis michel , said : " presidents kabila and kagame have given their agreement to commissioner michel to attend such an international summit . "
in a statement in kinshasa on friday , michel called for a summit to be held in nairobi , bringing together regional leaders and international organisations , to resolve the conflict in the east of congo .
the eastern congolese city of goma has become the epicenter of a humanitarian tragedy after tens of thousands of people fled an offensive by rebels of the national congress for the defense of the people that routed government forces in nord-kivu province . europe launches diplomatic drive europe on friday reasserted its commitment to diplomacy and political solutions to the violence in congo but ruled out a troop deployment to reinforce overstretched un forces in the region .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : kouchner warned of leaving action until it was too late france , which holds the rotating eu presidency , has proposed sending up to 1,500 european troops on a humanitarian mission to goma but britain and germany have voiced serious reservations .
while calling for an increase in troops , french foreign minister bernhard kouchner and eu foreign policy chief javier solana agreed the priority should be placed on providing aid , not fighting rebels .
kouchner added that while military personnel would likely make up the force , its mission would be to help refugees . " this response in our point of view should be humanitarian ... the name of these tactical groups - battlegroups - should not lead you to imagine that we are going to send troops to fight alongside the monuc , " he said , referring to the 17,000-strong un peacekeeping force already in congo . kouchner said the eu force would only be a small element of a larger , political solution between warring parties in congo and neighboring states . germany questions expanding eu deployment but germany remains opposed to the idea of an eu force .
german government spokesman jens ploetner said on friday that a 17,000-strong un mission , monuc , was already on the ground and said a deployment of eu troops could have " consequences for the credibility of monuc in the long run . " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : german foreign minister steinmeier called for rwanda 's help in the drc " those who hastily say that the existing mission is insufficient must expect that that will have consequences once monuc is back to carrying out its mission alone , " he said . german development minister heidemarie wieczorek-zeul reinforced german doubts by also questioning the logic behind increasing the eu presence in drc . " i personally can ’ t judge whether a special eu contingent is required to help restore peace in the drc , whether german troops should be part of such a mission , or whether a larger monuc force will do , " she said thursday .
" but violence has to stop as soon as possible .
the international community can not afford to sit back and simply watch once again . " kouchner , miliband to head to congo france 's foreign minister bernard kouchner and his british counterpart david miliband were preparing to head to strife-torn democratic republic of congo and rwanda on friday . kouchner 's spokesman , eric chevallier , told reporters in paris that the pair would visit the congolese capital kinshasa and the eastern city of goma , which is besieged by rebel forces .
officials confirmed they would also go to rwanda . " the mission will have several goals , " chevallier said .
" the first is to carry a clear political message from europe to demand that the situation stabilizes and the different actors agree to talk to each other more . bildunterschrift : tens of thousands of displaced people are fleeing the fighting in congo " the second is to get an update on the situation of the civilian population .
europe has decided to make an important contribution to the humanitarian effort in goma . " thirdly , we will evaluate the security situation .
in this regard , the goal is to study the security dynamic on the ground , " he added . french fm warns of unprecedented african " massacre " before leaving for drc , kouchner said the eastern region of the country is the scene of a " massacre " on a scale rarely seen in africa . " this is a massacre such as africa has probably never seen , which is taking place virtually before our eyes , " kouchner told europe 1 radio .
" it is out of the question that we let this happen . " a foreign office spokesman , commenting before miliband left for congo said that the eu delegation was " not going to set unrealistic ambitions for the visit but the fact that they are going illustrates the level of concern . " the eu delegation " will impress upon the leaders of both countries the seriousness of the situation in eastern democratic republic of congo -lrb- and -rrb- the need to engage urgently to find a solution to the underlying problem , " he added . eu-brokered ceasefire in tatters though the european union brokered a peace treaty in january that was signed by dozens of militias , including the rebel group responsible for the 1994 genocide in neighboring rwanda , the country has slid back into conflict . fighting in recent days has led to a stand-off between rebels and the un , as the latter rushes to aid nearly 30,000 displaced persons in what un secretary-general ban ki-moon is calling a humanitarian crisis of " catastrophic dimensions . " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the fighting against the congolese army is said to have ended a ceasefire came into effect on wednesday , calming attacks , but the latest round of violence had already provoked a crisis for aid agencies , some of whom have moved operations across the border to rwanda . eu frees up funding for aid the european commission responded to reports of the aid crisis thursday by saying it would give 4 million euros -lrb- $ 5.2 million -rrb- in emergency assistance to help the democratic republic of congo to cope with the conflict in its troubled east . " we are facing a critical humanitarian situation , " spokesman john clancy told journalists in brussels .
" the commission can announce emergency financial aid of a total 4 million euros . " he said 12 million of the 514 million euros earmarked for the country under the european commission 's 2008-2013 spending plans would specifically go towards helping the population of the war-torn east . germany has reportedly contributed 67.5 million euros to monuc in 2008 and just increased its humanitarian aid for drc to 5.7 million euros . dw staff -lrb- cat / nda -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

analysts had also expected inflation to come in at 3.2 percent in october . another reduction in borrowing costs by the ecb would also form part of a new wave of rate cuts by the world 's leading central banks with the us federal reserve on wednesday joining the monetary authorities in norway and china in reducing the cost of money .

" i consider possible that the governing council will decrease interest rates once again at its next meeting on nov .

" it is not a certainty , it is a possibility , " he said .
analysts believe the grim economic outlook combined with dwindling inflation gives the ecb scope to follow up the 50-basis cut it delivered in july as part of a coordinated action by the world 's leading central banks to shore up the global economy with another 50-basis points cut next thursday .

the new polish soccer chief is already considering other options . former polish soccer great grzegorz lato , the newly-elected head of the polish soccer federation -lrb- pzpn -rrb- , immediately began courting controversy after his appointment on thursday , oct .
29 by suggesting poland would turn to germany as its co-host for euro 2012 should original co-organizers ukraine prove incapable .
lato , a legendary player and top scorer at the 1974 world cup , took over from michal listkiewicz as president of the ailing pzpn , taking on the role of his country 's top official overseeing the run-up to poland 's first ever hosting of the european championships .
lato was voted in at a gathering of 113 pzpn delegates in warsaw after listkiewicz stepped down amid a corruption investigation .
" germany could join it -lrb- the plan to organize euro 2012 -rrb- , " lato told polish television when asked him what could happen should ukraine be unable to honor their original commitment .
lato added , however , that poland would be able to organize the tournament itself should it need to but expressed his hope that " ukraine would be able to finish the preparations in time . "
lato 's comments were described as " harmful " to the project by poland 's interior minister grzegorz schetyna and that the championship was a " mutual project and has a chance only when we treat it as such . "
ukraine feeling the pinch bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : grigori surkis , president of the ukraine fa , in happier times ukraine 's euro 2012 plans had earlier been thrown into doubt by a statement by its tournament organizer evgeny villinsky who said financial problems had meant ukraine 's preparations to host the tournament had come to a halt .
according to the interfax-ukraine news agency , villinsky added that the global financial crisis and ill-advised management were the reasons for the stopping of preparatory work .
the statement hinting at a cooperation agreement with germany added to the unease in certain circles over lato 's appointment the former striker quickly came under fire after being named pzpn president , mainly from politicians who claimed he was not up to the task of ridding polish soccer of corruption .
slawomir nowak , top aide to polish prime minister donald tusk , said that lato 's appointment was an obvious defeat for those who had ideas to improve the organization .
" this probably is n't the best news for polish soccer , " he told radio zet .
" we 'll have to wait longer for the process and cleaning up ... of polish soccer . "
interior minister schetyna told the polish press agency that lato was a " step backwards " for the federation , and that pzpn should " open itself to new solutions and new people , and this is n't happening . "
elzbieta jakubiak , head of a parliament sports commission , said lato wo n't make the needed changes as head of pzpn .
lato said he would resign in a year if the organization made no improvement , and called on other officials to work together and make euro 2012 " our shared success . "
polish corruption causing tensions bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : games in poland are suspected of being fixed the new pzpn president takes over at time of unprecedented tension between the government , the national soccer federation and world soccer 's governing body , fifa .
the sports ministry recently made a motion to suspend pzpn officials in an effort to clamp down on corruption , but fifa warned poland would lose upcoming world cup qualifying games and rights to euro 2012 unless it reinstated the officials .
fifa , which does n't tolerate political interference in soccer issues , withdrew the ultimatum after a letter from the ministry that showed a " positive evolution " in the situation .
the investigation into polish soccer was launched in may 2005 , and so far has charged nearly 100 people including referees , officials and federation members .
justice minister zbigniew cwiakalski said on friday there will " certainly " be more charges in the ongoing investigation that looks at years 2003 and 2004 .
" there were entire rounds that were fixed in certain clubs , " cwiakalski told polish radio .
" all the matches - one by one - were decided before they took place . "
cwiakalski said he did n't have proof that the pzpn was involved in the corruption , but admitted he could n't imagine " professionals did n't know about something that took place on a large scale in their surroundings .

john clancy , a spokesman for eu development and humanitarian aid commissioner louis michel , said : " presidents kabila and kagame have given their agreement to commissioner michel to attend such an international summit . "
in a statement in kinshasa on friday , michel called for a summit to be held in nairobi , bringing together regional leaders and international organisations , to resolve the conflict in the east of congo .
the eastern congolese city of goma has become the epicenter of a humanitarian tragedy after tens of thousands of people fled an offensive by rebels of the national congress for the defense of the people that routed government forces in nord-kivu province . europe launches diplomatic drive europe on friday reasserted its commitment to diplomacy and political solutions to the violence in congo but ruled out a troop deployment to reinforce overstretched un forces in the region .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : kouchner warned of leaving action until it was too late france , which holds the rotating eu presidency , has proposed sending up to 1,500 european troops on a humanitarian mission to goma but britain and germany have voiced serious reservations .
while calling for an increase in troops , french foreign minister bernhard kouchner and eu foreign policy chief javier solana agreed the priority should be placed on providing aid , not fighting rebels .
kouchner added that while military personnel would likely make up the force , its mission would be to help refugees . " this response in our point of view should be humanitarian ... the name of these tactical groups - battlegroups - should not lead you to imagine that we are going to send troops to fight alongside the monuc , " he said , referring to the 17,000-strong un peacekeeping force already in congo . kouchner said the eu force would only be a small element of a larger , political solution between warring parties in congo and neighboring states . germany questions expanding eu deployment but germany remains opposed to the idea of an eu force .
german government spokesman jens ploetner said on friday that a 17,000-strong un mission , monuc , was already on the ground and said a deployment of eu troops could have " consequences for the credibility of monuc in the long run . " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : german foreign minister steinmeier called for rwanda 's help in the drc " those who hastily say that the existing mission is insufficient must expect that that will have consequences once monuc is back to carrying out its mission alone , " he said . german development minister heidemarie wieczorek-zeul reinforced german doubts by also questioning the logic behind increasing the eu presence in drc . " i personally can ’ t judge whether a special eu contingent is required to help restore peace in the drc , whether german troops should be part of such a mission , or whether a larger monuc force will do , " she said thursday .
" but violence has to stop as soon as possible .
the international community can not afford to sit back and simply watch once again . " kouchner , miliband to head to congo france 's foreign minister bernard kouchner and his british counterpart david miliband were preparing to head to strife-torn democratic republic of congo and rwanda on friday . kouchner 's spokesman , eric chevallier , told reporters in paris that the pair would visit the congolese capital kinshasa and the eastern city of goma , which is besieged by rebel forces .
officials confirmed they would also go to rwanda . " the mission will have several goals , " chevallier said .
" the first is to carry a clear political message from europe to demand that the situation stabilizes and the different actors agree to talk to each other more . bildunterschrift : tens of thousands of displaced people are fleeing the fighting in congo " the second is to get an update on the situation of the civilian population .
europe has decided to make an important contribution to the humanitarian effort in goma . " thirdly , we will evaluate the security situation .
in this regard , the goal is to study the security dynamic on the ground , " he added . french fm warns of unprecedented african " massacre " before leaving for drc , kouchner said the eastern region of the country is the scene of a " massacre " on a scale rarely seen in africa . " this is a massacre such as africa has probably never seen , which is taking place virtually before our eyes , " kouchner told europe 1 radio .
" it is out of the question that we let this happen . " a foreign office spokesman , commenting before miliband left for congo said that the eu delegation was " not going to set unrealistic ambitions for the visit but the fact that they are going illustrates the level of concern . " the eu delegation " will impress upon the leaders of both countries the seriousness of the situation in eastern democratic republic of congo -lrb- and -rrb- the need to engage urgently to find a solution to the underlying problem , " he added . eu-brokered ceasefire in tatters though the european union brokered a peace treaty in january that was signed by dozens of militias , including the rebel group responsible for the 1994 genocide in neighboring rwanda , the country has slid back into conflict . fighting in recent days has led to a stand-off between rebels and the un , as the latter rushes to aid nearly 30,000 displaced persons in what un secretary-general ban ki-moon is calling a humanitarian crisis of " catastrophic dimensions . " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the fighting against the congolese army is said to have ended a ceasefire came into effect on wednesday , calming attacks , but the latest round of violence had already provoked a crisis for aid agencies , some of whom have moved operations across the border to rwanda . eu frees up funding for aid the european commission responded to reports of the aid crisis thursday by saying it would give 4 million euros -lrb- $ 5.2 million -rrb- in emergency assistance to help the democratic republic of congo to cope with the conflict in its troubled east . " we are facing a critical humanitarian situation , " spokesman john clancy told journalists in brussels .
" the commission can announce emergency financial aid of a total 4 million euros . " he said 12 million of the 514 million euros earmarked for the country under the european commission 's 2008-2013 spending plans would specifically go towards helping the population of the war-torn east . germany has reportedly contributed 67.5 million euros to monuc in 2008 and just increased its humanitarian aid for drc to 5.7 million euros . dw staff -lrb- cat / nda -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de opinion -pipe- 31.10.2008 opinion : drop in unemployment a temporary snap-shot großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the number of unemployed people in germany has sunk below three million for the first time since november 1992 .
but although it 's a nice snap-shot , the worst is yet to come , says dw 's rolf wenkel . despite the financial crisis and an economic slowdown , the number of people without jobs in october decreased by 84,000 to 2.997 million .
in comparison to september , the unemployment rate sank by 0.2 percent to 7.2 percent , according to a statement from the federal employment office that was released in on thursday , oct .
30 in nuremberg .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the job market statisticians have provided us with some good news : for the first time in 16 years , the number of unemployed people has dipped below the symbolic number of three million .
but experts predict this will be the last positive surprise that can be expected from the job market for a long time .
after all , the job market has a delayed reaction of several months when it comes to economic changes .
everyone is saying that the financial crisis will spill over into the real economy .
the economics research institute and the economics minster have drastically lowered their growth prognoses .
this surely holds consequences for the employment market .
the only question is how serious the impact will be .
in the best-case scenario , the impressive job creation of recent years will simply come to a stand-still and the unemployment rate will stagnate .
in the worst-case scenario , reduced working hours , which are now being implemented in the automobile industry , wo n't do the trick .
if companies have their backs up against a wall , jobs will be cuts and the unemployment rate will increase significantly once again .
but there 's a lot to be said for the fact that the german job market is better equipped for a dreary global economic condition this time around .
in the past , each external shock on the job market would mean another blow to unemployment . as much as some unions and socio-politicians may despise them , the job market reforms from the 2010 agenda have made the german employment market significantly more robust and flexible – and they 've paved the way for impressive success .
almost 250,000 new jobs have been created since 2004 , and by no means only in the low wage sector .
unemployment decreased by 22 percent between 2004 and 2007 .
the cost of unemployment for public funds decreased in the same time period to just under 25 million euros -lrb- $ 31.7 million -rrb- , or 27 percent .
a demographic factor also comes into play : germany is getting older and fewer new generations are coming out of schools and universities .
in this year alone , approximately 80,000 fewer people entered the job market as in the previous year .
many went into retirement . the nuremberg institute for job market and career research estimates that this number will be at 130,000 next year .
that 's a number which significantly reduces the size of the job market , even if the financial crisis penetrates the real economy harder than we can imagine it doing today .
and there is another argument that suggests the looming recession might only put a small damper on the job market .
the lack of skilled workers has persuaded many companies to rethink their strategies .
they now think similarly to the way medium-sized machine manufacturers have been for a long time .
these manufacturers have been used to extreme economic vacillations in their branch for years and carry their employees with them through bad times because they know that when things improve , they 'll need their workers again .
those who are quick to lay-off employees will have difficulties later , because skilled workers are both costly and difficult to find .
perhaps this can also be a model for the future of listed companies in the course of the cleanup following the financial crisis .
this could be a time when disastrous things like shareholder value and pure thought in the quarterly results are challenged and neatly trimmed down .
in any case , it would be nice .

in the past , each external shock on the job market would mean another blow to unemployment . as much as some unions and socio-politicians may despise them , the job market reforms from the 2010 agenda have made the german employment market significantly more robust and flexible – and they 've paved the way for impressive success .
almost 250,000 new jobs have been created since 2004 , and by no means only in the low wage sector .
unemployment decreased by 22 percent between 2004 and 2007 .
the cost of unemployment for public funds decreased in the same time period to just under 25 million euros -lrb- $ 31.7 million -rrb- , or 27 percent .
a demographic factor also comes into play : germany is getting older and fewer new generations are coming out of schools and universities .
in this year alone , approximately 80,000 fewer people entered the job market as in the previous year .
many went into retirement . the nuremberg institute for job market and career research estimates that this number will be at 130,000 next year .
that 's a number which significantly reduces the size of the job market , even if the financial crisis penetrates the real economy harder than we can imagine it doing today .
and there is another argument that suggests the looming recession might only put a small damper on the job market .
the lack of skilled workers has persuaded many companies to rethink their strategies .
they now think similarly to the way medium-sized machine manufacturers have been for a long time .
these manufacturers have been used to extreme economic vacillations in their branch for years and carry their employees with them through bad times because they know that when things improve , they 'll need their workers again .
those who are quick to lay-off employees will have difficulties later , because skilled workers are both costly and difficult to find .
perhaps this can also be a model for the future of listed companies in the course of the cleanup following the financial crisis .
this could be a time when disastrous things like shareholder value and pure thought in the quarterly results are challenged and neatly trimmed down .
in any case , it would be nice .

the airport played a central role in berlin 's history , but its future remains unclear . the night of wednesday was the last time people not flying to or from tempelhof were be allowed in the building , and the final take-offs followed one day later , marked by a farewell gala . supporters of the airport tried to save it , but a public referendum in april 2008 that would have called for its preservation failed to attract enough votes . the city of berlin and the german government , who own tempelhof , have wanted to close it for years , citing costs and declining passenger numbers .
last year a mere 350,000 passengers flew through tempelhof , compared with 19 million for berlin 's two other airports . but many people still feel very passionate about tempelhof .

it was then replaced in that function by the more modern tegel airport since its relatively short runways precluded larger passengers planes from taking off or landing . but tempelhof reopened to commercial passengers in 1985 and was used mostly by short-haul business commuters and vacationers . plans to permanently shut tempelhof began gaining momentum in 1996 , and the city of berlin and the city 's airport holding company estimate that it has run between 10 million and 15 million euros -lrb- $ 12.7 million and $ 19 million -rrb- in the red every year . berlin is hoping to build a massive new airport on the city 's eastern fringe by 2011 . uncertain future bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : a film studio may take over part of tempelhof 's unique architecture no one knows what will become of the more 3.5-million-square-meter site when planes no longer take off and land there . there has been talk of using parts of the main terminal building for a cultural forum , and the film studios in nearby babelsberg have also discussed using the facility for shooting movies and producing and storing props and costumes . the external grounds could be converted into a park and / or developed as housing property .
the city of berlin plans to stage an open competition to solicit ideas for how the site should be used and is currently having the tempelhof complex surveyed to determine its exact value . but delays in utilizing tempelhof are themselves costly .

the liquidity guarantee is expected to be in place by mid-november , a hre statement said .
while other regional banks in germany have said they are considering requesting help from the government 's rescue plan for the banking sector , including bayernlb which has applied for 5.4 billion euros -lrb- $ 6.8 billion -rrb- in aid , hre is the first private german financial institution to take advantage of the rescue package .
the german government revealed the rescue package , which includes 400 billion euros in loan guarantees and up to 80 billion euros in capital injections , earlier this month .
hre bailout the biggest in german history bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : hre was just one of a number of high-profile casualties hre is already the subject of a rescue plan worked out by the government , the german central bank and a financing consortium that 's worth 50 billion euros .
the short-term guarantee unveiled late on thursday will keep hre going until the full sum is available .
the real-estate lender became the subject of the biggest financial rescue in german history earlier this month after its inability to refinance the debts of its depfa subsidiary dragged it into the global financial turmoil .
the german-irish subsidiary , which specializes in financing of public works projects , was acquired by hre in october 2007 . dw staff -lrb- nda -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de opinion -pipe- 31.10.2008 opinion : drop in unemployment a temporary snap-shot großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the number of unemployed people in germany has sunk below three million for the first time since november 1992 .
but although it 's a nice snap-shot , the worst is yet to come , says dw 's rolf wenkel . despite the financial crisis and an economic slowdown , the number of people without jobs in october decreased by 84,000 to 2.997 million .
in comparison to september , the unemployment rate sank by 0.2 percent to 7.2 percent , according to a statement from the federal employment office that was released in on thursday , oct .
30 in nuremberg .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the job market statisticians have provided us with some good news : for the first time in 16 years , the number of unemployed people has dipped below the symbolic number of three million .
but experts predict this will be the last positive surprise that can be expected from the job market for a long time .
after all , the job market has a delayed reaction of several months when it comes to economic changes .
everyone is saying that the financial crisis will spill over into the real economy .
the economics research institute and the economics minster have drastically lowered their growth prognoses .
this surely holds consequences for the employment market .
the only question is how serious the impact will be .
in the best-case scenario , the impressive job creation of recent years will simply come to a stand-still and the unemployment rate will stagnate .
in the worst-case scenario , reduced working hours , which are now being implemented in the automobile industry , wo n't do the trick .
if companies have their backs up against a wall , jobs will be cuts and the unemployment rate will increase significantly once again .
but there 's a lot to be said for the fact that the german job market is better equipped for a dreary global economic condition this time around .
in the past , each external shock on the job market would mean another blow to unemployment . as much as some unions and socio-politicians may despise them , the job market reforms from the 2010 agenda have made the german employment market significantly more robust and flexible – and they 've paved the way for impressive success .
almost 250,000 new jobs have been created since 2004 , and by no means only in the low wage sector .
unemployment decreased by 22 percent between 2004 and 2007 .
the cost of unemployment for public funds decreased in the same time period to just under 25 million euros -lrb- $ 31.7 million -rrb- , or 27 percent .
a demographic factor also comes into play : germany is getting older and fewer new generations are coming out of schools and universities .
in this year alone , approximately 80,000 fewer people entered the job market as in the previous year .
many went into retirement . the nuremberg institute for job market and career research estimates that this number will be at 130,000 next year .
that 's a number which significantly reduces the size of the job market , even if the financial crisis penetrates the real economy harder than we can imagine it doing today .
and there is another argument that suggests the looming recession might only put a small damper on the job market .
the lack of skilled workers has persuaded many companies to rethink their strategies .
they now think similarly to the way medium-sized machine manufacturers have been for a long time .
these manufacturers have been used to extreme economic vacillations in their branch for years and carry their employees with them through bad times because they know that when things improve , they 'll need their workers again .
those who are quick to lay-off employees will have difficulties later , because skilled workers are both costly and difficult to find .
perhaps this can also be a model for the future of listed companies in the course of the cleanup following the financial crisis .
this could be a time when disastrous things like shareholder value and pure thought in the quarterly results are challenged and neatly trimmed down .
in any case , it would be nice .

the new polish soccer chief is already considering other options . former polish soccer great grzegorz lato , the newly-elected head of the polish soccer federation -lrb- pzpn -rrb- , immediately began courting controversy after his appointment on thursday , oct .
29 by suggesting poland would turn to germany as its co-host for euro 2012 should original co-organizers ukraine prove incapable .
lato , a legendary player and top scorer at the 1974 world cup , took over from michal listkiewicz as president of the ailing pzpn , taking on the role of his country 's top official overseeing the run-up to poland 's first ever hosting of the european championships .
lato was voted in at a gathering of 113 pzpn delegates in warsaw after listkiewicz stepped down amid a corruption investigation .
" germany could join it -lrb- the plan to organize euro 2012 -rrb- , " lato told polish television when asked him what could happen should ukraine be unable to honor their original commitment .
lato added , however , that poland would be able to organize the tournament itself should it need to but expressed his hope that " ukraine would be able to finish the preparations in time . "
lato 's comments were described as " harmful " to the project by poland 's interior minister grzegorz schetyna and that the championship was a " mutual project and has a chance only when we treat it as such . "
ukraine feeling the pinch bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : grigori surkis , president of the ukraine fa , in happier times ukraine 's euro 2012 plans had earlier been thrown into doubt by a statement by its tournament organizer evgeny villinsky who said financial problems had meant ukraine 's preparations to host the tournament had come to a halt .
according to the interfax-ukraine news agency , villinsky added that the global financial crisis and ill-advised management were the reasons for the stopping of preparatory work .
the statement hinting at a cooperation agreement with germany added to the unease in certain circles over lato 's appointment the former striker quickly came under fire after being named pzpn president , mainly from politicians who claimed he was not up to the task of ridding polish soccer of corruption .
slawomir nowak , top aide to polish prime minister donald tusk , said that lato 's appointment was an obvious defeat for those who had ideas to improve the organization .
" this probably is n't the best news for polish soccer , " he told radio zet .
" we 'll have to wait longer for the process and cleaning up ... of polish soccer . "
interior minister schetyna told the polish press agency that lato was a " step backwards " for the federation , and that pzpn should " open itself to new solutions and new people , and this is n't happening . "
elzbieta jakubiak , head of a parliament sports commission , said lato wo n't make the needed changes as head of pzpn .
lato said he would resign in a year if the organization made no improvement , and called on other officials to work together and make euro 2012 " our shared success . "
polish corruption causing tensions bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : games in poland are suspected of being fixed the new pzpn president takes over at time of unprecedented tension between the government , the national soccer federation and world soccer 's governing body , fifa .
the sports ministry recently made a motion to suspend pzpn officials in an effort to clamp down on corruption , but fifa warned poland would lose upcoming world cup qualifying games and rights to euro 2012 unless it reinstated the officials .
fifa , which does n't tolerate political interference in soccer issues , withdrew the ultimatum after a letter from the ministry that showed a " positive evolution " in the situation .
the investigation into polish soccer was launched in may 2005 , and so far has charged nearly 100 people including referees , officials and federation members .
justice minister zbigniew cwiakalski said on friday there will " certainly " be more charges in the ongoing investigation that looks at years 2003 and 2004 .
" there were entire rounds that were fixed in certain clubs , " cwiakalski told polish radio .
" all the matches - one by one - were decided before they took place . "
cwiakalski said he did n't have proof that the pzpn was involved in the corruption , but admitted he could n't imagine " professionals did n't know about something that took place on a large scale in their surroundings .

the new polish soccer chief is already considering other options . former polish soccer great grzegorz lato , the newly-elected head of the polish soccer federation -lrb- pzpn -rrb- , immediately began courting controversy after his appointment on thursday , oct .
29 by suggesting poland would turn to germany as its co-host for euro 2012 should original co-organizers ukraine prove incapable .
lato , a legendary player and top scorer at the 1974 world cup , took over from michal listkiewicz as president of the ailing pzpn , taking on the role of his country 's top official overseeing the run-up to poland 's first ever hosting of the european championships .
lato was voted in at a gathering of 113 pzpn delegates in warsaw after listkiewicz stepped down amid a corruption investigation .
" germany could join it -lrb- the plan to organize euro 2012 -rrb- , " lato told polish television when asked him what could happen should ukraine be unable to honor their original commitment .
lato added , however , that poland would be able to organize the tournament itself should it need to but expressed his hope that " ukraine would be able to finish the preparations in time . "
lato 's comments were described as " harmful " to the project by poland 's interior minister grzegorz schetyna and that the championship was a " mutual project and has a chance only when we treat it as such . "
ukraine feeling the pinch bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : grigori surkis , president of the ukraine fa , in happier times ukraine 's euro 2012 plans had earlier been thrown into doubt by a statement by its tournament organizer evgeny villinsky who said financial problems had meant ukraine 's preparations to host the tournament had come to a halt .
according to the interfax-ukraine news agency , villinsky added that the global financial crisis and ill-advised management were the reasons for the stopping of preparatory work .
the statement hinting at a cooperation agreement with germany added to the unease in certain circles over lato 's appointment the former striker quickly came under fire after being named pzpn president , mainly from politicians who claimed he was not up to the task of ridding polish soccer of corruption .
slawomir nowak , top aide to polish prime minister donald tusk , said that lato 's appointment was an obvious defeat for those who had ideas to improve the organization .
" this probably is n't the best news for polish soccer , " he told radio zet .
" we 'll have to wait longer for the process and cleaning up ... of polish soccer . "
interior minister schetyna told the polish press agency that lato was a " step backwards " for the federation , and that pzpn should " open itself to new solutions and new people , and this is n't happening . "
elzbieta jakubiak , head of a parliament sports commission , said lato wo n't make the needed changes as head of pzpn .
lato said he would resign in a year if the organization made no improvement , and called on other officials to work together and make euro 2012 " our shared success . "
polish corruption causing tensions bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : games in poland are suspected of being fixed the new pzpn president takes over at time of unprecedented tension between the government , the national soccer federation and world soccer 's governing body , fifa .
the sports ministry recently made a motion to suspend pzpn officials in an effort to clamp down on corruption , but fifa warned poland would lose upcoming world cup qualifying games and rights to euro 2012 unless it reinstated the officials .
fifa , which does n't tolerate political interference in soccer issues , withdrew the ultimatum after a letter from the ministry that showed a " positive evolution " in the situation .
the investigation into polish soccer was launched in may 2005 , and so far has charged nearly 100 people including referees , officials and federation members .
justice minister zbigniew cwiakalski said on friday there will " certainly " be more charges in the ongoing investigation that looks at years 2003 and 2004 .
" there were entire rounds that were fixed in certain clubs , " cwiakalski told polish radio .
" all the matches - one by one - were decided before they took place . "
cwiakalski said he did n't have proof that the pzpn was involved in the corruption , but admitted he could n't imagine " professionals did n't know about something that took place on a large scale in their surroundings .

ballack , 32 , said : " i realize it was not ok to go public .
i regret that this led to the impression that i wanted to criticise joachim loew in his position as coach , " the skipper said .
" i apologized to joachim loew .
he is the coach , he makes the decisions and we have to respect them . "
the chelsea midfielder had spoken out in the frankfurter allgemeine zeitung daily last week , expressing his dissent that loew benched his long-time midfield partner torsten frings at two world cup qualifiers .
ballack said that loew did not show enough respect for veteran germany players , but loew insisted that no player is guaranteed of a place in the starting 11 .
ballack apologized on the weekend but loew insisted on a meeting between the two in germany .
with chelsea 's consent , the currently injured ballack flew to frankfurt in a private jet on thursday and returned to london immediately afterwards .
" he knows that he can raise every issue internally .

john clancy , a spokesman for eu development and humanitarian aid commissioner louis michel , said : " presidents kabila and kagame have given their agreement to commissioner michel to attend such an international summit . "
in a statement in kinshasa on friday , michel called for a summit to be held in nairobi , bringing together regional leaders and international organisations , to resolve the conflict in the east of congo .
the eastern congolese city of goma has become the epicenter of a humanitarian tragedy after tens of thousands of people fled an offensive by rebels of the national congress for the defense of the people that routed government forces in nord-kivu province . europe launches diplomatic drive europe on friday reasserted its commitment to diplomacy and political solutions to the violence in congo but ruled out a troop deployment to reinforce overstretched un forces in the region .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : kouchner warned of leaving action until it was too late france , which holds the rotating eu presidency , has proposed sending up to 1,500 european troops on a humanitarian mission to goma but britain and germany have voiced serious reservations .
while calling for an increase in troops , french foreign minister bernhard kouchner and eu foreign policy chief javier solana agreed the priority should be placed on providing aid , not fighting rebels .
kouchner added that while military personnel would likely make up the force , its mission would be to help refugees . " this response in our point of view should be humanitarian ... the name of these tactical groups - battlegroups - should not lead you to imagine that we are going to send troops to fight alongside the monuc , " he said , referring to the 17,000-strong un peacekeeping force already in congo . kouchner said the eu force would only be a small element of a larger , political solution between warring parties in congo and neighboring states . germany questions expanding eu deployment but germany remains opposed to the idea of an eu force .
german government spokesman jens ploetner said on friday that a 17,000-strong un mission , monuc , was already on the ground and said a deployment of eu troops could have " consequences for the credibility of monuc in the long run . " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : german foreign minister steinmeier called for rwanda 's help in the drc " those who hastily say that the existing mission is insufficient must expect that that will have consequences once monuc is back to carrying out its mission alone , " he said . german development minister heidemarie wieczorek-zeul reinforced german doubts by also questioning the logic behind increasing the eu presence in drc . " i personally can ’ t judge whether a special eu contingent is required to help restore peace in the drc , whether german troops should be part of such a mission , or whether a larger monuc force will do , " she said thursday .
" but violence has to stop as soon as possible .
the international community can not afford to sit back and simply watch once again . " kouchner , miliband to head to congo france 's foreign minister bernard kouchner and his british counterpart david miliband were preparing to head to strife-torn democratic republic of congo and rwanda on friday . kouchner 's spokesman , eric chevallier , told reporters in paris that the pair would visit the congolese capital kinshasa and the eastern city of goma , which is besieged by rebel forces .
officials confirmed they would also go to rwanda . " the mission will have several goals , " chevallier said .
" the first is to carry a clear political message from europe to demand that the situation stabilizes and the different actors agree to talk to each other more . bildunterschrift : tens of thousands of displaced people are fleeing the fighting in congo " the second is to get an update on the situation of the civilian population .
europe has decided to make an important contribution to the humanitarian effort in goma . " thirdly , we will evaluate the security situation .
in this regard , the goal is to study the security dynamic on the ground , " he added . french fm warns of unprecedented african " massacre " before leaving for drc , kouchner said the eastern region of the country is the scene of a " massacre " on a scale rarely seen in africa . " this is a massacre such as africa has probably never seen , which is taking place virtually before our eyes , " kouchner told europe 1 radio .
" it is out of the question that we let this happen . " a foreign office spokesman , commenting before miliband left for congo said that the eu delegation was " not going to set unrealistic ambitions for the visit but the fact that they are going illustrates the level of concern . " the eu delegation " will impress upon the leaders of both countries the seriousness of the situation in eastern democratic republic of congo -lrb- and -rrb- the need to engage urgently to find a solution to the underlying problem , " he added . eu-brokered ceasefire in tatters though the european union brokered a peace treaty in january that was signed by dozens of militias , including the rebel group responsible for the 1994 genocide in neighboring rwanda , the country has slid back into conflict . fighting in recent days has led to a stand-off between rebels and the un , as the latter rushes to aid nearly 30,000 displaced persons in what un secretary-general ban ki-moon is calling a humanitarian crisis of " catastrophic dimensions . " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the fighting against the congolese army is said to have ended a ceasefire came into effect on wednesday , calming attacks , but the latest round of violence had already provoked a crisis for aid agencies , some of whom have moved operations across the border to rwanda . eu frees up funding for aid the european commission responded to reports of the aid crisis thursday by saying it would give 4 million euros -lrb- $ 5.2 million -rrb- in emergency assistance to help the democratic republic of congo to cope with the conflict in its troubled east . " we are facing a critical humanitarian situation , " spokesman john clancy told journalists in brussels .
" the commission can announce emergency financial aid of a total 4 million euros . " he said 12 million of the 514 million euros earmarked for the country under the european commission 's 2008-2013 spending plans would specifically go towards helping the population of the war-torn east . germany has reportedly contributed 67.5 million euros to monuc in 2008 and just increased its humanitarian aid for drc to 5.7 million euros . dw staff -lrb- cat / nda -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

" this response in our point of view should be humanitarian ... the name of these tactical groups - battlegroups - should not lead you to imagine that we are going to send troops to fight alongside the monuc , " he said , referring to the 17,000-strong un peacekeeping force already in congo . kouchner said the eu force would only be a small element of a larger , political solution between warring parties in congo and neighboring states . germany questions expanding eu deployment but germany remains opposed to the idea of an eu force .
german government spokesman jens ploetner said on friday that a 17,000-strong un mission , monuc , was already on the ground and said a deployment of eu troops could have " consequences for the credibility of monuc in the long run . " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : german foreign minister steinmeier called for rwanda 's help in the drc " those who hastily say that the existing mission is insufficient must expect that that will have consequences once monuc is back to carrying out its mission alone , " he said . german development minister heidemarie wieczorek-zeul reinforced german doubts by also questioning the logic behind increasing the eu presence in drc . " i personally can ’ t judge whether a special eu contingent is required to help restore peace in the drc , whether german troops should be part of such a mission , or whether a larger monuc force will do , " she said thursday .
" but violence has to stop as soon as possible .
the international community can not afford to sit back and simply watch once again . " kouchner , miliband to head to congo france 's foreign minister bernard kouchner and his british counterpart david miliband were preparing to head to strife-torn democratic republic of congo and rwanda on friday . kouchner 's spokesman , eric chevallier , told reporters in paris that the pair would visit the congolese capital kinshasa and the eastern city of goma , which is besieged by rebel forces .
officials confirmed they would also go to rwanda . " the mission will have several goals , " chevallier said .
" the first is to carry a clear political message from europe to demand that the situation stabilizes and the different actors agree to talk to each other more . bildunterschrift : tens of thousands of displaced people are fleeing the fighting in congo " the second is to get an update on the situation of the civilian population .
europe has decided to make an important contribution to the humanitarian effort in goma . " thirdly , we will evaluate the security situation .
in this regard , the goal is to study the security dynamic on the ground , " he added . french fm warns of unprecedented african " massacre " before leaving for drc , kouchner said the eastern region of the country is the scene of a " massacre " on a scale rarely seen in africa . " this is a massacre such as africa has probably never seen , which is taking place virtually before our eyes , " kouchner told europe 1 radio .
" it is out of the question that we let this happen . " a foreign office spokesman , commenting before miliband left for congo said that the eu delegation was " not going to set unrealistic ambitions for the visit but the fact that they are going illustrates the level of concern . " the eu delegation " will impress upon the leaders of both countries the seriousness of the situation in eastern democratic republic of congo -lrb- and -rrb- the need to engage urgently to find a solution to the underlying problem , " he added . eu-brokered ceasefire in tatters though the european union brokered a peace treaty in january that was signed by dozens of militias , including the rebel group responsible for the 1994 genocide in neighboring rwanda , the country has slid back into conflict . fighting in recent days has led to a stand-off between rebels and the un , as the latter rushes to aid nearly 30,000 displaced persons in what un secretary-general ban ki-moon is calling a humanitarian crisis of " catastrophic dimensions . " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the fighting against the congolese army is said to have ended a ceasefire came into effect on wednesday , calming attacks , but the latest round of violence had already provoked a crisis for aid agencies , some of whom have moved operations across the border to rwanda . eu frees up funding for aid the european commission responded to reports of the aid crisis thursday by saying it would give 4 million euros -lrb- $ 5.2 million -rrb- in emergency assistance to help the democratic republic of congo to cope with the conflict in its troubled east . " we are facing a critical humanitarian situation , " spokesman john clancy told journalists in brussels .
" the commission can announce emergency financial aid of a total 4 million euros . " he said 12 million of the 514 million euros earmarked for the country under the european commission 's 2008-2013 spending plans would specifically go towards helping the population of the war-torn east . germany has reportedly contributed 67.5 million euros to monuc in 2008 and just increased its humanitarian aid for drc to 5.7 million euros . dw staff -lrb- cat / nda -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

the news ended speculation that ballack may resign as captain or even be stripped of this position after criticizing loew last week in a newspaper interview over his selection criteria and attitude towards players .
even his future in the team was put into question .
" michael ballack remains my captain .
but as captain he must play by the rules , " said loew .
ballack , 32 , said : " i realize it was not ok to go public .
i regret that this led to the impression that i wanted to criticise joachim loew in his position as coach , " the skipper said .
" i apologized to joachim loew .
he is the coach , he makes the decisions and we have to respect them . "
the chelsea midfielder had spoken out in the frankfurter allgemeine zeitung daily last week , expressing his dissent that loew benched his long-time midfield partner torsten frings at two world cup qualifiers .
ballack said that loew did not show enough respect for veteran germany players , but loew insisted that no player is guaranteed of a place in the starting 11 .
ballack apologized on the weekend but loew insisted on a meeting between the two in germany .
with chelsea 's consent , the currently injured ballack flew to frankfurt in a private jet on thursday and returned to london immediately afterwards .
" he knows that he can raise every issue internally .
but all decisions are made by our coaches - and i made that clear to michael , " loew said .
loew gave an indication of the seriousness of the conflict when he expressed his joy that " a great international player , who has played a main role in our success over the last years , remains available for the team and will help us meet our goals on the road to the 2010 world cup . "
ballack said : " i have no doubt after the talk with joachim loew that we can both realise our goals in the national team in a good atmosphere . "
ballack is germany 's only entry in the 23-player shortlist for the world footballer of the year award .
but he is yet to win a major international title on club or country level .
given his age , the 2010 world cup could be his last big event in germany 's colors . dpa news agency -lrb- sp -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

the millionaire adventurer was 63 when he disappeared in september 2007 while on a solo flight from a nevada ranch .
his plane was located earlier this month after a hiker handed items belonging to mr fossett to police .
dna test results on the bones - which were found on wednesday 0.5 miles -lrb- 0.8km -rrb- east of the crash site - are expected within a week .

steve fossett became the first person to circle the globe solo in a balloon in 2002 and had about 100 other world records to his name .
for more than a year after he took off from the nevada ranch there was no trace of him , despite an intensive search .
but earlier this month a hiker found identification documents belonging to the adventurer in a remote stretch of the sierra nevada mountains .
that find triggered an aerial search of the area and the wreckage was found about 0.25 miles -lrb- 0.4km -rrb- away .
a ground team flown into the area by helicopter confirmed the identity of the plane .
officials said the single-engine bellanca super decathlon seemed to have struck the mountainside head-on , which would most likely have resulted in the pilot 's instant death .
most of the fuselage had disintegrated , with engine parts scattered over a debris field stretching about 150ft -lrb- 46m -rrb- by 400ft -lrb- 122m -rrb- .

two policemen will face trial on 10 november for the murder of altantuya shaariibuu , who was blown up with explosives after being shot .
mr abdul razak has admitted to an affair with ms shaariibuu .
he is ex-aide to deputy pm najib razak , whose alleged involvement has turned the murder into a political scandal .
" i just want to go home , " mr abdul razak , who is 48 , told reporters after hugging his family .
at the time of his arrest , he was director of the malaysian strategic research centre , which was founded by mr najib in 1993 .
case collapsed high court judge mohamad zaki yasin ruled that the prosecution had failed to establish a case against mr abdul razak following a trial that began nearly two years ago .
the prosecution had tried to argue that he had ordered the woman 's murder after her demands for money became oppressive .
but after the calling of 84 prosecution witnesses , the case had collapsed .
mr najib , who is expected to become prime minister in march next year , has firmly denied repeated allegations of any links to the case , other than friendship with mr abdul razak .
unanswered questions several mysteries related to the case remain .
the explosive allegedly used is described as " military-grade " , and the two policemen still on trial were members of the elite special action squad .
they are chief inspector azilah hadri and corporal sirul azhar umar .
a private detective , p. balasubramaniam , had said in a statutory declaration that mr najib had also had an affair with ms shaariibuu .
he altered the statement the next day and then went missing .
a popular blogger , raja petra kamaruddin , made a statutory declaration and posted allegations linking the deputy prime minister to the case .
he is now behind bars under the internal security act which allows for indefinite detention without trial .
analysts say that the acquittal of mr abdul razak could take some of the pressure off mr najib , although malaysia 's cyber-community is already discussing how much mud from the trial will stick to the politically powerful .
ms shaariibuu was a highly educated mother of two , who spoke russian , english , chinese and japanese .
born in mongolia , she was raised in st petersburg and educated in beijing .

two policemen will face trial on 10 november for the murder of altantuya shaariibuu , who was blown up with explosives after being shot .
mr abdul razak has admitted to an affair with ms shaariibuu .
he is ex-aide to deputy pm najib razak , whose alleged involvement has turned the murder into a political scandal .
" i just want to go home , " mr abdul razak , who is 48 , told reporters after hugging his family .
at the time of his arrest , he was director of the malaysian strategic research centre , which was founded by mr najib in 1993 .
case collapsed high court judge mohamad zaki yasin ruled that the prosecution had failed to establish a case against mr abdul razak following a trial that began nearly two years ago .
the prosecution had tried to argue that he had ordered the woman 's murder after her demands for money became oppressive .
but after the calling of 84 prosecution witnesses , the case had collapsed .
mr najib , who is expected to become prime minister in march next year , has firmly denied repeated allegations of any links to the case , other than friendship with mr abdul razak .
unanswered questions several mysteries related to the case remain .
the explosive allegedly used is described as " military-grade " , and the two policemen still on trial were members of the elite special action squad .
they are chief inspector azilah hadri and corporal sirul azhar umar .
a private detective , p. balasubramaniam , had said in a statutory declaration that mr najib had also had an affair with ms shaariibuu .
he altered the statement the next day and then went missing .
a popular blogger , raja petra kamaruddin , made a statutory declaration and posted allegations linking the deputy prime minister to the case .
he is now behind bars under the internal security act which allows for indefinite detention without trial .
analysts say that the acquittal of mr abdul razak could take some of the pressure off mr najib , although malaysia 's cyber-community is already discussing how much mud from the trial will stick to the politically powerful .
ms shaariibuu was a highly educated mother of two , who spoke russian , english , chinese and japanese .
born in mongolia , she was raised in st petersburg and educated in beijing .

householders along lansdowne road in canton , cardiff , have been told they must pay almost £ 300 per year or see the bottom of their garden fenced off .
network rail said it wanted a " fair and sensible " solution for everyone and a " boundary line for the public " .
it said there were inconsistencies and a third of the 155 properties involved had no tenancy agreement .
people in the canton area , whose homes back on to the rail line to cardiff central station , have been able to rent the few yards of land leading to the bank which carries the track .
however , not everyone rents or uses the land , so some well-tended gardens are surrounded by overgrown shrub land .
the rail regulator held three residents ' meetings this month to explain its proposals .
it said it was trying to simplify the system after piecemeal agreements made with householders by british rail and railtrack had resulted in people paying a range of rents , while others paid none at all .
one of the options available to householders is to buy the gardens , provided a minimum of 10 adjoining properties were involved .
network rail say the current system is inconsistent and unfair to some residents if they want to rent the land , many have been told the lease will cost £ 250 per year plus vat , a total of £ 293.75 .
brenda brookman said : " it 's not as if they they can use it , they 're just trying to squeeze money out of us . "
mrs brookman , 69 , said she paid £ 15 a year to british rail for a number of years .
but after the rail firm was privatised she said this rent became index-linked and she now paid more than £ 40 a year .
she said : " we 've looked after it so well after all these years that you do n't want to see it anything other than tidy .
" i do n't want to buy it at my age .
they 're not going to maintain it . "
her daughter-in-law , jenny brookman , said she was happy to pay the £ 123 per year network rail was asking for but felt the firm had handled its proposals badly .
we are working towards achieving a solution that is fair and sensible for everyone network rail she said : " we 're quite devastated .
now they 're saying it can go up to £ 250 recurring yearly .
my husband 's self-employed and i 'm a part-time working mum , i just could n't afford to pay that money . "
her neighbour janet mccarthy said network rail should show more loyalty to people like her , who have rented the land for years .
" whenever i have made any improvements , i have always had the -lsb- rail -rsb- inspectors in to see that i have n't encroached on their land , " she said .
a spokesperson for network rail said 56 of the 155 properties in the lansdowne road area occupied its land without legal tenancy agreement .
she said : " we understand that the situation with each property at lansdowne is very varied and we are also sensitive to their different needs , therefore we had organised a forum with the residents to hear their views .
" the open dialogue with them has and will give us a better understanding on their interests and then help us find an optimal solution .
" we are working towards achieving a solution that is fair and sensible for everyone , while at the same time enable us to create a more effective and safer boundary line for the public . "
network rail believes the current situation is hugely inconsistent with some land occupied illegally .
some residents pay for their tenancy , while some do not , while there are also problems of fly-tipping and access to rail land .
the market rent rate is £ 500 and network rail says it has have halved the individual tenancy rent rate to £ 250 , or £ 20 a month , it has recommended a joint tenancy that can potentially cut the rate further by another 50 % .

network rail said it wanted a " fair and sensible " solution for everyone and a " boundary line for the public " .
it said there were inconsistencies and a third of the 155 properties involved had no tenancy agreement .
people in the canton area , whose homes back on to the rail line to cardiff central station , have been able to rent the few yards of land leading to the bank which carries the track .
however , not everyone rents or uses the land , so some well-tended gardens are surrounded by overgrown shrub land .
the rail regulator held three residents ' meetings this month to explain its proposals .
it said it was trying to simplify the system after piecemeal agreements made with householders by british rail and railtrack had resulted in people paying a range of rents , while others paid none at all .
one of the options available to householders is to buy the gardens , provided a minimum of 10 adjoining properties were involved .
network rail say the current system is inconsistent and unfair to some residents if they want to rent the land , many have been told the lease will cost £ 250 per year plus vat , a total of £ 293.75 .
brenda brookman said : " it 's not as if they they can use it , they 're just trying to squeeze money out of us . "
mrs brookman , 69 , said she paid £ 15 a year to british rail for a number of years .
but after the rail firm was privatised she said this rent became index-linked and she now paid more than £ 40 a year .
she said : " we 've looked after it so well after all these years that you do n't want to see it anything other than tidy .
" i do n't want to buy it at my age .
they 're not going to maintain it . "
her daughter-in-law , jenny brookman , said she was happy to pay the £ 123 per year network rail was asking for but felt the firm had handled its proposals badly .
we are working towards achieving a solution that is fair and sensible for everyone network rail she said : " we 're quite devastated .
now they 're saying it can go up to £ 250 recurring yearly .
my husband 's self-employed and i 'm a part-time working mum , i just could n't afford to pay that money . "
her neighbour janet mccarthy said network rail should show more loyalty to people like her , who have rented the land for years .
" whenever i have made any improvements , i have always had the -lsb- rail -rsb- inspectors in to see that i have n't encroached on their land , " she said .
a spokesperson for network rail said 56 of the 155 properties in the lansdowne road area occupied its land without legal tenancy agreement .
she said : " we understand that the situation with each property at lansdowne is very varied and we are also sensitive to their different needs , therefore we had organised a forum with the residents to hear their views .
" the open dialogue with them has and will give us a better understanding on their interests and then help us find an optimal solution .
" we are working towards achieving a solution that is fair and sensible for everyone , while at the same time enable us to create a more effective and safer boundary line for the public . "
network rail believes the current situation is hugely inconsistent with some land occupied illegally .
some residents pay for their tenancy , while some do not , while there are also problems of fly-tipping and access to rail land .
the market rent rate is £ 500 and network rail says it has have halved the individual tenancy rent rate to £ 250 , or £ 20 a month , it has recommended a joint tenancy that can potentially cut the rate further by another 50 % .

a chartered institute of personnel and development survey says older workers will bear the brunt of job losses .
the survey also says many employers had been hanging on , hoping the economy would pick up so they could avoid making redundancies .
cipd chief economist john philpott said interest rates should be cut further to boost business confidence .
" the onset of recession is already putting jobs at risk but many more are in the firing line as employers consider their next move in a fast deteriorating situation , " mr philpott said .
' nightmare scenario ' he called for the bank of england to cut interest rates further " to prevent a nightmare scenario for jobs " .
earlier this month , the central bank cut interest rates to 4.5 % from 5 % in a co-ordinated global move and will meet next week to decide whether to cut the cost of borrowing again .
the turmoil surrounding the banking world and subsequent turbulence in the financial markets is making for an uncertain time rachael joy , gfk nop how to negotiate during redundancy the recent economic downturn has led many employers to draw up contingency plans for job losses , the survey suggests .
a quarter of the 721 organisations surveyed said they had prepared fresh plans for redundancies , with most planning to cut any jobs by the end of january .
older workers appear to be particularly at risk .
one in five employers said they would take advantage of the rules which allow them to make workers aged over 65 redundant , without having to provide a business reason .
confidence ebbs the financial crisis and threat of job cuts is also making consumers reluctant to spend .
research company gfk nop said its consumer confidence index slipped to -36 in october from -32 in september .
" the turmoil surrounding the banking world and subsequent turbulence in the financial markets is making for an uncertain time , " said rachael joy from gfk 's consumer confidence team .
" consumers are not at all confident about buying major purchases as rising food and energy bills leave them increasingly worried about keeping up with payments . "

julia wheeler , united arab emirates dubai prides itself on its shiny image , something that the city has spent the last decade perfecting and it is not about to let all that hard work go to waste , global recession or not .
so , if anywhere can put a positive spin on economic meltdown , then dubai will have a good go .
so it was that while the rest of the world waited anxiously for news on bank bailout plans , dubai announced it would built the world 's tallest tower .
dubai is anxious to preserve its image of opulence , whatever the stocks say as housing prices were wobbling elsewhere , the huge annual property exhibition reported remaining busy and potential investors were encouraged by a survey saying real estate prices in the middle east will significantly out perform all other regions .
no-one sensible is now predicting the continuation of the exponential price increases that have been seen in dubai since it opened its property market to foreigners and there is plenty of anecdotal evidence to suggest a real estate is simply not moving .
but there is a belief it remains a decent investment for the long term - not least because rents are extortionate and the increasing number of people who have been moving to the city all need somewhere to live .
the fledgling stock markets in the gulf are volatile at the best of times and , of course , they have continued to track their more established forerunners throughout this rollercoaster of a month .
the increased volatility has shaken some , particularly those new to playing the markets .
oil prices are down , but gulf government budgets are based on far more realistic oil prices than those reached in the last year however , there was increased confidence after strategic measures by regional governments , including the united arab emirate 's guarantee on bank deposits and qatar 's moves towards supporting its banking system .
oil prices are down , but gulf government budgets are based on far more realistic oil prices than those reached in the last year .
people feel relatively protected from the effects of global recession ; their governments are holding huge budget surpluses , and this , they feel , will cushion the harsh economic effects many other countries are dreading .
return to map karishma vaswani , india the comforting words of indian politicians and financial officials - offering reassurance about the stability of the country 's economy - are now ringing a little hollow .
the truth of the matter is india has been affected by the liquidity crunch - though arguably not as badly as other parts of the world have been .
property prices in mumbai were once on a par with manhattan the downturn in the west now appears to have reached india 's shores .
the indian stock market is the most obvious and evident victim of the global credit crunch - having lost over half of its value since the crisis began - billions of dollars of foreign funds were pulled out of indian shares , as foreign fund managers scrambled to get their books in order .
concerns are growing here about a global recession and what that might mean for the 300 million strong indian middle classes .
many indian professionals have put their savings into the stock market and into mutual funds over the last few years , tempted by the spectacular returns they saw .
india 's property sector has also been bruised .
up until recently , property prices in mumbai were on par with manhattan 's , boosted by scores of foreign firms coming into the financial capital , looking to set up shop here .
the foreign money also helped to create hundreds of thousands of jobs for india 's young middle classes , who could now finally afford to realise their dream of owning their own home .
all that demand for flats and houses caused prices to soar by 40 % in some of the big cities in india last year .
but now much of that money and demand has evaporated - leaving property developers out in the cold .
already prices are down some 10-15 % , with forecasts of a bigger crash around the corner .
return to map lucy williamson , indonesia indonesia is something of a novel position .
in the midst of a global financial crisis , the largest economy in south east asia is actually doing quite well .
for a start , it has 250 million domestic consumers and a lot of its growth is driven by them - not customers abroad .
secondly , a good deal of its economy - agriculture and services , for example - is not linked to what is happening on wall street .
and neither are its banks exposed to the crisis in the way those in the major economies are .
memories of the crash in the late 1990s has left investors in indonesia jittery all this means indonesia 's economy is pretty well-insulated from the meltdown in the us .
but it is still eyeing the current financial crisis with a good deal of trepidation , and rightly so .
ingrained nervousness amongst investors here means there does not have to be much wrong for people to start panicking .
earlier this month there was panic at the stock exchange after some foreign investors began pulling their money back home , some 20 % was wiped off share prices in just a few days of trading .
that panic was largely because indonesia already knows what financial crisis feels like .
ten years ago , foreign money fled this country , and two other so-called " asian tigers " , as the exchange rate collapsed .
recovering from that blow has taken many years and billions of dollars from the international monetary fund -lrb- imf -rrb- .
but after ten years of new safeguards and banking reforms , indonesia is in a more solid position .
its economy is predicted to continue growing at around 6 % , and it 's the world 's major economies that are now facing the brunt of the storm .
return to map sarah bender , mexico " if the us economy catches a cold , mexico catches pneumonia , " the saying goes .
money sent from the us by mexican workers there rank as the country 's second largest source of foreign income .
but that money has dropped 12 % , the central bank says , due to a recession in the us construction industry , a heavy user of mexican labour .
tighter border controls and a us crackdown on illegal immigration have also played a role .
the mexican peso has fallen amid uncertainty on the markets despite these concerns , mexico 's president felipe calderon is confident that the country will not suffer the ramifications of the credit crunch , and has proposed to spend us $ 4.4 billion next year -lrb- £ 2.5bn ; 3.3bn euros -rrb- on infrastructure projects .
the labour secretary for the mexico city government , benito miron lince , has announced plans to support some 30,000 workers who are expected to return to the mexican capital because of the slowdown in the us .
officials have stated that the current unemployment insurance program , unveiled last autumn , will be broadened .
according to mr miron lince , demand for unemployment benefits has rapidly increased during the last few months .
with the wave of migrants heading back , it is becoming increasingly evident that re-adjusting to a country that was once their home is not that simple .
after spending most of their lives in the us , mexican families barely recognise relatives or their towns .
children in particular are often mocked and discriminated against by their teachers and fellow students when they pronounce their names in an american accent .
many are returning to the same grinding poverty that originally drove them out .
return to map jonah fisher , south africa with the south african economy having grown steadily for the last decade there was little temptation for banks here to invest in the us sub-prime market .
that meant the economy was largely insulated against much of the world 's financial turmoil .
" over the last couple of years it became clear that south african investors were likely to get better returns here than in the overseas market , " says goolam ballim , the chief economist from standard bank .
" so , as a consequence , our financial system has stayed stable and secure . "
but the rand is a notoriously volatile currency and , in the last week , it slumped to its lowest levels since 2001 against the us dollar .
when financial crises take place it is often emerging markets such as south africa which feel the pinch as foreign investors shift their money to safer havens .
for ordinary south africans the impact of the financial crisis is likely to be higher inflation and unemployment .
while encouraging exports , a weaker rand means that all imports into south africa cost more .
with the government committed to targeting inflation that could also mean another rise in interest rates from a current benchmark level of 12 % .
for the many south africans with loans or credit that is bad news .
steep falls in commodity prices could also mean redundancies at south africa 's many mines as global demand falls and some production becomes uneconomic .
unemployment rates of over 25 % could be set to rise again .
" with commodities like platinum down over 60 percent , lots of projects could be put on ice , " says chris hart of investment solutions .
" as that happens we 're going to see economic growth take a real hit . "
return to map emma wallis , italy italian prime minister silvio berlusconi says that running a country is like controlling a very big board meeting .
the word recession might not be good for the business of politics , but , spun in the right way , the credit crunch could enhance the pm 's political power .
silvio berlusconi is trying to steer italy away from crisis the new right-wing government likes to blame the current recession on the previous left-wing coalition .
with a different economic system and less borrowing than the uk and the us , italy should not have been affected as seriously , but its biggest and most international bank , unicredit , hit troubled waters very quickly , calling for an injection of cash from investors to the tune of nearly $ 9 billion .
it repeatedly stopped trading as its share prices fell too low .
italians have been voting with their feet , pulling their money out of shares and banks and turning to the post office for savings and bonds .
the prime minister has passed laws to inject state money into troubled banks and businesses .
the financial crisis allows silvio berlusconi to play the role of strong leader .
he has stepped in personally to reassure italian investors , has organised special emergency meetings , and when necessary has turned to rule by decree to get things done quickly .
mr berlusconi , italy 's richest man , has seen his poll ratings climb ; around 60 % of the electorate back him .
as if to prove his word is law at the moment , the failing national airline , alitalia , seems geared up for a new take-off at the beginning of november .
that just goes to show that in mr berlusconi 's italy , despite the recession , it 's business as usual .
return to map john sudworth , japan japan , in theory at least , should have been well set to weather the financial storm , following a home-grown financial crisis that began in the 1990s .
bailed out by government money , japanese financial institutions were thought to be in better health than their western counterparts .
instead the country is bracing itself for more economic pain .
vital export industries have been hit hard by the credit crunch as the american consumer can no longer borrow money to buy things like cars .
" we 're seeing events that are completely new to everybody , we 've never seen economic cycles accelerate like this before " , said a nissan executive .
some analysts believe japan may already be in recession .
stock market index boards say it all - the benchmark nikkei index has lost almost half of its value in just 12 months , with the biggest declines during the past few weeks .
with international lending frozen japan 's banks have also been growing reluctant to lend , contributing to a 30 % increase in business failures last month .
the central bank has not yet had to underwrite lending or raise deposit guarantees .
but it has injected liquidity into the system by the bucket-load and says it will continue to provide as many dollars as the banks need .
if the freeze does n't ease there is speculation that , once again , the banks might need more direct help .
meanwhile , the japanese parliament has enacted an 18 billion dollar emergency spending plan to try to stimulate the economy .
but there is a strong feeling here that this is a crisis of someone else 's making .

julia wheeler , united arab emirates dubai prides itself on its shiny image , something that the city has spent the last decade perfecting and it is not about to let all that hard work go to waste , global recession or not .
so , if anywhere can put a positive spin on economic meltdown , then dubai will have a good go .
so it was that while the rest of the world waited anxiously for news on bank bailout plans , dubai announced it would built the world 's tallest tower .
dubai is anxious to preserve its image of opulence , whatever the stocks say as housing prices were wobbling elsewhere , the huge annual property exhibition reported remaining busy and potential investors were encouraged by a survey saying real estate prices in the middle east will significantly out perform all other regions .
no-one sensible is now predicting the continuation of the exponential price increases that have been seen in dubai since it opened its property market to foreigners and there is plenty of anecdotal evidence to suggest a real estate is simply not moving .
but there is a belief it remains a decent investment for the long term - not least because rents are extortionate and the increasing number of people who have been moving to the city all need somewhere to live .
the fledgling stock markets in the gulf are volatile at the best of times and , of course , they have continued to track their more established forerunners throughout this rollercoaster of a month .
the increased volatility has shaken some , particularly those new to playing the markets .
oil prices are down , but gulf government budgets are based on far more realistic oil prices than those reached in the last year however , there was increased confidence after strategic measures by regional governments , including the united arab emirate 's guarantee on bank deposits and qatar 's moves towards supporting its banking system .
oil prices are down , but gulf government budgets are based on far more realistic oil prices than those reached in the last year .
people feel relatively protected from the effects of global recession ; their governments are holding huge budget surpluses , and this , they feel , will cushion the harsh economic effects many other countries are dreading .
return to map karishma vaswani , india the comforting words of indian politicians and financial officials - offering reassurance about the stability of the country 's economy - are now ringing a little hollow .
the truth of the matter is india has been affected by the liquidity crunch - though arguably not as badly as other parts of the world have been .
property prices in mumbai were once on a par with manhattan the downturn in the west now appears to have reached india 's shores .
the indian stock market is the most obvious and evident victim of the global credit crunch - having lost over half of its value since the crisis began - billions of dollars of foreign funds were pulled out of indian shares , as foreign fund managers scrambled to get their books in order .
concerns are growing here about a global recession and what that might mean for the 300 million strong indian middle classes .
many indian professionals have put their savings into the stock market and into mutual funds over the last few years , tempted by the spectacular returns they saw .
india 's property sector has also been bruised .
up until recently , property prices in mumbai were on par with manhattan 's , boosted by scores of foreign firms coming into the financial capital , looking to set up shop here .
the foreign money also helped to create hundreds of thousands of jobs for india 's young middle classes , who could now finally afford to realise their dream of owning their own home .
all that demand for flats and houses caused prices to soar by 40 % in some of the big cities in india last year .
but now much of that money and demand has evaporated - leaving property developers out in the cold .
already prices are down some 10-15 % , with forecasts of a bigger crash around the corner .
return to map lucy williamson , indonesia indonesia is something of a novel position .
in the midst of a global financial crisis , the largest economy in south east asia is actually doing quite well .
for a start , it has 250 million domestic consumers and a lot of its growth is driven by them - not customers abroad .
secondly , a good deal of its economy - agriculture and services , for example - is not linked to what is happening on wall street .
and neither are its banks exposed to the crisis in the way those in the major economies are .
memories of the crash in the late 1990s has left investors in indonesia jittery all this means indonesia 's economy is pretty well-insulated from the meltdown in the us .
but it is still eyeing the current financial crisis with a good deal of trepidation , and rightly so .
ingrained nervousness amongst investors here means there does not have to be much wrong for people to start panicking .
earlier this month there was panic at the stock exchange after some foreign investors began pulling their money back home , some 20 % was wiped off share prices in just a few days of trading .
that panic was largely because indonesia already knows what financial crisis feels like .
ten years ago , foreign money fled this country , and two other so-called " asian tigers " , as the exchange rate collapsed .
recovering from that blow has taken many years and billions of dollars from the international monetary fund -lrb- imf -rrb- .
but after ten years of new safeguards and banking reforms , indonesia is in a more solid position .
its economy is predicted to continue growing at around 6 % , and it 's the world 's major economies that are now facing the brunt of the storm .
return to map sarah bender , mexico " if the us economy catches a cold , mexico catches pneumonia , " the saying goes .
money sent from the us by mexican workers there rank as the country 's second largest source of foreign income .
but that money has dropped 12 % , the central bank says , due to a recession in the us construction industry , a heavy user of mexican labour .
tighter border controls and a us crackdown on illegal immigration have also played a role .
the mexican peso has fallen amid uncertainty on the markets despite these concerns , mexico 's president felipe calderon is confident that the country will not suffer the ramifications of the credit crunch , and has proposed to spend us $ 4.4 billion next year -lrb- £ 2.5bn ; 3.3bn euros -rrb- on infrastructure projects .
the labour secretary for the mexico city government , benito miron lince , has announced plans to support some 30,000 workers who are expected to return to the mexican capital because of the slowdown in the us .
officials have stated that the current unemployment insurance program , unveiled last autumn , will be broadened .
according to mr miron lince , demand for unemployment benefits has rapidly increased during the last few months .
with the wave of migrants heading back , it is becoming increasingly evident that re-adjusting to a country that was once their home is not that simple .
after spending most of their lives in the us , mexican families barely recognise relatives or their towns .
children in particular are often mocked and discriminated against by their teachers and fellow students when they pronounce their names in an american accent .
many are returning to the same grinding poverty that originally drove them out .
return to map jonah fisher , south africa with the south african economy having grown steadily for the last decade there was little temptation for banks here to invest in the us sub-prime market .
that meant the economy was largely insulated against much of the world 's financial turmoil .
" over the last couple of years it became clear that south african investors were likely to get better returns here than in the overseas market , " says goolam ballim , the chief economist from standard bank .
" so , as a consequence , our financial system has stayed stable and secure . "
but the rand is a notoriously volatile currency and , in the last week , it slumped to its lowest levels since 2001 against the us dollar .
when financial crises take place it is often emerging markets such as south africa which feel the pinch as foreign investors shift their money to safer havens .
for ordinary south africans the impact of the financial crisis is likely to be higher inflation and unemployment .
while encouraging exports , a weaker rand means that all imports into south africa cost more .
with the government committed to targeting inflation that could also mean another rise in interest rates from a current benchmark level of 12 % .
for the many south africans with loans or credit that is bad news .
steep falls in commodity prices could also mean redundancies at south africa 's many mines as global demand falls and some production becomes uneconomic .
unemployment rates of over 25 % could be set to rise again .
" with commodities like platinum down over 60 percent , lots of projects could be put on ice , " says chris hart of investment solutions .
" as that happens we 're going to see economic growth take a real hit . "
return to map emma wallis , italy italian prime minister silvio berlusconi says that running a country is like controlling a very big board meeting .
the word recession might not be good for the business of politics , but , spun in the right way , the credit crunch could enhance the pm 's political power .
silvio berlusconi is trying to steer italy away from crisis the new right-wing government likes to blame the current recession on the previous left-wing coalition .
with a different economic system and less borrowing than the uk and the us , italy should not have been affected as seriously , but its biggest and most international bank , unicredit , hit troubled waters very quickly , calling for an injection of cash from investors to the tune of nearly $ 9 billion .
it repeatedly stopped trading as its share prices fell too low .
italians have been voting with their feet , pulling their money out of shares and banks and turning to the post office for savings and bonds .
the prime minister has passed laws to inject state money into troubled banks and businesses .
the financial crisis allows silvio berlusconi to play the role of strong leader .
he has stepped in personally to reassure italian investors , has organised special emergency meetings , and when necessary has turned to rule by decree to get things done quickly .
mr berlusconi , italy 's richest man , has seen his poll ratings climb ; around 60 % of the electorate back him .
as if to prove his word is law at the moment , the failing national airline , alitalia , seems geared up for a new take-off at the beginning of november .
that just goes to show that in mr berlusconi 's italy , despite the recession , it 's business as usual .
return to map john sudworth , japan japan , in theory at least , should have been well set to weather the financial storm , following a home-grown financial crisis that began in the 1990s .
bailed out by government money , japanese financial institutions were thought to be in better health than their western counterparts .
instead the country is bracing itself for more economic pain .
vital export industries have been hit hard by the credit crunch as the american consumer can no longer borrow money to buy things like cars .
" we 're seeing events that are completely new to everybody , we 've never seen economic cycles accelerate like this before " , said a nissan executive .
some analysts believe japan may already be in recession .
stock market index boards say it all - the benchmark nikkei index has lost almost half of its value in just 12 months , with the biggest declines during the past few weeks .
with international lending frozen japan 's banks have also been growing reluctant to lend , contributing to a 30 % increase in business failures last month .
the central bank has not yet had to underwrite lending or raise deposit guarantees .
but it has injected liquidity into the system by the bucket-load and says it will continue to provide as many dollars as the banks need .
if the freeze does n't ease there is speculation that , once again , the banks might need more direct help .
meanwhile , the japanese parliament has enacted an 18 billion dollar emergency spending plan to try to stimulate the economy .
but there is a strong feeling here that this is a crisis of someone else 's making .

bbc news / politics show graphics version bbc sport home politics show -pipe- archive -pipe- contact us -pipe- faqs -pipe- interviews -pipe- meet the team -pipe- 08:20 gmt , friday , 31 october 2008 why i vote - even when it does n't matter ...
aaron keeley provo , utah , usa for the politics show " many utahn republicans seem fed up with their own party " aaron keeley aaron keeley from provo , utah , reflects on why he votes and hopes that voters will turn away from party considerations and vote on issues ... "
months ago , howard dean , chairman of the dnc , appeared on the colbert report and , as a joke , claimed that the democrats would take utah this november .
since utah is often considered the reddest of red states , it 's easy to laugh at " something that only howard dean would say " .
but as a liberal in utah , i 'm going to try and make it happen anyway .
of course , i realize that , due to the electoral college system , my vote will most likely not count this november .
still , i plan to cast a ballot - this election seems too important to simply not participate , even with the knowledge that my participation will have little to do with the final outcome .
my future ...
but as a relatively young american voter , and with two wars costing me as a tax payer billions of dollars , an emerging financial crisis , the rising cost of health care , the continued and irreversible damaging of the environment , and the general lowered standards of the american educational system , i am , selfishly perhaps , worried about my own future .
though i am , politically speaking , anomalous in utah , in recent conversations with friends and neighbors found that many typically conservative voters -lrb- in my area at least -rrb- are increasingly unsatisfied with the republican party and senator mccain .
mccain 's choice of sarah palin , frighteningly unqualified and uniformed , has convinced many of the independent minded republicans i know to consider senator obama , third party candidates , or simply not voting .
i have also heard mccain 's unilateral approach to international politics , and views on iraq and afghanistan , openly mocked by those who would , in any other election , simply vote along the republican party line .
and while many of my conservative friends do n't like the idea of an economic bailout , it is widely perceived as a necessity .
the failure of most republican members congress to vote for the bill has further alienated them from their own constituents .
in short , many utahn republicans seem fed up with their own party .
no spin zone despite this , i am still surprised whenever i see an obama 08 sticker / sign / shirt here in provo , ut .
so i started to count , comparing the visual support for obama to mccain .
as of today , obama is in the lead by a very large margin .
perhaps this is because provo is a college town , and obama always polls well with younger voters compared to his septuagenarian rival .
it could be that utahns are still miffed over mccain 's choosing palin as vp over mitt romney .
it is a fact that since neither party campaigns in utah , considered a " lock " for the republicans , voters here have been in a relative " no spin zone " -lrb- yes , the quote is used ironically -rrb- .
what i hope , is that with the stakes of this election so high , voters are turning away from party considerations and focusing on issues .
if this is happening , then obama has a solid chance of taking utah .
i 'm one of many voters that is , foolishly perhaps , trying to turn utah blue . "

sue ' kit ' whalen merlin , oregon , usa for the politics show bill clinton speaks at grants pass sue ' kit ' whalen from merlin , oregon usa , shares her thoughts on the impending elections and reveals why she feels that true reform will only come when americans stand up to the two-party power structure ...
the u s fiscal " crisis " has turned the 2008 presidential election on its head .
the impact here in josephine county , oregon -lrb- population approx .
76,000 -rrb- is primarily psychological to date .
a large retiree population dominates this area .
we have no large industries .
most jobs are in health care and the services sector .
small owner-operated enterprises , such as my computer consulting business , provide jobs for others .
the boom in new home construction ended in 2007 .
the current financial market crash has had little immediate impact .
however , the fearmongering and scare tactics of president bush , barack obama and john mccain and the congressional leaders is causing reactions from scepticism to concern to panic .
bailout merlin day parade the now $ 800bn plus bailout plan before the u s house of representatives tomorrow , is directly affecting voters in josephine county .
most people i 've talked with , democrats and republicans , share my view that the bailout is bad legislation , a dangerous step toward corporate socialism and the nationalization of our nation 's financial industry .
people say this will influence their november 4 vote .
some democrats will vote for sen barack obama , regardless his positions on the bailout .
some republicans remain equally committed to sen john mccain , despite doubts about his position on the bailout and questions about gov sarah palin 's qualifications as a vice presidential candidate .
my personal journey from long-time unaffiliated voter to active participant in the election was driven by my conviction that sen obama is too inexperienced to be president and that he holds radical left wing views which represent a danger to our national security and stability .
that conviction led me to support sen hillary clinton in the democratic primary and then sen john mccain in the general election .
i believed that mccain 's judgment could be trusted .
despite reservations about gov palin 's qualifications to be vice president and , potentially , president , i continued to support mccain .
true reform rogue river that is , until mccain 's support for the $ 700bn + bailout of irresponsible borrowers , lending institutions and investment firms .
this bailout is pure corporate socialism at its worst .
i 'd be voting against my conscience if i were to vote for anyone who supports it .
my personal political journey this election year will conclude when i cast my vote for libertarian candidate bob barr who stands for smaller central government and a more strict interpretation of our constitution .
is that " throwing my vote away " as some say ?
i do not believe so .
true reform will only come when americans stand up to the two-party power structure and make their collective will known at the ballot box .
talking to others here in josephine county , i 've found lots of support for my position .

sue ' kit ' whalen merlin , oregon , usa for the politics show sue ' kit ' whalen from merlin , oregon usa , shares her thoughts on the impending elections and reveals why she feels that true reform will only come when americans stand up to the two-party power structure ... "
the u s fiscal " crisis " has turned the 2008 presidential election on its head .
the impact here in josephine county , oregon -lrb- population approx .
76,000 -rrb- is primarily psychological to date .
a large retiree population dominates this area .
we have no large industries .
most jobs are in health care and the services sector .
small owner-operated enterprises , such as my computer consulting business , provide jobs for others .
the boom in new home construction ended in 2007 .
the current financial market crash has had little immediate impact .
however , the fearmongering and scare tactics of president bush , barack obama and john mccain and the congressional leaders is causing reactions from scepticism to concern to panic .
bailout the now $ 800bn plus bailout plan before the u s house of representatives tomorrow , is directly affecting voters in josephine county .
most people i 've talked with , democrats and republicans , share my view that the bailout is bad legislation , a dangerous step toward corporate socialism and the nationalization of our nation 's financial industry .
people say this will influence their november 4 vote .
some democrats will vote for sen barack obama , regardless his positions on the bailout .
some republicans remain equally committed to sen john mccain , despite doubts about his position on the bailout and questions about gov sarah palin 's qualifications as a vice presidential candidate .
my personal journey from long-time unaffiliated voter to active participant in the election was driven by my conviction that sen obama is too inexperienced to be president and that he holds radical left wing views which represent a danger to our national security and stability .
that conviction led me to support sen hillary clinton in the democratic primary and then sen john mccain in the general election .
i believed that mccain 's judgment could be trusted .
despite reservations about gov palin 's qualifications to be vice president and , potentially , president , i continued to support mccain .
true reform that is , until mccain 's support for the $ 700bn + bailout of irresponsible borrowers , lending institutions and investment firms .
this bailout is pure corporate socialism at its worst .
i 'd be voting against my conscience if i were to vote for anyone who supports it .
my personal political journey this election year will conclude when i cast my vote for libertarian candidate bob barr who stands for smaller central government and a more strict interpretation of our constitution .
is that " throwing my vote away " as some say ?
i do not believe so .
true reform will only come when americans stand up to the two-party power structure and make their collective will known at the ballot box .
talking to others here in josephine county , i 've found lots of support for my position . "

what does the study say ?
the work by researchers at university college london looked at almost 12,500 children .
those whose mothers had had anything from an occasional drink to a maximum of two drinks a week during pregnancy - classed as light drinking - were not found to be at any increased risk of behavioural problems compared to those whose mothers abstained from alcohol .
they were even found to score more highly in some areas , such as vocabulary tests , when they were assessed at the age of three .
but the mothers tended to be better educated and from higher income families than those who abstained , and the researchers suggest these social factors may play a part in the results .
does this change research existing guidance ?
no .
government advice to women who are trying to conceive , or who are already pregnant , is that the safest course of action is to avoid alcohol altogether .
but if they do choose to drink , they should consume no more than one or two units of alcohol , once or twice a week - and should not get drunk .
there is some dispute however .
the british medical association warns the study findings may " lull " women into feeling drinking alcohol in pregnancy is safe .
it says moderate and heavy drinking are definitely not safe , and that the evidence is not conclusive on light drinking .
the royal college of obstetricians and gynaecologists does not disagree that heavier drinking is dangerous , and says it would like to see the ucl study 's findings confirmed in further research .
but it says the work suggests women should not be worried if they have had the odd drink while they are , or were , pregnant .
what impact does alcohol have on the unborn baby ?
alcohol can cross from the mother 's blood via the placenta to the baby 's circulation .
it is well established that heavy drinking during pregnancy can affect the development of the foetus .
the first three months , or first trimester , of pregnancy is particularly key , as this is the time when the organs and nervous system are rapidly developing .
heavy alcohol consumption during the more advanced stages of pregnancy can also stymie general growth .
in particularly serious cases heavy drinking can lead to a condition known as foetal alcohol syndrome .
this a name given to a set of symptoms which can include facial abnormalities , such as small heads and widely spaced eyes , poor growth , impaired learning and memory skills and behavioural problems such as hyperactivity .
the national organisation on foetal alcohol syndrome estimates more than 6,000 uk children are born with foetal alcohol spectrum disorder each year .
heavy drinking also significantly raises the risk of a miscarriage .
what about breastfeeding ?
doctors suggest that the occasional drink - again one to two units no more than once or twice a week - probably wo n't do any harm .
however , more heavy drinking can make breast milk smell different to a baby , potentially disrupting their feeding patterns .
there is also evidence that it can cause problems for a baby 's digestion .
alcohol clears from a mother 's milk at the rate of around one unit every two hours .
so try to avoid alcohol before breastfeeding , or plan ahead and express milk if you know you will be drinking .
how much is a unit of alcohol ?
the measurement of alcohol units was recently revamped to take account of the modern trend for stronger drinks , and bigger glasses .
a half pint of normal beer and a single shot of a spirit is defined as a single unit , while a medium glass of 12.5 % table wine is considered to contain two units .
units for alcoholic drinks drink volume strength units normal beer / lager / cider half pint 284ml 4 1 large can / bottle 440ml 4.50 % 2 strong beer / lager / cider half pint 284ml 6.50 % 2 large can / bottle 440ml 6.50 % 3 table wine small glass 125ml 12.50 % 1.5 medium glass 175ml 12.50 % 2 large glass 250ml 12.50 % 3 bottle 750ml 12.50 % 9 spirits single shot 25ml 40.00 % 1 bottle 750ml 40.00 % 30 alcopops bottle 275ml 5.00 % 1.5 office for national statistics bookmark with : delicious digg reddit facebook stumbleupon what are these ?

what does the study say ?
the work by researchers at university college london looked at almost 12,500 children .
those whose mothers had had anything from an occasional drink to a maximum of two drinks a week during pregnancy - classed as light drinking - were not found to be at any increased risk of behavioural problems compared to those whose mothers abstained from alcohol .
they were even found to score more highly in some areas , such as vocabulary tests , when they were assessed at the age of three .
but the mothers tended to be better educated and from higher income families than those who abstained , and the researchers suggest these social factors may play a part in the results .
does this change research existing guidance ?
no .
government advice to women who are trying to conceive , or who are already pregnant , is that the safest course of action is to avoid alcohol altogether .
but if they do choose to drink , they should consume no more than one or two units of alcohol , once or twice a week - and should not get drunk .
there is some dispute however .
the british medical association warns the study findings may " lull " women into feeling drinking alcohol in pregnancy is safe .
it says moderate and heavy drinking are definitely not safe , and that the evidence is not conclusive on light drinking .
the royal college of obstetricians and gynaecologists does not disagree that heavier drinking is dangerous , and says it would like to see the ucl study 's findings confirmed in further research .
but it says the work suggests women should not be worried if they have had the odd drink while they are , or were , pregnant .
what impact does alcohol have on the unborn baby ?
alcohol can cross from the mother 's blood via the placenta to the baby 's circulation .
it is well established that heavy drinking during pregnancy can affect the development of the foetus .
the first three months , or first trimester , of pregnancy is particularly key , as this is the time when the organs and nervous system are rapidly developing .
heavy alcohol consumption during the more advanced stages of pregnancy can also stymie general growth .
in particularly serious cases heavy drinking can lead to a condition known as foetal alcohol syndrome .
this a name given to a set of symptoms which can include facial abnormalities , such as small heads and widely spaced eyes , poor growth , impaired learning and memory skills and behavioural problems such as hyperactivity .
the national organisation on foetal alcohol syndrome estimates more than 6,000 uk children are born with foetal alcohol spectrum disorder each year .
heavy drinking also significantly raises the risk of a miscarriage .
what about breastfeeding ?
doctors suggest that the occasional drink - again one to two units no more than once or twice a week - probably wo n't do any harm .
however , more heavy drinking can make breast milk smell different to a baby , potentially disrupting their feeding patterns .
there is also evidence that it can cause problems for a baby 's digestion .
alcohol clears from a mother 's milk at the rate of around one unit every two hours .
so try to avoid alcohol before breastfeeding , or plan ahead and express milk if you know you will be drinking .
how much is a unit of alcohol ?
the measurement of alcohol units was recently revamped to take account of the modern trend for stronger drinks , and bigger glasses .
a half pint of normal beer and a single shot of a spirit is defined as a single unit , while a medium glass of 12.5 % table wine is considered to contain two units .

advertisement water levels have subsided , revealing much damage a clean-up operation has begun after severe flooding caused by an unpredicted wintry storm wreaked havoc in east devon .
heavy rain , hail and snow fell in what the met office described as a " freak event " in the ottery st mary area overnight thursday .
floodwaters rose up to 4ft -lrb- 1.2m -rrb- , which led to people having to be rescued by air from houses and cars .
devon county councillor roger giles called for a " very thorough " inquiry .
damage caused by the severe weather has been estimated at hundreds of thousands of pounds for home owners and businesses in ottery st mary .
roads into the low-lying town became flooded with torrents of water , hedges were ripped away , sections of roads were torn up and a deluge of silt and rubble washed across the town .
there has to be a very thorough inquiry with no effort nor expense spared to prevent an occurrence of this terrible situation roger giles , devon county councillor the environment agency said it planned to look at better protection for the culvert in ottery st mary to prevent flooding problems in the future .
the culvert became blocked by a range of debris , including cars and a garden shed .
mr giles said : " there has to be a very thorough inquiry with no effort nor expense spared to prevent an occurrence of this terrible situation .
" there must be the most comprehensive action taken as a result of what the inquiry finds . "
crews from devon and somerset fire and rescue service had to be drafted in to rescue dozens of people from homes in ottery st mary and feniton .
they were taken to the hospital in ottery st mary , part of which was used as a shelter for those who had nowhere else to go .
one farmer , john burrows , lost 35 sheep as a result of the flooding which also led to a number of roads in the area being closed and disruption to rail services .
the environment agency put flood warnings in place on the rivers otter , axe , clyst , coly , culm , isle and yarty in devon .
although river levels for the clyst , culm and otter have now dropped , flood warnings remain in place .
