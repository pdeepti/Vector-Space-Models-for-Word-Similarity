speciality breweries and brew-pubs could change that , but they 've not really become popular - so far . beer may be germany 's unofficial national drink , but more and more germans seem to be losing their taste for it .
according to the german brewer 's association , beer consumption fell by around 18 percent from 1992 to 2006 . one person who 's not affected by the decline is berlin 's oliver lemke , the owner of one of the few independent brewpubs in the german capital .
business is up in all four of his establishments , the first of which opened in 1999 .
he said the overall slump reflects the destruction of small local breweries by big corporations . " there used to be 100 breweries in this neighborhood alone , " lemke said .
" they died out in the 1970s with the trend toward mono-breweries .
the big breweries - for example warsteiner or licher – said : ‘ we 're only going to make one sort of beer , a premium pilsner , and we 'll market it nationwide . '
and that inevitably leads to a dead-end .
at some point , even the world 's biggest idiot notices that there 's virtually no difference between a warsteiner and licher . " popsicle flavorings or real ale ? bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : berlin 's brauhaus lemke has n't been affected by the slump germany has some 1,300 brewing companies , but the vast majority - including germany 's most famous brand , beck 's - belong to huge international conglomerates , and styles rarely stray from the standard pilsner and wheat varieties .
the main strategy among major brewers for interesting young people is to mix their products with everything from lemon flavor to cola . but why has n't germany gotten in on the micro-brewery and real-ale trends in the us or the uk ?
after all , no self-respecting manhattan yuppie would be seen with a bud light in his hand . " it 's a global interplay between wrong-headed marketing , the wrong sort of people as bar owners and the wrong retailing structures , " lemke said .
" that 's why those trends are under-represented here compared with the united states . " lemke is trying to change that .
his brewpubs revive almost forgotten brewing styles , such as amber ale or the double-hopped , non-filtered zwickel , and seasonal specialities such as the extra-strength märzen -lrb- " march beer " -rrb- .
they sell a respectable 2,500 hectoliters -lrb- 66,000 gallons -rrb- a year - and there 's no mistaking them for beck 's . alcohol abuse bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : nationally marketed brands forced many local breweries out of business in the 1970s but it 's difficult for independents to break through against the conglomerates .
the big brewing companies control distribution networks and encourage pub owners to feature their products exclusively by offering loans , price rebates and free tapping and refrigeration systems , beer glasses and even ashtrays . and german consumers and bar owners are ignorant about the drink itself , lemke said . " the german beer drinker thinks he knows a lot about beer , but most of them know very , very , little , " he said .
" it start 's with the myth that you need seven minutes to tap a good pilsner .
nonsense - that just makes it go flat and warm .
when i go to bars , i usually drink bottled beer because i know the tap beer has usually been physically abused .
it 's atrocious .
i know a lot of people in america that know far more about beer than people here in germany . " name recognition bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : what would a brewpub be without the obligatory copper brewing kettles ?
the first problem for small brewers is how to let potential customers know that they 're there . " that 's due in part to the marketing abilities of the big companies , " said marc-oliver huhnholz , press spokesman for the german brewers ' association .
" also america never drank as much beer as germany so small brewers can have more impact . " and to appeal to a new generation of potential beer drinkers , brewers have to take into account demographic shifts and the accompanying changes in personal taste . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : beer suffers from its image as a drink for older men " the average age in germany is rising , and older people tend to drink less , " huhnholz said .
" and among younger people , the trend is toward milder drinks - women especially prefer sweeter drinks .
they do n't want anything too bitter . " but huhnholz also thinks that small local breweries can play a role in stirring up new interest in - and appreciation for - beer . " small brewers have to offer an attractive product , and they need to do a lot of marketing , " huhnholz said .
" but some of them can succeed . " beer vs. bureaucracy bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : is germany 's bureaucracy preventing more small brew-pubs from opening ?
philipp brokamp would love to do that , but first he has to get started .
the 32-year-old brewer moved to berlin last year and is set to open his first brewpub , appropriately named hops and barley . without the support of a major corporation , that 's proven a daunting task .
germany 's notorious bureaucracy has n't made things any easier , brokamp said . " there 's the stereotype about bureaucracy , but i now know it 's not a stereotype , " said brokamp , who was forced to postpone opening due to red tape .
" i 've had to deal with at least eight separate government permit agencies , everything from the civil engineering office to offices for the environment and handicapped accessibility .
every one of them considered itself particularly important , but they could n't even agree on what the regulations were . " all that for a bar with a capacity of 100 , where the beer is made in the basement . while he 's tying up loose ends , brokamp is brewing light and dark beers as well as red ale and cider .
his style emphasizes malt more than lemke 's without being overly sweet . brokamp 's beers are also non-filtered , which means they look cloudy when poured .
but as he explains , cloudiness is good . " the things mass breweries filter out are n't impurities , " brokamp said .
" they 're very nutritious , and they make the beer more flavorful than filtered varieties . " think globally , drink locally bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : friedrichshain 's student crowds might be perfect for a micro-brewery lemke 's flagship brewpub is in the touristy neighborhood around berlin 's hackescher markt , while brokamp 's bar is located in the more residential area of friedrichshain .
he knows it will be a challenge to convince the locals to drink local stuff , but he 's confident . " i think that it 's exactly the right niche in the market , " brokamp said .
" general consumption is in decline .
people are more conscious and perhaps more choosey about what they drink .
and so i hope they 'll be interested in the sort of specialities that i 'll be offering . " brokamp will begin testing that hypothesis on feb .
2 , when hops and barley officially opens .
then he 'll see whether his neighbors are interested in trying something out of the ordinary or whether they prefer to just keep popping open beck 's - in decreasing numbers . jefferson chase send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de business -pipe- 24.01.2008 tensions at siemens agm as more corruption claims emerge großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : it will be years before siemens can put the scandal behind it as investors aired their grievances at the siemens general assembly of shareholders , allegations of corruption continue to emerge . some 10,000 investors came to munich on thursday for a general assembly of siemens shareholders , accusing the bosses of failing to address the spiraling corruption scandal .
" the reputation built by siemens for 160 years has been reduced to ashes , " said daniela bergdolt , from the dsw group of small investors .
" it is not satisfactory that the affair has not been wrapped up after more than a year , " complained hans hirt , who represented the british pension fund hermes .
in the latest twist to the " affair , " investigators have established that payments worth around 140 million euros -lrb- $ 206 million -rrb- have been found in the firm 's flagship medical equipment division , reported the daily süddeutsche zeitung thursday .
siemens ' most profitable division , its turnover averages some 10 billion euros a year .
until now , siemens has said such payments totalled around 1.3 billion euros .
the löscher effect bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : shareholders got a chance to voice their feelings exempted from the shareholders ' criticisms was siemens boss peter löscher , appointed six months ago following the disclosure of a well-stocked slush fund at the group .
shareholders ' hopes are resting on the shoulders of löscher , the first siemens boss to be hired from outside the group .
he has already renovated the management team and begun to simplify the company 's tentacular structure , reining in directors of siemens units abroad who have been dubbed " the princes . "
" what counts for me is clean business everywhere and always , and highest performance meeting the highest ethical standards , " he has said .
he has also revealed that the group had been hit with compliance costs to date of around 1.1 billion euros , plus around 520 million in tax liabilities and sanctions " whose scope can not be estimated . "
" intangible damage is much harder to measure - the loss of reputation and trust in the general public , " he said .
shareholder concerns others on the executive floor were given a rocky ride by investors , including those supposed to be controlling the group such as supervisory board gerhard cromme and his right-hand man , deutsche bank chairman josef ackermann .
according to afp , the association of small shareholders dsw intends to vote against a renewal of their mandates , which nonetheless seem assured .
among the top figures absent were former siemens boss klaus kleinfeld and former supervisory board president heinrich von pierer , the emblematic head of the group from 1992 to 2005 , who both left siemens last year .
one telling sign of the times was a decision by siemens to forego the traditional vote of confidence by which shareholders typically approve the management team 's performance over the past year .
but the supervisory board , including cromme and his right-hand man josef ackermann , the chairman of deutsche bank , were to face such a vote .
still in business bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : peter löscher it has been over a year since the first revelations emerged about shady dealings at siemens , often in the form of money alleged to have been paid under the table to obtain foreign contracts .
at last count , the biggest private german employer had acknowledged 1.3 billion euros in questionable funds .
according to press reports , internal allegations are still abounding , including the suggestion that corruption was present up to the higher spheres of the group .
the german group is listed on wall street and fears being slapped with a fine of four billion euros -lrb- 5.8 billion dollars -rrb- in the us , according to the german business magazine wirtschaftswoche .
but for the time being , the company 's businesses - medical equipment , manufacturing , trains and electric power stations - remain healthy .
the company posted a huge increase in first quarter profit from 788 million euros to 6.5 billion owing to the sale of the auto equipment parts company vdo .
operating profit for the first three months of its 2007-2008 fiscal year , which began on october 1 , increased by 16 percent to 1.7 billion euros , on sales which grew by 10 percent to 18.4 billion euros . dw staff -lrb- jp -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

but people should rather look on the bright side , one of germany 's leading business managers told deutsche welle . jürgen großmann , 55 , is the ceo of rwe , one of germany 's largest energy companies .
he talked to dw-radio on the sidelines of the world economic forum in davos , which started wednesday , jan .
23 . deutsche welle : the financial and stock market crisis is the dominating topic in davos .
what could german businesses and publicly traded companies do to prevent a stock value massacre like the one we 've seen at the beginning of the week ? bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : jürgen großmann jürgen großmann : central banks and governments will surely come up with macroeconomic measures .
the lowering of interest rates by the us federal reserve is a first step .
in terms of microeconomics , companies have to tell themselves again and again : the donkey gets daring when he feels too comfortable .
we have to keep our cost structures and our competitiveness under control for stock market success to return .
it 's right and important to correct things sometimes .
let 's see that we get our ships back in order ; that we stick to the course .
do n't panic .
that 's the worst thing that could happen .
instead , we should analyze the current situation with a clear head .
if we do that , we 'll emerge from this stronger , i believe . how much is germany affected by the financial crisis ? bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : it 's no fun to be a german stock broker at the momen the global economy naturally is connected via financial markets , insurances and banks .
if wealth is destroyed in one place , that clearly has an effect on the behavior of consumers and investors .
we 're all affected .
no one should think that he 's not simply because he does n't own any stock .
that 's completely wrong . many people would love to be in the position that germany 's been fighting for hard for decades .
they 're also working on becoming world champions .
everyone participates in globalization and there are only marginal groups that do n't .
here in davos , we 've seen many studies over the past couple of years that have all reached the same conclusion : when all is said and done , the global economy , and also the poorest countries , have benefited from globalization . the example of cell phone maker nokia , who is about to close a plan in bochum in western germany , shows that even jobs in booming sectors are n't safe any more in germany .
will protectionism return ?
will industrialized countries have to isolate their markets to a greater extent in order to secure jobs ? bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : if nokia goes to romania , germans have to fill the void the eu 's never dropped protectionism in certain sectors , such as agriculture .
the bitter thing about nokia is that the competitor 's not in southeast asia , but in the eu and that the shift of jobs might even be financed with eu money .
but we 're still profiting big time from globalization and we have to think about how we can respond to such challenges . running after investors with subsidies clearly is n't the way to do it .
we need to recollect ourselves and think about our own strengths and develop our own business concepts .
we need german entrepreneurs that say : okay , if nokia leaves , we 'll step in .
we need good new ideas backed by innovation and we can develop them - it 's possible in germany . interview : marco vollmar -lrb- win -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

the rise in what is one of europe 's major economic indicators came despite this week 's torrid round of trading on global stock markets which fuelled fears of a global economic crisis .
" companies ' order books are bursting , " ifo economist hans günter russ told german news agency , dpa .
firms " remain optimistic about their exports , " he added .
german business defies fears analysts had predicted the closely watched index would show german business confidence sliding to 102.2 points this month on the back of worries that the shakeout in the us housing market could tip the giant us economy into recession .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : german companies are doing roaring business however , releasing the survey ifo president hans-werner sinn said , " on the whole , the condition of firms in german industry and trade continues to be robust . "
his comments echo the views of many economists who see germany acting as europe 's economic locomotive in the coming 12 months , despite the prospects of the nation 's growth rate slipping back a notch from 2.5 per cent in 2007 to below 2.0 per cent this year .
the germany economy grew at a perky 2.9 per cent in 2006 .
the ifo survey " underlines that fundamentally the euro area economy remains in good shape , " ' said elga bartsch from the us investment house morgan stanley .
" but it is clear that the headwinds are currently gaining momentum and , unless they blow over quickly , they will introduce downside risks to growth , inflation and interest rate forecasts , " she said .
asian demand help economy offset slump leading the ifo rise was an increase in german industry 's expectations of business conditions six months down the track , which nudged up to 99 from 98.2 in december .
however , underscoring the current economic uncertainty , the ifo index component gauging german executives ' assessment of the present situation dropped to 107.9 from 108.1 .
while germany 's key export sector is expected to lose some momentum this year , solid demand from the world 's key emerging economies in asia , eastern europe and the middle east is seen as helping to offset a slump in the us .
moreover , increased pay packets for german workers this year after a protracted period of wage stagnation as well as a continuing fall in unemployment are also forecast to help underpin consumer demand .
the surprise jump in the january ifo index added to the brighter mood prevailing on both german and european stocks markets after a highly volatile week in share trading and big falls in stock prices .
by mid-morning trading , frankfurt 's dax index was up almost five per cent with europe 's blue-chip stoxx 50 having gained nearly 4.0 per cent .
the rise in the ifo is likely to ease some of the pressure on the european central bank to follow the lead of other major central banks , notably the us federal reserve , and cut interest rates to help shore up economic confidence and in response to the signs of slowing growth . dw staff / dpa -lrb- sp -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

" kosovo is ready , is united , and i think we 'll proclaim the date -lrb- of independence -rrb- in pristina very soon , " thaci said after talks with eu foreign-policy chief javier solana .
" we have discussed many things - the constitution , the symbols .
kosovo is ready for independence .
it 's an issue of days , " he said .
solana , when asked if he had discussed the date of any such declaration with thaci , answered " no , i did not , " but added that he had agreed to maintain contacts with the kosovo albanians .
serbia is to hold the final round of its presidential election on february 3 , with ultra-nationalist candidate tomislav nikolic having taken the lead over pro-eu incumbent boris tadic in the first round .
kosovo is the most heated issue on the agenda , with nationalists accusing the eu of wanting to steal the province from them .
eu officials have been careful to steer clear of any comments which could inflame the situation ahead of the crucial vote .
" the issue is a very sensitive one and we are in a very sensitive political context in which it is better to resort to diplomatic means than public statements , " a spokeswoman for eu enlargement commissioner olli rehn told journalists .
eu reiterates its commitment balkan stability bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : " we wo n't give up kosovo " sums up the serbian stance thaci and rehn discussed " the european perspective of kosovo and the whole region of the western balkans as well as the issue of the settlement of kosovo 's status , " she said .
rehn " reiterated the eu 's readiness to carry its responsibility by steering a coordinated and managed process to finalize the settlement of kosovo 's status , " she said .
the question of what to do when kosovo declares independence is the most divisive issue in the eu at present .
a majority of member states favor recognizing the new state , but some have said that to do so would spark separatist moves elsewhere .
serb nationalists have expressed outrage at what they see as eu support for an attempt to break up their country .
nikolic has gone on the record as saying that serbia will never join the eu , and that he regrets the country is not a province of russia .
serbians stand firm against kosovo state bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : olli rehn wants a well-managed process for kosovo however , eu officials insist that serbia 's future is as a part of the bloc .
just hours after meeting thaci , rehn met with a serbian delegation to discuss serbia 's cooperation with the international criminal tribunal for the former yugoslavia -lrb- icty -rrb- .
eu leaders have said that they will not sign a stabilization and association agreement -lrb- saa -rrb- paving the way to candidate status for serbia until it cooperates fully with the icty .
rehn " reiterated his strong commitment to serbia 's european future , and would like to sign the saa soon , once the conditions are fulfilled , " the spokeswoman said .

11 attacks lawmakers from 47 european nations have strongly criticized a system of un and eu sanctions against suspected backers of global terrorism , saying the use of terrorist blacklists violates fundamental rights . the council of europe , the eu 's rights watchdog , rules urged the united nations and the european union to overhaul procedures to blacklist individuals and groups suspected of having links to terrorism .
not only does the practice violate human rights , the lawmakers concluded , but they are " completely arbitrary , " according to a statement released by the 47-member body .
a report commissioned by the rights body said people were blacklisted on the basis of " mere suspicion " and called the measures " deplorable and violation of human rights and fundamental freedoms . "
harsh penalties against suspects dick marty , a swiss senator and former prosecutor who has published critical reports into alleged anti-terrorist practices by states and institutions , including reported secret cia prisons on european soil , said those affected by the terrorist blacklists had absolutely no rights to defend themselves against terrorist allegations .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : marty said the practice gave suspects no chance of defending themselves " i have seldom experienced anything as unfair as the compilation of these lists , " marty said at the european parliament in strasbourg this week .
according to the report , around 370 people and 130 groups or organizations are currently on the un 's blacklist .
they include alleged taliban individuals and those linked to al qaeda .
the eu lists 60 people or groups - including the radical palestinian group hamas and the basque separatist group , eta .
set up after the sept .
11 attacks in 2001 , the lists impose a number of penalties on those suspected of backing terrorism .
they include freezing suspects ' assets and preventing them from traveling without giving them a court hearing or disclosing the evidence against them .
the council of europe said in its report that many suspects on the lists only discovered that they were on it after they were stopped at a border while travelling or when their bank accounts were frozen .
" people remain on these lists for years without knowing why , and their lives are ruined , " marty said .
marty 's investigation into the practice was sparked by the case of a 78-year-old italian citizen of arab descent , youssef nada whose business was ruined after he landed on the blacklist .
the cia reportedly suspected nada of belonging to a group of financiers behind the sept .
11 attacks .
but a four-year investigation by swiss authorities into nada 's case was suspended in 2005 due to a lack of evidence .
nada 's assets were seized and he was barred from leaving his home of 30 years in switzerland .
nada 's name remains on the terror blacklist .
top eu court may rule against un practice the un system is at present being scrutinized by the eu 's top court and there is a strong likelihood it may rule that the 27-member bloc has violated basic rights by applying them .
according to news agency reuters , an eu legal advisor has recommended the eu court of justice in luxembourg should cancel financial sanctions against a saudi businessman and a swedish-based money transfer business in two separate cases .
the agency quoted cameron doley , a british lawyer representing saudi businessman yassin kadi as saying that his client had never received a clear statement of the allegations against him .
kadi had filed his case in the eu because the un had no equivalent tribunal to which he could appeal .
" what this gives us , we hope , is a statement by one of the most prominent and respected courts in the world that this system is an unjustified infringement of the fundamental human rights of those persons who are listed , " doley told reuters . dw staff -lrb- sp -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

he lost both italy was again thrown into political turmoil as prime minister romano prodi decided to leave office after he lost a crucial vote of confidence in the italian senate .
the opposition is calling for new elections . italy 's embattled prime minister romano prodi tendered his resignation after losing a vote of confidence in the senate on thursday , jan .
24 , by five votes . italian president giorgio napolitano who , according to news reports , " reserved the right " on whether to accept prodi 's resignation , convened the speakers of both houses of parliament for consultations friday . the result was 156 for the center-left government , 161 against and one abstention .
three senators were absent , including two non-elected life senators . napolitano must choose between calling early elections and setting up a transitional government to allow electoral reforms , which many deputies say are badly needed , to be enacted . prodi , the center-left leader who won elections in april 2006 by a handful of votes , went before the senate despite appeals by top leaders including napolitano to resign rather than face the vote . he appeared resigned to the prospect of losing the vote but determined to carry through with it on principle . " i am here because you can not hide from the judgment of those who represent the people , and our people are watching us , " he said . prodi has walked a tightrope trying to keep together his squabbling coalition , which ranges from centrist catholics to far-left communists . earlier plea falls on senate 's deaf ears dismissing calls for his resignation , prodi earlier urged senators to support his government . " italy does not have the luxury of halting -lrb- the work of -rrb- this government , " prodi said in the senate as he opened the scheduled debate preceding the vote . to those voting against him , prodi said they should ask what government and what parliamentary majority they wanted in place of " the legitimate one currently in office . " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : president napolitano wanted prodi to step aside ahead of the vote earlier prodi met napolitano - who like others in the governing center-left coalition reportedly wanted the premier to make way for a caretaker government - before the senate vote . the embattled prime minister had already met napolitano before winning wednesday 's confidence vote in parliament 's lower house chamber of deputies where , unlike the senate , the government has a clear majority . recent defections have left the governing centre-left coalition with some 157 votes in the senate , while the opposition is expected to muster around 160 votes . " we will have early elections , " university and research minister fabio mussi said thursday , voicing a view shared by some members of prodi 's eight-party coalition and the vast majority of the opposition including former prime minister silvio berlusconi . however the democratic party , the largest in the center-left government had said that if prodi were to fall , then electoral reforms - aimed at giving governments more stability by decreasing the influence of small parties - should be introduced before a new poll . napolitano , who has the power to dissolve parliament had also said in the past that a new electoral law would be needed before elections are held . mastella 's withdrawal of support prompts crisis prodi 's decision to test his support in parliament came after former justice minister clemente mastella said monday his small moderate udeur party would no longer support the governing coalition .
mastella resigned last week in the wake of a corruption scandal . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : mastella decided to pull his party out of prodi 's coalition his decision triggered the latest , and most serious crisis to strike prodi since he took office 20 months ago after winning italy 's closest post-world war ii election by just 25,000 votes in april 2006 .
prodi has had to rely on more than 30 confidence votes to push through legislation , including the government 's budget and foreign policy . in the wake of prodi 's resignation , berlusconi called for the president to dissolve parliament and call elections immediately . berlusconi also had to face four votes of confidence during his government 's turn in office .
berlusconi was the longest serving prime minister italy has had since world war ii .
italy has had 61 governments since 1945 . impact on economy in the run-up to prodi 's decision , political commentators and analysts were warning that holding elections now without amending italy 's messy electoral rules would only prolong the unstable system of coalition governments . reuters news agency reported that the current government turmoil took its toll on financial markets where spreads between italian government bonds and german bunds widened to near levels not seen for six-and-a-half years . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : alumnia urged italy to confront its political problems italy 's economy , which has long underperformed its peers in the euro zone , also suffered more bad news with the worst consumer confidence data for two-and-a-half years . eu commissioner for economic and monetary affairs joaquin almunia urged italy to resolve the situation as soon as possible because " only then can italy begin to confront its real problems , like the economy . " speaking to reporters outside the world economic forum in davos , switzerland , almunia reiterated : " we are currently in a time of economic difficulty and turbulence .

the rise in what is one of europe 's major economic indicators came despite this week 's torrid round of trading on global stock markets which fuelled fears of a global economic crisis .
" companies ' order books are bursting , " ifo economist hans günter russ told german news agency , dpa .
firms " remain optimistic about their exports , " he added .
german business defies fears analysts had predicted the closely watched index would show german business confidence sliding to 102.2 points this month on the back of worries that the shakeout in the us housing market could tip the giant us economy into recession .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : german companies are doing roaring business however , releasing the survey ifo president hans-werner sinn said , " on the whole , the condition of firms in german industry and trade continues to be robust . "
his comments echo the views of many economists who see germany acting as europe 's economic locomotive in the coming 12 months , despite the prospects of the nation 's growth rate slipping back a notch from 2.5 per cent in 2007 to below 2.0 per cent this year .
the germany economy grew at a perky 2.9 per cent in 2006 .
the ifo survey " underlines that fundamentally the euro area economy remains in good shape , " ' said elga bartsch from the us investment house morgan stanley .
" but it is clear that the headwinds are currently gaining momentum and , unless they blow over quickly , they will introduce downside risks to growth , inflation and interest rate forecasts , " she said .
asian demand help economy offset slump leading the ifo rise was an increase in german industry 's expectations of business conditions six months down the track , which nudged up to 99 from 98.2 in december .
however , underscoring the current economic uncertainty , the ifo index component gauging german executives ' assessment of the present situation dropped to 107.9 from 108.1 .
while germany 's key export sector is expected to lose some momentum this year , solid demand from the world 's key emerging economies in asia , eastern europe and the middle east is seen as helping to offset a slump in the us .
moreover , increased pay packets for german workers this year after a protracted period of wage stagnation as well as a continuing fall in unemployment are also forecast to help underpin consumer demand .
the surprise jump in the january ifo index added to the brighter mood prevailing on both german and european stocks markets after a highly volatile week in share trading and big falls in stock prices .
by mid-morning trading , frankfurt 's dax index was up almost five per cent with europe 's blue-chip stoxx 50 having gained nearly 4.0 per cent .
the rise in the ifo is likely to ease some of the pressure on the european central bank to follow the lead of other major central banks , notably the us federal reserve , and cut interest rates to help shore up economic confidence and in response to the signs of slowing growth . dw staff / dpa -lrb- sp -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

11 attacks lawmakers from 47 european nations have strongly criticized a system of un and eu sanctions against suspected backers of global terrorism , saying the use of terrorist blacklists violates fundamental rights . the council of europe , the eu 's rights watchdog , rules urged the united nations and the european union to overhaul procedures to blacklist individuals and groups suspected of having links to terrorism .
not only does the practice violate human rights , the lawmakers concluded , but they are " completely arbitrary , " according to a statement released by the 47-member body .
a report commissioned by the rights body said people were blacklisted on the basis of " mere suspicion " and called the measures " deplorable and violation of human rights and fundamental freedoms . "
harsh penalties against suspects dick marty , a swiss senator and former prosecutor who has published critical reports into alleged anti-terrorist practices by states and institutions , including reported secret cia prisons on european soil , said those affected by the terrorist blacklists had absolutely no rights to defend themselves against terrorist allegations .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : marty said the practice gave suspects no chance of defending themselves " i have seldom experienced anything as unfair as the compilation of these lists , " marty said at the european parliament in strasbourg this week .
according to the report , around 370 people and 130 groups or organizations are currently on the un 's blacklist .
they include alleged taliban individuals and those linked to al qaeda .
the eu lists 60 people or groups - including the radical palestinian group hamas and the basque separatist group , eta .
set up after the sept .
11 attacks in 2001 , the lists impose a number of penalties on those suspected of backing terrorism .
they include freezing suspects ' assets and preventing them from traveling without giving them a court hearing or disclosing the evidence against them .
the council of europe said in its report that many suspects on the lists only discovered that they were on it after they were stopped at a border while travelling or when their bank accounts were frozen .
" people remain on these lists for years without knowing why , and their lives are ruined , " marty said .
marty 's investigation into the practice was sparked by the case of a 78-year-old italian citizen of arab descent , youssef nada whose business was ruined after he landed on the blacklist .
the cia reportedly suspected nada of belonging to a group of financiers behind the sept .
11 attacks .
but a four-year investigation by swiss authorities into nada 's case was suspended in 2005 due to a lack of evidence .
nada 's assets were seized and he was barred from leaving his home of 30 years in switzerland .
nada 's name remains on the terror blacklist .
top eu court may rule against un practice the un system is at present being scrutinized by the eu 's top court and there is a strong likelihood it may rule that the 27-member bloc has violated basic rights by applying them .
according to news agency reuters , an eu legal advisor has recommended the eu court of justice in luxembourg should cancel financial sanctions against a saudi businessman and a swedish-based money transfer business in two separate cases .
the agency quoted cameron doley , a british lawyer representing saudi businessman yassin kadi as saying that his client had never received a clear statement of the allegations against him .
kadi had filed his case in the eu because the un had no equivalent tribunal to which he could appeal .
" what this gives us , we hope , is a statement by one of the most prominent and respected courts in the world that this system is an unjustified infringement of the fundamental human rights of those persons who are listed , " doley told reuters . dw staff -lrb- sp -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

" the reputation built by siemens for 160 years has been reduced to ashes , " said daniela bergdolt , from the dsw group of small investors .
" it is not satisfactory that the affair has not been wrapped up after more than a year , " complained hans hirt , who represented the british pension fund hermes .
in the latest twist to the " affair , " investigators have established that payments worth around 140 million euros -lrb- $ 206 million -rrb- have been found in the firm 's flagship medical equipment division , reported the daily süddeutsche zeitung thursday .
siemens ' most profitable division , its turnover averages some 10 billion euros a year .
until now , siemens has said such payments totalled around 1.3 billion euros .
the löscher effect bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : shareholders got a chance to voice their feelings exempted from the shareholders ' criticisms was siemens boss peter löscher , appointed six months ago following the disclosure of a well-stocked slush fund at the group .
shareholders ' hopes are resting on the shoulders of löscher , the first siemens boss to be hired from outside the group .
he has already renovated the management team and begun to simplify the company 's tentacular structure , reining in directors of siemens units abroad who have been dubbed " the princes . "
" what counts for me is clean business everywhere and always , and highest performance meeting the highest ethical standards , " he has said .
he has also revealed that the group had been hit with compliance costs to date of around 1.1 billion euros , plus around 520 million in tax liabilities and sanctions " whose scope can not be estimated . "
" intangible damage is much harder to measure - the loss of reputation and trust in the general public , " he said .
shareholder concerns others on the executive floor were given a rocky ride by investors , including those supposed to be controlling the group such as supervisory board gerhard cromme and his right-hand man , deutsche bank chairman josef ackermann .
according to afp , the association of small shareholders dsw intends to vote against a renewal of their mandates , which nonetheless seem assured .
among the top figures absent were former siemens boss klaus kleinfeld and former supervisory board president heinrich von pierer , the emblematic head of the group from 1992 to 2005 , who both left siemens last year .
one telling sign of the times was a decision by siemens to forego the traditional vote of confidence by which shareholders typically approve the management team 's performance over the past year .
but the supervisory board , including cromme and his right-hand man josef ackermann , the chairman of deutsche bank , were to face such a vote .
still in business bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : peter löscher it has been over a year since the first revelations emerged about shady dealings at siemens , often in the form of money alleged to have been paid under the table to obtain foreign contracts .
at last count , the biggest private german employer had acknowledged 1.3 billion euros in questionable funds .
according to press reports , internal allegations are still abounding , including the suggestion that corruption was present up to the higher spheres of the group .
the german group is listed on wall street and fears being slapped with a fine of four billion euros -lrb- 5.8 billion dollars -rrb- in the us , according to the german business magazine wirtschaftswoche .
but for the time being , the company 's businesses - medical equipment , manufacturing , trains and electric power stations - remain healthy .
the company posted a huge increase in first quarter profit from 788 million euros to 6.5 billion owing to the sale of the auto equipment parts company vdo .
operating profit for the first three months of its 2007-2008 fiscal year , which began on october 1 , increased by 16 percent to 1.7 billion euros , on sales which grew by 10 percent to 18.4 billion euros . dw staff -lrb- jp -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

speciality breweries and brew-pubs could change that , but they 've not really become popular - so far . beer may be germany 's unofficial national drink , but more and more germans seem to be losing their taste for it .
according to the german brewer 's association , beer consumption fell by around 18 percent from 1992 to 2006 . one person who 's not affected by the decline is berlin 's oliver lemke , the owner of one of the few independent brewpubs in the german capital .
business is up in all four of his establishments , the first of which opened in 1999 .
he said the overall slump reflects the destruction of small local breweries by big corporations . " there used to be 100 breweries in this neighborhood alone , " lemke said .
" they died out in the 1970s with the trend toward mono-breweries .
the big breweries - for example warsteiner or licher – said : ‘ we 're only going to make one sort of beer , a premium pilsner , and we 'll market it nationwide . '
and that inevitably leads to a dead-end .
at some point , even the world 's biggest idiot notices that there 's virtually no difference between a warsteiner and licher . " popsicle flavorings or real ale ? bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : berlin 's brauhaus lemke has n't been affected by the slump germany has some 1,300 brewing companies , but the vast majority - including germany 's most famous brand , beck 's - belong to huge international conglomerates , and styles rarely stray from the standard pilsner and wheat varieties .
the main strategy among major brewers for interesting young people is to mix their products with everything from lemon flavor to cola . but why has n't germany gotten in on the micro-brewery and real-ale trends in the us or the uk ?
after all , no self-respecting manhattan yuppie would be seen with a bud light in his hand . " it 's a global interplay between wrong-headed marketing , the wrong sort of people as bar owners and the wrong retailing structures , " lemke said .
" that 's why those trends are under-represented here compared with the united states . " lemke is trying to change that .
his brewpubs revive almost forgotten brewing styles , such as amber ale or the double-hopped , non-filtered zwickel , and seasonal specialities such as the extra-strength märzen -lrb- " march beer " -rrb- .
they sell a respectable 2,500 hectoliters -lrb- 66,000 gallons -rrb- a year - and there 's no mistaking them for beck 's . alcohol abuse bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : nationally marketed brands forced many local breweries out of business in the 1970s but it 's difficult for independents to break through against the conglomerates .
the big brewing companies control distribution networks and encourage pub owners to feature their products exclusively by offering loans , price rebates and free tapping and refrigeration systems , beer glasses and even ashtrays . and german consumers and bar owners are ignorant about the drink itself , lemke said . " the german beer drinker thinks he knows a lot about beer , but most of them know very , very , little , " he said .
" it start 's with the myth that you need seven minutes to tap a good pilsner .
nonsense - that just makes it go flat and warm .
when i go to bars , i usually drink bottled beer because i know the tap beer has usually been physically abused .
it 's atrocious .
i know a lot of people in america that know far more about beer than people here in germany . " name recognition bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : what would a brewpub be without the obligatory copper brewing kettles ?
the first problem for small brewers is how to let potential customers know that they 're there . " that 's due in part to the marketing abilities of the big companies , " said marc-oliver huhnholz , press spokesman for the german brewers ' association .
" also america never drank as much beer as germany so small brewers can have more impact . " and to appeal to a new generation of potential beer drinkers , brewers have to take into account demographic shifts and the accompanying changes in personal taste . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : beer suffers from its image as a drink for older men " the average age in germany is rising , and older people tend to drink less , " huhnholz said .
" and among younger people , the trend is toward milder drinks - women especially prefer sweeter drinks .
they do n't want anything too bitter . " but huhnholz also thinks that small local breweries can play a role in stirring up new interest in - and appreciation for - beer . " small brewers have to offer an attractive product , and they need to do a lot of marketing , " huhnholz said .
" but some of them can succeed . " beer vs. bureaucracy bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : is germany 's bureaucracy preventing more small brew-pubs from opening ?
philipp brokamp would love to do that , but first he has to get started .
the 32-year-old brewer moved to berlin last year and is set to open his first brewpub , appropriately named hops and barley . without the support of a major corporation , that 's proven a daunting task .
germany 's notorious bureaucracy has n't made things any easier , brokamp said . " there 's the stereotype about bureaucracy , but i now know it 's not a stereotype , " said brokamp , who was forced to postpone opening due to red tape .
" i 've had to deal with at least eight separate government permit agencies , everything from the civil engineering office to offices for the environment and handicapped accessibility .
every one of them considered itself particularly important , but they could n't even agree on what the regulations were . " all that for a bar with a capacity of 100 , where the beer is made in the basement . while he 's tying up loose ends , brokamp is brewing light and dark beers as well as red ale and cider .
his style emphasizes malt more than lemke 's without being overly sweet . brokamp 's beers are also non-filtered , which means they look cloudy when poured .
but as he explains , cloudiness is good . " the things mass breweries filter out are n't impurities , " brokamp said .
" they 're very nutritious , and they make the beer more flavorful than filtered varieties . " think globally , drink locally bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : friedrichshain 's student crowds might be perfect for a micro-brewery lemke 's flagship brewpub is in the touristy neighborhood around berlin 's hackescher markt , while brokamp 's bar is located in the more residential area of friedrichshain .
he knows it will be a challenge to convince the locals to drink local stuff , but he 's confident . " i think that it 's exactly the right niche in the market , " brokamp said .
" general consumption is in decline .
people are more conscious and perhaps more choosey about what they drink .
and so i hope they 'll be interested in the sort of specialities that i 'll be offering . " brokamp will begin testing that hypothesis on feb .
2 , when hops and barley officially opens .
then he 'll see whether his neighbors are interested in trying something out of the ordinary or whether they prefer to just keep popping open beck 's - in decreasing numbers . jefferson chase send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

" kosovo is ready , is united , and i think we 'll proclaim the date -lrb- of independence -rrb- in pristina very soon , " thaci said after talks with eu foreign-policy chief javier solana .
" we have discussed many things - the constitution , the symbols .
kosovo is ready for independence .
it 's an issue of days , " he said .
solana , when asked if he had discussed the date of any such declaration with thaci , answered " no , i did not , " but added that he had agreed to maintain contacts with the kosovo albanians .
serbia is to hold the final round of its presidential election on february 3 , with ultra-nationalist candidate tomislav nikolic having taken the lead over pro-eu incumbent boris tadic in the first round .
kosovo is the most heated issue on the agenda , with nationalists accusing the eu of wanting to steal the province from them .
eu officials have been careful to steer clear of any comments which could inflame the situation ahead of the crucial vote .
" the issue is a very sensitive one and we are in a very sensitive political context in which it is better to resort to diplomatic means than public statements , " a spokeswoman for eu enlargement commissioner olli rehn told journalists .
eu reiterates its commitment balkan stability bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : " we wo n't give up kosovo " sums up the serbian stance thaci and rehn discussed " the european perspective of kosovo and the whole region of the western balkans as well as the issue of the settlement of kosovo 's status , " she said .
rehn " reiterated the eu 's readiness to carry its responsibility by steering a coordinated and managed process to finalize the settlement of kosovo 's status , " she said .
the question of what to do when kosovo declares independence is the most divisive issue in the eu at present .
a majority of member states favor recognizing the new state , but some have said that to do so would spark separatist moves elsewhere .
serb nationalists have expressed outrage at what they see as eu support for an attempt to break up their country .
nikolic has gone on the record as saying that serbia will never join the eu , and that he regrets the country is not a province of russia .
serbians stand firm against kosovo state bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : olli rehn wants a well-managed process for kosovo however , eu officials insist that serbia 's future is as a part of the bloc .
just hours after meeting thaci , rehn met with a serbian delegation to discuss serbia 's cooperation with the international criminal tribunal for the former yugoslavia -lrb- icty -rrb- .
eu leaders have said that they will not sign a stabilization and association agreement -lrb- saa -rrb- paving the way to candidate status for serbia until it cooperates fully with the icty .
rehn " reiterated his strong commitment to serbia 's european future , and would like to sign the saa soon , once the conditions are fulfilled , " the spokeswoman said .

" the reputation built by siemens for 160 years has been reduced to ashes , " said daniela bergdolt , from the dsw group of small investors .
" it is not satisfactory that the affair has not been wrapped up after more than a year , " complained hans hirt , who represented the british pension fund hermes .
in the latest twist to the " affair , " investigators have established that payments worth around 140 million euros -lrb- $ 206 million -rrb- have been found in the firm 's flagship medical equipment division , reported the daily süddeutsche zeitung thursday .
siemens ' most profitable division , its turnover averages some 10 billion euros a year .
until now , siemens has said such payments totalled around 1.3 billion euros .
the löscher effect bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : shareholders got a chance to voice their feelings exempted from the shareholders ' criticisms was siemens boss peter löscher , appointed six months ago following the disclosure of a well-stocked slush fund at the group .
shareholders ' hopes are resting on the shoulders of löscher , the first siemens boss to be hired from outside the group .
he has already renovated the management team and begun to simplify the company 's tentacular structure , reining in directors of siemens units abroad who have been dubbed " the princes . "
" what counts for me is clean business everywhere and always , and highest performance meeting the highest ethical standards , " he has said .
he has also revealed that the group had been hit with compliance costs to date of around 1.1 billion euros , plus around 520 million in tax liabilities and sanctions " whose scope can not be estimated . "
" intangible damage is much harder to measure - the loss of reputation and trust in the general public , " he said .
shareholder concerns others on the executive floor were given a rocky ride by investors , including those supposed to be controlling the group such as supervisory board gerhard cromme and his right-hand man , deutsche bank chairman josef ackermann .
according to afp , the association of small shareholders dsw intends to vote against a renewal of their mandates , which nonetheless seem assured .
among the top figures absent were former siemens boss klaus kleinfeld and former supervisory board president heinrich von pierer , the emblematic head of the group from 1992 to 2005 , who both left siemens last year .
one telling sign of the times was a decision by siemens to forego the traditional vote of confidence by which shareholders typically approve the management team 's performance over the past year .
but the supervisory board , including cromme and his right-hand man josef ackermann , the chairman of deutsche bank , were to face such a vote .
still in business bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : peter löscher it has been over a year since the first revelations emerged about shady dealings at siemens , often in the form of money alleged to have been paid under the table to obtain foreign contracts .
at last count , the biggest private german employer had acknowledged 1.3 billion euros in questionable funds .
according to press reports , internal allegations are still abounding , including the suggestion that corruption was present up to the higher spheres of the group .
the german group is listed on wall street and fears being slapped with a fine of four billion euros -lrb- 5.8 billion dollars -rrb- in the us , according to the german business magazine wirtschaftswoche .
but for the time being , the company 's businesses - medical equipment , manufacturing , trains and electric power stations - remain healthy .
the company posted a huge increase in first quarter profit from 788 million euros to 6.5 billion owing to the sale of the auto equipment parts company vdo .
operating profit for the first three months of its 2007-2008 fiscal year , which began on october 1 , increased by 16 percent to 1.7 billion euros , on sales which grew by 10 percent to 18.4 billion euros . dw staff -lrb- jp -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

11 attacks lawmakers from 47 european nations have strongly criticized a system of un and eu sanctions against suspected backers of global terrorism , saying the use of terrorist blacklists violates fundamental rights . the council of europe , the eu 's rights watchdog , rules urged the united nations and the european union to overhaul procedures to blacklist individuals and groups suspected of having links to terrorism .
not only does the practice violate human rights , the lawmakers concluded , but they are " completely arbitrary , " according to a statement released by the 47-member body .
a report commissioned by the rights body said people were blacklisted on the basis of " mere suspicion " and called the measures " deplorable and violation of human rights and fundamental freedoms . "
harsh penalties against suspects dick marty , a swiss senator and former prosecutor who has published critical reports into alleged anti-terrorist practices by states and institutions , including reported secret cia prisons on european soil , said those affected by the terrorist blacklists had absolutely no rights to defend themselves against terrorist allegations .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : marty said the practice gave suspects no chance of defending themselves " i have seldom experienced anything as unfair as the compilation of these lists , " marty said at the european parliament in strasbourg this week .
according to the report , around 370 people and 130 groups or organizations are currently on the un 's blacklist .
they include alleged taliban individuals and those linked to al qaeda .
the eu lists 60 people or groups - including the radical palestinian group hamas and the basque separatist group , eta .
set up after the sept .
11 attacks in 2001 , the lists impose a number of penalties on those suspected of backing terrorism .
they include freezing suspects ' assets and preventing them from traveling without giving them a court hearing or disclosing the evidence against them .
the council of europe said in its report that many suspects on the lists only discovered that they were on it after they were stopped at a border while travelling or when their bank accounts were frozen .
" people remain on these lists for years without knowing why , and their lives are ruined , " marty said .
marty 's investigation into the practice was sparked by the case of a 78-year-old italian citizen of arab descent , youssef nada whose business was ruined after he landed on the blacklist .
the cia reportedly suspected nada of belonging to a group of financiers behind the sept .
11 attacks .
but a four-year investigation by swiss authorities into nada 's case was suspended in 2005 due to a lack of evidence .
nada 's assets were seized and he was barred from leaving his home of 30 years in switzerland .
nada 's name remains on the terror blacklist .
top eu court may rule against un practice the un system is at present being scrutinized by the eu 's top court and there is a strong likelihood it may rule that the 27-member bloc has violated basic rights by applying them .
according to news agency reuters , an eu legal advisor has recommended the eu court of justice in luxembourg should cancel financial sanctions against a saudi businessman and a swedish-based money transfer business in two separate cases .
the agency quoted cameron doley , a british lawyer representing saudi businessman yassin kadi as saying that his client had never received a clear statement of the allegations against him .
kadi had filed his case in the eu because the un had no equivalent tribunal to which he could appeal .
" what this gives us , we hope , is a statement by one of the most prominent and respected courts in the world that this system is an unjustified infringement of the fundamental human rights of those persons who are listed , " doley told reuters . dw staff -lrb- sp -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

" kosovo is ready , is united , and i think we 'll proclaim the date -lrb- of independence -rrb- in pristina very soon , " thaci said after talks with eu foreign-policy chief javier solana .
" we have discussed many things - the constitution , the symbols .
kosovo is ready for independence .
it 's an issue of days , " he said .
solana , when asked if he had discussed the date of any such declaration with thaci , answered " no , i did not , " but added that he had agreed to maintain contacts with the kosovo albanians .
serbia is to hold the final round of its presidential election on february 3 , with ultra-nationalist candidate tomislav nikolic having taken the lead over pro-eu incumbent boris tadic in the first round .
kosovo is the most heated issue on the agenda , with nationalists accusing the eu of wanting to steal the province from them .
eu officials have been careful to steer clear of any comments which could inflame the situation ahead of the crucial vote .
" the issue is a very sensitive one and we are in a very sensitive political context in which it is better to resort to diplomatic means than public statements , " a spokeswoman for eu enlargement commissioner olli rehn told journalists .
eu reiterates its commitment balkan stability bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : " we wo n't give up kosovo " sums up the serbian stance thaci and rehn discussed " the european perspective of kosovo and the whole region of the western balkans as well as the issue of the settlement of kosovo 's status , " she said .
rehn " reiterated the eu 's readiness to carry its responsibility by steering a coordinated and managed process to finalize the settlement of kosovo 's status , " she said .
the question of what to do when kosovo declares independence is the most divisive issue in the eu at present .
a majority of member states favor recognizing the new state , but some have said that to do so would spark separatist moves elsewhere .
serb nationalists have expressed outrage at what they see as eu support for an attempt to break up their country .
nikolic has gone on the record as saying that serbia will never join the eu , and that he regrets the country is not a province of russia .
serbians stand firm against kosovo state bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : olli rehn wants a well-managed process for kosovo however , eu officials insist that serbia 's future is as a part of the bloc .
just hours after meeting thaci , rehn met with a serbian delegation to discuss serbia 's cooperation with the international criminal tribunal for the former yugoslavia -lrb- icty -rrb- .
eu leaders have said that they will not sign a stabilization and association agreement -lrb- saa -rrb- paving the way to candidate status for serbia until it cooperates fully with the icty .
rehn " reiterated his strong commitment to serbia 's european future , and would like to sign the saa soon , once the conditions are fulfilled , " the spokeswoman said .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de food and drink -pipe- 24.01.2008 micro-brewers hope to fight sinking beer sales in germany großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : germans are drinking less beer , but local specialties still sell well german beer consumption has been in steady decline since the early 1990s – - especially among young people .
speciality breweries and brew-pubs could change that , but they 've not really become popular - so far . beer may be germany 's unofficial national drink , but more and more germans seem to be losing their taste for it .
according to the german brewer 's association , beer consumption fell by around 18 percent from 1992 to 2006 . one person who 's not affected by the decline is berlin 's oliver lemke , the owner of one of the few independent brewpubs in the german capital .
business is up in all four of his establishments , the first of which opened in 1999 .
he said the overall slump reflects the destruction of small local breweries by big corporations . " there used to be 100 breweries in this neighborhood alone , " lemke said .
" they died out in the 1970s with the trend toward mono-breweries .
the big breweries - for example warsteiner or licher – said : ‘ we 're only going to make one sort of beer , a premium pilsner , and we 'll market it nationwide . '
and that inevitably leads to a dead-end .
at some point , even the world 's biggest idiot notices that there 's virtually no difference between a warsteiner and licher . " popsicle flavorings or real ale ? bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : berlin 's brauhaus lemke has n't been affected by the slump germany has some 1,300 brewing companies , but the vast majority - including germany 's most famous brand , beck 's - belong to huge international conglomerates , and styles rarely stray from the standard pilsner and wheat varieties .
the main strategy among major brewers for interesting young people is to mix their products with everything from lemon flavor to cola . but why has n't germany gotten in on the micro-brewery and real-ale trends in the us or the uk ?
after all , no self-respecting manhattan yuppie would be seen with a bud light in his hand . " it 's a global interplay between wrong-headed marketing , the wrong sort of people as bar owners and the wrong retailing structures , " lemke said .
" that 's why those trends are under-represented here compared with the united states . " lemke is trying to change that .
his brewpubs revive almost forgotten brewing styles , such as amber ale or the double-hopped , non-filtered zwickel , and seasonal specialities such as the extra-strength märzen -lrb- " march beer " -rrb- .
they sell a respectable 2,500 hectoliters -lrb- 66,000 gallons -rrb- a year - and there 's no mistaking them for beck 's . alcohol abuse bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : nationally marketed brands forced many local breweries out of business in the 1970s but it 's difficult for independents to break through against the conglomerates .
the big brewing companies control distribution networks and encourage pub owners to feature their products exclusively by offering loans , price rebates and free tapping and refrigeration systems , beer glasses and even ashtrays . and german consumers and bar owners are ignorant about the drink itself , lemke said . " the german beer drinker thinks he knows a lot about beer , but most of them know very , very , little , " he said .
" it start 's with the myth that you need seven minutes to tap a good pilsner .
nonsense - that just makes it go flat and warm .

speciality breweries and brew-pubs could change that , but they 've not really become popular - so far . beer may be germany 's unofficial national drink , but more and more germans seem to be losing their taste for it .
according to the german brewer 's association , beer consumption fell by around 18 percent from 1992 to 2006 . one person who 's not affected by the decline is berlin 's oliver lemke , the owner of one of the few independent brewpubs in the german capital .
business is up in all four of his establishments , the first of which opened in 1999 .
he said the overall slump reflects the destruction of small local breweries by big corporations . " there used to be 100 breweries in this neighborhood alone , " lemke said .
" they died out in the 1970s with the trend toward mono-breweries .
the big breweries - for example warsteiner or licher – said : ‘ we 're only going to make one sort of beer , a premium pilsner , and we 'll market it nationwide . '
and that inevitably leads to a dead-end .
at some point , even the world 's biggest idiot notices that there 's virtually no difference between a warsteiner and licher . " popsicle flavorings or real ale ? bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : berlin 's brauhaus lemke has n't been affected by the slump germany has some 1,300 brewing companies , but the vast majority - including germany 's most famous brand , beck 's - belong to huge international conglomerates , and styles rarely stray from the standard pilsner and wheat varieties .
the main strategy among major brewers for interesting young people is to mix their products with everything from lemon flavor to cola . but why has n't germany gotten in on the micro-brewery and real-ale trends in the us or the uk ?
after all , no self-respecting manhattan yuppie would be seen with a bud light in his hand . " it 's a global interplay between wrong-headed marketing , the wrong sort of people as bar owners and the wrong retailing structures , " lemke said .
" that 's why those trends are under-represented here compared with the united states . " lemke is trying to change that .
his brewpubs revive almost forgotten brewing styles , such as amber ale or the double-hopped , non-filtered zwickel , and seasonal specialities such as the extra-strength märzen -lrb- " march beer " -rrb- .
they sell a respectable 2,500 hectoliters -lrb- 66,000 gallons -rrb- a year - and there 's no mistaking them for beck 's . alcohol abuse bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : nationally marketed brands forced many local breweries out of business in the 1970s but it 's difficult for independents to break through against the conglomerates .
the big brewing companies control distribution networks and encourage pub owners to feature their products exclusively by offering loans , price rebates and free tapping and refrigeration systems , beer glasses and even ashtrays . and german consumers and bar owners are ignorant about the drink itself , lemke said . " the german beer drinker thinks he knows a lot about beer , but most of them know very , very , little , " he said .
" it start 's with the myth that you need seven minutes to tap a good pilsner .
nonsense - that just makes it go flat and warm .

but people should rather look on the bright side , one of germany 's leading business managers told deutsche welle . jürgen großmann , 55 , is the ceo of rwe , one of germany 's largest energy companies .
he talked to dw-radio on the sidelines of the world economic forum in davos , which started wednesday , jan .
23 . deutsche welle : the financial and stock market crisis is the dominating topic in davos .
what could german businesses and publicly traded companies do to prevent a stock value massacre like the one we 've seen at the beginning of the week ? bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : jürgen großmann jürgen großmann : central banks and governments will surely come up with macroeconomic measures .
the lowering of interest rates by the us federal reserve is a first step .
in terms of microeconomics , companies have to tell themselves again and again : the donkey gets daring when he feels too comfortable .
we have to keep our cost structures and our competitiveness under control for stock market success to return .
it 's right and important to correct things sometimes .
let 's see that we get our ships back in order ; that we stick to the course .
do n't panic .
that 's the worst thing that could happen .
instead , we should analyze the current situation with a clear head .
if we do that , we 'll emerge from this stronger , i believe . how much is germany affected by the financial crisis ? bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : it 's no fun to be a german stock broker at the momen the global economy naturally is connected via financial markets , insurances and banks .
if wealth is destroyed in one place , that clearly has an effect on the behavior of consumers and investors .
we 're all affected .
no one should think that he 's not simply because he does n't own any stock .
that 's completely wrong . many people would love to be in the position that germany 's been fighting for hard for decades .
they 're also working on becoming world champions .
everyone participates in globalization and there are only marginal groups that do n't .
here in davos , we 've seen many studies over the past couple of years that have all reached the same conclusion : when all is said and done , the global economy , and also the poorest countries , have benefited from globalization . the example of cell phone maker nokia , who is about to close a plan in bochum in western germany , shows that even jobs in booming sectors are n't safe any more in germany .
will protectionism return ?
will industrialized countries have to isolate their markets to a greater extent in order to secure jobs ? bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : if nokia goes to romania , germans have to fill the void the eu 's never dropped protectionism in certain sectors , such as agriculture .
the bitter thing about nokia is that the competitor 's not in southeast asia , but in the eu and that the shift of jobs might even be financed with eu money .
but we 're still profiting big time from globalization and we have to think about how we can respond to such challenges . running after investors with subsidies clearly is n't the way to do it .
we need to recollect ourselves and think about our own strengths and develop our own business concepts .
we need german entrepreneurs that say : okay , if nokia leaves , we 'll step in .

24 , that the countries would pay a far higher price for ignoring the environment . while the measures would cost consumers 3 euros -lrb- $ 4.37 -rrb- a week on average , " the cost of inaction is up to 10 times more than what we are proposing , " said commission president jose manuel barroso . " responding to the challenge of climate change is the ultimate political test for our generation , " he added .
" our package not only responds to this challenge , but holds the right answer to the challenge of energy security and is an opportunity that should create thousands of new businesses and millions of jobs . " urging eu members to curb their dependency on imports of fossil fuels and to step up their use of renewable energy and biofuels , he also laid out plans to make industry pay for the right to pollute . environmental gain , economic loss ? bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : what will the impact be on industry ?
the measures are designed to put into action the aim set by eu leaders last year to cut carbon dioxide emissions by 20 percent by 2020 , compared to 1990 levels . by then , the use of renewable energies like biomass , wind and solar power will have to have risen to 20 percent of all energy forms .
biofuels will also have to make up 10 percent of fuels used for transport . these targets would wean the bloc off coal and oil , as would a decision that power generators must pay from 2013 for all permits to emit carbon dioxide - but left industrial leaders wondering about the impact on industry . german utility rwe said the package called into question the future of coal . " coal is threatened in its economic viability , " rwe 's head of power generation , ulrich jobs , told reuters meanwhile , other energy-intensive sectors such as the steel , aluminum and chemical industries have accepted the principles of the plan but voiced similar concerns about the cost and impact on jobs and a drop in competitiveness .
the steel industry is expecting the shift to entail the loss of up to 300,000 jobs across europe . " we foresee that industry and individuals will be facing a huge rise in the cost of electricity , " said jürgen thumann , president of the german association of german industry in berlin wednesday .
" the pinch will be felt by energy-intensive industries but also by other sectors . " compromising competitiveness some companies also fear that the stringent emission targets will force them to move production outside the bloc - and further strengthen the competitiveness of china and india , which so far have no emission limits . announcing that the commission will be monitoring any negative repercussions on the labor market , barroso conceded this was " a risk " and said brussels would do what it could to counter it . " an international agreement is our absolute priority , " barroso told reporters .
" but let me be clear , if we do not make progress we will protect european companies . " eu environment commissioner stavros dimas has said that if competitors from the us and china have still failed to establish climate rules by 2011 , thereby allowing for cheap production , he would consider lightening the burden for european companies and forcing importers to buy emissions permits . germany 's concerns bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : glos is concerned too heavy a burden is being placed on germany with around 8.5 percent of eu energy coming from renewable forms , future load sharing will be based in part on gross domestic product . while german environment minister sigmar gabriel hailed the plan as " courageous , " economy minister michael glos warned that " it will destroy jobs in industries which consume a lot of energy . " glos also suggested that the commission 's plan left germany carrying an unfair share of the climate protection burden . " we can not accept that the eu commission simply says : germany wanted climate protection and should therefore do the lion 's share of the work . " he was backed up by joachim pfeiffer , the christian democrats ' energy expert . " the eu commission proposals are an attack on germany as an industrial location , " he said .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de terrorism -pipe- 24.01.2008 european rights watchdog slams eu , un terrorism blacklists großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the terrorism blacklists were set up in the wake of the sept .
11 attacks lawmakers from 47 european nations have strongly criticized a system of un and eu sanctions against suspected backers of global terrorism , saying the use of terrorist blacklists violates fundamental rights . the council of europe , the eu 's rights watchdog , rules urged the united nations and the european union to overhaul procedures to blacklist individuals and groups suspected of having links to terrorism .
not only does the practice violate human rights , the lawmakers concluded , but they are " completely arbitrary , " according to a statement released by the 47-member body .
a report commissioned by the rights body said people were blacklisted on the basis of " mere suspicion " and called the measures " deplorable and violation of human rights and fundamental freedoms . "
harsh penalties against suspects dick marty , a swiss senator and former prosecutor who has published critical reports into alleged anti-terrorist practices by states and institutions , including reported secret cia prisons on european soil , said those affected by the terrorist blacklists had absolutely no rights to defend themselves against terrorist allegations .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : marty said the practice gave suspects no chance of defending themselves " i have seldom experienced anything as unfair as the compilation of these lists , " marty said at the european parliament in strasbourg this week .
according to the report , around 370 people and 130 groups or organizations are currently on the un 's blacklist .
they include alleged taliban individuals and those linked to al qaeda .
the eu lists 60 people or groups - including the radical palestinian group hamas and the basque separatist group , eta .
set up after the sept .
11 attacks in 2001 , the lists impose a number of penalties on those suspected of backing terrorism .
they include freezing suspects ' assets and preventing them from traveling without giving them a court hearing or disclosing the evidence against them .
the council of europe said in its report that many suspects on the lists only discovered that they were on it after they were stopped at a border while travelling or when their bank accounts were frozen .
" people remain on these lists for years without knowing why , and their lives are ruined , " marty said .
marty 's investigation into the practice was sparked by the case of a 78-year-old italian citizen of arab descent , youssef nada whose business was ruined after he landed on the blacklist .
the cia reportedly suspected nada of belonging to a group of financiers behind the sept .
11 attacks .
but a four-year investigation by swiss authorities into nada 's case was suspended in 2005 due to a lack of evidence .
nada 's assets were seized and he was barred from leaving his home of 30 years in switzerland .
nada 's name remains on the terror blacklist .
top eu court may rule against un practice the un system is at present being scrutinized by the eu 's top court and there is a strong likelihood it may rule that the 27-member bloc has violated basic rights by applying them .
according to news agency reuters , an eu legal advisor has recommended the eu court of justice in luxembourg should cancel financial sanctions against a saudi businessman and a swedish-based money transfer business in two separate cases .
the agency quoted cameron doley , a british lawyer representing saudi businessman yassin kadi as saying that his client had never received a clear statement of the allegations against him .
kadi had filed his case in the eu because the un had no equivalent tribunal to which he could appeal .
" what this gives us , we hope , is a statement by one of the most prominent and respected courts in the world that this system is an unjustified infringement of the fundamental human rights of those persons who are listed , " doley told reuters . dw staff -lrb- sp -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

the rise in what is one of europe 's major economic indicators came despite this week 's torrid round of trading on global stock markets which fuelled fears of a global economic crisis .
" companies ' order books are bursting , " ifo economist hans günter russ told german news agency , dpa .
firms " remain optimistic about their exports , " he added .
german business defies fears analysts had predicted the closely watched index would show german business confidence sliding to 102.2 points this month on the back of worries that the shakeout in the us housing market could tip the giant us economy into recession .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : german companies are doing roaring business however , releasing the survey ifo president hans-werner sinn said , " on the whole , the condition of firms in german industry and trade continues to be robust . "
his comments echo the views of many economists who see germany acting as europe 's economic locomotive in the coming 12 months , despite the prospects of the nation 's growth rate slipping back a notch from 2.5 per cent in 2007 to below 2.0 per cent this year .
the germany economy grew at a perky 2.9 per cent in 2006 .
the ifo survey " underlines that fundamentally the euro area economy remains in good shape , " ' said elga bartsch from the us investment house morgan stanley .
" but it is clear that the headwinds are currently gaining momentum and , unless they blow over quickly , they will introduce downside risks to growth , inflation and interest rate forecasts , " she said .
asian demand help economy offset slump leading the ifo rise was an increase in german industry 's expectations of business conditions six months down the track , which nudged up to 99 from 98.2 in december .
however , underscoring the current economic uncertainty , the ifo index component gauging german executives ' assessment of the present situation dropped to 107.9 from 108.1 .
while germany 's key export sector is expected to lose some momentum this year , solid demand from the world 's key emerging economies in asia , eastern europe and the middle east is seen as helping to offset a slump in the us .
moreover , increased pay packets for german workers this year after a protracted period of wage stagnation as well as a continuing fall in unemployment are also forecast to help underpin consumer demand .
the surprise jump in the january ifo index added to the brighter mood prevailing on both german and european stocks markets after a highly volatile week in share trading and big falls in stock prices .
by mid-morning trading , frankfurt 's dax index was up almost five per cent with europe 's blue-chip stoxx 50 having gained nearly 4.0 per cent .
the rise in the ifo is likely to ease some of the pressure on the european central bank to follow the lead of other major central banks , notably the us federal reserve , and cut interest rates to help shore up economic confidence and in response to the signs of slowing growth . dw staff / dpa -lrb- sp -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de business -pipe- 24.01.2008 tensions at siemens agm as more corruption claims emerge großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : it will be years before siemens can put the scandal behind it as investors aired their grievances at the siemens general assembly of shareholders , allegations of corruption continue to emerge . some 10,000 investors came to munich on thursday for a general assembly of siemens shareholders , accusing the bosses of failing to address the spiraling corruption scandal .
" the reputation built by siemens for 160 years has been reduced to ashes , " said daniela bergdolt , from the dsw group of small investors .
" it is not satisfactory that the affair has not been wrapped up after more than a year , " complained hans hirt , who represented the british pension fund hermes .
in the latest twist to the " affair , " investigators have established that payments worth around 140 million euros -lrb- $ 206 million -rrb- have been found in the firm 's flagship medical equipment division , reported the daily süddeutsche zeitung thursday .
siemens ' most profitable division , its turnover averages some 10 billion euros a year .
until now , siemens has said such payments totalled around 1.3 billion euros .
the löscher effect bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : shareholders got a chance to voice their feelings exempted from the shareholders ' criticisms was siemens boss peter löscher , appointed six months ago following the disclosure of a well-stocked slush fund at the group .
shareholders ' hopes are resting on the shoulders of löscher , the first siemens boss to be hired from outside the group .
he has already renovated the management team and begun to simplify the company 's tentacular structure , reining in directors of siemens units abroad who have been dubbed " the princes . "
" what counts for me is clean business everywhere and always , and highest performance meeting the highest ethical standards , " he has said .
he has also revealed that the group had been hit with compliance costs to date of around 1.1 billion euros , plus around 520 million in tax liabilities and sanctions " whose scope can not be estimated . "
" intangible damage is much harder to measure - the loss of reputation and trust in the general public , " he said .
shareholder concerns others on the executive floor were given a rocky ride by investors , including those supposed to be controlling the group such as supervisory board gerhard cromme and his right-hand man , deutsche bank chairman josef ackermann .
according to afp , the association of small shareholders dsw intends to vote against a renewal of their mandates , which nonetheless seem assured .
among the top figures absent were former siemens boss klaus kleinfeld and former supervisory board president heinrich von pierer , the emblematic head of the group from 1992 to 2005 , who both left siemens last year .
one telling sign of the times was a decision by siemens to forego the traditional vote of confidence by which shareholders typically approve the management team 's performance over the past year .

he lost both italy was again thrown into political turmoil as prime minister romano prodi decided to leave office after he lost a crucial vote of confidence in the italian senate .
the opposition is calling for new elections . italy 's embattled prime minister romano prodi tendered his resignation after losing a vote of confidence in the senate on thursday , jan .
24 , by five votes . italian president giorgio napolitano who , according to news reports , " reserved the right " on whether to accept prodi 's resignation , convened the speakers of both houses of parliament for consultations friday . the result was 156 for the center-left government , 161 against and one abstention .
three senators were absent , including two non-elected life senators . napolitano must choose between calling early elections and setting up a transitional government to allow electoral reforms , which many deputies say are badly needed , to be enacted . prodi , the center-left leader who won elections in april 2006 by a handful of votes , went before the senate despite appeals by top leaders including napolitano to resign rather than face the vote . he appeared resigned to the prospect of losing the vote but determined to carry through with it on principle . " i am here because you can not hide from the judgment of those who represent the people , and our people are watching us , " he said . prodi has walked a tightrope trying to keep together his squabbling coalition , which ranges from centrist catholics to far-left communists . earlier plea falls on senate 's deaf ears dismissing calls for his resignation , prodi earlier urged senators to support his government . " italy does not have the luxury of halting -lrb- the work of -rrb- this government , " prodi said in the senate as he opened the scheduled debate preceding the vote . to those voting against him , prodi said they should ask what government and what parliamentary majority they wanted in place of " the legitimate one currently in office .

" we will have early elections , " university and research minister fabio mussi said thursday , voicing a view shared by some members of prodi 's eight-party coalition and the vast majority of the opposition including former prime minister silvio berlusconi . however the democratic party , the largest in the center-left government had said that if prodi were to fall , then electoral reforms - aimed at giving governments more stability by decreasing the influence of small parties - should be introduced before a new poll . napolitano , who has the power to dissolve parliament had also said in the past that a new electoral law would be needed before elections are held . mastella 's withdrawal of support prompts crisis prodi 's decision to test his support in parliament came after former justice minister clemente mastella said monday his small moderate udeur party would no longer support the governing coalition .
mastella resigned last week in the wake of a corruption scandal . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : mastella decided to pull his party out of prodi 's coalition his decision triggered the latest , and most serious crisis to strike prodi since he took office 20 months ago after winning italy 's closest post-world war ii election by just 25,000 votes in april 2006 .
prodi has had to rely on more than 30 confidence votes to push through legislation , including the government 's budget and foreign policy . in the wake of prodi 's resignation , berlusconi called for the president to dissolve parliament and call elections immediately . berlusconi also had to face four votes of confidence during his government 's turn in office .
berlusconi was the longest serving prime minister italy has had since world war ii .
italy has had 61 governments since 1945 . impact on economy in the run-up to prodi 's decision , political commentators and analysts were warning that holding elections now without amending italy 's messy electoral rules would only prolong the unstable system of coalition governments . reuters news agency reported that the current government turmoil took its toll on financial markets where spreads between italian government bonds and german bunds widened to near levels not seen for six-and-a-half years . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : alumnia urged italy to confront its political problems italy 's economy , which has long underperformed its peers in the euro zone , also suffered more bad news with the worst consumer confidence data for two-and-a-half years . eu commissioner for economic and monetary affairs joaquin almunia urged italy to resolve the situation as soon as possible because " only then can italy begin to confront its real problems , like the economy . " speaking to reporters outside the world economic forum in davos , switzerland , almunia reiterated : " we are currently in a time of economic difficulty and turbulence .

he lost both italy was again thrown into political turmoil as prime minister romano prodi decided to leave office after he lost a crucial vote of confidence in the italian senate .
the opposition is calling for new elections . italy 's embattled prime minister romano prodi tendered his resignation after losing a vote of confidence in the senate on thursday , jan .
24 , by five votes . italian president giorgio napolitano who , according to news reports , " reserved the right " on whether to accept prodi 's resignation , convened the speakers of both houses of parliament for consultations friday . the result was 156 for the center-left government , 161 against and one abstention .
three senators were absent , including two non-elected life senators . napolitano must choose between calling early elections and setting up a transitional government to allow electoral reforms , which many deputies say are badly needed , to be enacted . prodi , the center-left leader who won elections in april 2006 by a handful of votes , went before the senate despite appeals by top leaders including napolitano to resign rather than face the vote . he appeared resigned to the prospect of losing the vote but determined to carry through with it on principle . " i am here because you can not hide from the judgment of those who represent the people , and our people are watching us , " he said . prodi has walked a tightrope trying to keep together his squabbling coalition , which ranges from centrist catholics to far-left communists . earlier plea falls on senate 's deaf ears dismissing calls for his resignation , prodi earlier urged senators to support his government . " italy does not have the luxury of halting -lrb- the work of -rrb- this government , " prodi said in the senate as he opened the scheduled debate preceding the vote . to those voting against him , prodi said they should ask what government and what parliamentary majority they wanted in place of " the legitimate one currently in office . " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : president napolitano wanted prodi to step aside ahead of the vote earlier prodi met napolitano - who like others in the governing center-left coalition reportedly wanted the premier to make way for a caretaker government - before the senate vote . the embattled prime minister had already met napolitano before winning wednesday 's confidence vote in parliament 's lower house chamber of deputies where , unlike the senate , the government has a clear majority . recent defections have left the governing centre-left coalition with some 157 votes in the senate , while the opposition is expected to muster around 160 votes . " we will have early elections , " university and research minister fabio mussi said thursday , voicing a view shared by some members of prodi 's eight-party coalition and the vast majority of the opposition including former prime minister silvio berlusconi . however the democratic party , the largest in the center-left government had said that if prodi were to fall , then electoral reforms - aimed at giving governments more stability by decreasing the influence of small parties - should be introduced before a new poll . napolitano , who has the power to dissolve parliament had also said in the past that a new electoral law would be needed before elections are held . mastella 's withdrawal of support prompts crisis prodi 's decision to test his support in parliament came after former justice minister clemente mastella said monday his small moderate udeur party would no longer support the governing coalition .
mastella resigned last week in the wake of a corruption scandal . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : mastella decided to pull his party out of prodi 's coalition his decision triggered the latest , and most serious crisis to strike prodi since he took office 20 months ago after winning italy 's closest post-world war ii election by just 25,000 votes in april 2006 .
prodi has had to rely on more than 30 confidence votes to push through legislation , including the government 's budget and foreign policy . in the wake of prodi 's resignation , berlusconi called for the president to dissolve parliament and call elections immediately . berlusconi also had to face four votes of confidence during his government 's turn in office .

speciality breweries and brew-pubs could change that , but they 've not really become popular - so far . beer may be germany 's unofficial national drink , but more and more germans seem to be losing their taste for it .
according to the german brewer 's association , beer consumption fell by around 18 percent from 1992 to 2006 . one person who 's not affected by the decline is berlin 's oliver lemke , the owner of one of the few independent brewpubs in the german capital .
business is up in all four of his establishments , the first of which opened in 1999 .
he said the overall slump reflects the destruction of small local breweries by big corporations . " there used to be 100 breweries in this neighborhood alone , " lemke said .
" they died out in the 1970s with the trend toward mono-breweries .
the big breweries - for example warsteiner or licher – said : ‘ we 're only going to make one sort of beer , a premium pilsner , and we 'll market it nationwide . '
and that inevitably leads to a dead-end .
at some point , even the world 's biggest idiot notices that there 's virtually no difference between a warsteiner and licher . " popsicle flavorings or real ale ? bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : berlin 's brauhaus lemke has n't been affected by the slump germany has some 1,300 brewing companies , but the vast majority - including germany 's most famous brand , beck 's - belong to huge international conglomerates , and styles rarely stray from the standard pilsner and wheat varieties .
the main strategy among major brewers for interesting young people is to mix their products with everything from lemon flavor to cola . but why has n't germany gotten in on the micro-brewery and real-ale trends in the us or the uk ?
after all , no self-respecting manhattan yuppie would be seen with a bud light in his hand . " it 's a global interplay between wrong-headed marketing , the wrong sort of people as bar owners and the wrong retailing structures , " lemke said .
" that 's why those trends are under-represented here compared with the united states . " lemke is trying to change that .
his brewpubs revive almost forgotten brewing styles , such as amber ale or the double-hopped , non-filtered zwickel , and seasonal specialities such as the extra-strength märzen -lrb- " march beer " -rrb- .
they sell a respectable 2,500 hectoliters -lrb- 66,000 gallons -rrb- a year - and there 's no mistaking them for beck 's . alcohol abuse bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : nationally marketed brands forced many local breweries out of business in the 1970s but it 's difficult for independents to break through against the conglomerates .
the big brewing companies control distribution networks and encourage pub owners to feature their products exclusively by offering loans , price rebates and free tapping and refrigeration systems , beer glasses and even ashtrays . and german consumers and bar owners are ignorant about the drink itself , lemke said . " the german beer drinker thinks he knows a lot about beer , but most of them know very , very , little , " he said .
" it start 's with the myth that you need seven minutes to tap a good pilsner .
nonsense - that just makes it go flat and warm .
when i go to bars , i usually drink bottled beer because i know the tap beer has usually been physically abused .
it 's atrocious .
i know a lot of people in america that know far more about beer than people here in germany . " name recognition bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : what would a brewpub be without the obligatory copper brewing kettles ?
the first problem for small brewers is how to let potential customers know that they 're there . " that 's due in part to the marketing abilities of the big companies , " said marc-oliver huhnholz , press spokesman for the german brewers ' association .
" also america never drank as much beer as germany so small brewers can have more impact . " and to appeal to a new generation of potential beer drinkers , brewers have to take into account demographic shifts and the accompanying changes in personal taste . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : beer suffers from its image as a drink for older men " the average age in germany is rising , and older people tend to drink less , " huhnholz said .
" and among younger people , the trend is toward milder drinks - women especially prefer sweeter drinks .
they do n't want anything too bitter . " but huhnholz also thinks that small local breweries can play a role in stirring up new interest in - and appreciation for - beer . " small brewers have to offer an attractive product , and they need to do a lot of marketing , " huhnholz said .
" but some of them can succeed . " beer vs. bureaucracy bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : is germany 's bureaucracy preventing more small brew-pubs from opening ?
philipp brokamp would love to do that , but first he has to get started .
the 32-year-old brewer moved to berlin last year and is set to open his first brewpub , appropriately named hops and barley . without the support of a major corporation , that 's proven a daunting task .
germany 's notorious bureaucracy has n't made things any easier , brokamp said . " there 's the stereotype about bureaucracy , but i now know it 's not a stereotype , " said brokamp , who was forced to postpone opening due to red tape .
" i 've had to deal with at least eight separate government permit agencies , everything from the civil engineering office to offices for the environment and handicapped accessibility .
every one of them considered itself particularly important , but they could n't even agree on what the regulations were . " all that for a bar with a capacity of 100 , where the beer is made in the basement . while he 's tying up loose ends , brokamp is brewing light and dark beers as well as red ale and cider .
his style emphasizes malt more than lemke 's without being overly sweet . brokamp 's beers are also non-filtered , which means they look cloudy when poured .
but as he explains , cloudiness is good . " the things mass breweries filter out are n't impurities , " brokamp said .
" they 're very nutritious , and they make the beer more flavorful than filtered varieties . " think globally , drink locally bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : friedrichshain 's student crowds might be perfect for a micro-brewery lemke 's flagship brewpub is in the touristy neighborhood around berlin 's hackescher markt , while brokamp 's bar is located in the more residential area of friedrichshain .
he knows it will be a challenge to convince the locals to drink local stuff , but he 's confident . " i think that it 's exactly the right niche in the market , " brokamp said .
" general consumption is in decline .

speciality breweries and brew-pubs could change that , but they 've not really become popular - so far . beer may be germany 's unofficial national drink , but more and more germans seem to be losing their taste for it .
according to the german brewer 's association , beer consumption fell by around 18 percent from 1992 to 2006 . one person who 's not affected by the decline is berlin 's oliver lemke , the owner of one of the few independent brewpubs in the german capital .
business is up in all four of his establishments , the first of which opened in 1999 .
he said the overall slump reflects the destruction of small local breweries by big corporations . " there used to be 100 breweries in this neighborhood alone , " lemke said .
" they died out in the 1970s with the trend toward mono-breweries .
the big breweries - for example warsteiner or licher – said : ‘ we 're only going to make one sort of beer , a premium pilsner , and we 'll market it nationwide . '
and that inevitably leads to a dead-end .
at some point , even the world 's biggest idiot notices that there 's virtually no difference between a warsteiner and licher . " popsicle flavorings or real ale ? bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : berlin 's brauhaus lemke has n't been affected by the slump germany has some 1,300 brewing companies , but the vast majority - including germany 's most famous brand , beck 's - belong to huge international conglomerates , and styles rarely stray from the standard pilsner and wheat varieties .
the main strategy among major brewers for interesting young people is to mix their products with everything from lemon flavor to cola . but why has n't germany gotten in on the micro-brewery and real-ale trends in the us or the uk ?
after all , no self-respecting manhattan yuppie would be seen with a bud light in his hand . " it 's a global interplay between wrong-headed marketing , the wrong sort of people as bar owners and the wrong retailing structures , " lemke said .
" that 's why those trends are under-represented here compared with the united states . " lemke is trying to change that .
his brewpubs revive almost forgotten brewing styles , such as amber ale or the double-hopped , non-filtered zwickel , and seasonal specialities such as the extra-strength märzen -lrb- " march beer " -rrb- .
they sell a respectable 2,500 hectoliters -lrb- 66,000 gallons -rrb- a year - and there 's no mistaking them for beck 's . alcohol abuse bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : nationally marketed brands forced many local breweries out of business in the 1970s but it 's difficult for independents to break through against the conglomerates .
the big brewing companies control distribution networks and encourage pub owners to feature their products exclusively by offering loans , price rebates and free tapping and refrigeration systems , beer glasses and even ashtrays . and german consumers and bar owners are ignorant about the drink itself , lemke said . " the german beer drinker thinks he knows a lot about beer , but most of them know very , very , little , " he said .
" it start 's with the myth that you need seven minutes to tap a good pilsner .
nonsense - that just makes it go flat and warm .
when i go to bars , i usually drink bottled beer because i know the tap beer has usually been physically abused .
it 's atrocious .
i know a lot of people in america that know far more about beer than people here in germany . " name recognition bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : what would a brewpub be without the obligatory copper brewing kettles ?
the first problem for small brewers is how to let potential customers know that they 're there . " that 's due in part to the marketing abilities of the big companies , " said marc-oliver huhnholz , press spokesman for the german brewers ' association .
" also america never drank as much beer as germany so small brewers can have more impact . " and to appeal to a new generation of potential beer drinkers , brewers have to take into account demographic shifts and the accompanying changes in personal taste . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : beer suffers from its image as a drink for older men " the average age in germany is rising , and older people tend to drink less , " huhnholz said .
" and among younger people , the trend is toward milder drinks - women especially prefer sweeter drinks .
they do n't want anything too bitter . " but huhnholz also thinks that small local breweries can play a role in stirring up new interest in - and appreciation for - beer . " small brewers have to offer an attractive product , and they need to do a lot of marketing , " huhnholz said .
" but some of them can succeed . " beer vs. bureaucracy bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : is germany 's bureaucracy preventing more small brew-pubs from opening ?
philipp brokamp would love to do that , but first he has to get started .
the 32-year-old brewer moved to berlin last year and is set to open his first brewpub , appropriately named hops and barley . without the support of a major corporation , that 's proven a daunting task .
germany 's notorious bureaucracy has n't made things any easier , brokamp said . " there 's the stereotype about bureaucracy , but i now know it 's not a stereotype , " said brokamp , who was forced to postpone opening due to red tape .
" i 've had to deal with at least eight separate government permit agencies , everything from the civil engineering office to offices for the environment and handicapped accessibility .
every one of them considered itself particularly important , but they could n't even agree on what the regulations were . " all that for a bar with a capacity of 100 , where the beer is made in the basement . while he 's tying up loose ends , brokamp is brewing light and dark beers as well as red ale and cider .
his style emphasizes malt more than lemke 's without being overly sweet . brokamp 's beers are also non-filtered , which means they look cloudy when poured .
but as he explains , cloudiness is good . " the things mass breweries filter out are n't impurities , " brokamp said .
" they 're very nutritious , and they make the beer more flavorful than filtered varieties . " think globally , drink locally bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : friedrichshain 's student crowds might be perfect for a micro-brewery lemke 's flagship brewpub is in the touristy neighborhood around berlin 's hackescher markt , while brokamp 's bar is located in the more residential area of friedrichshain .
he knows it will be a challenge to convince the locals to drink local stuff , but he 's confident . " i think that it 's exactly the right niche in the market , " brokamp said .
" general consumption is in decline .
people are more conscious and perhaps more choosey about what they drink .
and so i hope they 'll be interested in the sort of specialities that i 'll be offering . " brokamp will begin testing that hypothesis on feb .

speciality breweries and brew-pubs could change that , but they 've not really become popular - so far . beer may be germany 's unofficial national drink , but more and more germans seem to be losing their taste for it .
according to the german brewer 's association , beer consumption fell by around 18 percent from 1992 to 2006 . one person who 's not affected by the decline is berlin 's oliver lemke , the owner of one of the few independent brewpubs in the german capital .
business is up in all four of his establishments , the first of which opened in 1999 .
he said the overall slump reflects the destruction of small local breweries by big corporations . " there used to be 100 breweries in this neighborhood alone , " lemke said .
" they died out in the 1970s with the trend toward mono-breweries .
the big breweries - for example warsteiner or licher – said : ‘ we 're only going to make one sort of beer , a premium pilsner , and we 'll market it nationwide . '
and that inevitably leads to a dead-end .
at some point , even the world 's biggest idiot notices that there 's virtually no difference between a warsteiner and licher . " popsicle flavorings or real ale ? bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : berlin 's brauhaus lemke has n't been affected by the slump germany has some 1,300 brewing companies , but the vast majority - including germany 's most famous brand , beck 's - belong to huge international conglomerates , and styles rarely stray from the standard pilsner and wheat varieties .
the main strategy among major brewers for interesting young people is to mix their products with everything from lemon flavor to cola . but why has n't germany gotten in on the micro-brewery and real-ale trends in the us or the uk ?
after all , no self-respecting manhattan yuppie would be seen with a bud light in his hand . " it 's a global interplay between wrong-headed marketing , the wrong sort of people as bar owners and the wrong retailing structures , " lemke said .
" that 's why those trends are under-represented here compared with the united states . " lemke is trying to change that .
his brewpubs revive almost forgotten brewing styles , such as amber ale or the double-hopped , non-filtered zwickel , and seasonal specialities such as the extra-strength märzen -lrb- " march beer " -rrb- .
they sell a respectable 2,500 hectoliters -lrb- 66,000 gallons -rrb- a year - and there 's no mistaking them for beck 's . alcohol abuse bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : nationally marketed brands forced many local breweries out of business in the 1970s but it 's difficult for independents to break through against the conglomerates .
the big brewing companies control distribution networks and encourage pub owners to feature their products exclusively by offering loans , price rebates and free tapping and refrigeration systems , beer glasses and even ashtrays . and german consumers and bar owners are ignorant about the drink itself , lemke said . " the german beer drinker thinks he knows a lot about beer , but most of them know very , very , little , " he said .
" it start 's with the myth that you need seven minutes to tap a good pilsner .
nonsense - that just makes it go flat and warm .
when i go to bars , i usually drink bottled beer because i know the tap beer has usually been physically abused .
it 's atrocious .
i know a lot of people in america that know far more about beer than people here in germany . " name recognition bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : what would a brewpub be without the obligatory copper brewing kettles ?
the first problem for small brewers is how to let potential customers know that they 're there . " that 's due in part to the marketing abilities of the big companies , " said marc-oliver huhnholz , press spokesman for the german brewers ' association .
" also america never drank as much beer as germany so small brewers can have more impact . " and to appeal to a new generation of potential beer drinkers , brewers have to take into account demographic shifts and the accompanying changes in personal taste . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : beer suffers from its image as a drink for older men " the average age in germany is rising , and older people tend to drink less , " huhnholz said .
" and among younger people , the trend is toward milder drinks - women especially prefer sweeter drinks .
they do n't want anything too bitter . " but huhnholz also thinks that small local breweries can play a role in stirring up new interest in - and appreciation for - beer . " small brewers have to offer an attractive product , and they need to do a lot of marketing , " huhnholz said .
" but some of them can succeed . " beer vs. bureaucracy bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : is germany 's bureaucracy preventing more small brew-pubs from opening ?
philipp brokamp would love to do that , but first he has to get started .
the 32-year-old brewer moved to berlin last year and is set to open his first brewpub , appropriately named hops and barley . without the support of a major corporation , that 's proven a daunting task .
germany 's notorious bureaucracy has n't made things any easier , brokamp said . " there 's the stereotype about bureaucracy , but i now know it 's not a stereotype , " said brokamp , who was forced to postpone opening due to red tape .
" i 've had to deal with at least eight separate government permit agencies , everything from the civil engineering office to offices for the environment and handicapped accessibility .
every one of them considered itself particularly important , but they could n't even agree on what the regulations were . " all that for a bar with a capacity of 100 , where the beer is made in the basement . while he 's tying up loose ends , brokamp is brewing light and dark beers as well as red ale and cider .
his style emphasizes malt more than lemke 's without being overly sweet . brokamp 's beers are also non-filtered , which means they look cloudy when poured .
but as he explains , cloudiness is good . " the things mass breweries filter out are n't impurities , " brokamp said .
" they 're very nutritious , and they make the beer more flavorful than filtered varieties . " think globally , drink locally bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : friedrichshain 's student crowds might be perfect for a micro-brewery lemke 's flagship brewpub is in the touristy neighborhood around berlin 's hackescher markt , while brokamp 's bar is located in the more residential area of friedrichshain .
he knows it will be a challenge to convince the locals to drink local stuff , but he 's confident . " i think that it 's exactly the right niche in the market , " brokamp said .
" general consumption is in decline .
people are more conscious and perhaps more choosey about what they drink .
and so i hope they 'll be interested in the sort of specialities that i 'll be offering . " brokamp will begin testing that hypothesis on feb .
2 , when hops and barley officially opens .
then he 'll see whether his neighbors are interested in trying something out of the ordinary or whether they prefer to just keep popping open beck 's - in decreasing numbers . jefferson chase send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

the rise in what is one of europe 's major economic indicators came despite this week 's torrid round of trading on global stock markets which fuelled fears of a global economic crisis .
" companies ' order books are bursting , " ifo economist hans günter russ told german news agency , dpa .
firms " remain optimistic about their exports , " he added .
german business defies fears analysts had predicted the closely watched index would show german business confidence sliding to 102.2 points this month on the back of worries that the shakeout in the us housing market could tip the giant us economy into recession .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : german companies are doing roaring business however , releasing the survey ifo president hans-werner sinn said , " on the whole , the condition of firms in german industry and trade continues to be robust . "
his comments echo the views of many economists who see germany acting as europe 's economic locomotive in the coming 12 months , despite the prospects of the nation 's growth rate slipping back a notch from 2.5 per cent in 2007 to below 2.0 per cent this year .
the germany economy grew at a perky 2.9 per cent in 2006 .
the ifo survey " underlines that fundamentally the euro area economy remains in good shape , " ' said elga bartsch from the us investment house morgan stanley .
" but it is clear that the headwinds are currently gaining momentum and , unless they blow over quickly , they will introduce downside risks to growth , inflation and interest rate forecasts , " she said .
asian demand help economy offset slump leading the ifo rise was an increase in german industry 's expectations of business conditions six months down the track , which nudged up to 99 from 98.2 in december .
however , underscoring the current economic uncertainty , the ifo index component gauging german executives ' assessment of the present situation dropped to 107.9 from 108.1 .
while germany 's key export sector is expected to lose some momentum this year , solid demand from the world 's key emerging economies in asia , eastern europe and the middle east is seen as helping to offset a slump in the us .
moreover , increased pay packets for german workers this year after a protracted period of wage stagnation as well as a continuing fall in unemployment are also forecast to help underpin consumer demand .

by mid-morning trading , frankfurt 's dax index was up almost five per cent with europe 's blue-chip stoxx 50 having gained nearly 4.0 per cent .

the rise in what is one of europe 's major economic indicators came despite this week 's torrid round of trading on global stock markets which fuelled fears of a global economic crisis .
" companies ' order books are bursting , " ifo economist hans günter russ told german news agency , dpa .
firms " remain optimistic about their exports , " he added .
german business defies fears analysts had predicted the closely watched index would show german business confidence sliding to 102.2 points this month on the back of worries that the shakeout in the us housing market could tip the giant us economy into recession .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : german companies are doing roaring business however , releasing the survey ifo president hans-werner sinn said , " on the whole , the condition of firms in german industry and trade continues to be robust . "
his comments echo the views of many economists who see germany acting as europe 's economic locomotive in the coming 12 months , despite the prospects of the nation 's growth rate slipping back a notch from 2.5 per cent in 2007 to below 2.0 per cent this year .
the germany economy grew at a perky 2.9 per cent in 2006 .
the ifo survey " underlines that fundamentally the euro area economy remains in good shape , " ' said elga bartsch from the us investment house morgan stanley .
" but it is clear that the headwinds are currently gaining momentum and , unless they blow over quickly , they will introduce downside risks to growth , inflation and interest rate forecasts , " she said .
asian demand help economy offset slump leading the ifo rise was an increase in german industry 's expectations of business conditions six months down the track , which nudged up to 99 from 98.2 in december .
however , underscoring the current economic uncertainty , the ifo index component gauging german executives ' assessment of the present situation dropped to 107.9 from 108.1 .
while germany 's key export sector is expected to lose some momentum this year , solid demand from the world 's key emerging economies in asia , eastern europe and the middle east is seen as helping to offset a slump in the us .
moreover , increased pay packets for german workers this year after a protracted period of wage stagnation as well as a continuing fall in unemployment are also forecast to help underpin consumer demand .
the surprise jump in the january ifo index added to the brighter mood prevailing on both german and european stocks markets after a highly volatile week in share trading and big falls in stock prices .
by mid-morning trading , frankfurt 's dax index was up almost five per cent with europe 's blue-chip stoxx 50 having gained nearly 4.0 per cent .
the rise in the ifo is likely to ease some of the pressure on the european central bank to follow the lead of other major central banks , notably the us federal reserve , and cut interest rates to help shore up economic confidence and in response to the signs of slowing growth . dw staff / dpa -lrb- sp -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

11 attacks lawmakers from 47 european nations have strongly criticized a system of un and eu sanctions against suspected backers of global terrorism , saying the use of terrorist blacklists violates fundamental rights . the council of europe , the eu 's rights watchdog , rules urged the united nations and the european union to overhaul procedures to blacklist individuals and groups suspected of having links to terrorism .
not only does the practice violate human rights , the lawmakers concluded , but they are " completely arbitrary , " according to a statement released by the 47-member body .
a report commissioned by the rights body said people were blacklisted on the basis of " mere suspicion " and called the measures " deplorable and violation of human rights and fundamental freedoms . "
harsh penalties against suspects dick marty , a swiss senator and former prosecutor who has published critical reports into alleged anti-terrorist practices by states and institutions , including reported secret cia prisons on european soil , said those affected by the terrorist blacklists had absolutely no rights to defend themselves against terrorist allegations .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : marty said the practice gave suspects no chance of defending themselves " i have seldom experienced anything as unfair as the compilation of these lists , " marty said at the european parliament in strasbourg this week .
according to the report , around 370 people and 130 groups or organizations are currently on the un 's blacklist .
they include alleged taliban individuals and those linked to al qaeda .
the eu lists 60 people or groups - including the radical palestinian group hamas and the basque separatist group , eta .
set up after the sept .
11 attacks in 2001 , the lists impose a number of penalties on those suspected of backing terrorism .
they include freezing suspects ' assets and preventing them from traveling without giving them a court hearing or disclosing the evidence against them .
the council of europe said in its report that many suspects on the lists only discovered that they were on it after they were stopped at a border while travelling or when their bank accounts were frozen .
" people remain on these lists for years without knowing why , and their lives are ruined , " marty said .
marty 's investigation into the practice was sparked by the case of a 78-year-old italian citizen of arab descent , youssef nada whose business was ruined after he landed on the blacklist .
the cia reportedly suspected nada of belonging to a group of financiers behind the sept .
11 attacks .
but a four-year investigation by swiss authorities into nada 's case was suspended in 2005 due to a lack of evidence .
nada 's assets were seized and he was barred from leaving his home of 30 years in switzerland .
nada 's name remains on the terror blacklist .

the agency quoted cameron doley , a british lawyer representing saudi businessman yassin kadi as saying that his client had never received a clear statement of the allegations against him .
kadi had filed his case in the eu because the un had no equivalent tribunal to which he could appeal .

11 attacks lawmakers from 47 european nations have strongly criticized a system of un and eu sanctions against suspected backers of global terrorism , saying the use of terrorist blacklists violates fundamental rights . the council of europe , the eu 's rights watchdog , rules urged the united nations and the european union to overhaul procedures to blacklist individuals and groups suspected of having links to terrorism .
not only does the practice violate human rights , the lawmakers concluded , but they are " completely arbitrary , " according to a statement released by the 47-member body .
a report commissioned by the rights body said people were blacklisted on the basis of " mere suspicion " and called the measures " deplorable and violation of human rights and fundamental freedoms . "
harsh penalties against suspects dick marty , a swiss senator and former prosecutor who has published critical reports into alleged anti-terrorist practices by states and institutions , including reported secret cia prisons on european soil , said those affected by the terrorist blacklists had absolutely no rights to defend themselves against terrorist allegations .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : marty said the practice gave suspects no chance of defending themselves " i have seldom experienced anything as unfair as the compilation of these lists , " marty said at the european parliament in strasbourg this week .
according to the report , around 370 people and 130 groups or organizations are currently on the un 's blacklist .
they include alleged taliban individuals and those linked to al qaeda .
the eu lists 60 people or groups - including the radical palestinian group hamas and the basque separatist group , eta .
set up after the sept .
11 attacks in 2001 , the lists impose a number of penalties on those suspected of backing terrorism .
they include freezing suspects ' assets and preventing them from traveling without giving them a court hearing or disclosing the evidence against them .
the council of europe said in its report that many suspects on the lists only discovered that they were on it after they were stopped at a border while travelling or when their bank accounts were frozen .
" people remain on these lists for years without knowing why , and their lives are ruined , " marty said .
marty 's investigation into the practice was sparked by the case of a 78-year-old italian citizen of arab descent , youssef nada whose business was ruined after he landed on the blacklist .
the cia reportedly suspected nada of belonging to a group of financiers behind the sept .
11 attacks .
but a four-year investigation by swiss authorities into nada 's case was suspended in 2005 due to a lack of evidence .
nada 's assets were seized and he was barred from leaving his home of 30 years in switzerland .
nada 's name remains on the terror blacklist .
top eu court may rule against un practice the un system is at present being scrutinized by the eu 's top court and there is a strong likelihood it may rule that the 27-member bloc has violated basic rights by applying them .
according to news agency reuters , an eu legal advisor has recommended the eu court of justice in luxembourg should cancel financial sanctions against a saudi businessman and a swedish-based money transfer business in two separate cases .
the agency quoted cameron doley , a british lawyer representing saudi businessman yassin kadi as saying that his client had never received a clear statement of the allegations against him .
kadi had filed his case in the eu because the un had no equivalent tribunal to which he could appeal .

" kosovo is ready , is united , and i think we 'll proclaim the date -lrb- of independence -rrb- in pristina very soon , " thaci said after talks with eu foreign-policy chief javier solana .
" we have discussed many things - the constitution , the symbols .
kosovo is ready for independence .
it 's an issue of days , " he said .
solana , when asked if he had discussed the date of any such declaration with thaci , answered " no , i did not , " but added that he had agreed to maintain contacts with the kosovo albanians .
serbia is to hold the final round of its presidential election on february 3 , with ultra-nationalist candidate tomislav nikolic having taken the lead over pro-eu incumbent boris tadic in the first round .
kosovo is the most heated issue on the agenda , with nationalists accusing the eu of wanting to steal the province from them .
eu officials have been careful to steer clear of any comments which could inflame the situation ahead of the crucial vote .
" the issue is a very sensitive one and we are in a very sensitive political context in which it is better to resort to diplomatic means than public statements , " a spokeswoman for eu enlargement commissioner olli rehn told journalists .
eu reiterates its commitment balkan stability bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : " we wo n't give up kosovo " sums up the serbian stance thaci and rehn discussed " the european perspective of kosovo and the whole region of the western balkans as well as the issue of the settlement of kosovo 's status , " she said .
rehn " reiterated the eu 's readiness to carry its responsibility by steering a coordinated and managed process to finalize the settlement of kosovo 's status , " she said .
the question of what to do when kosovo declares independence is the most divisive issue in the eu at present .
a majority of member states favor recognizing the new state , but some have said that to do so would spark separatist moves elsewhere .
serb nationalists have expressed outrage at what they see as eu support for an attempt to break up their country .
nikolic has gone on the record as saying that serbia will never join the eu , and that he regrets the country is not a province of russia .
serbians stand firm against kosovo state bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : olli rehn wants a well-managed process for kosovo however , eu officials insist that serbia 's future is as a part of the bloc .
just hours after meeting thaci , rehn met with a serbian delegation to discuss serbia 's cooperation with the international criminal tribunal for the former yugoslavia -lrb- icty -rrb- .
eu leaders have said that they will not sign a stabilization and association agreement -lrb- saa -rrb- paving the way to candidate status for serbia until it cooperates fully with the icty .
rehn " reiterated his strong commitment to serbia 's european future , and would like to sign the saa soon , once the conditions are fulfilled , " the spokeswoman said .

solana , when asked if he had discussed the date of any such declaration with thaci , answered " no , i did not , " but added that he had agreed to maintain contacts with the kosovo albanians .
serbia is to hold the final round of its presidential election on february 3 , with ultra-nationalist candidate tomislav nikolic having taken the lead over pro-eu incumbent boris tadic in the first round .
kosovo is the most heated issue on the agenda , with nationalists accusing the eu of wanting to steal the province from them .
eu officials have been careful to steer clear of any comments which could inflame the situation ahead of the crucial vote .
" the issue is a very sensitive one and we are in a very sensitive political context in which it is better to resort to diplomatic means than public statements , " a spokeswoman for eu enlargement commissioner olli rehn told journalists .

rehn " reiterated the eu 's readiness to carry its responsibility by steering a coordinated and managed process to finalize the settlement of kosovo 's status , " she said .
the question of what to do when kosovo declares independence is the most divisive issue in the eu at present .
a majority of member states favor recognizing the new state , but some have said that to do so would spark separatist moves elsewhere .
serb nationalists have expressed outrage at what they see as eu support for an attempt to break up their country .
nikolic has gone on the record as saying that serbia will never join the eu , and that he regrets the country is not a province of russia .
serbians stand firm against kosovo state bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : olli rehn wants a well-managed process for kosovo however , eu officials insist that serbia 's future is as a part of the bloc .
just hours after meeting thaci , rehn met with a serbian delegation to discuss serbia 's cooperation with the international criminal tribunal for the former yugoslavia -lrb- icty -rrb- .
eu leaders have said that they will not sign a stabilization and association agreement -lrb- saa -rrb- paving the way to candidate status for serbia until it cooperates fully with the icty .
rehn " reiterated his strong commitment to serbia 's european future , and would like to sign the saa soon , once the conditions are fulfilled , " the spokeswoman said .

" kosovo is ready , is united , and i think we 'll proclaim the date -lrb- of independence -rrb- in pristina very soon , " thaci said after talks with eu foreign-policy chief javier solana .
" we have discussed many things - the constitution , the symbols .
kosovo is ready for independence .
it 's an issue of days , " he said .
solana , when asked if he had discussed the date of any such declaration with thaci , answered " no , i did not , " but added that he had agreed to maintain contacts with the kosovo albanians .
serbia is to hold the final round of its presidential election on february 3 , with ultra-nationalist candidate tomislav nikolic having taken the lead over pro-eu incumbent boris tadic in the first round .
kosovo is the most heated issue on the agenda , with nationalists accusing the eu of wanting to steal the province from them .
eu officials have been careful to steer clear of any comments which could inflame the situation ahead of the crucial vote .
" the issue is a very sensitive one and we are in a very sensitive political context in which it is better to resort to diplomatic means than public statements , " a spokeswoman for eu enlargement commissioner olli rehn told journalists .
eu reiterates its commitment balkan stability bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : " we wo n't give up kosovo " sums up the serbian stance thaci and rehn discussed " the european perspective of kosovo and the whole region of the western balkans as well as the issue of the settlement of kosovo 's status , " she said .
rehn " reiterated the eu 's readiness to carry its responsibility by steering a coordinated and managed process to finalize the settlement of kosovo 's status , " she said .
the question of what to do when kosovo declares independence is the most divisive issue in the eu at present .
a majority of member states favor recognizing the new state , but some have said that to do so would spark separatist moves elsewhere .
serb nationalists have expressed outrage at what they see as eu support for an attempt to break up their country .
nikolic has gone on the record as saying that serbia will never join the eu , and that he regrets the country is not a province of russia .
serbians stand firm against kosovo state bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : olli rehn wants a well-managed process for kosovo however , eu officials insist that serbia 's future is as a part of the bloc .
just hours after meeting thaci , rehn met with a serbian delegation to discuss serbia 's cooperation with the international criminal tribunal for the former yugoslavia -lrb- icty -rrb- .
eu leaders have said that they will not sign a stabilization and association agreement -lrb- saa -rrb- paving the way to candidate status for serbia until it cooperates fully with the icty .
rehn " reiterated his strong commitment to serbia 's european future , and would like to sign the saa soon , once the conditions are fulfilled , " the spokeswoman said .

" responding to the challenge of climate change is the ultimate political test for our generation , " he added .
" our package not only responds to this challenge , but holds the right answer to the challenge of energy security and is an opportunity that should create thousands of new businesses and millions of jobs .

the measures are designed to put into action the aim set by eu leaders last year to cut carbon dioxide emissions by 20 percent by 2020 , compared to 1990 levels . by then , the use of renewable energies like biomass , wind and solar power will have to have risen to 20 percent of all energy forms .
biofuels will also have to make up 10 percent of fuels used for transport . these targets would wean the bloc off coal and oil , as would a decision that power generators must pay from 2013 for all permits to emit carbon dioxide - but left industrial leaders wondering about the impact on industry . german utility rwe said the package called into question the future of coal . " coal is threatened in its economic viability , " rwe 's head of power generation , ulrich jobs , told reuters meanwhile , other energy-intensive sectors such as the steel , aluminum and chemical industries have accepted the principles of the plan but voiced similar concerns about the cost and impact on jobs and a drop in competitiveness .
the steel industry is expecting the shift to entail the loss of up to 300,000 jobs across europe . " we foresee that industry and individuals will be facing a huge rise in the cost of electricity , " said jürgen thumann , president of the german association of german industry in berlin wednesday .

" an international agreement is our absolute priority , " barroso told reporters .
" but let me be clear , if we do not make progress we will protect european companies . " eu environment commissioner stavros dimas has said that if competitors from the us and china have still failed to establish climate rules by 2011 , thereby allowing for cheap production , he would consider lightening the burden for european companies and forcing importers to buy emissions permits . germany 's concerns bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : glos is concerned too heavy a burden is being placed on germany with around 8.5 percent of eu energy coming from renewable forms , future load sharing will be based in part on gross domestic product . while german environment minister sigmar gabriel hailed the plan as " courageous , " economy minister michael glos warned that " it will destroy jobs in industries which consume a lot of energy .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de holocaust -pipe- 24.01.2008 nazi death train exhibit opens in berlin station großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : thousands of people were murdered by the nazis in the auschwitz concentration camp an exhibition on the deportation of jewish children to nazi death camps has opened in a berlin train station .
germany 's rail company had initially rejected the idea , but bowed to pressure from the transport minister . ordinary people supported the nazi dictatorship in their everyday lives , which is why the exhibit about these crimes must be shown in an everyday place , transport minister wolfgang tiefensee said wednesday , jan .
23 , at the opening of the exhibition potsdamer platz station in downtown berlin . forty information boards with photos , personal testimonies , biographies and diagrams detail the fate of , among others , 11,400 jewish children who were deported from france to the auschwitz death camp by train between 1942 and 1944 . the exhibition , which also honors the sinti roma deported and killed by the nazis , is a replicate of a similar show that took place in french train stations four years ago .
both were organized by the french-german couple beate and serge klarsfeld , who founded the organization sons and daughters of jews deported from france . poignant location despite commuter chaos bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : nazi-hunter klarsfeld outlined the personal stories of thousands of deported children " putting an exhibition in a station is very different from putting it in a museum , " serge klarsfeld told the afp news agency on wednesday .
" it speaks to the german people directly . " however , deutsche bahn , germany 's national rail operator , had at first opposed the proposal to transform train station into a place of remembrance . " the subject is too serious , " deutsche bahn chief hartmut mehdorn said in october 2006 .

but people should rather look on the bright side , one of germany 's leading business managers told deutsche welle . jürgen großmann , 55 , is the ceo of rwe , one of germany 's largest energy companies .
he talked to dw-radio on the sidelines of the world economic forum in davos , which started wednesday , jan .
23 . deutsche welle : the financial and stock market crisis is the dominating topic in davos .
what could german businesses and publicly traded companies do to prevent a stock value massacre like the one we 've seen at the beginning of the week ? bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : jürgen großmann jürgen großmann : central banks and governments will surely come up with macroeconomic measures .
the lowering of interest rates by the us federal reserve is a first step .
in terms of microeconomics , companies have to tell themselves again and again : the donkey gets daring when he feels too comfortable .
we have to keep our cost structures and our competitiveness under control for stock market success to return .
it 's right and important to correct things sometimes .
let 's see that we get our ships back in order ; that we stick to the course .
do n't panic .
that 's the worst thing that could happen .
instead , we should analyze the current situation with a clear head .
if we do that , we 'll emerge from this stronger , i believe . how much is germany affected by the financial crisis ? bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : it 's no fun to be a german stock broker at the momen the global economy naturally is connected via financial markets , insurances and banks .
if wealth is destroyed in one place , that clearly has an effect on the behavior of consumers and investors .
we 're all affected .
no one should think that he 's not simply because he does n't own any stock .
that 's completely wrong . many people would love to be in the position that germany 's been fighting for hard for decades .
they 're also working on becoming world champions .
everyone participates in globalization and there are only marginal groups that do n't .
here in davos , we 've seen many studies over the past couple of years that have all reached the same conclusion : when all is said and done , the global economy , and also the poorest countries , have benefited from globalization . the example of cell phone maker nokia , who is about to close a plan in bochum in western germany , shows that even jobs in booming sectors are n't safe any more in germany .
will protectionism return ?
will industrialized countries have to isolate their markets to a greater extent in order to secure jobs ? bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : if nokia goes to romania , germans have to fill the void the eu 's never dropped protectionism in certain sectors , such as agriculture .
the bitter thing about nokia is that the competitor 's not in southeast asia , but in the eu and that the shift of jobs might even be financed with eu money .
but we 're still profiting big time from globalization and we have to think about how we can respond to such challenges . running after investors with subsidies clearly is n't the way to do it .
we need to recollect ourselves and think about our own strengths and develop our own business concepts .
we need german entrepreneurs that say : okay , if nokia leaves , we 'll step in .
we need good new ideas backed by innovation and we can develop them - it 's possible in germany . interview : marco vollmar -lrb- win -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?
dw-world.de trade union talks with nokia fruitless , german plant to close the german trade union ig metall said tuesday , jan .
22 , that its talks with finnish cell-phone maker nokia had been unsuccessful , but vowed to continue the fight to keep a german factory open .
-lrb- 22.01.2008 -rrb- effects of us recession could be held at bay , experts say global markets have plunged , partly due to fear of a recession in the united states , the world 's biggest economy .
but european experts say dynamic developing countries like china could offset us troubles .
-lrb- 22.01.2008 -rrb- european press review : no reason to panic over stock plummet asian and european stock markets plunged by as much as 7 percent on monday and the german dax experienced the worst drop since sept .
11 , 2001 .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de food and drink -pipe- 24.01.2008 micro-brewers hope to fight sinking beer sales in germany großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : germans are drinking less beer , but local specialties still sell well german beer consumption has been in steady decline since the early 1990s – - especially among young people .
speciality breweries and brew-pubs could change that , but they 've not really become popular - so far . beer may be germany 's unofficial national drink , but more and more germans seem to be losing their taste for it .
according to the german brewer 's association , beer consumption fell by around 18 percent from 1992 to 2006 . one person who 's not affected by the decline is berlin 's oliver lemke , the owner of one of the few independent brewpubs in the german capital .
business is up in all four of his establishments , the first of which opened in 1999 .
he said the overall slump reflects the destruction of small local breweries by big corporations . " there used to be 100 breweries in this neighborhood alone , " lemke said .
" they died out in the 1970s with the trend toward mono-breweries .
the big breweries - for example warsteiner or licher – said : ‘ we 're only going to make one sort of beer , a premium pilsner , and we 'll market it nationwide . '
and that inevitably leads to a dead-end .
at some point , even the world 's biggest idiot notices that there 's virtually no difference between a warsteiner and licher . " popsicle flavorings or real ale ? bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : berlin 's brauhaus lemke has n't been affected by the slump germany has some 1,300 brewing companies , but the vast majority - including germany 's most famous brand , beck 's - belong to huge international conglomerates , and styles rarely stray from the standard pilsner and wheat varieties .
the main strategy among major brewers for interesting young people is to mix their products with everything from lemon flavor to cola . but why has n't germany gotten in on the micro-brewery and real-ale trends in the us or the uk ?
after all , no self-respecting manhattan yuppie would be seen with a bud light in his hand . " it 's a global interplay between wrong-headed marketing , the wrong sort of people as bar owners and the wrong retailing structures , " lemke said .
" that 's why those trends are under-represented here compared with the united states . " lemke is trying to change that .
his brewpubs revive almost forgotten brewing styles , such as amber ale or the double-hopped , non-filtered zwickel , and seasonal specialities such as the extra-strength märzen -lrb- " march beer " -rrb- .
they sell a respectable 2,500 hectoliters -lrb- 66,000 gallons -rrb- a year - and there 's no mistaking them for beck 's . alcohol abuse bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : nationally marketed brands forced many local breweries out of business in the 1970s but it 's difficult for independents to break through against the conglomerates .
the big brewing companies control distribution networks and encourage pub owners to feature their products exclusively by offering loans , price rebates and free tapping and refrigeration systems , beer glasses and even ashtrays . and german consumers and bar owners are ignorant about the drink itself , lemke said . " the german beer drinker thinks he knows a lot about beer , but most of them know very , very , little , " he said .
" it start 's with the myth that you need seven minutes to tap a good pilsner .
nonsense - that just makes it go flat and warm .
when i go to bars , i usually drink bottled beer because i know the tap beer has usually been physically abused .
it 's atrocious .
i know a lot of people in america that know far more about beer than people here in germany . " name recognition bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : what would a brewpub be without the obligatory copper brewing kettles ?
the first problem for small brewers is how to let potential customers know that they 're there . " that 's due in part to the marketing abilities of the big companies , " said marc-oliver huhnholz , press spokesman for the german brewers ' association .
" also america never drank as much beer as germany so small brewers can have more impact . " and to appeal to a new generation of potential beer drinkers , brewers have to take into account demographic shifts and the accompanying changes in personal taste . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : beer suffers from its image as a drink for older men " the average age in germany is rising , and older people tend to drink less , " huhnholz said .
" and among younger people , the trend is toward milder drinks - women especially prefer sweeter drinks .
they do n't want anything too bitter . " but huhnholz also thinks that small local breweries can play a role in stirring up new interest in - and appreciation for - beer . " small brewers have to offer an attractive product , and they need to do a lot of marketing , " huhnholz said .
" but some of them can succeed . " beer vs. bureaucracy bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : is germany 's bureaucracy preventing more small brew-pubs from opening ?
philipp brokamp would love to do that , but first he has to get started .
the 32-year-old brewer moved to berlin last year and is set to open his first brewpub , appropriately named hops and barley . without the support of a major corporation , that 's proven a daunting task .
germany 's notorious bureaucracy has n't made things any easier , brokamp said . " there 's the stereotype about bureaucracy , but i now know it 's not a stereotype , " said brokamp , who was forced to postpone opening due to red tape .
" i 've had to deal with at least eight separate government permit agencies , everything from the civil engineering office to offices for the environment and handicapped accessibility .
every one of them considered itself particularly important , but they could n't even agree on what the regulations were . " all that for a bar with a capacity of 100 , where the beer is made in the basement . while he 's tying up loose ends , brokamp is brewing light and dark beers as well as red ale and cider .
his style emphasizes malt more than lemke 's without being overly sweet . brokamp 's beers are also non-filtered , which means they look cloudy when poured .
but as he explains , cloudiness is good . " the things mass breweries filter out are n't impurities , " brokamp said .
" they 're very nutritious , and they make the beer more flavorful than filtered varieties . " think globally , drink locally bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : friedrichshain 's student crowds might be perfect for a micro-brewery lemke 's flagship brewpub is in the touristy neighborhood around berlin 's hackescher markt , while brokamp 's bar is located in the more residential area of friedrichshain .
he knows it will be a challenge to convince the locals to drink local stuff , but he 's confident . " i think that it 's exactly the right niche in the market , " brokamp said .
" general consumption is in decline .
people are more conscious and perhaps more choosey about what they drink .
and so i hope they 'll be interested in the sort of specialities that i 'll be offering . " brokamp will begin testing that hypothesis on feb .
2 , when hops and barley officially opens .
then he 'll see whether his neighbors are interested in trying something out of the ordinary or whether they prefer to just keep popping open beck 's - in decreasing numbers . jefferson chase send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

but people should rather look on the bright side , one of germany 's leading business managers told deutsche welle . jürgen großmann , 55 , is the ceo of rwe , one of germany 's largest energy companies .
he talked to dw-radio on the sidelines of the world economic forum in davos , which started wednesday , jan .
23 . deutsche welle : the financial and stock market crisis is the dominating topic in davos .
what could german businesses and publicly traded companies do to prevent a stock value massacre like the one we 've seen at the beginning of the week ? bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : jürgen großmann jürgen großmann : central banks and governments will surely come up with macroeconomic measures .
the lowering of interest rates by the us federal reserve is a first step .
in terms of microeconomics , companies have to tell themselves again and again : the donkey gets daring when he feels too comfortable .
we have to keep our cost structures and our competitiveness under control for stock market success to return .
it 's right and important to correct things sometimes .
let 's see that we get our ships back in order ; that we stick to the course .
do n't panic .
that 's the worst thing that could happen .
instead , we should analyze the current situation with a clear head .
if we do that , we 'll emerge from this stronger , i believe . how much is germany affected by the financial crisis ? bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : it 's no fun to be a german stock broker at the momen the global economy naturally is connected via financial markets , insurances and banks .
if wealth is destroyed in one place , that clearly has an effect on the behavior of consumers and investors .
we 're all affected .
no one should think that he 's not simply because he does n't own any stock .
that 's completely wrong . many people would love to be in the position that germany 's been fighting for hard for decades .
they 're also working on becoming world champions .
everyone participates in globalization and there are only marginal groups that do n't .
here in davos , we 've seen many studies over the past couple of years that have all reached the same conclusion : when all is said and done , the global economy , and also the poorest countries , have benefited from globalization . the example of cell phone maker nokia , who is about to close a plan in bochum in western germany , shows that even jobs in booming sectors are n't safe any more in germany .
will protectionism return ?
will industrialized countries have to isolate their markets to a greater extent in order to secure jobs ? bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : if nokia goes to romania , germans have to fill the void the eu 's never dropped protectionism in certain sectors , such as agriculture .
the bitter thing about nokia is that the competitor 's not in southeast asia , but in the eu and that the shift of jobs might even be financed with eu money .
but we 're still profiting big time from globalization and we have to think about how we can respond to such challenges . running after investors with subsidies clearly is n't the way to do it .
we need to recollect ourselves and think about our own strengths and develop our own business concepts .
we need german entrepreneurs that say : okay , if nokia leaves , we 'll step in .
we need good new ideas backed by innovation and we can develop them - it 's possible in germany . interview : marco vollmar -lrb- win -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?
dw-world.de trade union talks with nokia fruitless , german plant to close the german trade union ig metall said tuesday , jan .
22 , that its talks with finnish cell-phone maker nokia had been unsuccessful , but vowed to continue the fight to keep a german factory open .
-lrb- 22.01.2008 -rrb- effects of us recession could be held at bay , experts say global markets have plunged , partly due to fear of a recession in the united states , the world 's biggest economy .
but european experts say dynamic developing countries like china could offset us troubles .

but people should rather look on the bright side , one of germany 's leading business managers told deutsche welle . jürgen großmann , 55 , is the ceo of rwe , one of germany 's largest energy companies .
he talked to dw-radio on the sidelines of the world economic forum in davos , which started wednesday , jan .
23 . deutsche welle : the financial and stock market crisis is the dominating topic in davos .
what could german businesses and publicly traded companies do to prevent a stock value massacre like the one we 've seen at the beginning of the week ? bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : jürgen großmann jürgen großmann : central banks and governments will surely come up with macroeconomic measures .
the lowering of interest rates by the us federal reserve is a first step .
in terms of microeconomics , companies have to tell themselves again and again : the donkey gets daring when he feels too comfortable .
we have to keep our cost structures and our competitiveness under control for stock market success to return .
it 's right and important to correct things sometimes .
let 's see that we get our ships back in order ; that we stick to the course .
do n't panic .
that 's the worst thing that could happen .
instead , we should analyze the current situation with a clear head .
if we do that , we 'll emerge from this stronger , i believe . how much is germany affected by the financial crisis ? bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : it 's no fun to be a german stock broker at the momen the global economy naturally is connected via financial markets , insurances and banks .
if wealth is destroyed in one place , that clearly has an effect on the behavior of consumers and investors .
we 're all affected .
no one should think that he 's not simply because he does n't own any stock .
that 's completely wrong . many people would love to be in the position that germany 's been fighting for hard for decades .
they 're also working on becoming world champions .
everyone participates in globalization and there are only marginal groups that do n't .
here in davos , we 've seen many studies over the past couple of years that have all reached the same conclusion : when all is said and done , the global economy , and also the poorest countries , have benefited from globalization . the example of cell phone maker nokia , who is about to close a plan in bochum in western germany , shows that even jobs in booming sectors are n't safe any more in germany .
will protectionism return ?
will industrialized countries have to isolate their markets to a greater extent in order to secure jobs ? bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : if nokia goes to romania , germans have to fill the void the eu 's never dropped protectionism in certain sectors , such as agriculture .
the bitter thing about nokia is that the competitor 's not in southeast asia , but in the eu and that the shift of jobs might even be financed with eu money .
but we 're still profiting big time from globalization and we have to think about how we can respond to such challenges . running after investors with subsidies clearly is n't the way to do it .
we need to recollect ourselves and think about our own strengths and develop our own business concepts .
we need german entrepreneurs that say : okay , if nokia leaves , we 'll step in .
we need good new ideas backed by innovation and we can develop them - it 's possible in germany . interview : marco vollmar -lrb- win -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

the rise in what is one of europe 's major economic indicators came despite this week 's torrid round of trading on global stock markets which fuelled fears of a global economic crisis .
" companies ' order books are bursting , " ifo economist hans günter russ told german news agency , dpa .
firms " remain optimistic about their exports , " he added .
german business defies fears analysts had predicted the closely watched index would show german business confidence sliding to 102.2 points this month on the back of worries that the shakeout in the us housing market could tip the giant us economy into recession .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : german companies are doing roaring business however , releasing the survey ifo president hans-werner sinn said , " on the whole , the condition of firms in german industry and trade continues to be robust . "
his comments echo the views of many economists who see germany acting as europe 's economic locomotive in the coming 12 months , despite the prospects of the nation 's growth rate slipping back a notch from 2.5 per cent in 2007 to below 2.0 per cent this year .
the germany economy grew at a perky 2.9 per cent in 2006 .
the ifo survey " underlines that fundamentally the euro area economy remains in good shape , " ' said elga bartsch from the us investment house morgan stanley .
" but it is clear that the headwinds are currently gaining momentum and , unless they blow over quickly , they will introduce downside risks to growth , inflation and interest rate forecasts , " she said .
asian demand help economy offset slump leading the ifo rise was an increase in german industry 's expectations of business conditions six months down the track , which nudged up to 99 from 98.2 in december .
however , underscoring the current economic uncertainty , the ifo index component gauging german executives ' assessment of the present situation dropped to 107.9 from 108.1 .
while germany 's key export sector is expected to lose some momentum this year , solid demand from the world 's key emerging economies in asia , eastern europe and the middle east is seen as helping to offset a slump in the us .
moreover , increased pay packets for german workers this year after a protracted period of wage stagnation as well as a continuing fall in unemployment are also forecast to help underpin consumer demand .
the surprise jump in the january ifo index added to the brighter mood prevailing on both german and european stocks markets after a highly volatile week in share trading and big falls in stock prices .
by mid-morning trading , frankfurt 's dax index was up almost five per cent with europe 's blue-chip stoxx 50 having gained nearly 4.0 per cent .
the rise in the ifo is likely to ease some of the pressure on the european central bank to follow the lead of other major central banks , notably the us federal reserve , and cut interest rates to help shore up economic confidence and in response to the signs of slowing growth . dw staff / dpa -lrb- sp -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

" the reputation built by siemens for 160 years has been reduced to ashes , " said daniela bergdolt , from the dsw group of small investors .
" it is not satisfactory that the affair has not been wrapped up after more than a year , " complained hans hirt , who represented the british pension fund hermes .
in the latest twist to the " affair , " investigators have established that payments worth around 140 million euros -lrb- $ 206 million -rrb- have been found in the firm 's flagship medical equipment division , reported the daily süddeutsche zeitung thursday .
siemens ' most profitable division , its turnover averages some 10 billion euros a year .

he has already renovated the management team and begun to simplify the company 's tentacular structure , reining in directors of siemens units abroad who have been dubbed " the princes . "
" what counts for me is clean business everywhere and always , and highest performance meeting the highest ethical standards , " he has said .
he has also revealed that the group had been hit with compliance costs to date of around 1.1 billion euros , plus around 520 million in tax liabilities and sanctions " whose scope can not be estimated . "

according to afp , the association of small shareholders dsw intends to vote against a renewal of their mandates , which nonetheless seem assured .
among the top figures absent were former siemens boss klaus kleinfeld and former supervisory board president heinrich von pierer , the emblematic head of the group from 1992 to 2005 , who both left siemens last year .
one telling sign of the times was a decision by siemens to forego the traditional vote of confidence by which shareholders typically approve the management team 's performance over the past year .

11 attacks lawmakers from 47 european nations have strongly criticized a system of un and eu sanctions against suspected backers of global terrorism , saying the use of terrorist blacklists violates fundamental rights . the council of europe , the eu 's rights watchdog , rules urged the united nations and the european union to overhaul procedures to blacklist individuals and groups suspected of having links to terrorism .
not only does the practice violate human rights , the lawmakers concluded , but they are " completely arbitrary , " according to a statement released by the 47-member body .
a report commissioned by the rights body said people were blacklisted on the basis of " mere suspicion " and called the measures " deplorable and violation of human rights and fundamental freedoms . "
harsh penalties against suspects dick marty , a swiss senator and former prosecutor who has published critical reports into alleged anti-terrorist practices by states and institutions , including reported secret cia prisons on european soil , said those affected by the terrorist blacklists had absolutely no rights to defend themselves against terrorist allegations .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : marty said the practice gave suspects no chance of defending themselves " i have seldom experienced anything as unfair as the compilation of these lists , " marty said at the european parliament in strasbourg this week .
according to the report , around 370 people and 130 groups or organizations are currently on the un 's blacklist .
they include alleged taliban individuals and those linked to al qaeda .
the eu lists 60 people or groups - including the radical palestinian group hamas and the basque separatist group , eta .
set up after the sept .
11 attacks in 2001 , the lists impose a number of penalties on those suspected of backing terrorism .
they include freezing suspects ' assets and preventing them from traveling without giving them a court hearing or disclosing the evidence against them .
the council of europe said in its report that many suspects on the lists only discovered that they were on it after they were stopped at a border while travelling or when their bank accounts were frozen .
" people remain on these lists for years without knowing why , and their lives are ruined , " marty said .
marty 's investigation into the practice was sparked by the case of a 78-year-old italian citizen of arab descent , youssef nada whose business was ruined after he landed on the blacklist .
the cia reportedly suspected nada of belonging to a group of financiers behind the sept .
11 attacks .
but a four-year investigation by swiss authorities into nada 's case was suspended in 2005 due to a lack of evidence .
nada 's assets were seized and he was barred from leaving his home of 30 years in switzerland .
nada 's name remains on the terror blacklist .
top eu court may rule against un practice the un system is at present being scrutinized by the eu 's top court and there is a strong likelihood it may rule that the 27-member bloc has violated basic rights by applying them .
according to news agency reuters , an eu legal advisor has recommended the eu court of justice in luxembourg should cancel financial sanctions against a saudi businessman and a swedish-based money transfer business in two separate cases .
the agency quoted cameron doley , a british lawyer representing saudi businessman yassin kadi as saying that his client had never received a clear statement of the allegations against him .
kadi had filed his case in the eu because the un had no equivalent tribunal to which he could appeal .
" what this gives us , we hope , is a statement by one of the most prominent and respected courts in the world that this system is an unjustified infringement of the fundamental human rights of those persons who are listed , " doley told reuters . dw staff -lrb- sp -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

" kosovo is ready , is united , and i think we 'll proclaim the date -lrb- of independence -rrb- in pristina very soon , " thaci said after talks with eu foreign-policy chief javier solana .
" we have discussed many things - the constitution , the symbols .
kosovo is ready for independence .
it 's an issue of days , " he said .
solana , when asked if he had discussed the date of any such declaration with thaci , answered " no , i did not , " but added that he had agreed to maintain contacts with the kosovo albanians .
serbia is to hold the final round of its presidential election on february 3 , with ultra-nationalist candidate tomislav nikolic having taken the lead over pro-eu incumbent boris tadic in the first round .
kosovo is the most heated issue on the agenda , with nationalists accusing the eu of wanting to steal the province from them .
eu officials have been careful to steer clear of any comments which could inflame the situation ahead of the crucial vote .
" the issue is a very sensitive one and we are in a very sensitive political context in which it is better to resort to diplomatic means than public statements , " a spokeswoman for eu enlargement commissioner olli rehn told journalists .
eu reiterates its commitment balkan stability bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : " we wo n't give up kosovo " sums up the serbian stance thaci and rehn discussed " the european perspective of kosovo and the whole region of the western balkans as well as the issue of the settlement of kosovo 's status , " she said .
rehn " reiterated the eu 's readiness to carry its responsibility by steering a coordinated and managed process to finalize the settlement of kosovo 's status , " she said .
the question of what to do when kosovo declares independence is the most divisive issue in the eu at present .
a majority of member states favor recognizing the new state , but some have said that to do so would spark separatist moves elsewhere .
serb nationalists have expressed outrage at what they see as eu support for an attempt to break up their country .
nikolic has gone on the record as saying that serbia will never join the eu , and that he regrets the country is not a province of russia .
serbians stand firm against kosovo state bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : olli rehn wants a well-managed process for kosovo however , eu officials insist that serbia 's future is as a part of the bloc .
just hours after meeting thaci , rehn met with a serbian delegation to discuss serbia 's cooperation with the international criminal tribunal for the former yugoslavia -lrb- icty -rrb- .
eu leaders have said that they will not sign a stabilization and association agreement -lrb- saa -rrb- paving the way to candidate status for serbia until it cooperates fully with the icty .
rehn " reiterated his strong commitment to serbia 's european future , and would like to sign the saa soon , once the conditions are fulfilled , " the spokeswoman said .

the rise in what is one of europe 's major economic indicators came despite this week 's torrid round of trading on global stock markets which fuelled fears of a global economic crisis .
" companies ' order books are bursting , " ifo economist hans günter russ told german news agency , dpa .
firms " remain optimistic about their exports , " he added .
german business defies fears analysts had predicted the closely watched index would show german business confidence sliding to 102.2 points this month on the back of worries that the shakeout in the us housing market could tip the giant us economy into recession .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : german companies are doing roaring business however , releasing the survey ifo president hans-werner sinn said , " on the whole , the condition of firms in german industry and trade continues to be robust . "
his comments echo the views of many economists who see germany acting as europe 's economic locomotive in the coming 12 months , despite the prospects of the nation 's growth rate slipping back a notch from 2.5 per cent in 2007 to below 2.0 per cent this year .
the germany economy grew at a perky 2.9 per cent in 2006 .
the ifo survey " underlines that fundamentally the euro area economy remains in good shape , " ' said elga bartsch from the us investment house morgan stanley .
" but it is clear that the headwinds are currently gaining momentum and , unless they blow over quickly , they will introduce downside risks to growth , inflation and interest rate forecasts , " she said .
asian demand help economy offset slump leading the ifo rise was an increase in german industry 's expectations of business conditions six months down the track , which nudged up to 99 from 98.2 in december .
however , underscoring the current economic uncertainty , the ifo index component gauging german executives ' assessment of the present situation dropped to 107.9 from 108.1 .
while germany 's key export sector is expected to lose some momentum this year , solid demand from the world 's key emerging economies in asia , eastern europe and the middle east is seen as helping to offset a slump in the us .
moreover , increased pay packets for german workers this year after a protracted period of wage stagnation as well as a continuing fall in unemployment are also forecast to help underpin consumer demand .
the surprise jump in the january ifo index added to the brighter mood prevailing on both german and european stocks markets after a highly volatile week in share trading and big falls in stock prices .
by mid-morning trading , frankfurt 's dax index was up almost five per cent with europe 's blue-chip stoxx 50 having gained nearly 4.0 per cent .
the rise in the ifo is likely to ease some of the pressure on the european central bank to follow the lead of other major central banks , notably the us federal reserve , and cut interest rates to help shore up economic confidence and in response to the signs of slowing growth . dw staff / dpa -lrb- sp -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

his comments echo the views of many economists who see germany acting as europe 's economic locomotive in the coming 12 months , despite the prospects of the nation 's growth rate slipping back a notch from 2.5 per cent in 2007 to below 2.0 per cent this year .
the germany economy grew at a perky 2.9 per cent in 2006 .
the ifo survey " underlines that fundamentally the euro area economy remains in good shape , " ' said elga bartsch from the us investment house morgan stanley .
" but it is clear that the headwinds are currently gaining momentum and , unless they blow over quickly , they will introduce downside risks to growth , inflation and interest rate forecasts , " she said .
asian demand help economy offset slump leading the ifo rise was an increase in german industry 's expectations of business conditions six months down the track , which nudged up to 99 from 98.2 in december .
however , underscoring the current economic uncertainty , the ifo index component gauging german executives ' assessment of the present situation dropped to 107.9 from 108.1 .
while germany 's key export sector is expected to lose some momentum this year , solid demand from the world 's key emerging economies in asia , eastern europe and the middle east is seen as helping to offset a slump in the us .
moreover , increased pay packets for german workers this year after a protracted period of wage stagnation as well as a continuing fall in unemployment are also forecast to help underpin consumer demand .
the surprise jump in the january ifo index added to the brighter mood prevailing on both german and european stocks markets after a highly volatile week in share trading and big falls in stock prices .
by mid-morning trading , frankfurt 's dax index was up almost five per cent with europe 's blue-chip stoxx 50 having gained nearly 4.0 per cent .
the rise in the ifo is likely to ease some of the pressure on the european central bank to follow the lead of other major central banks , notably the us federal reserve , and cut interest rates to help shore up economic confidence and in response to the signs of slowing growth . dw staff / dpa -lrb- sp -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

" the reputation built by siemens for 160 years has been reduced to ashes , " said daniela bergdolt , from the dsw group of small investors .
" it is not satisfactory that the affair has not been wrapped up after more than a year , " complained hans hirt , who represented the british pension fund hermes .
in the latest twist to the " affair , " investigators have established that payments worth around 140 million euros -lrb- $ 206 million -rrb- have been found in the firm 's flagship medical equipment division , reported the daily süddeutsche zeitung thursday .
siemens ' most profitable division , its turnover averages some 10 billion euros a year .

he has already renovated the management team and begun to simplify the company 's tentacular structure , reining in directors of siemens units abroad who have been dubbed " the princes . "
" what counts for me is clean business everywhere and always , and highest performance meeting the highest ethical standards , " he has said .
he has also revealed that the group had been hit with compliance costs to date of around 1.1 billion euros , plus around 520 million in tax liabilities and sanctions " whose scope can not be estimated . "
" intangible damage is much harder to measure - the loss of reputation and trust in the general public , " he said .
shareholder concerns others on the executive floor were given a rocky ride by investors , including those supposed to be controlling the group such as supervisory board gerhard cromme and his right-hand man , deutsche bank chairman josef ackermann .
according to afp , the association of small shareholders dsw intends to vote against a renewal of their mandates , which nonetheless seem assured .
among the top figures absent were former siemens boss klaus kleinfeld and former supervisory board president heinrich von pierer , the emblematic head of the group from 1992 to 2005 , who both left siemens last year .
one telling sign of the times was a decision by siemens to forego the traditional vote of confidence by which shareholders typically approve the management team 's performance over the past year .

he lost both italy was again thrown into political turmoil as prime minister romano prodi decided to leave office after he lost a crucial vote of confidence in the italian senate .
the opposition is calling for new elections . italy 's embattled prime minister romano prodi tendered his resignation after losing a vote of confidence in the senate on thursday , jan .
24 , by five votes . italian president giorgio napolitano who , according to news reports , " reserved the right " on whether to accept prodi 's resignation , convened the speakers of both houses of parliament for consultations friday . the result was 156 for the center-left government , 161 against and one abstention .
three senators were absent , including two non-elected life senators . napolitano must choose between calling early elections and setting up a transitional government to allow electoral reforms , which many deputies say are badly needed , to be enacted . prodi , the center-left leader who won elections in april 2006 by a handful of votes , went before the senate despite appeals by top leaders including napolitano to resign rather than face the vote . he appeared resigned to the prospect of losing the vote but determined to carry through with it on principle . " i am here because you can not hide from the judgment of those who represent the people , and our people are watching us , " he said . prodi has walked a tightrope trying to keep together his squabbling coalition , which ranges from centrist catholics to far-left communists . earlier plea falls on senate 's deaf ears dismissing calls for his resignation , prodi earlier urged senators to support his government . " italy does not have the luxury of halting -lrb- the work of -rrb- this government , " prodi said in the senate as he opened the scheduled debate preceding the vote . to those voting against him , prodi said they should ask what government and what parliamentary majority they wanted in place of " the legitimate one currently in office . " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : president napolitano wanted prodi to step aside ahead of the vote earlier prodi met napolitano - who like others in the governing center-left coalition reportedly wanted the premier to make way for a caretaker government - before the senate vote . the embattled prime minister had already met napolitano before winning wednesday 's confidence vote in parliament 's lower house chamber of deputies where , unlike the senate , the government has a clear majority . recent defections have left the governing centre-left coalition with some 157 votes in the senate , while the opposition is expected to muster around 160 votes . " we will have early elections , " university and research minister fabio mussi said thursday , voicing a view shared by some members of prodi 's eight-party coalition and the vast majority of the opposition including former prime minister silvio berlusconi . however the democratic party , the largest in the center-left government had said that if prodi were to fall , then electoral reforms - aimed at giving governments more stability by decreasing the influence of small parties - should be introduced before a new poll . napolitano , who has the power to dissolve parliament had also said in the past that a new electoral law would be needed before elections are held . mastella 's withdrawal of support prompts crisis prodi 's decision to test his support in parliament came after former justice minister clemente mastella said monday his small moderate udeur party would no longer support the governing coalition .
mastella resigned last week in the wake of a corruption scandal . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : mastella decided to pull his party out of prodi 's coalition his decision triggered the latest , and most serious crisis to strike prodi since he took office 20 months ago after winning italy 's closest post-world war ii election by just 25,000 votes in april 2006 .
prodi has had to rely on more than 30 confidence votes to push through legislation , including the government 's budget and foreign policy . in the wake of prodi 's resignation , berlusconi called for the president to dissolve parliament and call elections immediately . berlusconi also had to face four votes of confidence during his government 's turn in office .
berlusconi was the longest serving prime minister italy has had since world war ii .
italy has had 61 governments since 1945 . impact on economy in the run-up to prodi 's decision , political commentators and analysts were warning that holding elections now without amending italy 's messy electoral rules would only prolong the unstable system of coalition governments . reuters news agency reported that the current government turmoil took its toll on financial markets where spreads between italian government bonds and german bunds widened to near levels not seen for six-and-a-half years . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : alumnia urged italy to confront its political problems italy 's economy , which has long underperformed its peers in the euro zone , also suffered more bad news with the worst consumer confidence data for two-and-a-half years . eu commissioner for economic and monetary affairs joaquin almunia urged italy to resolve the situation as soon as possible because " only then can italy begin to confront its real problems , like the economy . " speaking to reporters outside the world economic forum in davos , switzerland , almunia reiterated : " we are currently in a time of economic difficulty and turbulence .

11 attacks lawmakers from 47 european nations have strongly criticized a system of un and eu sanctions against suspected backers of global terrorism , saying the use of terrorist blacklists violates fundamental rights . the council of europe , the eu 's rights watchdog , rules urged the united nations and the european union to overhaul procedures to blacklist individuals and groups suspected of having links to terrorism .
not only does the practice violate human rights , the lawmakers concluded , but they are " completely arbitrary , " according to a statement released by the 47-member body .
a report commissioned by the rights body said people were blacklisted on the basis of " mere suspicion " and called the measures " deplorable and violation of human rights and fundamental freedoms . "
harsh penalties against suspects dick marty , a swiss senator and former prosecutor who has published critical reports into alleged anti-terrorist practices by states and institutions , including reported secret cia prisons on european soil , said those affected by the terrorist blacklists had absolutely no rights to defend themselves against terrorist allegations .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : marty said the practice gave suspects no chance of defending themselves " i have seldom experienced anything as unfair as the compilation of these lists , " marty said at the european parliament in strasbourg this week .
according to the report , around 370 people and 130 groups or organizations are currently on the un 's blacklist .
they include alleged taliban individuals and those linked to al qaeda .
the eu lists 60 people or groups - including the radical palestinian group hamas and the basque separatist group , eta .
set up after the sept .
11 attacks in 2001 , the lists impose a number of penalties on those suspected of backing terrorism .
they include freezing suspects ' assets and preventing them from traveling without giving them a court hearing or disclosing the evidence against them .
the council of europe said in its report that many suspects on the lists only discovered that they were on it after they were stopped at a border while travelling or when their bank accounts were frozen .
" people remain on these lists for years without knowing why , and their lives are ruined , " marty said .
marty 's investigation into the practice was sparked by the case of a 78-year-old italian citizen of arab descent , youssef nada whose business was ruined after he landed on the blacklist .
the cia reportedly suspected nada of belonging to a group of financiers behind the sept .
11 attacks .
but a four-year investigation by swiss authorities into nada 's case was suspended in 2005 due to a lack of evidence .
nada 's assets were seized and he was barred from leaving his home of 30 years in switzerland .
nada 's name remains on the terror blacklist .

according to news agency reuters , an eu legal advisor has recommended the eu court of justice in luxembourg should cancel financial sanctions against a saudi businessman and a swedish-based money transfer business in two separate cases .
the agency quoted cameron doley , a british lawyer representing saudi businessman yassin kadi as saying that his client had never received a clear statement of the allegations against him .
kadi had filed his case in the eu because the un had no equivalent tribunal to which he could appeal .

" the reputation built by siemens for 160 years has been reduced to ashes , " said daniela bergdolt , from the dsw group of small investors .
" it is not satisfactory that the affair has not been wrapped up after more than a year , " complained hans hirt , who represented the british pension fund hermes .
in the latest twist to the " affair , " investigators have established that payments worth around 140 million euros -lrb- $ 206 million -rrb- have been found in the firm 's flagship medical equipment division , reported the daily süddeutsche zeitung thursday .
siemens ' most profitable division , its turnover averages some 10 billion euros a year .
until now , siemens has said such payments totalled around 1.3 billion euros .
the löscher effect bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : shareholders got a chance to voice their feelings exempted from the shareholders ' criticisms was siemens boss peter löscher , appointed six months ago following the disclosure of a well-stocked slush fund at the group .
shareholders ' hopes are resting on the shoulders of löscher , the first siemens boss to be hired from outside the group .
he has already renovated the management team and begun to simplify the company 's tentacular structure , reining in directors of siemens units abroad who have been dubbed " the princes . "
" what counts for me is clean business everywhere and always , and highest performance meeting the highest ethical standards , " he has said .
he has also revealed that the group had been hit with compliance costs to date of around 1.1 billion euros , plus around 520 million in tax liabilities and sanctions " whose scope can not be estimated . "
" intangible damage is much harder to measure - the loss of reputation and trust in the general public , " he said .
shareholder concerns others on the executive floor were given a rocky ride by investors , including those supposed to be controlling the group such as supervisory board gerhard cromme and his right-hand man , deutsche bank chairman josef ackermann .
according to afp , the association of small shareholders dsw intends to vote against a renewal of their mandates , which nonetheless seem assured .
among the top figures absent were former siemens boss klaus kleinfeld and former supervisory board president heinrich von pierer , the emblematic head of the group from 1992 to 2005 , who both left siemens last year .
one telling sign of the times was a decision by siemens to forego the traditional vote of confidence by which shareholders typically approve the management team 's performance over the past year .
but the supervisory board , including cromme and his right-hand man josef ackermann , the chairman of deutsche bank , were to face such a vote .
still in business bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : peter löscher it has been over a year since the first revelations emerged about shady dealings at siemens , often in the form of money alleged to have been paid under the table to obtain foreign contracts .
at last count , the biggest private german employer had acknowledged 1.3 billion euros in questionable funds .
according to press reports , internal allegations are still abounding , including the suggestion that corruption was present up to the higher spheres of the group .
the german group is listed on wall street and fears being slapped with a fine of four billion euros -lrb- 5.8 billion dollars -rrb- in the us , according to the german business magazine wirtschaftswoche .
but for the time being , the company 's businesses - medical equipment , manufacturing , trains and electric power stations - remain healthy .
the company posted a huge increase in first quarter profit from 788 million euros to 6.5 billion owing to the sale of the auto equipment parts company vdo .
operating profit for the first three months of its 2007-2008 fiscal year , which began on october 1 , increased by 16 percent to 1.7 billion euros , on sales which grew by 10 percent to 18.4 billion euros . dw staff -lrb- jp -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

the rise in what is one of europe 's major economic indicators came despite this week 's torrid round of trading on global stock markets which fuelled fears of a global economic crisis .
" companies ' order books are bursting , " ifo economist hans günter russ told german news agency , dpa .
firms " remain optimistic about their exports , " he added .
german business defies fears analysts had predicted the closely watched index would show german business confidence sliding to 102.2 points this month on the back of worries that the shakeout in the us housing market could tip the giant us economy into recession .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : german companies are doing roaring business however , releasing the survey ifo president hans-werner sinn said , " on the whole , the condition of firms in german industry and trade continues to be robust . "
his comments echo the views of many economists who see germany acting as europe 's economic locomotive in the coming 12 months , despite the prospects of the nation 's growth rate slipping back a notch from 2.5 per cent in 2007 to below 2.0 per cent this year .
the germany economy grew at a perky 2.9 per cent in 2006 .
the ifo survey " underlines that fundamentally the euro area economy remains in good shape , " ' said elga bartsch from the us investment house morgan stanley .
" but it is clear that the headwinds are currently gaining momentum and , unless they blow over quickly , they will introduce downside risks to growth , inflation and interest rate forecasts , " she said .
asian demand help economy offset slump leading the ifo rise was an increase in german industry 's expectations of business conditions six months down the track , which nudged up to 99 from 98.2 in december .
however , underscoring the current economic uncertainty , the ifo index component gauging german executives ' assessment of the present situation dropped to 107.9 from 108.1 .
while germany 's key export sector is expected to lose some momentum this year , solid demand from the world 's key emerging economies in asia , eastern europe and the middle east is seen as helping to offset a slump in the us .
moreover , increased pay packets for german workers this year after a protracted period of wage stagnation as well as a continuing fall in unemployment are also forecast to help underpin consumer demand .
the surprise jump in the january ifo index added to the brighter mood prevailing on both german and european stocks markets after a highly volatile week in share trading and big falls in stock prices .
by mid-morning trading , frankfurt 's dax index was up almost five per cent with europe 's blue-chip stoxx 50 having gained nearly 4.0 per cent .
the rise in the ifo is likely to ease some of the pressure on the european central bank to follow the lead of other major central banks , notably the us federal reserve , and cut interest rates to help shore up economic confidence and in response to the signs of slowing growth . dw staff / dpa -lrb- sp -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : german companies are doing roaring business however , releasing the survey ifo president hans-werner sinn said , " on the whole , the condition of firms in german industry and trade continues to be robust . "
his comments echo the views of many economists who see germany acting as europe 's economic locomotive in the coming 12 months , despite the prospects of the nation 's growth rate slipping back a notch from 2.5 per cent in 2007 to below 2.0 per cent this year .
the germany economy grew at a perky 2.9 per cent in 2006 .
the ifo survey " underlines that fundamentally the euro area economy remains in good shape , " ' said elga bartsch from the us investment house morgan stanley .
" but it is clear that the headwinds are currently gaining momentum and , unless they blow over quickly , they will introduce downside risks to growth , inflation and interest rate forecasts , " she said .
asian demand help economy offset slump leading the ifo rise was an increase in german industry 's expectations of business conditions six months down the track , which nudged up to 99 from 98.2 in december .
however , underscoring the current economic uncertainty , the ifo index component gauging german executives ' assessment of the present situation dropped to 107.9 from 108.1 .
while germany 's key export sector is expected to lose some momentum this year , solid demand from the world 's key emerging economies in asia , eastern europe and the middle east is seen as helping to offset a slump in the us .
moreover , increased pay packets for german workers this year after a protracted period of wage stagnation as well as a continuing fall in unemployment are also forecast to help underpin consumer demand .
the surprise jump in the january ifo index added to the brighter mood prevailing on both german and european stocks markets after a highly volatile week in share trading and big falls in stock prices .
by mid-morning trading , frankfurt 's dax index was up almost five per cent with europe 's blue-chip stoxx 50 having gained nearly 4.0 per cent .
the rise in the ifo is likely to ease some of the pressure on the european central bank to follow the lead of other major central banks , notably the us federal reserve , and cut interest rates to help shore up economic confidence and in response to the signs of slowing growth . dw staff / dpa -lrb- sp -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

he lost both italy was again thrown into political turmoil as prime minister romano prodi decided to leave office after he lost a crucial vote of confidence in the italian senate .
the opposition is calling for new elections . italy 's embattled prime minister romano prodi tendered his resignation after losing a vote of confidence in the senate on thursday , jan .
24 , by five votes . italian president giorgio napolitano who , according to news reports , " reserved the right " on whether to accept prodi 's resignation , convened the speakers of both houses of parliament for consultations friday . the result was 156 for the center-left government , 161 against and one abstention .
three senators were absent , including two non-elected life senators . napolitano must choose between calling early elections and setting up a transitional government to allow electoral reforms , which many deputies say are badly needed , to be enacted . prodi , the center-left leader who won elections in april 2006 by a handful of votes , went before the senate despite appeals by top leaders including napolitano to resign rather than face the vote . he appeared resigned to the prospect of losing the vote but determined to carry through with it on principle . " i am here because you can not hide from the judgment of those who represent the people , and our people are watching us , " he said . prodi has walked a tightrope trying to keep together his squabbling coalition , which ranges from centrist catholics to far-left communists . earlier plea falls on senate 's deaf ears dismissing calls for his resignation , prodi earlier urged senators to support his government . " italy does not have the luxury of halting -lrb- the work of -rrb- this government , " prodi said in the senate as he opened the scheduled debate preceding the vote . to those voting against him , prodi said they should ask what government and what parliamentary majority they wanted in place of " the legitimate one currently in office . " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : president napolitano wanted prodi to step aside ahead of the vote earlier prodi met napolitano - who like others in the governing center-left coalition reportedly wanted the premier to make way for a caretaker government - before the senate vote . the embattled prime minister had already met napolitano before winning wednesday 's confidence vote in parliament 's lower house chamber of deputies where , unlike the senate , the government has a clear majority . recent defections have left the governing centre-left coalition with some 157 votes in the senate , while the opposition is expected to muster around 160 votes . " we will have early elections , " university and research minister fabio mussi said thursday , voicing a view shared by some members of prodi 's eight-party coalition and the vast majority of the opposition including former prime minister silvio berlusconi . however the democratic party , the largest in the center-left government had said that if prodi were to fall , then electoral reforms - aimed at giving governments more stability by decreasing the influence of small parties - should be introduced before a new poll . napolitano , who has the power to dissolve parliament had also said in the past that a new electoral law would be needed before elections are held . mastella 's withdrawal of support prompts crisis prodi 's decision to test his support in parliament came after former justice minister clemente mastella said monday his small moderate udeur party would no longer support the governing coalition .
mastella resigned last week in the wake of a corruption scandal . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : mastella decided to pull his party out of prodi 's coalition his decision triggered the latest , and most serious crisis to strike prodi since he took office 20 months ago after winning italy 's closest post-world war ii election by just 25,000 votes in april 2006 .
prodi has had to rely on more than 30 confidence votes to push through legislation , including the government 's budget and foreign policy . in the wake of prodi 's resignation , berlusconi called for the president to dissolve parliament and call elections immediately . berlusconi also had to face four votes of confidence during his government 's turn in office .
berlusconi was the longest serving prime minister italy has had since world war ii .
italy has had 61 governments since 1945 . impact on economy in the run-up to prodi 's decision , political commentators and analysts were warning that holding elections now without amending italy 's messy electoral rules would only prolong the unstable system of coalition governments . reuters news agency reported that the current government turmoil took its toll on financial markets where spreads between italian government bonds and german bunds widened to near levels not seen for six-and-a-half years . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : alumnia urged italy to confront its political problems italy 's economy , which has long underperformed its peers in the euro zone , also suffered more bad news with the worst consumer confidence data for two-and-a-half years . eu commissioner for economic and monetary affairs joaquin almunia urged italy to resolve the situation as soon as possible because " only then can italy begin to confront its real problems , like the economy . " speaking to reporters outside the world economic forum in davos , switzerland , almunia reiterated : " we are currently in a time of economic difficulty and turbulence .
all countries need strong governments and the support of all parties within the parliaments , not just the majority but also the opposition . " dw staff -lrb- nda -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

germany 's rail company had initially rejected the idea , but bowed to pressure from the transport minister . ordinary people supported the nazi dictatorship in their everyday lives , which is why the exhibit about these crimes must be shown in an everyday place , transport minister wolfgang tiefensee said wednesday , jan .
23 , at the opening of the exhibition potsdamer platz station in downtown berlin . forty information boards with photos , personal testimonies , biographies and diagrams detail the fate of , among others , 11,400 jewish children who were deported from france to the auschwitz death camp by train between 1942 and 1944 . the exhibition , which also honors the sinti roma deported and killed by the nazis , is a replicate of a similar show that took place in french train stations four years ago .
both were organized by the french-german couple beate and serge klarsfeld , who founded the organization sons and daughters of jews deported from france . poignant location despite commuter chaos bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : nazi-hunter klarsfeld outlined the personal stories of thousands of deported children " putting an exhibition in a station is very different from putting it in a museum , " serge klarsfeld told the afp news agency on wednesday .
" it speaks to the german people directly . " however , deutsche bahn , germany 's national rail operator , had at first opposed the proposal to transform train station into a place of remembrance . " the subject is too serious , " deutsche bahn chief hartmut mehdorn said in october 2006 .
" it deserves more than commuters ' divided attention as they run to catch their trains while gulping down a sandwich . " in response , the rail company drew harsh criticism from the klarsfelds , who accused it of not owning up to its past . the reichsbahn , predecessor of germany 's present day train service , played an essential role in the nazi scheme to deport and exterminate millions of jews , roma and other " unwanted " people .
it also received money from the nazi government for each person it deported . trains made genocide possible bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : track 17 in grunewald is a memorial to holocaust victims deutsche bahn finally gave in to pressure from the transport minister . " it was important to me that this exhibition should go ahead and expose the troubled past of the reichsbahn , " tiefensee said wednesday at the opening of the exhibition . mehdorn did not attend the ceremony , but margret suckale , deutsche bahn 's personnel and legal manager , affirmed that , " without a doubt , the reichsbahn played a supporting role in the national socialist genocide . " a deutsche bahn press statement emphasized that the company seeks to uncover and remember its nazi past in other ways as well , including a memorial at track 17 at the grunewald station and with an exhibition at its museum in nuremberg . the deportation exhibition , titled " chartered trains to death - deportation with the german reichsbahn , " will be on display at the potsdamer platz station in berlin through feb .

the rise in what is one of europe 's major economic indicators came despite this week 's torrid round of trading on global stock markets which fuelled fears of a global economic crisis .
" companies ' order books are bursting , " ifo economist hans günter russ told german news agency , dpa .
firms " remain optimistic about their exports , " he added .
german business defies fears analysts had predicted the closely watched index would show german business confidence sliding to 102.2 points this month on the back of worries that the shakeout in the us housing market could tip the giant us economy into recession .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : german companies are doing roaring business however , releasing the survey ifo president hans-werner sinn said , " on the whole , the condition of firms in german industry and trade continues to be robust . "
his comments echo the views of many economists who see germany acting as europe 's economic locomotive in the coming 12 months , despite the prospects of the nation 's growth rate slipping back a notch from 2.5 per cent in 2007 to below 2.0 per cent this year .
the germany economy grew at a perky 2.9 per cent in 2006 .
the ifo survey " underlines that fundamentally the euro area economy remains in good shape , " ' said elga bartsch from the us investment house morgan stanley .
" but it is clear that the headwinds are currently gaining momentum and , unless they blow over quickly , they will introduce downside risks to growth , inflation and interest rate forecasts , " she said .

however , underscoring the current economic uncertainty , the ifo index component gauging german executives ' assessment of the present situation dropped to 107.9 from 108.1 .
while germany 's key export sector is expected to lose some momentum this year , solid demand from the world 's key emerging economies in asia , eastern europe and the middle east is seen as helping to offset a slump in the us .
moreover , increased pay packets for german workers this year after a protracted period of wage stagnation as well as a continuing fall in unemployment are also forecast to help underpin consumer demand .

11 attacks lawmakers from 47 european nations have strongly criticized a system of un and eu sanctions against suspected backers of global terrorism , saying the use of terrorist blacklists violates fundamental rights . the council of europe , the eu 's rights watchdog , rules urged the united nations and the european union to overhaul procedures to blacklist individuals and groups suspected of having links to terrorism .
not only does the practice violate human rights , the lawmakers concluded , but they are " completely arbitrary , " according to a statement released by the 47-member body .
a report commissioned by the rights body said people were blacklisted on the basis of " mere suspicion " and called the measures " deplorable and violation of human rights and fundamental freedoms . "
harsh penalties against suspects dick marty , a swiss senator and former prosecutor who has published critical reports into alleged anti-terrorist practices by states and institutions , including reported secret cia prisons on european soil , said those affected by the terrorist blacklists had absolutely no rights to defend themselves against terrorist allegations .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : marty said the practice gave suspects no chance of defending themselves " i have seldom experienced anything as unfair as the compilation of these lists , " marty said at the european parliament in strasbourg this week .
according to the report , around 370 people and 130 groups or organizations are currently on the un 's blacklist .
they include alleged taliban individuals and those linked to al qaeda .
the eu lists 60 people or groups - including the radical palestinian group hamas and the basque separatist group , eta .
set up after the sept .
11 attacks in 2001 , the lists impose a number of penalties on those suspected of backing terrorism .
they include freezing suspects ' assets and preventing them from traveling without giving them a court hearing or disclosing the evidence against them .
the council of europe said in its report that many suspects on the lists only discovered that they were on it after they were stopped at a border while travelling or when their bank accounts were frozen .
" people remain on these lists for years without knowing why , and their lives are ruined , " marty said .
marty 's investigation into the practice was sparked by the case of a 78-year-old italian citizen of arab descent , youssef nada whose business was ruined after he landed on the blacklist .
the cia reportedly suspected nada of belonging to a group of financiers behind the sept .
11 attacks .
but a four-year investigation by swiss authorities into nada 's case was suspended in 2005 due to a lack of evidence .
nada 's assets were seized and he was barred from leaving his home of 30 years in switzerland .
nada 's name remains on the terror blacklist .
top eu court may rule against un practice the un system is at present being scrutinized by the eu 's top court and there is a strong likelihood it may rule that the 27-member bloc has violated basic rights by applying them .
according to news agency reuters , an eu legal advisor has recommended the eu court of justice in luxembourg should cancel financial sanctions against a saudi businessman and a swedish-based money transfer business in two separate cases .
the agency quoted cameron doley , a british lawyer representing saudi businessman yassin kadi as saying that his client had never received a clear statement of the allegations against him .
kadi had filed his case in the eu because the un had no equivalent tribunal to which he could appeal .
" what this gives us , we hope , is a statement by one of the most prominent and respected courts in the world that this system is an unjustified infringement of the fundamental human rights of those persons who are listed , " doley told reuters . dw staff -lrb- sp -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

the rise in the ifo is likely to ease some of the pressure on the european central bank to follow the lead of other major central banks , notably the us federal reserve , and cut interest rates to help shore up economic confidence and in response to the signs of slowing growth . dw staff / dpa -lrb- sp -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

" kosovo is ready , is united , and i think we 'll proclaim the date -lrb- of independence -rrb- in pristina very soon , " thaci said after talks with eu foreign-policy chief javier solana .
" we have discussed many things - the constitution , the symbols .
kosovo is ready for independence .
it 's an issue of days , " he said .
solana , when asked if he had discussed the date of any such declaration with thaci , answered " no , i did not , " but added that he had agreed to maintain contacts with the kosovo albanians .
serbia is to hold the final round of its presidential election on february 3 , with ultra-nationalist candidate tomislav nikolic having taken the lead over pro-eu incumbent boris tadic in the first round .
kosovo is the most heated issue on the agenda , with nationalists accusing the eu of wanting to steal the province from them .
eu officials have been careful to steer clear of any comments which could inflame the situation ahead of the crucial vote .
" the issue is a very sensitive one and we are in a very sensitive political context in which it is better to resort to diplomatic means than public statements , " a spokeswoman for eu enlargement commissioner olli rehn told journalists .
eu reiterates its commitment balkan stability bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : " we wo n't give up kosovo " sums up the serbian stance thaci and rehn discussed " the european perspective of kosovo and the whole region of the western balkans as well as the issue of the settlement of kosovo 's status , " she said .
rehn " reiterated the eu 's readiness to carry its responsibility by steering a coordinated and managed process to finalize the settlement of kosovo 's status , " she said .
the question of what to do when kosovo declares independence is the most divisive issue in the eu at present .
a majority of member states favor recognizing the new state , but some have said that to do so would spark separatist moves elsewhere .
serb nationalists have expressed outrage at what they see as eu support for an attempt to break up their country .
nikolic has gone on the record as saying that serbia will never join the eu , and that he regrets the country is not a province of russia .
serbians stand firm against kosovo state bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : olli rehn wants a well-managed process for kosovo however , eu officials insist that serbia 's future is as a part of the bloc .
just hours after meeting thaci , rehn met with a serbian delegation to discuss serbia 's cooperation with the international criminal tribunal for the former yugoslavia -lrb- icty -rrb- .
eu leaders have said that they will not sign a stabilization and association agreement -lrb- saa -rrb- paving the way to candidate status for serbia until it cooperates fully with the icty .
rehn " reiterated his strong commitment to serbia 's european future , and would like to sign the saa soon , once the conditions are fulfilled , " the spokeswoman said .

germany 's rail company had initially rejected the idea , but bowed to pressure from the transport minister . ordinary people supported the nazi dictatorship in their everyday lives , which is why the exhibit about these crimes must be shown in an everyday place , transport minister wolfgang tiefensee said wednesday , jan .
23 , at the opening of the exhibition potsdamer platz station in downtown berlin . forty information boards with photos , personal testimonies , biographies and diagrams detail the fate of , among others , 11,400 jewish children who were deported from france to the auschwitz death camp by train between 1942 and 1944 . the exhibition , which also honors the sinti roma deported and killed by the nazis , is a replicate of a similar show that took place in french train stations four years ago .
both were organized by the french-german couple beate and serge klarsfeld , who founded the organization sons and daughters of jews deported from france . poignant location despite commuter chaos bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : nazi-hunter klarsfeld outlined the personal stories of thousands of deported children " putting an exhibition in a station is very different from putting it in a museum , " serge klarsfeld told the afp news agency on wednesday .
" it speaks to the german people directly . " however , deutsche bahn , germany 's national rail operator , had at first opposed the proposal to transform train station into a place of remembrance . " the subject is too serious , " deutsche bahn chief hartmut mehdorn said in october 2006 .
" it deserves more than commuters ' divided attention as they run to catch their trains while gulping down a sandwich . " in response , the rail company drew harsh criticism from the klarsfelds , who accused it of not owning up to its past . the reichsbahn , predecessor of germany 's present day train service , played an essential role in the nazi scheme to deport and exterminate millions of jews , roma and other " unwanted " people .
it also received money from the nazi government for each person it deported . trains made genocide possible bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : track 17 in grunewald is a memorial to holocaust victims deutsche bahn finally gave in to pressure from the transport minister . " it was important to me that this exhibition should go ahead and expose the troubled past of the reichsbahn , " tiefensee said wednesday at the opening of the exhibition . mehdorn did not attend the ceremony , but margret suckale , deutsche bahn 's personnel and legal manager , affirmed that , " without a doubt , the reichsbahn played a supporting role in the national socialist genocide . " a deutsche bahn press statement emphasized that the company seeks to uncover and remember its nazi past in other ways as well , including a memorial at track 17 at the grunewald station and with an exhibition at its museum in nuremberg . the deportation exhibition , titled " chartered trains to death - deportation with the german reichsbahn , " will be on display at the potsdamer platz station in berlin through feb .

" kosovo is ready , is united , and i think we 'll proclaim the date -lrb- of independence -rrb- in pristina very soon , " thaci said after talks with eu foreign-policy chief javier solana .
" we have discussed many things - the constitution , the symbols .
kosovo is ready for independence .
it 's an issue of days , " he said .
solana , when asked if he had discussed the date of any such declaration with thaci , answered " no , i did not , " but added that he had agreed to maintain contacts with the kosovo albanians .
serbia is to hold the final round of its presidential election on february 3 , with ultra-nationalist candidate tomislav nikolic having taken the lead over pro-eu incumbent boris tadic in the first round .
kosovo is the most heated issue on the agenda , with nationalists accusing the eu of wanting to steal the province from them .
eu officials have been careful to steer clear of any comments which could inflame the situation ahead of the crucial vote .
" the issue is a very sensitive one and we are in a very sensitive political context in which it is better to resort to diplomatic means than public statements , " a spokeswoman for eu enlargement commissioner olli rehn told journalists .
eu reiterates its commitment balkan stability bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : " we wo n't give up kosovo " sums up the serbian stance thaci and rehn discussed " the european perspective of kosovo and the whole region of the western balkans as well as the issue of the settlement of kosovo 's status , " she said .
rehn " reiterated the eu 's readiness to carry its responsibility by steering a coordinated and managed process to finalize the settlement of kosovo 's status , " she said .
the question of what to do when kosovo declares independence is the most divisive issue in the eu at present .

" kosovo is ready , is united , and i think we 'll proclaim the date -lrb- of independence -rrb- in pristina very soon , " thaci said after talks with eu foreign-policy chief javier solana .
" we have discussed many things - the constitution , the symbols .

it 's an issue of days , " he said .
solana , when asked if he had discussed the date of any such declaration with thaci , answered " no , i did not , " but added that he had agreed to maintain contacts with the kosovo albanians .
serbia is to hold the final round of its presidential election on february 3 , with ultra-nationalist candidate tomislav nikolic having taken the lead over pro-eu incumbent boris tadic in the first round .
kosovo is the most heated issue on the agenda , with nationalists accusing the eu of wanting to steal the province from them .
eu officials have been careful to steer clear of any comments which could inflame the situation ahead of the crucial vote .

the question of what to do when kosovo declares independence is the most divisive issue in the eu at present .

11 attacks lawmakers from 47 european nations have strongly criticized a system of un and eu sanctions against suspected backers of global terrorism , saying the use of terrorist blacklists violates fundamental rights . the council of europe , the eu 's rights watchdog , rules urged the united nations and the european union to overhaul procedures to blacklist individuals and groups suspected of having links to terrorism .
not only does the practice violate human rights , the lawmakers concluded , but they are " completely arbitrary , " according to a statement released by the 47-member body .
a report commissioned by the rights body said people were blacklisted on the basis of " mere suspicion " and called the measures " deplorable and violation of human rights and fundamental freedoms . "
harsh penalties against suspects dick marty , a swiss senator and former prosecutor who has published critical reports into alleged anti-terrorist practices by states and institutions , including reported secret cia prisons on european soil , said those affected by the terrorist blacklists had absolutely no rights to defend themselves against terrorist allegations .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : marty said the practice gave suspects no chance of defending themselves " i have seldom experienced anything as unfair as the compilation of these lists , " marty said at the european parliament in strasbourg this week .
according to the report , around 370 people and 130 groups or organizations are currently on the un 's blacklist .
they include alleged taliban individuals and those linked to al qaeda .
the eu lists 60 people or groups - including the radical palestinian group hamas and the basque separatist group , eta .
set up after the sept .
11 attacks in 2001 , the lists impose a number of penalties on those suspected of backing terrorism .
they include freezing suspects ' assets and preventing them from traveling without giving them a court hearing or disclosing the evidence against them .
the council of europe said in its report that many suspects on the lists only discovered that they were on it after they were stopped at a border while travelling or when their bank accounts were frozen .
" people remain on these lists for years without knowing why , and their lives are ruined , " marty said .
marty 's investigation into the practice was sparked by the case of a 78-year-old italian citizen of arab descent , youssef nada whose business was ruined after he landed on the blacklist .
the cia reportedly suspected nada of belonging to a group of financiers behind the sept .
11 attacks .
but a four-year investigation by swiss authorities into nada 's case was suspended in 2005 due to a lack of evidence .
nada 's assets were seized and he was barred from leaving his home of 30 years in switzerland .
nada 's name remains on the terror blacklist .
top eu court may rule against un practice the un system is at present being scrutinized by the eu 's top court and there is a strong likelihood it may rule that the 27-member bloc has violated basic rights by applying them .
according to news agency reuters , an eu legal advisor has recommended the eu court of justice in luxembourg should cancel financial sanctions against a saudi businessman and a swedish-based money transfer business in two separate cases .
the agency quoted cameron doley , a british lawyer representing saudi businessman yassin kadi as saying that his client had never received a clear statement of the allegations against him .
kadi had filed his case in the eu because the un had no equivalent tribunal to which he could appeal .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de business -pipe- 24.01.2008 tensions at siemens agm as more corruption claims emerge großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : it will be years before siemens can put the scandal behind it as investors aired their grievances at the siemens general assembly of shareholders , allegations of corruption continue to emerge . some 10,000 investors came to munich on thursday for a general assembly of siemens shareholders , accusing the bosses of failing to address the spiraling corruption scandal .
" the reputation built by siemens for 160 years has been reduced to ashes , " said daniela bergdolt , from the dsw group of small investors .
" it is not satisfactory that the affair has not been wrapped up after more than a year , " complained hans hirt , who represented the british pension fund hermes .
in the latest twist to the " affair , " investigators have established that payments worth around 140 million euros -lrb- $ 206 million -rrb- have been found in the firm 's flagship medical equipment division , reported the daily süddeutsche zeitung thursday .
siemens ' most profitable division , its turnover averages some 10 billion euros a year .
until now , siemens has said such payments totalled around 1.3 billion euros .
the löscher effect bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : shareholders got a chance to voice their feelings exempted from the shareholders ' criticisms was siemens boss peter löscher , appointed six months ago following the disclosure of a well-stocked slush fund at the group .
shareholders ' hopes are resting on the shoulders of löscher , the first siemens boss to be hired from outside the group .
he has already renovated the management team and begun to simplify the company 's tentacular structure , reining in directors of siemens units abroad who have been dubbed " the princes . "
" what counts for me is clean business everywhere and always , and highest performance meeting the highest ethical standards , " he has said .
he has also revealed that the group had been hit with compliance costs to date of around 1.1 billion euros , plus around 520 million in tax liabilities and sanctions " whose scope can not be estimated . "
" intangible damage is much harder to measure - the loss of reputation and trust in the general public , " he said .
shareholder concerns others on the executive floor were given a rocky ride by investors , including those supposed to be controlling the group such as supervisory board gerhard cromme and his right-hand man , deutsche bank chairman josef ackermann .
according to afp , the association of small shareholders dsw intends to vote against a renewal of their mandates , which nonetheless seem assured .
among the top figures absent were former siemens boss klaus kleinfeld and former supervisory board president heinrich von pierer , the emblematic head of the group from 1992 to 2005 , who both left siemens last year .
one telling sign of the times was a decision by siemens to forego the traditional vote of confidence by which shareholders typically approve the management team 's performance over the past year .
but the supervisory board , including cromme and his right-hand man josef ackermann , the chairman of deutsche bank , were to face such a vote .
still in business bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : peter löscher it has been over a year since the first revelations emerged about shady dealings at siemens , often in the form of money alleged to have been paid under the table to obtain foreign contracts .
at last count , the biggest private german employer had acknowledged 1.3 billion euros in questionable funds .
according to press reports , internal allegations are still abounding , including the suggestion that corruption was present up to the higher spheres of the group .
the german group is listed on wall street and fears being slapped with a fine of four billion euros -lrb- 5.8 billion dollars -rrb- in the us , according to the german business magazine wirtschaftswoche .
but for the time being , the company 's businesses - medical equipment , manufacturing , trains and electric power stations - remain healthy .
the company posted a huge increase in first quarter profit from 788 million euros to 6.5 billion owing to the sale of the auto equipment parts company vdo .
operating profit for the first three months of its 2007-2008 fiscal year , which began on october 1 , increased by 16 percent to 1.7 billion euros , on sales which grew by 10 percent to 18.4 billion euros . dw staff -lrb- jp -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de food and drink -pipe- 24.01.2008 micro-brewers hope to fight sinking beer sales in germany großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : germans are drinking less beer , but local specialties still sell well german beer consumption has been in steady decline since the early 1990s – - especially among young people .
speciality breweries and brew-pubs could change that , but they 've not really become popular - so far . beer may be germany 's unofficial national drink , but more and more germans seem to be losing their taste for it .
according to the german brewer 's association , beer consumption fell by around 18 percent from 1992 to 2006 . one person who 's not affected by the decline is berlin 's oliver lemke , the owner of one of the few independent brewpubs in the german capital .
business is up in all four of his establishments , the first of which opened in 1999 .
he said the overall slump reflects the destruction of small local breweries by big corporations . " there used to be 100 breweries in this neighborhood alone , " lemke said .
" they died out in the 1970s with the trend toward mono-breweries .
the big breweries - for example warsteiner or licher – said : ‘ we 're only going to make one sort of beer , a premium pilsner , and we 'll market it nationwide . '
and that inevitably leads to a dead-end .
at some point , even the world 's biggest idiot notices that there 's virtually no difference between a warsteiner and licher . " popsicle flavorings or real ale ? bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : berlin 's brauhaus lemke has n't been affected by the slump germany has some 1,300 brewing companies , but the vast majority - including germany 's most famous brand , beck 's - belong to huge international conglomerates , and styles rarely stray from the standard pilsner and wheat varieties .
the main strategy among major brewers for interesting young people is to mix their products with everything from lemon flavor to cola . but why has n't germany gotten in on the micro-brewery and real-ale trends in the us or the uk ?
after all , no self-respecting manhattan yuppie would be seen with a bud light in his hand . " it 's a global interplay between wrong-headed marketing , the wrong sort of people as bar owners and the wrong retailing structures , " lemke said .
" that 's why those trends are under-represented here compared with the united states . " lemke is trying to change that .
his brewpubs revive almost forgotten brewing styles , such as amber ale or the double-hopped , non-filtered zwickel , and seasonal specialities such as the extra-strength märzen -lrb- " march beer " -rrb- .
they sell a respectable 2,500 hectoliters -lrb- 66,000 gallons -rrb- a year - and there 's no mistaking them for beck 's . alcohol abuse bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : nationally marketed brands forced many local breweries out of business in the 1970s but it 's difficult for independents to break through against the conglomerates .
the big brewing companies control distribution networks and encourage pub owners to feature their products exclusively by offering loans , price rebates and free tapping and refrigeration systems , beer glasses and even ashtrays . and german consumers and bar owners are ignorant about the drink itself , lemke said . " the german beer drinker thinks he knows a lot about beer , but most of them know very , very , little , " he said .
" it start 's with the myth that you need seven minutes to tap a good pilsner .
nonsense - that just makes it go flat and warm .
when i go to bars , i usually drink bottled beer because i know the tap beer has usually been physically abused .
it 's atrocious .
i know a lot of people in america that know far more about beer than people here in germany . " name recognition bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : what would a brewpub be without the obligatory copper brewing kettles ?
the first problem for small brewers is how to let potential customers know that they 're there . " that 's due in part to the marketing abilities of the big companies , " said marc-oliver huhnholz , press spokesman for the german brewers ' association .
" also america never drank as much beer as germany so small brewers can have more impact . " and to appeal to a new generation of potential beer drinkers , brewers have to take into account demographic shifts and the accompanying changes in personal taste . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : beer suffers from its image as a drink for older men " the average age in germany is rising , and older people tend to drink less , " huhnholz said .
" and among younger people , the trend is toward milder drinks - women especially prefer sweeter drinks .
they do n't want anything too bitter . " but huhnholz also thinks that small local breweries can play a role in stirring up new interest in - and appreciation for - beer . " small brewers have to offer an attractive product , and they need to do a lot of marketing , " huhnholz said .
" but some of them can succeed . " beer vs. bureaucracy bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : is germany 's bureaucracy preventing more small brew-pubs from opening ?
philipp brokamp would love to do that , but first he has to get started .
the 32-year-old brewer moved to berlin last year and is set to open his first brewpub , appropriately named hops and barley . without the support of a major corporation , that 's proven a daunting task .
germany 's notorious bureaucracy has n't made things any easier , brokamp said . " there 's the stereotype about bureaucracy , but i now know it 's not a stereotype , " said brokamp , who was forced to postpone opening due to red tape .
" i 've had to deal with at least eight separate government permit agencies , everything from the civil engineering office to offices for the environment and handicapped accessibility .
every one of them considered itself particularly important , but they could n't even agree on what the regulations were . " all that for a bar with a capacity of 100 , where the beer is made in the basement . while he 's tying up loose ends , brokamp is brewing light and dark beers as well as red ale and cider .
his style emphasizes malt more than lemke 's without being overly sweet . brokamp 's beers are also non-filtered , which means they look cloudy when poured .
but as he explains , cloudiness is good . " the things mass breweries filter out are n't impurities , " brokamp said .
" they 're very nutritious , and they make the beer more flavorful than filtered varieties . " think globally , drink locally bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : friedrichshain 's student crowds might be perfect for a micro-brewery lemke 's flagship brewpub is in the touristy neighborhood around berlin 's hackescher markt , while brokamp 's bar is located in the more residential area of friedrichshain .
he knows it will be a challenge to convince the locals to drink local stuff , but he 's confident . " i think that it 's exactly the right niche in the market , " brokamp said .
" general consumption is in decline .
people are more conscious and perhaps more choosey about what they drink .
and so i hope they 'll be interested in the sort of specialities that i 'll be offering . " brokamp will begin testing that hypothesis on feb .
2 , when hops and barley officially opens .
then he 'll see whether his neighbors are interested in trying something out of the ordinary or whether they prefer to just keep popping open beck 's - in decreasing numbers . jefferson chase send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

speciality breweries and brew-pubs could change that , but they 've not really become popular - so far . beer may be germany 's unofficial national drink , but more and more germans seem to be losing their taste for it .
according to the german brewer 's association , beer consumption fell by around 18 percent from 1992 to 2006 . one person who 's not affected by the decline is berlin 's oliver lemke , the owner of one of the few independent brewpubs in the german capital .
business is up in all four of his establishments , the first of which opened in 1999 .
he said the overall slump reflects the destruction of small local breweries by big corporations . " there used to be 100 breweries in this neighborhood alone , " lemke said .
" they died out in the 1970s with the trend toward mono-breweries .
the big breweries - for example warsteiner or licher – said : ‘ we 're only going to make one sort of beer , a premium pilsner , and we 'll market it nationwide . '
and that inevitably leads to a dead-end .
at some point , even the world 's biggest idiot notices that there 's virtually no difference between a warsteiner and licher . " popsicle flavorings or real ale ? bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : berlin 's brauhaus lemke has n't been affected by the slump germany has some 1,300 brewing companies , but the vast majority - including germany 's most famous brand , beck 's - belong to huge international conglomerates , and styles rarely stray from the standard pilsner and wheat varieties .
the main strategy among major brewers for interesting young people is to mix their products with everything from lemon flavor to cola . but why has n't germany gotten in on the micro-brewery and real-ale trends in the us or the uk ?
after all , no self-respecting manhattan yuppie would be seen with a bud light in his hand . " it 's a global interplay between wrong-headed marketing , the wrong sort of people as bar owners and the wrong retailing structures , " lemke said .
" that 's why those trends are under-represented here compared with the united states . " lemke is trying to change that .
his brewpubs revive almost forgotten brewing styles , such as amber ale or the double-hopped , non-filtered zwickel , and seasonal specialities such as the extra-strength märzen -lrb- " march beer " -rrb- .
they sell a respectable 2,500 hectoliters -lrb- 66,000 gallons -rrb- a year - and there 's no mistaking them for beck 's . alcohol abuse bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : nationally marketed brands forced many local breweries out of business in the 1970s but it 's difficult for independents to break through against the conglomerates .
the big brewing companies control distribution networks and encourage pub owners to feature their products exclusively by offering loans , price rebates and free tapping and refrigeration systems , beer glasses and even ashtrays . and german consumers and bar owners are ignorant about the drink itself , lemke said . " the german beer drinker thinks he knows a lot about beer , but most of them know very , very , little , " he said .

the first problem for small brewers is how to let potential customers know that they 're there . " that 's due in part to the marketing abilities of the big companies , " said marc-oliver huhnholz , press spokesman for the german brewers ' association .

germany 's notorious bureaucracy has n't made things any easier , brokamp said . " there 's the stereotype about bureaucracy , but i now know it 's not a stereotype , " said brokamp , who was forced to postpone opening due to red tape .

speciality breweries and brew-pubs could change that , but they 've not really become popular - so far . beer may be germany 's unofficial national drink , but more and more germans seem to be losing their taste for it .
according to the german brewer 's association , beer consumption fell by around 18 percent from 1992 to 2006 . one person who 's not affected by the decline is berlin 's oliver lemke , the owner of one of the few independent brewpubs in the german capital .
business is up in all four of his establishments , the first of which opened in 1999 .
he said the overall slump reflects the destruction of small local breweries by big corporations . " there used to be 100 breweries in this neighborhood alone , " lemke said .
" they died out in the 1970s with the trend toward mono-breweries .
the big breweries - for example warsteiner or licher – said : ‘ we 're only going to make one sort of beer , a premium pilsner , and we 'll market it nationwide . '
and that inevitably leads to a dead-end .
at some point , even the world 's biggest idiot notices that there 's virtually no difference between a warsteiner and licher . " popsicle flavorings or real ale ? bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : berlin 's brauhaus lemke has n't been affected by the slump germany has some 1,300 brewing companies , but the vast majority - including germany 's most famous brand , beck 's - belong to huge international conglomerates , and styles rarely stray from the standard pilsner and wheat varieties .
the main strategy among major brewers for interesting young people is to mix their products with everything from lemon flavor to cola . but why has n't germany gotten in on the micro-brewery and real-ale trends in the us or the uk ?
after all , no self-respecting manhattan yuppie would be seen with a bud light in his hand . " it 's a global interplay between wrong-headed marketing , the wrong sort of people as bar owners and the wrong retailing structures , " lemke said .
" that 's why those trends are under-represented here compared with the united states . " lemke is trying to change that .
his brewpubs revive almost forgotten brewing styles , such as amber ale or the double-hopped , non-filtered zwickel , and seasonal specialities such as the extra-strength märzen -lrb- " march beer " -rrb- .
they sell a respectable 2,500 hectoliters -lrb- 66,000 gallons -rrb- a year - and there 's no mistaking them for beck 's . alcohol abuse bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : nationally marketed brands forced many local breweries out of business in the 1970s but it 's difficult for independents to break through against the conglomerates .
the big brewing companies control distribution networks and encourage pub owners to feature their products exclusively by offering loans , price rebates and free tapping and refrigeration systems , beer glasses and even ashtrays . and german consumers and bar owners are ignorant about the drink itself , lemke said . " the german beer drinker thinks he knows a lot about beer , but most of them know very , very , little , " he said .
" it start 's with the myth that you need seven minutes to tap a good pilsner .
nonsense - that just makes it go flat and warm .
when i go to bars , i usually drink bottled beer because i know the tap beer has usually been physically abused .
it 's atrocious .

11 attacks lawmakers from 47 european nations have strongly criticized a system of un and eu sanctions against suspected backers of global terrorism , saying the use of terrorist blacklists violates fundamental rights . the council of europe , the eu 's rights watchdog , rules urged the united nations and the european union to overhaul procedures to blacklist individuals and groups suspected of having links to terrorism .
not only does the practice violate human rights , the lawmakers concluded , but they are " completely arbitrary , " according to a statement released by the 47-member body .
a report commissioned by the rights body said people were blacklisted on the basis of " mere suspicion " and called the measures " deplorable and violation of human rights and fundamental freedoms . "
harsh penalties against suspects dick marty , a swiss senator and former prosecutor who has published critical reports into alleged anti-terrorist practices by states and institutions , including reported secret cia prisons on european soil , said those affected by the terrorist blacklists had absolutely no rights to defend themselves against terrorist allegations .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : marty said the practice gave suspects no chance of defending themselves " i have seldom experienced anything as unfair as the compilation of these lists , " marty said at the european parliament in strasbourg this week .
according to the report , around 370 people and 130 groups or organizations are currently on the un 's blacklist .
they include alleged taliban individuals and those linked to al qaeda .
the eu lists 60 people or groups - including the radical palestinian group hamas and the basque separatist group , eta .
set up after the sept .
11 attacks in 2001 , the lists impose a number of penalties on those suspected of backing terrorism .
they include freezing suspects ' assets and preventing them from traveling without giving them a court hearing or disclosing the evidence against them .
the council of europe said in its report that many suspects on the lists only discovered that they were on it after they were stopped at a border while travelling or when their bank accounts were frozen .
" people remain on these lists for years without knowing why , and their lives are ruined , " marty said .
marty 's investigation into the practice was sparked by the case of a 78-year-old italian citizen of arab descent , youssef nada whose business was ruined after he landed on the blacklist .
the cia reportedly suspected nada of belonging to a group of financiers behind the sept .
11 attacks .
but a four-year investigation by swiss authorities into nada 's case was suspended in 2005 due to a lack of evidence .
nada 's assets were seized and he was barred from leaving his home of 30 years in switzerland .
nada 's name remains on the terror blacklist .
top eu court may rule against un practice the un system is at present being scrutinized by the eu 's top court and there is a strong likelihood it may rule that the 27-member bloc has violated basic rights by applying them .
according to news agency reuters , an eu legal advisor has recommended the eu court of justice in luxembourg should cancel financial sanctions against a saudi businessman and a swedish-based money transfer business in two separate cases .
the agency quoted cameron doley , a british lawyer representing saudi businessman yassin kadi as saying that his client had never received a clear statement of the allegations against him .
kadi had filed his case in the eu because the un had no equivalent tribunal to which he could appeal .
" what this gives us , we hope , is a statement by one of the most prominent and respected courts in the world that this system is an unjustified infringement of the fundamental human rights of those persons who are listed , " doley told reuters . dw staff -lrb- sp -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

but people should rather look on the bright side , one of germany 's leading business managers told deutsche welle . jürgen großmann , 55 , is the ceo of rwe , one of germany 's largest energy companies .
he talked to dw-radio on the sidelines of the world economic forum in davos , which started wednesday , jan .
23 . deutsche welle : the financial and stock market crisis is the dominating topic in davos .
what could german businesses and publicly traded companies do to prevent a stock value massacre like the one we 've seen at the beginning of the week ? bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : jürgen großmann jürgen großmann : central banks and governments will surely come up with macroeconomic measures .
the lowering of interest rates by the us federal reserve is a first step .
in terms of microeconomics , companies have to tell themselves again and again : the donkey gets daring when he feels too comfortable .
we have to keep our cost structures and our competitiveness under control for stock market success to return .
it 's right and important to correct things sometimes .
let 's see that we get our ships back in order ; that we stick to the course .
do n't panic .
that 's the worst thing that could happen .
instead , we should analyze the current situation with a clear head .
if we do that , we 'll emerge from this stronger , i believe . how much is germany affected by the financial crisis ? bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : it 's no fun to be a german stock broker at the momen the global economy naturally is connected via financial markets , insurances and banks .
if wealth is destroyed in one place , that clearly has an effect on the behavior of consumers and investors .
we 're all affected .
no one should think that he 's not simply because he does n't own any stock .
that 's completely wrong . many people would love to be in the position that germany 's been fighting for hard for decades .
they 're also working on becoming world champions .
everyone participates in globalization and there are only marginal groups that do n't .
here in davos , we 've seen many studies over the past couple of years that have all reached the same conclusion : when all is said and done , the global economy , and also the poorest countries , have benefited from globalization . the example of cell phone maker nokia , who is about to close a plan in bochum in western germany , shows that even jobs in booming sectors are n't safe any more in germany .
will protectionism return ?
will industrialized countries have to isolate their markets to a greater extent in order to secure jobs ? bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : if nokia goes to romania , germans have to fill the void the eu 's never dropped protectionism in certain sectors , such as agriculture .
the bitter thing about nokia is that the competitor 's not in southeast asia , but in the eu and that the shift of jobs might even be financed with eu money .
but we 're still profiting big time from globalization and we have to think about how we can respond to such challenges . running after investors with subsidies clearly is n't the way to do it .
we need to recollect ourselves and think about our own strengths and develop our own business concepts .
we need german entrepreneurs that say : okay , if nokia leaves , we 'll step in .
we need good new ideas backed by innovation and we can develop them - it 's possible in germany . interview : marco vollmar -lrb- win -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

24 , that the countries would pay a far higher price for ignoring the environment . while the measures would cost consumers 3 euros -lrb- $ 4.37 -rrb- a week on average , " the cost of inaction is up to 10 times more than what we are proposing , " said commission president jose manuel barroso . " responding to the challenge of climate change is the ultimate political test for our generation , " he added .
" our package not only responds to this challenge , but holds the right answer to the challenge of energy security and is an opportunity that should create thousands of new businesses and millions of jobs . " urging eu members to curb their dependency on imports of fossil fuels and to step up their use of renewable energy and biofuels , he also laid out plans to make industry pay for the right to pollute . environmental gain , economic loss ? bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : what will the impact be on industry ?
the measures are designed to put into action the aim set by eu leaders last year to cut carbon dioxide emissions by 20 percent by 2020 , compared to 1990 levels . by then , the use of renewable energies like biomass , wind and solar power will have to have risen to 20 percent of all energy forms .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de business -pipe- 24.01.2008 tensions at siemens agm as more corruption claims emerge großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : it will be years before siemens can put the scandal behind it as investors aired their grievances at the siemens general assembly of shareholders , allegations of corruption continue to emerge . some 10,000 investors came to munich on thursday for a general assembly of siemens shareholders , accusing the bosses of failing to address the spiraling corruption scandal .
" the reputation built by siemens for 160 years has been reduced to ashes , " said daniela bergdolt , from the dsw group of small investors .
" it is not satisfactory that the affair has not been wrapped up after more than a year , " complained hans hirt , who represented the british pension fund hermes .
in the latest twist to the " affair , " investigators have established that payments worth around 140 million euros -lrb- $ 206 million -rrb- have been found in the firm 's flagship medical equipment division , reported the daily süddeutsche zeitung thursday .
siemens ' most profitable division , its turnover averages some 10 billion euros a year .
until now , siemens has said such payments totalled around 1.3 billion euros .
the löscher effect bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : shareholders got a chance to voice their feelings exempted from the shareholders ' criticisms was siemens boss peter löscher , appointed six months ago following the disclosure of a well-stocked slush fund at the group .
shareholders ' hopes are resting on the shoulders of löscher , the first siemens boss to be hired from outside the group .
he has already renovated the management team and begun to simplify the company 's tentacular structure , reining in directors of siemens units abroad who have been dubbed " the princes . "
" what counts for me is clean business everywhere and always , and highest performance meeting the highest ethical standards , " he has said .
he has also revealed that the group had been hit with compliance costs to date of around 1.1 billion euros , plus around 520 million in tax liabilities and sanctions " whose scope can not be estimated . "
" intangible damage is much harder to measure - the loss of reputation and trust in the general public , " he said .
shareholder concerns others on the executive floor were given a rocky ride by investors , including those supposed to be controlling the group such as supervisory board gerhard cromme and his right-hand man , deutsche bank chairman josef ackermann .
according to afp , the association of small shareholders dsw intends to vote against a renewal of their mandates , which nonetheless seem assured .
among the top figures absent were former siemens boss klaus kleinfeld and former supervisory board president heinrich von pierer , the emblematic head of the group from 1992 to 2005 , who both left siemens last year .
one telling sign of the times was a decision by siemens to forego the traditional vote of confidence by which shareholders typically approve the management team 's performance over the past year .
but the supervisory board , including cromme and his right-hand man josef ackermann , the chairman of deutsche bank , were to face such a vote .
still in business bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : peter löscher it has been over a year since the first revelations emerged about shady dealings at siemens , often in the form of money alleged to have been paid under the table to obtain foreign contracts .
at last count , the biggest private german employer had acknowledged 1.3 billion euros in questionable funds .
according to press reports , internal allegations are still abounding , including the suggestion that corruption was present up to the higher spheres of the group .
the german group is listed on wall street and fears being slapped with a fine of four billion euros -lrb- 5.8 billion dollars -rrb- in the us , according to the german business magazine wirtschaftswoche .
but for the time being , the company 's businesses - medical equipment , manufacturing , trains and electric power stations - remain healthy .
the company posted a huge increase in first quarter profit from 788 million euros to 6.5 billion owing to the sale of the auto equipment parts company vdo .
operating profit for the first three months of its 2007-2008 fiscal year , which began on october 1 , increased by 16 percent to 1.7 billion euros , on sales which grew by 10 percent to 18.4 billion euros . dw staff -lrb- jp -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

24 , that the countries would pay a far higher price for ignoring the environment . while the measures would cost consumers 3 euros -lrb- $ 4.37 -rrb- a week on average , " the cost of inaction is up to 10 times more than what we are proposing , " said commission president jose manuel barroso . " responding to the challenge of climate change is the ultimate political test for our generation , " he added .
" our package not only responds to this challenge , but holds the right answer to the challenge of energy security and is an opportunity that should create thousands of new businesses and millions of jobs . " urging eu members to curb their dependency on imports of fossil fuels and to step up their use of renewable energy and biofuels , he also laid out plans to make industry pay for the right to pollute . environmental gain , economic loss ? bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : what will the impact be on industry ?
the measures are designed to put into action the aim set by eu leaders last year to cut carbon dioxide emissions by 20 percent by 2020 , compared to 1990 levels . by then , the use of renewable energies like biomass , wind and solar power will have to have risen to 20 percent of all energy forms .
biofuels will also have to make up 10 percent of fuels used for transport . these targets would wean the bloc off coal and oil , as would a decision that power generators must pay from 2013 for all permits to emit carbon dioxide - but left industrial leaders wondering about the impact on industry . german utility rwe said the package called into question the future of coal . " coal is threatened in its economic viability , " rwe 's head of power generation , ulrich jobs , told reuters meanwhile , other energy-intensive sectors such as the steel , aluminum and chemical industries have accepted the principles of the plan but voiced similar concerns about the cost and impact on jobs and a drop in competitiveness .
the steel industry is expecting the shift to entail the loss of up to 300,000 jobs across europe . " we foresee that industry and individuals will be facing a huge rise in the cost of electricity , " said jürgen thumann , president of the german association of german industry in berlin wednesday .
" the pinch will be felt by energy-intensive industries but also by other sectors . " compromising competitiveness some companies also fear that the stringent emission targets will force them to move production outside the bloc - and further strengthen the competitiveness of china and india , which so far have no emission limits . announcing that the commission will be monitoring any negative repercussions on the labor market , barroso conceded this was " a risk " and said brussels would do what it could to counter it . " an international agreement is our absolute priority , " barroso told reporters .
" but let me be clear , if we do not make progress we will protect european companies . " eu environment commissioner stavros dimas has said that if competitors from the us and china have still failed to establish climate rules by 2011 , thereby allowing for cheap production , he would consider lightening the burden for european companies and forcing importers to buy emissions permits . germany 's concerns bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : glos is concerned too heavy a burden is being placed on germany with around 8.5 percent of eu energy coming from renewable forms , future load sharing will be based in part on gross domestic product . while german environment minister sigmar gabriel hailed the plan as " courageous , " economy minister michael glos warned that " it will destroy jobs in industries which consume a lot of energy . " glos also suggested that the commission 's plan left germany carrying an unfair share of the climate protection burden . " we can not accept that the eu commission simply says : germany wanted climate protection and should therefore do the lion 's share of the work . " he was backed up by joachim pfeiffer , the christian democrats ' energy expert . " the eu commission proposals are an attack on germany as an industrial location , " he said .

" the reputation built by siemens for 160 years has been reduced to ashes , " said daniela bergdolt , from the dsw group of small investors .
" it is not satisfactory that the affair has not been wrapped up after more than a year , " complained hans hirt , who represented the british pension fund hermes .
in the latest twist to the " affair , " investigators have established that payments worth around 140 million euros -lrb- $ 206 million -rrb- have been found in the firm 's flagship medical equipment division , reported the daily süddeutsche zeitung thursday .
siemens ' most profitable division , its turnover averages some 10 billion euros a year .
until now , siemens has said such payments totalled around 1.3 billion euros .
the löscher effect bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : shareholders got a chance to voice their feelings exempted from the shareholders ' criticisms was siemens boss peter löscher , appointed six months ago following the disclosure of a well-stocked slush fund at the group .
shareholders ' hopes are resting on the shoulders of löscher , the first siemens boss to be hired from outside the group .
he has already renovated the management team and begun to simplify the company 's tentacular structure , reining in directors of siemens units abroad who have been dubbed " the princes . "
" what counts for me is clean business everywhere and always , and highest performance meeting the highest ethical standards , " he has said .
he has also revealed that the group had been hit with compliance costs to date of around 1.1 billion euros , plus around 520 million in tax liabilities and sanctions " whose scope can not be estimated . "
" intangible damage is much harder to measure - the loss of reputation and trust in the general public , " he said .
shareholder concerns others on the executive floor were given a rocky ride by investors , including those supposed to be controlling the group such as supervisory board gerhard cromme and his right-hand man , deutsche bank chairman josef ackermann .
according to afp , the association of small shareholders dsw intends to vote against a renewal of their mandates , which nonetheless seem assured .
among the top figures absent were former siemens boss klaus kleinfeld and former supervisory board president heinrich von pierer , the emblematic head of the group from 1992 to 2005 , who both left siemens last year .
one telling sign of the times was a decision by siemens to forego the traditional vote of confidence by which shareholders typically approve the management team 's performance over the past year .
but the supervisory board , including cromme and his right-hand man josef ackermann , the chairman of deutsche bank , were to face such a vote .

according to press reports , internal allegations are still abounding , including the suggestion that corruption was present up to the higher spheres of the group .
the german group is listed on wall street and fears being slapped with a fine of four billion euros -lrb- 5.8 billion dollars -rrb- in the us , according to the german business magazine wirtschaftswoche .
but for the time being , the company 's businesses - medical equipment , manufacturing , trains and electric power stations - remain healthy .

11 attacks lawmakers from 47 european nations have strongly criticized a system of un and eu sanctions against suspected backers of global terrorism , saying the use of terrorist blacklists violates fundamental rights . the council of europe , the eu 's rights watchdog , rules urged the united nations and the european union to overhaul procedures to blacklist individuals and groups suspected of having links to terrorism .
not only does the practice violate human rights , the lawmakers concluded , but they are " completely arbitrary , " according to a statement released by the 47-member body .
a report commissioned by the rights body said people were blacklisted on the basis of " mere suspicion " and called the measures " deplorable and violation of human rights and fundamental freedoms . "
harsh penalties against suspects dick marty , a swiss senator and former prosecutor who has published critical reports into alleged anti-terrorist practices by states and institutions , including reported secret cia prisons on european soil , said those affected by the terrorist blacklists had absolutely no rights to defend themselves against terrorist allegations .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : marty said the practice gave suspects no chance of defending themselves " i have seldom experienced anything as unfair as the compilation of these lists , " marty said at the european parliament in strasbourg this week .
according to the report , around 370 people and 130 groups or organizations are currently on the un 's blacklist .
they include alleged taliban individuals and those linked to al qaeda .
the eu lists 60 people or groups - including the radical palestinian group hamas and the basque separatist group , eta .
set up after the sept .
11 attacks in 2001 , the lists impose a number of penalties on those suspected of backing terrorism .
they include freezing suspects ' assets and preventing them from traveling without giving them a court hearing or disclosing the evidence against them .
the council of europe said in its report that many suspects on the lists only discovered that they were on it after they were stopped at a border while travelling or when their bank accounts were frozen .
" people remain on these lists for years without knowing why , and their lives are ruined , " marty said .
marty 's investigation into the practice was sparked by the case of a 78-year-old italian citizen of arab descent , youssef nada whose business was ruined after he landed on the blacklist .
the cia reportedly suspected nada of belonging to a group of financiers behind the sept .
11 attacks .
but a four-year investigation by swiss authorities into nada 's case was suspended in 2005 due to a lack of evidence .
nada 's assets were seized and he was barred from leaving his home of 30 years in switzerland .
nada 's name remains on the terror blacklist .
top eu court may rule against un practice the un system is at present being scrutinized by the eu 's top court and there is a strong likelihood it may rule that the 27-member bloc has violated basic rights by applying them .
according to news agency reuters , an eu legal advisor has recommended the eu court of justice in luxembourg should cancel financial sanctions against a saudi businessman and a swedish-based money transfer business in two separate cases .
the agency quoted cameron doley , a british lawyer representing saudi businessman yassin kadi as saying that his client had never received a clear statement of the allegations against him .
kadi had filed his case in the eu because the un had no equivalent tribunal to which he could appeal .
" what this gives us , we hope , is a statement by one of the most prominent and respected courts in the world that this system is an unjustified infringement of the fundamental human rights of those persons who are listed , " doley told reuters . dw staff -lrb- sp -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

" responding to the challenge of climate change is the ultimate political test for our generation , " he added .
" our package not only responds to this challenge , but holds the right answer to the challenge of energy security and is an opportunity that should create thousands of new businesses and millions of jobs .

the measures are designed to put into action the aim set by eu leaders last year to cut carbon dioxide emissions by 20 percent by 2020 , compared to 1990 levels . by then , the use of renewable energies like biomass , wind and solar power will have to have risen to 20 percent of all energy forms .
biofuels will also have to make up 10 percent of fuels used for transport . these targets would wean the bloc off coal and oil , as would a decision that power generators must pay from 2013 for all permits to emit carbon dioxide - but left industrial leaders wondering about the impact on industry . german utility rwe said the package called into question the future of coal . " coal is threatened in its economic viability , " rwe 's head of power generation , ulrich jobs , told reuters meanwhile , other energy-intensive sectors such as the steel , aluminum and chemical industries have accepted the principles of the plan but voiced similar concerns about the cost and impact on jobs and a drop in competitiveness .
the steel industry is expecting the shift to entail the loss of up to 300,000 jobs across europe . " we foresee that industry and individuals will be facing a huge rise in the cost of electricity , " said jürgen thumann , president of the german association of german industry in berlin wednesday .
" the pinch will be felt by energy-intensive industries but also by other sectors . " compromising competitiveness some companies also fear that the stringent emission targets will force them to move production outside the bloc - and further strengthen the competitiveness of china and india , which so far have no emission limits . announcing that the commission will be monitoring any negative repercussions on the labor market , barroso conceded this was " a risk " and said brussels would do what it could to counter it . " an international agreement is our absolute priority , " barroso told reporters .
" but let me be clear , if we do not make progress we will protect european companies . " eu environment commissioner stavros dimas has said that if competitors from the us and china have still failed to establish climate rules by 2011 , thereby allowing for cheap production , he would consider lightening the burden for european companies and forcing importers to buy emissions permits . germany 's concerns bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : glos is concerned too heavy a burden is being placed on germany with around 8.5 percent of eu energy coming from renewable forms , future load sharing will be based in part on gross domestic product . while german environment minister sigmar gabriel hailed the plan as " courageous , " economy minister michael glos warned that " it will destroy jobs in industries which consume a lot of energy .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de food and drink -pipe- 24.01.2008 micro-brewers hope to fight sinking beer sales in germany großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : germans are drinking less beer , but local specialties still sell well german beer consumption has been in steady decline since the early 1990s – - especially among young people .
speciality breweries and brew-pubs could change that , but they 've not really become popular - so far . beer may be germany 's unofficial national drink , but more and more germans seem to be losing their taste for it .
according to the german brewer 's association , beer consumption fell by around 18 percent from 1992 to 2006 . one person who 's not affected by the decline is berlin 's oliver lemke , the owner of one of the few independent brewpubs in the german capital .
business is up in all four of his establishments , the first of which opened in 1999 .
he said the overall slump reflects the destruction of small local breweries by big corporations . " there used to be 100 breweries in this neighborhood alone , " lemke said .
" they died out in the 1970s with the trend toward mono-breweries .
the big breweries - for example warsteiner or licher – said : ‘ we 're only going to make one sort of beer , a premium pilsner , and we 'll market it nationwide . '
and that inevitably leads to a dead-end .
at some point , even the world 's biggest idiot notices that there 's virtually no difference between a warsteiner and licher . " popsicle flavorings or real ale ? bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : berlin 's brauhaus lemke has n't been affected by the slump germany has some 1,300 brewing companies , but the vast majority - including germany 's most famous brand , beck 's - belong to huge international conglomerates , and styles rarely stray from the standard pilsner and wheat varieties .
the main strategy among major brewers for interesting young people is to mix their products with everything from lemon flavor to cola . but why has n't germany gotten in on the micro-brewery and real-ale trends in the us or the uk ?
after all , no self-respecting manhattan yuppie would be seen with a bud light in his hand . " it 's a global interplay between wrong-headed marketing , the wrong sort of people as bar owners and the wrong retailing structures , " lemke said .
" that 's why those trends are under-represented here compared with the united states . " lemke is trying to change that .
his brewpubs revive almost forgotten brewing styles , such as amber ale or the double-hopped , non-filtered zwickel , and seasonal specialities such as the extra-strength märzen -lrb- " march beer " -rrb- .
they sell a respectable 2,500 hectoliters -lrb- 66,000 gallons -rrb- a year - and there 's no mistaking them for beck 's . alcohol abuse bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : nationally marketed brands forced many local breweries out of business in the 1970s but it 's difficult for independents to break through against the conglomerates .
the big brewing companies control distribution networks and encourage pub owners to feature their products exclusively by offering loans , price rebates and free tapping and refrigeration systems , beer glasses and even ashtrays . and german consumers and bar owners are ignorant about the drink itself , lemke said . " the german beer drinker thinks he knows a lot about beer , but most of them know very , very , little , " he said .
" it start 's with the myth that you need seven minutes to tap a good pilsner .
nonsense - that just makes it go flat and warm .
when i go to bars , i usually drink bottled beer because i know the tap beer has usually been physically abused .
it 's atrocious .
i know a lot of people in america that know far more about beer than people here in germany . " name recognition bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : what would a brewpub be without the obligatory copper brewing kettles ?
the first problem for small brewers is how to let potential customers know that they 're there . " that 's due in part to the marketing abilities of the big companies , " said marc-oliver huhnholz , press spokesman for the german brewers ' association .
" also america never drank as much beer as germany so small brewers can have more impact . " and to appeal to a new generation of potential beer drinkers , brewers have to take into account demographic shifts and the accompanying changes in personal taste . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : beer suffers from its image as a drink for older men " the average age in germany is rising , and older people tend to drink less , " huhnholz said .
" and among younger people , the trend is toward milder drinks - women especially prefer sweeter drinks .
they do n't want anything too bitter . " but huhnholz also thinks that small local breweries can play a role in stirring up new interest in - and appreciation for - beer . " small brewers have to offer an attractive product , and they need to do a lot of marketing , " huhnholz said .
" but some of them can succeed . " beer vs. bureaucracy bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : is germany 's bureaucracy preventing more small brew-pubs from opening ?
philipp brokamp would love to do that , but first he has to get started .
the 32-year-old brewer moved to berlin last year and is set to open his first brewpub , appropriately named hops and barley . without the support of a major corporation , that 's proven a daunting task .
germany 's notorious bureaucracy has n't made things any easier , brokamp said . " there 's the stereotype about bureaucracy , but i now know it 's not a stereotype , " said brokamp , who was forced to postpone opening due to red tape .
" i 've had to deal with at least eight separate government permit agencies , everything from the civil engineering office to offices for the environment and handicapped accessibility .
every one of them considered itself particularly important , but they could n't even agree on what the regulations were . " all that for a bar with a capacity of 100 , where the beer is made in the basement . while he 's tying up loose ends , brokamp is brewing light and dark beers as well as red ale and cider .
his style emphasizes malt more than lemke 's without being overly sweet . brokamp 's beers are also non-filtered , which means they look cloudy when poured .
but as he explains , cloudiness is good . " the things mass breweries filter out are n't impurities , " brokamp said .
" they 're very nutritious , and they make the beer more flavorful than filtered varieties . " think globally , drink locally bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : friedrichshain 's student crowds might be perfect for a micro-brewery lemke 's flagship brewpub is in the touristy neighborhood around berlin 's hackescher markt , while brokamp 's bar is located in the more residential area of friedrichshain .
he knows it will be a challenge to convince the locals to drink local stuff , but he 's confident . " i think that it 's exactly the right niche in the market , " brokamp said .
" general consumption is in decline .
people are more conscious and perhaps more choosey about what they drink .
and so i hope they 'll be interested in the sort of specialities that i 'll be offering . " brokamp will begin testing that hypothesis on feb .
2 , when hops and barley officially opens .
then he 'll see whether his neighbors are interested in trying something out of the ordinary or whether they prefer to just keep popping open beck 's - in decreasing numbers . jefferson chase send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

speciality breweries and brew-pubs could change that , but they 've not really become popular - so far . beer may be germany 's unofficial national drink , but more and more germans seem to be losing their taste for it .
according to the german brewer 's association , beer consumption fell by around 18 percent from 1992 to 2006 . one person who 's not affected by the decline is berlin 's oliver lemke , the owner of one of the few independent brewpubs in the german capital .

the rise in what is one of europe 's major economic indicators came despite this week 's torrid round of trading on global stock markets which fuelled fears of a global economic crisis .
" companies ' order books are bursting , " ifo economist hans günter russ told german news agency , dpa .
firms " remain optimistic about their exports , " he added .
german business defies fears analysts had predicted the closely watched index would show german business confidence sliding to 102.2 points this month on the back of worries that the shakeout in the us housing market could tip the giant us economy into recession .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : german companies are doing roaring business however , releasing the survey ifo president hans-werner sinn said , " on the whole , the condition of firms in german industry and trade continues to be robust . "
his comments echo the views of many economists who see germany acting as europe 's economic locomotive in the coming 12 months , despite the prospects of the nation 's growth rate slipping back a notch from 2.5 per cent in 2007 to below 2.0 per cent this year .
the germany economy grew at a perky 2.9 per cent in 2006 .
the ifo survey " underlines that fundamentally the euro area economy remains in good shape , " ' said elga bartsch from the us investment house morgan stanley .
" but it is clear that the headwinds are currently gaining momentum and , unless they blow over quickly , they will introduce downside risks to growth , inflation and interest rate forecasts , " she said .
asian demand help economy offset slump leading the ifo rise was an increase in german industry 's expectations of business conditions six months down the track , which nudged up to 99 from 98.2 in december .
however , underscoring the current economic uncertainty , the ifo index component gauging german executives ' assessment of the present situation dropped to 107.9 from 108.1 .
while germany 's key export sector is expected to lose some momentum this year , solid demand from the world 's key emerging economies in asia , eastern europe and the middle east is seen as helping to offset a slump in the us .
moreover , increased pay packets for german workers this year after a protracted period of wage stagnation as well as a continuing fall in unemployment are also forecast to help underpin consumer demand .
the surprise jump in the january ifo index added to the brighter mood prevailing on both german and european stocks markets after a highly volatile week in share trading and big falls in stock prices .
by mid-morning trading , frankfurt 's dax index was up almost five per cent with europe 's blue-chip stoxx 50 having gained nearly 4.0 per cent .
the rise in the ifo is likely to ease some of the pressure on the european central bank to follow the lead of other major central banks , notably the us federal reserve , and cut interest rates to help shore up economic confidence and in response to the signs of slowing growth . dw staff / dpa -lrb- sp -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

he lost both italy was again thrown into political turmoil as prime minister romano prodi decided to leave office after he lost a crucial vote of confidence in the italian senate .
the opposition is calling for new elections . italy 's embattled prime minister romano prodi tendered his resignation after losing a vote of confidence in the senate on thursday , jan .
24 , by five votes . italian president giorgio napolitano who , according to news reports , " reserved the right " on whether to accept prodi 's resignation , convened the speakers of both houses of parliament for consultations friday . the result was 156 for the center-left government , 161 against and one abstention .
three senators were absent , including two non-elected life senators . napolitano must choose between calling early elections and setting up a transitional government to allow electoral reforms , which many deputies say are badly needed , to be enacted . prodi , the center-left leader who won elections in april 2006 by a handful of votes , went before the senate despite appeals by top leaders including napolitano to resign rather than face the vote . he appeared resigned to the prospect of losing the vote but determined to carry through with it on principle . " i am here because you can not hide from the judgment of those who represent the people , and our people are watching us , " he said . prodi has walked a tightrope trying to keep together his squabbling coalition , which ranges from centrist catholics to far-left communists . earlier plea falls on senate 's deaf ears dismissing calls for his resignation , prodi earlier urged senators to support his government . " italy does not have the luxury of halting -lrb- the work of -rrb- this government , " prodi said in the senate as he opened the scheduled debate preceding the vote . to those voting against him , prodi said they should ask what government and what parliamentary majority they wanted in place of " the legitimate one currently in office . " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : president napolitano wanted prodi to step aside ahead of the vote earlier prodi met napolitano - who like others in the governing center-left coalition reportedly wanted the premier to make way for a caretaker government - before the senate vote . the embattled prime minister had already met napolitano before winning wednesday 's confidence vote in parliament 's lower house chamber of deputies where , unlike the senate , the government has a clear majority . recent defections have left the governing centre-left coalition with some 157 votes in the senate , while the opposition is expected to muster around 160 votes . " we will have early elections , " university and research minister fabio mussi said thursday , voicing a view shared by some members of prodi 's eight-party coalition and the vast majority of the opposition including former prime minister silvio berlusconi . however the democratic party , the largest in the center-left government had said that if prodi were to fall , then electoral reforms - aimed at giving governments more stability by decreasing the influence of small parties - should be introduced before a new poll . napolitano , who has the power to dissolve parliament had also said in the past that a new electoral law would be needed before elections are held . mastella 's withdrawal of support prompts crisis prodi 's decision to test his support in parliament came after former justice minister clemente mastella said monday his small moderate udeur party would no longer support the governing coalition .
mastella resigned last week in the wake of a corruption scandal . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : mastella decided to pull his party out of prodi 's coalition his decision triggered the latest , and most serious crisis to strike prodi since he took office 20 months ago after winning italy 's closest post-world war ii election by just 25,000 votes in april 2006 .
prodi has had to rely on more than 30 confidence votes to push through legislation , including the government 's budget and foreign policy . in the wake of prodi 's resignation , berlusconi called for the president to dissolve parliament and call elections immediately . berlusconi also had to face four votes of confidence during his government 's turn in office .
berlusconi was the longest serving prime minister italy has had since world war ii .
italy has had 61 governments since 1945 . impact on economy in the run-up to prodi 's decision , political commentators and analysts were warning that holding elections now without amending italy 's messy electoral rules would only prolong the unstable system of coalition governments . reuters news agency reported that the current government turmoil took its toll on financial markets where spreads between italian government bonds and german bunds widened to near levels not seen for six-and-a-half years . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : alumnia urged italy to confront its political problems italy 's economy , which has long underperformed its peers in the euro zone , also suffered more bad news with the worst consumer confidence data for two-and-a-half years . eu commissioner for economic and monetary affairs joaquin almunia urged italy to resolve the situation as soon as possible because " only then can italy begin to confront its real problems , like the economy .

" the reputation built by siemens for 160 years has been reduced to ashes , " said daniela bergdolt , from the dsw group of small investors .
" it is not satisfactory that the affair has not been wrapped up after more than a year , " complained hans hirt , who represented the british pension fund hermes .
in the latest twist to the " affair , " investigators have established that payments worth around 140 million euros -lrb- $ 206 million -rrb- have been found in the firm 's flagship medical equipment division , reported the daily süddeutsche zeitung thursday .
siemens ' most profitable division , its turnover averages some 10 billion euros a year .
until now , siemens has said such payments totalled around 1.3 billion euros .
the löscher effect bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : shareholders got a chance to voice their feelings exempted from the shareholders ' criticisms was siemens boss peter löscher , appointed six months ago following the disclosure of a well-stocked slush fund at the group .
shareholders ' hopes are resting on the shoulders of löscher , the first siemens boss to be hired from outside the group .
he has already renovated the management team and begun to simplify the company 's tentacular structure , reining in directors of siemens units abroad who have been dubbed " the princes . "
" what counts for me is clean business everywhere and always , and highest performance meeting the highest ethical standards , " he has said .
he has also revealed that the group had been hit with compliance costs to date of around 1.1 billion euros , plus around 520 million in tax liabilities and sanctions " whose scope can not be estimated . "
" intangible damage is much harder to measure - the loss of reputation and trust in the general public , " he said .
shareholder concerns others on the executive floor were given a rocky ride by investors , including those supposed to be controlling the group such as supervisory board gerhard cromme and his right-hand man , deutsche bank chairman josef ackermann .
according to afp , the association of small shareholders dsw intends to vote against a renewal of their mandates , which nonetheless seem assured .
among the top figures absent were former siemens boss klaus kleinfeld and former supervisory board president heinrich von pierer , the emblematic head of the group from 1992 to 2005 , who both left siemens last year .
one telling sign of the times was a decision by siemens to forego the traditional vote of confidence by which shareholders typically approve the management team 's performance over the past year .

according to press reports , internal allegations are still abounding , including the suggestion that corruption was present up to the higher spheres of the group .
the german group is listed on wall street and fears being slapped with a fine of four billion euros -lrb- 5.8 billion dollars -rrb- in the us , according to the german business magazine wirtschaftswoche .

germany 's rail company had initially rejected the idea , but bowed to pressure from the transport minister . ordinary people supported the nazi dictatorship in their everyday lives , which is why the exhibit about these crimes must be shown in an everyday place , transport minister wolfgang tiefensee said wednesday , jan .
23 , at the opening of the exhibition potsdamer platz station in downtown berlin . forty information boards with photos , personal testimonies , biographies and diagrams detail the fate of , among others , 11,400 jewish children who were deported from france to the auschwitz death camp by train between 1942 and 1944 . the exhibition , which also honors the sinti roma deported and killed by the nazis , is a replicate of a similar show that took place in french train stations four years ago .
both were organized by the french-german couple beate and serge klarsfeld , who founded the organization sons and daughters of jews deported from france . poignant location despite commuter chaos bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : nazi-hunter klarsfeld outlined the personal stories of thousands of deported children " putting an exhibition in a station is very different from putting it in a museum , " serge klarsfeld told the afp news agency on wednesday .
" it speaks to the german people directly . " however , deutsche bahn , germany 's national rail operator , had at first opposed the proposal to transform train station into a place of remembrance . " the subject is too serious , " deutsche bahn chief hartmut mehdorn said in october 2006 .
" it deserves more than commuters ' divided attention as they run to catch their trains while gulping down a sandwich . " in response , the rail company drew harsh criticism from the klarsfelds , who accused it of not owning up to its past . the reichsbahn , predecessor of germany 's present day train service , played an essential role in the nazi scheme to deport and exterminate millions of jews , roma and other " unwanted " people .
it also received money from the nazi government for each person it deported . trains made genocide possible bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : track 17 in grunewald is a memorial to holocaust victims deutsche bahn finally gave in to pressure from the transport minister . " it was important to me that this exhibition should go ahead and expose the troubled past of the reichsbahn , " tiefensee said wednesday at the opening of the exhibition . mehdorn did not attend the ceremony , but margret suckale , deutsche bahn 's personnel and legal manager , affirmed that , " without a doubt , the reichsbahn played a supporting role in the national socialist genocide . " a deutsche bahn press statement emphasized that the company seeks to uncover and remember its nazi past in other ways as well , including a memorial at track 17 at the grunewald station and with an exhibition at its museum in nuremberg . the deportation exhibition , titled " chartered trains to death - deportation with the german reichsbahn , " will be on display at the potsdamer platz station in berlin through feb .

" the reputation built by siemens for 160 years has been reduced to ashes , " said daniela bergdolt , from the dsw group of small investors .
" it is not satisfactory that the affair has not been wrapped up after more than a year , " complained hans hirt , who represented the british pension fund hermes .
in the latest twist to the " affair , " investigators have established that payments worth around 140 million euros -lrb- $ 206 million -rrb- have been found in the firm 's flagship medical equipment division , reported the daily süddeutsche zeitung thursday .
siemens ' most profitable division , its turnover averages some 10 billion euros a year .
until now , siemens has said such payments totalled around 1.3 billion euros .
the löscher effect bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : shareholders got a chance to voice their feelings exempted from the shareholders ' criticisms was siemens boss peter löscher , appointed six months ago following the disclosure of a well-stocked slush fund at the group .
shareholders ' hopes are resting on the shoulders of löscher , the first siemens boss to be hired from outside the group .
he has already renovated the management team and begun to simplify the company 's tentacular structure , reining in directors of siemens units abroad who have been dubbed " the princes . "
" what counts for me is clean business everywhere and always , and highest performance meeting the highest ethical standards , " he has said .
he has also revealed that the group had been hit with compliance costs to date of around 1.1 billion euros , plus around 520 million in tax liabilities and sanctions " whose scope can not be estimated . "
" intangible damage is much harder to measure - the loss of reputation and trust in the general public , " he said .
shareholder concerns others on the executive floor were given a rocky ride by investors , including those supposed to be controlling the group such as supervisory board gerhard cromme and his right-hand man , deutsche bank chairman josef ackermann .
according to afp , the association of small shareholders dsw intends to vote against a renewal of their mandates , which nonetheless seem assured .
among the top figures absent were former siemens boss klaus kleinfeld and former supervisory board president heinrich von pierer , the emblematic head of the group from 1992 to 2005 , who both left siemens last year .
one telling sign of the times was a decision by siemens to forego the traditional vote of confidence by which shareholders typically approve the management team 's performance over the past year .

according to press reports , internal allegations are still abounding , including the suggestion that corruption was present up to the higher spheres of the group .

until now , siemens has said such payments totalled around 1.3 billion euros .
the löscher effect bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : shareholders got a chance to voice their feelings exempted from the shareholders ' criticisms was siemens boss peter löscher , appointed six months ago following the disclosure of a well-stocked slush fund at the group .
shareholders ' hopes are resting on the shoulders of löscher , the first siemens boss to be hired from outside the group .
he has already renovated the management team and begun to simplify the company 's tentacular structure , reining in directors of siemens units abroad who have been dubbed " the princes . "
" what counts for me is clean business everywhere and always , and highest performance meeting the highest ethical standards , " he has said .
he has also revealed that the group had been hit with compliance costs to date of around 1.1 billion euros , plus around 520 million in tax liabilities and sanctions " whose scope can not be estimated . "
" intangible damage is much harder to measure - the loss of reputation and trust in the general public , " he said .
shareholder concerns others on the executive floor were given a rocky ride by investors , including those supposed to be controlling the group such as supervisory board gerhard cromme and his right-hand man , deutsche bank chairman josef ackermann .
according to afp , the association of small shareholders dsw intends to vote against a renewal of their mandates , which nonetheless seem assured .
among the top figures absent were former siemens boss klaus kleinfeld and former supervisory board president heinrich von pierer , the emblematic head of the group from 1992 to 2005 , who both left siemens last year .
one telling sign of the times was a decision by siemens to forego the traditional vote of confidence by which shareholders typically approve the management team 's performance over the past year .
but the supervisory board , including cromme and his right-hand man josef ackermann , the chairman of deutsche bank , were to face such a vote .
still in business bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : peter löscher it has been over a year since the first revelations emerged about shady dealings at siemens , often in the form of money alleged to have been paid under the table to obtain foreign contracts .
at last count , the biggest private german employer had acknowledged 1.3 billion euros in questionable funds .
according to press reports , internal allegations are still abounding , including the suggestion that corruption was present up to the higher spheres of the group .
the german group is listed on wall street and fears being slapped with a fine of four billion euros -lrb- 5.8 billion dollars -rrb- in the us , according to the german business magazine wirtschaftswoche .
but for the time being , the company 's businesses - medical equipment , manufacturing , trains and electric power stations - remain healthy .
the company posted a huge increase in first quarter profit from 788 million euros to 6.5 billion owing to the sale of the auto equipment parts company vdo .
operating profit for the first three months of its 2007-2008 fiscal year , which began on october 1 , increased by 16 percent to 1.7 billion euros , on sales which grew by 10 percent to 18.4 billion euros . dw staff -lrb- jp -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

11 attacks lawmakers from 47 european nations have strongly criticized a system of un and eu sanctions against suspected backers of global terrorism , saying the use of terrorist blacklists violates fundamental rights . the council of europe , the eu 's rights watchdog , rules urged the united nations and the european union to overhaul procedures to blacklist individuals and groups suspected of having links to terrorism .
not only does the practice violate human rights , the lawmakers concluded , but they are " completely arbitrary , " according to a statement released by the 47-member body .
a report commissioned by the rights body said people were blacklisted on the basis of " mere suspicion " and called the measures " deplorable and violation of human rights and fundamental freedoms . "
harsh penalties against suspects dick marty , a swiss senator and former prosecutor who has published critical reports into alleged anti-terrorist practices by states and institutions , including reported secret cia prisons on european soil , said those affected by the terrorist blacklists had absolutely no rights to defend themselves against terrorist allegations .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : marty said the practice gave suspects no chance of defending themselves " i have seldom experienced anything as unfair as the compilation of these lists , " marty said at the european parliament in strasbourg this week .
according to the report , around 370 people and 130 groups or organizations are currently on the un 's blacklist .
they include alleged taliban individuals and those linked to al qaeda .
the eu lists 60 people or groups - including the radical palestinian group hamas and the basque separatist group , eta .
set up after the sept .
11 attacks in 2001 , the lists impose a number of penalties on those suspected of backing terrorism .
they include freezing suspects ' assets and preventing them from traveling without giving them a court hearing or disclosing the evidence against them .
the council of europe said in its report that many suspects on the lists only discovered that they were on it after they were stopped at a border while travelling or when their bank accounts were frozen .
" people remain on these lists for years without knowing why , and their lives are ruined , " marty said .
marty 's investigation into the practice was sparked by the case of a 78-year-old italian citizen of arab descent , youssef nada whose business was ruined after he landed on the blacklist .
the cia reportedly suspected nada of belonging to a group of financiers behind the sept .
11 attacks .
but a four-year investigation by swiss authorities into nada 's case was suspended in 2005 due to a lack of evidence .
nada 's assets were seized and he was barred from leaving his home of 30 years in switzerland .
nada 's name remains on the terror blacklist .
top eu court may rule against un practice the un system is at present being scrutinized by the eu 's top court and there is a strong likelihood it may rule that the 27-member bloc has violated basic rights by applying them .
according to news agency reuters , an eu legal advisor has recommended the eu court of justice in luxembourg should cancel financial sanctions against a saudi businessman and a swedish-based money transfer business in two separate cases .
the agency quoted cameron doley , a british lawyer representing saudi businessman yassin kadi as saying that his client had never received a clear statement of the allegations against him .
kadi had filed his case in the eu because the un had no equivalent tribunal to which he could appeal .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de economy -pipe- 24.01.2008 german business confidence defies fears of slowdown großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : german business have defied fears triggered by stock market plunges german business confidence recorded a surprise increase in january , a key survey showed , amid hopes that europe 's biggest economy will withstand a us slowdown and world share market turbulence . the munich-based ifo economic institute said its monthly index of 7,000 german executives edged up from 103 points in december to 103.4 points this month , beating analysts ' forecasts .
the rise in what is one of europe 's major economic indicators came despite this week 's torrid round of trading on global stock markets which fuelled fears of a global economic crisis .
" companies ' order books are bursting , " ifo economist hans günter russ told german news agency , dpa .
firms " remain optimistic about their exports , " he added .
german business defies fears analysts had predicted the closely watched index would show german business confidence sliding to 102.2 points this month on the back of worries that the shakeout in the us housing market could tip the giant us economy into recession .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : german companies are doing roaring business however , releasing the survey ifo president hans-werner sinn said , " on the whole , the condition of firms in german industry and trade continues to be robust . "
his comments echo the views of many economists who see germany acting as europe 's economic locomotive in the coming 12 months , despite the prospects of the nation 's growth rate slipping back a notch from 2.5 per cent in 2007 to below 2.0 per cent this year .
the germany economy grew at a perky 2.9 per cent in 2006 .
the ifo survey " underlines that fundamentally the euro area economy remains in good shape , " ' said elga bartsch from the us investment house morgan stanley .
" but it is clear that the headwinds are currently gaining momentum and , unless they blow over quickly , they will introduce downside risks to growth , inflation and interest rate forecasts , " she said .
asian demand help economy offset slump leading the ifo rise was an increase in german industry 's expectations of business conditions six months down the track , which nudged up to 99 from 98.2 in december .
however , underscoring the current economic uncertainty , the ifo index component gauging german executives ' assessment of the present situation dropped to 107.9 from 108.1 .
while germany 's key export sector is expected to lose some momentum this year , solid demand from the world 's key emerging economies in asia , eastern europe and the middle east is seen as helping to offset a slump in the us .
moreover , increased pay packets for german workers this year after a protracted period of wage stagnation as well as a continuing fall in unemployment are also forecast to help underpin consumer demand .

11 attacks lawmakers from 47 european nations have strongly criticized a system of un and eu sanctions against suspected backers of global terrorism , saying the use of terrorist blacklists violates fundamental rights . the council of europe , the eu 's rights watchdog , rules urged the united nations and the european union to overhaul procedures to blacklist individuals and groups suspected of having links to terrorism .
not only does the practice violate human rights , the lawmakers concluded , but they are " completely arbitrary , " according to a statement released by the 47-member body .
a report commissioned by the rights body said people were blacklisted on the basis of " mere suspicion " and called the measures " deplorable and violation of human rights and fundamental freedoms . "
harsh penalties against suspects dick marty , a swiss senator and former prosecutor who has published critical reports into alleged anti-terrorist practices by states and institutions , including reported secret cia prisons on european soil , said those affected by the terrorist blacklists had absolutely no rights to defend themselves against terrorist allegations .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : marty said the practice gave suspects no chance of defending themselves " i have seldom experienced anything as unfair as the compilation of these lists , " marty said at the european parliament in strasbourg this week .
according to the report , around 370 people and 130 groups or organizations are currently on the un 's blacklist .
they include alleged taliban individuals and those linked to al qaeda .
the eu lists 60 people or groups - including the radical palestinian group hamas and the basque separatist group , eta .
set up after the sept .
11 attacks in 2001 , the lists impose a number of penalties on those suspected of backing terrorism .
they include freezing suspects ' assets and preventing them from traveling without giving them a court hearing or disclosing the evidence against them .
the council of europe said in its report that many suspects on the lists only discovered that they were on it after they were stopped at a border while travelling or when their bank accounts were frozen .
" people remain on these lists for years without knowing why , and their lives are ruined , " marty said .
marty 's investigation into the practice was sparked by the case of a 78-year-old italian citizen of arab descent , youssef nada whose business was ruined after he landed on the blacklist .
the cia reportedly suspected nada of belonging to a group of financiers behind the sept .
11 attacks .
but a four-year investigation by swiss authorities into nada 's case was suspended in 2005 due to a lack of evidence .
nada 's assets were seized and he was barred from leaving his home of 30 years in switzerland .
nada 's name remains on the terror blacklist .
top eu court may rule against un practice the un system is at present being scrutinized by the eu 's top court and there is a strong likelihood it may rule that the 27-member bloc has violated basic rights by applying them .
according to news agency reuters , an eu legal advisor has recommended the eu court of justice in luxembourg should cancel financial sanctions against a saudi businessman and a swedish-based money transfer business in two separate cases .
the agency quoted cameron doley , a british lawyer representing saudi businessman yassin kadi as saying that his client had never received a clear statement of the allegations against him .
kadi had filed his case in the eu because the un had no equivalent tribunal to which he could appeal .
" what this gives us , we hope , is a statement by one of the most prominent and respected courts in the world that this system is an unjustified infringement of the fundamental human rights of those persons who are listed , " doley told reuters . dw staff -lrb- sp -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

the rise in what is one of europe 's major economic indicators came despite this week 's torrid round of trading on global stock markets which fuelled fears of a global economic crisis .
" companies ' order books are bursting , " ifo economist hans günter russ told german news agency , dpa .
firms " remain optimistic about their exports , " he added .
german business defies fears analysts had predicted the closely watched index would show german business confidence sliding to 102.2 points this month on the back of worries that the shakeout in the us housing market could tip the giant us economy into recession .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : german companies are doing roaring business however , releasing the survey ifo president hans-werner sinn said , " on the whole , the condition of firms in german industry and trade continues to be robust . "
his comments echo the views of many economists who see germany acting as europe 's economic locomotive in the coming 12 months , despite the prospects of the nation 's growth rate slipping back a notch from 2.5 per cent in 2007 to below 2.0 per cent this year .
the germany economy grew at a perky 2.9 per cent in 2006 .
the ifo survey " underlines that fundamentally the euro area economy remains in good shape , " ' said elga bartsch from the us investment house morgan stanley .
" but it is clear that the headwinds are currently gaining momentum and , unless they blow over quickly , they will introduce downside risks to growth , inflation and interest rate forecasts , " she said .

however , underscoring the current economic uncertainty , the ifo index component gauging german executives ' assessment of the present situation dropped to 107.9 from 108.1 .
while germany 's key export sector is expected to lose some momentum this year , solid demand from the world 's key emerging economies in asia , eastern europe and the middle east is seen as helping to offset a slump in the us .

11 attacks lawmakers from 47 european nations have strongly criticized a system of un and eu sanctions against suspected backers of global terrorism , saying the use of terrorist blacklists violates fundamental rights . the council of europe , the eu 's rights watchdog , rules urged the united nations and the european union to overhaul procedures to blacklist individuals and groups suspected of having links to terrorism .
not only does the practice violate human rights , the lawmakers concluded , but they are " completely arbitrary , " according to a statement released by the 47-member body .
a report commissioned by the rights body said people were blacklisted on the basis of " mere suspicion " and called the measures " deplorable and violation of human rights and fundamental freedoms . "
harsh penalties against suspects dick marty , a swiss senator and former prosecutor who has published critical reports into alleged anti-terrorist practices by states and institutions , including reported secret cia prisons on european soil , said those affected by the terrorist blacklists had absolutely no rights to defend themselves against terrorist allegations .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : marty said the practice gave suspects no chance of defending themselves " i have seldom experienced anything as unfair as the compilation of these lists , " marty said at the european parliament in strasbourg this week .
according to the report , around 370 people and 130 groups or organizations are currently on the un 's blacklist .
they include alleged taliban individuals and those linked to al qaeda .
the eu lists 60 people or groups - including the radical palestinian group hamas and the basque separatist group , eta .
set up after the sept .
11 attacks in 2001 , the lists impose a number of penalties on those suspected of backing terrorism .
they include freezing suspects ' assets and preventing them from traveling without giving them a court hearing or disclosing the evidence against them .
the council of europe said in its report that many suspects on the lists only discovered that they were on it after they were stopped at a border while travelling or when their bank accounts were frozen .
" people remain on these lists for years without knowing why , and their lives are ruined , " marty said .

he lost both italy was again thrown into political turmoil as prime minister romano prodi decided to leave office after he lost a crucial vote of confidence in the italian senate .
the opposition is calling for new elections . italy 's embattled prime minister romano prodi tendered his resignation after losing a vote of confidence in the senate on thursday , jan .
24 , by five votes . italian president giorgio napolitano who , according to news reports , " reserved the right " on whether to accept prodi 's resignation , convened the speakers of both houses of parliament for consultations friday . the result was 156 for the center-left government , 161 against and one abstention .
three senators were absent , including two non-elected life senators . napolitano must choose between calling early elections and setting up a transitional government to allow electoral reforms , which many deputies say are badly needed , to be enacted . prodi , the center-left leader who won elections in april 2006 by a handful of votes , went before the senate despite appeals by top leaders including napolitano to resign rather than face the vote . he appeared resigned to the prospect of losing the vote but determined to carry through with it on principle . " i am here because you can not hide from the judgment of those who represent the people , and our people are watching us , " he said . prodi has walked a tightrope trying to keep together his squabbling coalition , which ranges from centrist catholics to far-left communists . earlier plea falls on senate 's deaf ears dismissing calls for his resignation , prodi earlier urged senators to support his government . " italy does not have the luxury of halting -lrb- the work of -rrb- this government , " prodi said in the senate as he opened the scheduled debate preceding the vote . to those voting against him , prodi said they should ask what government and what parliamentary majority they wanted in place of " the legitimate one currently in office . " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : president napolitano wanted prodi to step aside ahead of the vote earlier prodi met napolitano - who like others in the governing center-left coalition reportedly wanted the premier to make way for a caretaker government - before the senate vote . the embattled prime minister had already met napolitano before winning wednesday 's confidence vote in parliament 's lower house chamber of deputies where , unlike the senate , the government has a clear majority . recent defections have left the governing centre-left coalition with some 157 votes in the senate , while the opposition is expected to muster around 160 votes . " we will have early elections , " university and research minister fabio mussi said thursday , voicing a view shared by some members of prodi 's eight-party coalition and the vast majority of the opposition including former prime minister silvio berlusconi . however the democratic party , the largest in the center-left government had said that if prodi were to fall , then electoral reforms - aimed at giving governments more stability by decreasing the influence of small parties - should be introduced before a new poll . napolitano , who has the power to dissolve parliament had also said in the past that a new electoral law would be needed before elections are held . mastella 's withdrawal of support prompts crisis prodi 's decision to test his support in parliament came after former justice minister clemente mastella said monday his small moderate udeur party would no longer support the governing coalition .
mastella resigned last week in the wake of a corruption scandal . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : mastella decided to pull his party out of prodi 's coalition his decision triggered the latest , and most serious crisis to strike prodi since he took office 20 months ago after winning italy 's closest post-world war ii election by just 25,000 votes in april 2006 .
prodi has had to rely on more than 30 confidence votes to push through legislation , including the government 's budget and foreign policy . in the wake of prodi 's resignation , berlusconi called for the president to dissolve parliament and call elections immediately . berlusconi also had to face four votes of confidence during his government 's turn in office .
berlusconi was the longest serving prime minister italy has had since world war ii .
italy has had 61 governments since 1945 . impact on economy in the run-up to prodi 's decision , political commentators and analysts were warning that holding elections now without amending italy 's messy electoral rules would only prolong the unstable system of coalition governments . reuters news agency reported that the current government turmoil took its toll on financial markets where spreads between italian government bonds and german bunds widened to near levels not seen for six-and-a-half years . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : alumnia urged italy to confront its political problems italy 's economy , which has long underperformed its peers in the euro zone , also suffered more bad news with the worst consumer confidence data for two-and-a-half years . eu commissioner for economic and monetary affairs joaquin almunia urged italy to resolve the situation as soon as possible because " only then can italy begin to confront its real problems , like the economy . " speaking to reporters outside the world economic forum in davos , switzerland , almunia reiterated : " we are currently in a time of economic difficulty and turbulence .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de food and drink -pipe- 24.01.2008 micro-brewers hope to fight sinking beer sales in germany großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : germans are drinking less beer , but local specialties still sell well german beer consumption has been in steady decline since the early 1990s – - especially among young people .
speciality breweries and brew-pubs could change that , but they 've not really become popular - so far . beer may be germany 's unofficial national drink , but more and more germans seem to be losing their taste for it .
according to the german brewer 's association , beer consumption fell by around 18 percent from 1992 to 2006 . one person who 's not affected by the decline is berlin 's oliver lemke , the owner of one of the few independent brewpubs in the german capital .
business is up in all four of his establishments , the first of which opened in 1999 .
he said the overall slump reflects the destruction of small local breweries by big corporations . " there used to be 100 breweries in this neighborhood alone , " lemke said .
" they died out in the 1970s with the trend toward mono-breweries .
the big breweries - for example warsteiner or licher – said : ‘ we 're only going to make one sort of beer , a premium pilsner , and we 'll market it nationwide . '
and that inevitably leads to a dead-end .
at some point , even the world 's biggest idiot notices that there 's virtually no difference between a warsteiner and licher . " popsicle flavorings or real ale ? bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : berlin 's brauhaus lemke has n't been affected by the slump germany has some 1,300 brewing companies , but the vast majority - including germany 's most famous brand , beck 's - belong to huge international conglomerates , and styles rarely stray from the standard pilsner and wheat varieties .
the main strategy among major brewers for interesting young people is to mix their products with everything from lemon flavor to cola . but why has n't germany gotten in on the micro-brewery and real-ale trends in the us or the uk ?
after all , no self-respecting manhattan yuppie would be seen with a bud light in his hand . " it 's a global interplay between wrong-headed marketing , the wrong sort of people as bar owners and the wrong retailing structures , " lemke said .
" that 's why those trends are under-represented here compared with the united states . " lemke is trying to change that .
his brewpubs revive almost forgotten brewing styles , such as amber ale or the double-hopped , non-filtered zwickel , and seasonal specialities such as the extra-strength märzen -lrb- " march beer " -rrb- .
they sell a respectable 2,500 hectoliters -lrb- 66,000 gallons -rrb- a year - and there 's no mistaking them for beck 's . alcohol abuse bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : nationally marketed brands forced many local breweries out of business in the 1970s but it 's difficult for independents to break through against the conglomerates .
the big brewing companies control distribution networks and encourage pub owners to feature their products exclusively by offering loans , price rebates and free tapping and refrigeration systems , beer glasses and even ashtrays . and german consumers and bar owners are ignorant about the drink itself , lemke said . " the german beer drinker thinks he knows a lot about beer , but most of them know very , very , little , " he said .
" it start 's with the myth that you need seven minutes to tap a good pilsner .
nonsense - that just makes it go flat and warm .
when i go to bars , i usually drink bottled beer because i know the tap beer has usually been physically abused .
it 's atrocious .
i know a lot of people in america that know far more about beer than people here in germany . " name recognition bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : what would a brewpub be without the obligatory copper brewing kettles ?
the first problem for small brewers is how to let potential customers know that they 're there . " that 's due in part to the marketing abilities of the big companies , " said marc-oliver huhnholz , press spokesman for the german brewers ' association .
" also america never drank as much beer as germany so small brewers can have more impact . " and to appeal to a new generation of potential beer drinkers , brewers have to take into account demographic shifts and the accompanying changes in personal taste . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : beer suffers from its image as a drink for older men " the average age in germany is rising , and older people tend to drink less , " huhnholz said .
" and among younger people , the trend is toward milder drinks - women especially prefer sweeter drinks .
they do n't want anything too bitter . " but huhnholz also thinks that small local breweries can play a role in stirring up new interest in - and appreciation for - beer . " small brewers have to offer an attractive product , and they need to do a lot of marketing , " huhnholz said .
" but some of them can succeed . " beer vs. bureaucracy bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : is germany 's bureaucracy preventing more small brew-pubs from opening ?
philipp brokamp would love to do that , but first he has to get started .
the 32-year-old brewer moved to berlin last year and is set to open his first brewpub , appropriately named hops and barley . without the support of a major corporation , that 's proven a daunting task .
germany 's notorious bureaucracy has n't made things any easier , brokamp said . " there 's the stereotype about bureaucracy , but i now know it 's not a stereotype , " said brokamp , who was forced to postpone opening due to red tape .
" i 've had to deal with at least eight separate government permit agencies , everything from the civil engineering office to offices for the environment and handicapped accessibility .
every one of them considered itself particularly important , but they could n't even agree on what the regulations were . " all that for a bar with a capacity of 100 , where the beer is made in the basement . while he 's tying up loose ends , brokamp is brewing light and dark beers as well as red ale and cider .
his style emphasizes malt more than lemke 's without being overly sweet . brokamp 's beers are also non-filtered , which means they look cloudy when poured .
but as he explains , cloudiness is good . " the things mass breweries filter out are n't impurities , " brokamp said .
" they 're very nutritious , and they make the beer more flavorful than filtered varieties . " think globally , drink locally bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : friedrichshain 's student crowds might be perfect for a micro-brewery lemke 's flagship brewpub is in the touristy neighborhood around berlin 's hackescher markt , while brokamp 's bar is located in the more residential area of friedrichshain .
he knows it will be a challenge to convince the locals to drink local stuff , but he 's confident . " i think that it 's exactly the right niche in the market , " brokamp said .
" general consumption is in decline .
people are more conscious and perhaps more choosey about what they drink .
and so i hope they 'll be interested in the sort of specialities that i 'll be offering . " brokamp will begin testing that hypothesis on feb .

speciality breweries and brew-pubs could change that , but they 've not really become popular - so far . beer may be germany 's unofficial national drink , but more and more germans seem to be losing their taste for it .
according to the german brewer 's association , beer consumption fell by around 18 percent from 1992 to 2006 . one person who 's not affected by the decline is berlin 's oliver lemke , the owner of one of the few independent brewpubs in the german capital .
business is up in all four of his establishments , the first of which opened in 1999 .
he said the overall slump reflects the destruction of small local breweries by big corporations . " there used to be 100 breweries in this neighborhood alone , " lemke said .
" they died out in the 1970s with the trend toward mono-breweries .
the big breweries - for example warsteiner or licher – said : ‘ we 're only going to make one sort of beer , a premium pilsner , and we 'll market it nationwide . '
and that inevitably leads to a dead-end .
at some point , even the world 's biggest idiot notices that there 's virtually no difference between a warsteiner and licher . " popsicle flavorings or real ale ? bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : berlin 's brauhaus lemke has n't been affected by the slump germany has some 1,300 brewing companies , but the vast majority - including germany 's most famous brand , beck 's - belong to huge international conglomerates , and styles rarely stray from the standard pilsner and wheat varieties .
the main strategy among major brewers for interesting young people is to mix their products with everything from lemon flavor to cola . but why has n't germany gotten in on the micro-brewery and real-ale trends in the us or the uk ?
after all , no self-respecting manhattan yuppie would be seen with a bud light in his hand . " it 's a global interplay between wrong-headed marketing , the wrong sort of people as bar owners and the wrong retailing structures , " lemke said .
" that 's why those trends are under-represented here compared with the united states . " lemke is trying to change that .
his brewpubs revive almost forgotten brewing styles , such as amber ale or the double-hopped , non-filtered zwickel , and seasonal specialities such as the extra-strength märzen -lrb- " march beer " -rrb- .
they sell a respectable 2,500 hectoliters -lrb- 66,000 gallons -rrb- a year - and there 's no mistaking them for beck 's . alcohol abuse bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : nationally marketed brands forced many local breweries out of business in the 1970s but it 's difficult for independents to break through against the conglomerates .
the big brewing companies control distribution networks and encourage pub owners to feature their products exclusively by offering loans , price rebates and free tapping and refrigeration systems , beer glasses and even ashtrays . and german consumers and bar owners are ignorant about the drink itself , lemke said . " the german beer drinker thinks he knows a lot about beer , but most of them know very , very , little , " he said .
" it start 's with the myth that you need seven minutes to tap a good pilsner .
nonsense - that just makes it go flat and warm .
when i go to bars , i usually drink bottled beer because i know the tap beer has usually been physically abused .
it 's atrocious .
i know a lot of people in america that know far more about beer than people here in germany . " name recognition bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : what would a brewpub be without the obligatory copper brewing kettles ?
the first problem for small brewers is how to let potential customers know that they 're there . " that 's due in part to the marketing abilities of the big companies , " said marc-oliver huhnholz , press spokesman for the german brewers ' association .
" also america never drank as much beer as germany so small brewers can have more impact . " and to appeal to a new generation of potential beer drinkers , brewers have to take into account demographic shifts and the accompanying changes in personal taste . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : beer suffers from its image as a drink for older men " the average age in germany is rising , and older people tend to drink less , " huhnholz said .
" and among younger people , the trend is toward milder drinks - women especially prefer sweeter drinks .
they do n't want anything too bitter . " but huhnholz also thinks that small local breweries can play a role in stirring up new interest in - and appreciation for - beer . " small brewers have to offer an attractive product , and they need to do a lot of marketing , " huhnholz said .
" but some of them can succeed . " beer vs. bureaucracy bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : is germany 's bureaucracy preventing more small brew-pubs from opening ?
philipp brokamp would love to do that , but first he has to get started .
the 32-year-old brewer moved to berlin last year and is set to open his first brewpub , appropriately named hops and barley . without the support of a major corporation , that 's proven a daunting task .
germany 's notorious bureaucracy has n't made things any easier , brokamp said . " there 's the stereotype about bureaucracy , but i now know it 's not a stereotype , " said brokamp , who was forced to postpone opening due to red tape .
" i 've had to deal with at least eight separate government permit agencies , everything from the civil engineering office to offices for the environment and handicapped accessibility .
every one of them considered itself particularly important , but they could n't even agree on what the regulations were . " all that for a bar with a capacity of 100 , where the beer is made in the basement . while he 's tying up loose ends , brokamp is brewing light and dark beers as well as red ale and cider .
his style emphasizes malt more than lemke 's without being overly sweet . brokamp 's beers are also non-filtered , which means they look cloudy when poured .
but as he explains , cloudiness is good . " the things mass breweries filter out are n't impurities , " brokamp said .
" they 're very nutritious , and they make the beer more flavorful than filtered varieties . " think globally , drink locally bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : friedrichshain 's student crowds might be perfect for a micro-brewery lemke 's flagship brewpub is in the touristy neighborhood around berlin 's hackescher markt , while brokamp 's bar is located in the more residential area of friedrichshain .
he knows it will be a challenge to convince the locals to drink local stuff , but he 's confident . " i think that it 's exactly the right niche in the market , " brokamp said .
" general consumption is in decline .
people are more conscious and perhaps more choosey about what they drink .
and so i hope they 'll be interested in the sort of specialities that i 'll be offering . " brokamp will begin testing that hypothesis on feb .

23 , that they were willing to work together . " we are prepared to leave the problems of the past behind us , " erdogan told reporters . in a symbolic gesture of reconciliation , karamanlis laid a wreath at the tomb of turkey 's national founder and hero mustafa kremel ataturk , whose forces defeated invading greek troop in the 1920s . though the countries nearly went to war again in 1997 over a territorial dispute in the aegean sea , relations have been steadily improving over the last decade .

europe must accept it as a full member of the european family , " said karamanlis . he also urged erdogan to reopen a greek orthodox seminary , which was closed by the turkish government in 1972 , saying it could aid the country in joining the eu . resolving the cyprus issue is also key to turkey 's goal of eu membership , the greek prime minister added .
while ankara supports the breakaway turkish cypriots in northern cyprus , the eu recognizes the greek cypriot government as the legitimate authority . erdogan said a new wave of diplomatic efforts should begin following elections in cyprus , an eu member state , later this year . last official meeting in 1959 karamanlis is scheduled to meet turkish president abdullah gül on thursday before going to istanbul for a meeting with greek orthodox patriarch bartholomew i and a greek-turkish business forum . his uncle konstantinos was the last greek prime minister to pay an official visit to turkey . bildunterschrift : karamanlis visited the ataturk mausoleum in ankara dw staff -lrb- kjb -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

but people should rather look on the bright side , one of germany 's leading business managers told deutsche welle . jürgen großmann , 55 , is the ceo of rwe , one of germany 's largest energy companies .
he talked to dw-radio on the sidelines of the world economic forum in davos , which started wednesday , jan .
23 . deutsche welle : the financial and stock market crisis is the dominating topic in davos .
what could german businesses and publicly traded companies do to prevent a stock value massacre like the one we 've seen at the beginning of the week ? bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : jürgen großmann jürgen großmann : central banks and governments will surely come up with macroeconomic measures .
the lowering of interest rates by the us federal reserve is a first step .
in terms of microeconomics , companies have to tell themselves again and again : the donkey gets daring when he feels too comfortable .
we have to keep our cost structures and our competitiveness under control for stock market success to return .
it 's right and important to correct things sometimes .
let 's see that we get our ships back in order ; that we stick to the course .
do n't panic .
that 's the worst thing that could happen .
instead , we should analyze the current situation with a clear head .
if we do that , we 'll emerge from this stronger , i believe . how much is germany affected by the financial crisis ? bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : it 's no fun to be a german stock broker at the momen the global economy naturally is connected via financial markets , insurances and banks .
if wealth is destroyed in one place , that clearly has an effect on the behavior of consumers and investors .
we 're all affected .
no one should think that he 's not simply because he does n't own any stock .
that 's completely wrong . many people would love to be in the position that germany 's been fighting for hard for decades .
they 're also working on becoming world champions .
everyone participates in globalization and there are only marginal groups that do n't .
here in davos , we 've seen many studies over the past couple of years that have all reached the same conclusion : when all is said and done , the global economy , and also the poorest countries , have benefited from globalization . the example of cell phone maker nokia , who is about to close a plan in bochum in western germany , shows that even jobs in booming sectors are n't safe any more in germany .
will protectionism return ?
will industrialized countries have to isolate their markets to a greater extent in order to secure jobs ? bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : if nokia goes to romania , germans have to fill the void the eu 's never dropped protectionism in certain sectors , such as agriculture .
the bitter thing about nokia is that the competitor 's not in southeast asia , but in the eu and that the shift of jobs might even be financed with eu money .
but we 're still profiting big time from globalization and we have to think about how we can respond to such challenges . running after investors with subsidies clearly is n't the way to do it .
we need to recollect ourselves and think about our own strengths and develop our own business concepts .
we need german entrepreneurs that say : okay , if nokia leaves , we 'll step in .
we need good new ideas backed by innovation and we can develop them - it 's possible in germany . interview : marco vollmar -lrb- win -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?
dw-world.de trade union talks with nokia fruitless , german plant to close the german trade union ig metall said tuesday , jan .

-lrb- 22.01.2008 -rrb- effects of us recession could be held at bay , experts say global markets have plunged , partly due to fear of a recession in the united states , the world 's biggest economy .

germany 's rail company had initially rejected the idea , but bowed to pressure from the transport minister . ordinary people supported the nazi dictatorship in their everyday lives , which is why the exhibit about these crimes must be shown in an everyday place , transport minister wolfgang tiefensee said wednesday , jan .

both were organized by the french-german couple beate and serge klarsfeld , who founded the organization sons and daughters of jews deported from france . poignant location despite commuter chaos bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : nazi-hunter klarsfeld outlined the personal stories of thousands of deported children " putting an exhibition in a station is very different from putting it in a museum , " serge klarsfeld told the afp news agency on wednesday .
" it speaks to the german people directly . " however , deutsche bahn , germany 's national rail operator , had at first opposed the proposal to transform train station into a place of remembrance . " the subject is too serious , " deutsche bahn chief hartmut mehdorn said in october 2006 .
" it deserves more than commuters ' divided attention as they run to catch their trains while gulping down a sandwich . " in response , the rail company drew harsh criticism from the klarsfelds , who accused it of not owning up to its past . the reichsbahn , predecessor of germany 's present day train service , played an essential role in the nazi scheme to deport and exterminate millions of jews , roma and other " unwanted " people .
it also received money from the nazi government for each person it deported . trains made genocide possible bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : track 17 in grunewald is a memorial to holocaust victims deutsche bahn finally gave in to pressure from the transport minister . " it was important to me that this exhibition should go ahead and expose the troubled past of the reichsbahn , " tiefensee said wednesday at the opening of the exhibition . mehdorn did not attend the ceremony , but margret suckale , deutsche bahn 's personnel and legal manager , affirmed that , " without a doubt , the reichsbahn played a supporting role in the national socialist genocide . " a deutsche bahn press statement emphasized that the company seeks to uncover and remember its nazi past in other ways as well , including a memorial at track 17 at the grunewald station and with an exhibition at its museum in nuremberg . the deportation exhibition , titled " chartered trains to death - deportation with the german reichsbahn , " will be on display at the potsdamer platz station in berlin through feb .

but people should rather look on the bright side , one of germany 's leading business managers told deutsche welle . jürgen großmann , 55 , is the ceo of rwe , one of germany 's largest energy companies .
he talked to dw-radio on the sidelines of the world economic forum in davos , which started wednesday , jan .
23 . deutsche welle : the financial and stock market crisis is the dominating topic in davos .
what could german businesses and publicly traded companies do to prevent a stock value massacre like the one we 've seen at the beginning of the week ? bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : jürgen großmann jürgen großmann : central banks and governments will surely come up with macroeconomic measures .
the lowering of interest rates by the us federal reserve is a first step .
in terms of microeconomics , companies have to tell themselves again and again : the donkey gets daring when he feels too comfortable .
we have to keep our cost structures and our competitiveness under control for stock market success to return .
it 's right and important to correct things sometimes .
let 's see that we get our ships back in order ; that we stick to the course .
do n't panic .
that 's the worst thing that could happen .
instead , we should analyze the current situation with a clear head .
if we do that , we 'll emerge from this stronger , i believe . how much is germany affected by the financial crisis ? bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : it 's no fun to be a german stock broker at the momen the global economy naturally is connected via financial markets , insurances and banks .
if wealth is destroyed in one place , that clearly has an effect on the behavior of consumers and investors .
we 're all affected .
no one should think that he 's not simply because he does n't own any stock .
that 's completely wrong . many people would love to be in the position that germany 's been fighting for hard for decades .
they 're also working on becoming world champions .
everyone participates in globalization and there are only marginal groups that do n't .
here in davos , we 've seen many studies over the past couple of years that have all reached the same conclusion : when all is said and done , the global economy , and also the poorest countries , have benefited from globalization . the example of cell phone maker nokia , who is about to close a plan in bochum in western germany , shows that even jobs in booming sectors are n't safe any more in germany .
will protectionism return ?
will industrialized countries have to isolate their markets to a greater extent in order to secure jobs ? bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : if nokia goes to romania , germans have to fill the void the eu 's never dropped protectionism in certain sectors , such as agriculture .
the bitter thing about nokia is that the competitor 's not in southeast asia , but in the eu and that the shift of jobs might even be financed with eu money .
but we 're still profiting big time from globalization and we have to think about how we can respond to such challenges . running after investors with subsidies clearly is n't the way to do it .
we need to recollect ourselves and think about our own strengths and develop our own business concepts .
we need german entrepreneurs that say : okay , if nokia leaves , we 'll step in .
we need good new ideas backed by innovation and we can develop them - it 's possible in germany . interview : marco vollmar -lrb- win -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

he lost both italy was again thrown into political turmoil as prime minister romano prodi decided to leave office after he lost a crucial vote of confidence in the italian senate .
the opposition is calling for new elections . italy 's embattled prime minister romano prodi tendered his resignation after losing a vote of confidence in the senate on thursday , jan .

" the reputation built by siemens for 160 years has been reduced to ashes , " said daniela bergdolt , from the dsw group of small investors .
" it is not satisfactory that the affair has not been wrapped up after more than a year , " complained hans hirt , who represented the british pension fund hermes .
in the latest twist to the " affair , " investigators have established that payments worth around 140 million euros -lrb- $ 206 million -rrb- have been found in the firm 's flagship medical equipment division , reported the daily süddeutsche zeitung thursday .
siemens ' most profitable division , its turnover averages some 10 billion euros a year .

he has already renovated the management team and begun to simplify the company 's tentacular structure , reining in directors of siemens units abroad who have been dubbed " the princes . "
" what counts for me is clean business everywhere and always , and highest performance meeting the highest ethical standards , " he has said .

among the top figures absent were former siemens boss klaus kleinfeld and former supervisory board president heinrich von pierer , the emblematic head of the group from 1992 to 2005 , who both left siemens last year .
one telling sign of the times was a decision by siemens to forego the traditional vote of confidence by which shareholders typically approve the management team 's performance over the past year .

the rise in what is one of europe 's major economic indicators came despite this week 's torrid round of trading on global stock markets which fuelled fears of a global economic crisis .
" companies ' order books are bursting , " ifo economist hans günter russ told german news agency , dpa .
firms " remain optimistic about their exports , " he added .
german business defies fears analysts had predicted the closely watched index would show german business confidence sliding to 102.2 points this month on the back of worries that the shakeout in the us housing market could tip the giant us economy into recession .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : german companies are doing roaring business however , releasing the survey ifo president hans-werner sinn said , " on the whole , the condition of firms in german industry and trade continues to be robust . "
his comments echo the views of many economists who see germany acting as europe 's economic locomotive in the coming 12 months , despite the prospects of the nation 's growth rate slipping back a notch from 2.5 per cent in 2007 to below 2.0 per cent this year .
the germany economy grew at a perky 2.9 per cent in 2006 .
the ifo survey " underlines that fundamentally the euro area economy remains in good shape , " ' said elga bartsch from the us investment house morgan stanley .
" but it is clear that the headwinds are currently gaining momentum and , unless they blow over quickly , they will introduce downside risks to growth , inflation and interest rate forecasts , " she said .
asian demand help economy offset slump leading the ifo rise was an increase in german industry 's expectations of business conditions six months down the track , which nudged up to 99 from 98.2 in december .
however , underscoring the current economic uncertainty , the ifo index component gauging german executives ' assessment of the present situation dropped to 107.9 from 108.1 .
while germany 's key export sector is expected to lose some momentum this year , solid demand from the world 's key emerging economies in asia , eastern europe and the middle east is seen as helping to offset a slump in the us .
moreover , increased pay packets for german workers this year after a protracted period of wage stagnation as well as a continuing fall in unemployment are also forecast to help underpin consumer demand .
the surprise jump in the january ifo index added to the brighter mood prevailing on both german and european stocks markets after a highly volatile week in share trading and big falls in stock prices .
by mid-morning trading , frankfurt 's dax index was up almost five per cent with europe 's blue-chip stoxx 50 having gained nearly 4.0 per cent .
the rise in the ifo is likely to ease some of the pressure on the european central bank to follow the lead of other major central banks , notably the us federal reserve , and cut interest rates to help shore up economic confidence and in response to the signs of slowing growth . dw staff / dpa -lrb- sp -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

11 attacks lawmakers from 47 european nations have strongly criticized a system of un and eu sanctions against suspected backers of global terrorism , saying the use of terrorist blacklists violates fundamental rights . the council of europe , the eu 's rights watchdog , rules urged the united nations and the european union to overhaul procedures to blacklist individuals and groups suspected of having links to terrorism .
not only does the practice violate human rights , the lawmakers concluded , but they are " completely arbitrary , " according to a statement released by the 47-member body .
a report commissioned by the rights body said people were blacklisted on the basis of " mere suspicion " and called the measures " deplorable and violation of human rights and fundamental freedoms . "
harsh penalties against suspects dick marty , a swiss senator and former prosecutor who has published critical reports into alleged anti-terrorist practices by states and institutions , including reported secret cia prisons on european soil , said those affected by the terrorist blacklists had absolutely no rights to defend themselves against terrorist allegations .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : marty said the practice gave suspects no chance of defending themselves " i have seldom experienced anything as unfair as the compilation of these lists , " marty said at the european parliament in strasbourg this week .
according to the report , around 370 people and 130 groups or organizations are currently on the un 's blacklist .
they include alleged taliban individuals and those linked to al qaeda .
the eu lists 60 people or groups - including the radical palestinian group hamas and the basque separatist group , eta .
set up after the sept .
11 attacks in 2001 , the lists impose a number of penalties on those suspected of backing terrorism .
they include freezing suspects ' assets and preventing them from traveling without giving them a court hearing or disclosing the evidence against them .
the council of europe said in its report that many suspects on the lists only discovered that they were on it after they were stopped at a border while travelling or when their bank accounts were frozen .
" people remain on these lists for years without knowing why , and their lives are ruined , " marty said .
marty 's investigation into the practice was sparked by the case of a 78-year-old italian citizen of arab descent , youssef nada whose business was ruined after he landed on the blacklist .
the cia reportedly suspected nada of belonging to a group of financiers behind the sept .
11 attacks .
but a four-year investigation by swiss authorities into nada 's case was suspended in 2005 due to a lack of evidence .
nada 's assets were seized and he was barred from leaving his home of 30 years in switzerland .

kadi had filed his case in the eu because the un had no equivalent tribunal to which he could appeal .

the rise in what is one of europe 's major economic indicators came despite this week 's torrid round of trading on global stock markets which fuelled fears of a global economic crisis .
" companies ' order books are bursting , " ifo economist hans günter russ told german news agency , dpa .
firms " remain optimistic about their exports , " he added .
german business defies fears analysts had predicted the closely watched index would show german business confidence sliding to 102.2 points this month on the back of worries that the shakeout in the us housing market could tip the giant us economy into recession .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : german companies are doing roaring business however , releasing the survey ifo president hans-werner sinn said , " on the whole , the condition of firms in german industry and trade continues to be robust . "
his comments echo the views of many economists who see germany acting as europe 's economic locomotive in the coming 12 months , despite the prospects of the nation 's growth rate slipping back a notch from 2.5 per cent in 2007 to below 2.0 per cent this year .
the germany economy grew at a perky 2.9 per cent in 2006 .
the ifo survey " underlines that fundamentally the euro area economy remains in good shape , " ' said elga bartsch from the us investment house morgan stanley .
" but it is clear that the headwinds are currently gaining momentum and , unless they blow over quickly , they will introduce downside risks to growth , inflation and interest rate forecasts , " she said .
asian demand help economy offset slump leading the ifo rise was an increase in german industry 's expectations of business conditions six months down the track , which nudged up to 99 from 98.2 in december .
however , underscoring the current economic uncertainty , the ifo index component gauging german executives ' assessment of the present situation dropped to 107.9 from 108.1 .
while germany 's key export sector is expected to lose some momentum this year , solid demand from the world 's key emerging economies in asia , eastern europe and the middle east is seen as helping to offset a slump in the us .
moreover , increased pay packets for german workers this year after a protracted period of wage stagnation as well as a continuing fall in unemployment are also forecast to help underpin consumer demand .
the surprise jump in the january ifo index added to the brighter mood prevailing on both german and european stocks markets after a highly volatile week in share trading and big falls in stock prices .
by mid-morning trading , frankfurt 's dax index was up almost five per cent with europe 's blue-chip stoxx 50 having gained nearly 4.0 per cent .
the rise in the ifo is likely to ease some of the pressure on the european central bank to follow the lead of other major central banks , notably the us federal reserve , and cut interest rates to help shore up economic confidence and in response to the signs of slowing growth . dw staff / dpa -lrb- sp -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

the rise in what is one of europe 's major economic indicators came despite this week 's torrid round of trading on global stock markets which fuelled fears of a global economic crisis .
" companies ' order books are bursting , " ifo economist hans günter russ told german news agency , dpa .
firms " remain optimistic about their exports , " he added .
german business defies fears analysts had predicted the closely watched index would show german business confidence sliding to 102.2 points this month on the back of worries that the shakeout in the us housing market could tip the giant us economy into recession .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : german companies are doing roaring business however , releasing the survey ifo president hans-werner sinn said , " on the whole , the condition of firms in german industry and trade continues to be robust . "
his comments echo the views of many economists who see germany acting as europe 's economic locomotive in the coming 12 months , despite the prospects of the nation 's growth rate slipping back a notch from 2.5 per cent in 2007 to below 2.0 per cent this year .
the germany economy grew at a perky 2.9 per cent in 2006 .
the ifo survey " underlines that fundamentally the euro area economy remains in good shape , " ' said elga bartsch from the us investment house morgan stanley .
" but it is clear that the headwinds are currently gaining momentum and , unless they blow over quickly , they will introduce downside risks to growth , inflation and interest rate forecasts , " she said .
asian demand help economy offset slump leading the ifo rise was an increase in german industry 's expectations of business conditions six months down the track , which nudged up to 99 from 98.2 in december .
however , underscoring the current economic uncertainty , the ifo index component gauging german executives ' assessment of the present situation dropped to 107.9 from 108.1 .
while germany 's key export sector is expected to lose some momentum this year , solid demand from the world 's key emerging economies in asia , eastern europe and the middle east is seen as helping to offset a slump in the us .
moreover , increased pay packets for german workers this year after a protracted period of wage stagnation as well as a continuing fall in unemployment are also forecast to help underpin consumer demand .
the surprise jump in the january ifo index added to the brighter mood prevailing on both german and european stocks markets after a highly volatile week in share trading and big falls in stock prices .
by mid-morning trading , frankfurt 's dax index was up almost five per cent with europe 's blue-chip stoxx 50 having gained nearly 4.0 per cent .
the rise in the ifo is likely to ease some of the pressure on the european central bank to follow the lead of other major central banks , notably the us federal reserve , and cut interest rates to help shore up economic confidence and in response to the signs of slowing growth . dw staff / dpa -lrb- sp -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

serbia is to hold the final round of its presidential election on february 3 , with ultra-nationalist candidate tomislav nikolic having taken the lead over pro-eu incumbent boris tadic in the first round .

24 , that the countries would pay a far higher price for ignoring the environment . while the measures would cost consumers 3 euros -lrb- $ 4.37 -rrb- a week on average , " the cost of inaction is up to 10 times more than what we are proposing , " said commission president jose manuel barroso . " responding to the challenge of climate change is the ultimate political test for our generation , " he added .
" our package not only responds to this challenge , but holds the right answer to the challenge of energy security and is an opportunity that should create thousands of new businesses and millions of jobs .

the measures are designed to put into action the aim set by eu leaders last year to cut carbon dioxide emissions by 20 percent by 2020 , compared to 1990 levels . by then , the use of renewable energies like biomass , wind and solar power will have to have risen to 20 percent of all energy forms .
biofuels will also have to make up 10 percent of fuels used for transport . these targets would wean the bloc off coal and oil , as would a decision that power generators must pay from 2013 for all permits to emit carbon dioxide - but left industrial leaders wondering about the impact on industry . german utility rwe said the package called into question the future of coal . " coal is threatened in its economic viability , " rwe 's head of power generation , ulrich jobs , told reuters meanwhile , other energy-intensive sectors such as the steel , aluminum and chemical industries have accepted the principles of the plan but voiced similar concerns about the cost and impact on jobs and a drop in competitiveness .
the steel industry is expecting the shift to entail the loss of up to 300,000 jobs across europe . " we foresee that industry and individuals will be facing a huge rise in the cost of electricity , " said jürgen thumann , president of the german association of german industry in berlin wednesday .

" an international agreement is our absolute priority , " barroso told reporters .
" but let me be clear , if we do not make progress we will protect european companies . " eu environment commissioner stavros dimas has said that if competitors from the us and china have still failed to establish climate rules by 2011 , thereby allowing for cheap production , he would consider lightening the burden for european companies and forcing importers to buy emissions permits . germany 's concerns bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : glos is concerned too heavy a burden is being placed on germany with around 8.5 percent of eu energy coming from renewable forms , future load sharing will be based in part on gross domestic product . while german environment minister sigmar gabriel hailed the plan as " courageous , " economy minister michael glos warned that " it will destroy jobs in industries which consume a lot of energy .

germany 's rail company had initially rejected the idea , but bowed to pressure from the transport minister . ordinary people supported the nazi dictatorship in their everyday lives , which is why the exhibit about these crimes must be shown in an everyday place , transport minister wolfgang tiefensee said wednesday , jan .
23 , at the opening of the exhibition potsdamer platz station in downtown berlin . forty information boards with photos , personal testimonies , biographies and diagrams detail the fate of , among others , 11,400 jewish children who were deported from france to the auschwitz death camp by train between 1942 and 1944 . the exhibition , which also honors the sinti roma deported and killed by the nazis , is a replicate of a similar show that took place in french train stations four years ago .
both were organized by the french-german couple beate and serge klarsfeld , who founded the organization sons and daughters of jews deported from france . poignant location despite commuter chaos bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : nazi-hunter klarsfeld outlined the personal stories of thousands of deported children " putting an exhibition in a station is very different from putting it in a museum , " serge klarsfeld told the afp news agency on wednesday .
" it speaks to the german people directly . " however , deutsche bahn , germany 's national rail operator , had at first opposed the proposal to transform train station into a place of remembrance . " the subject is too serious , " deutsche bahn chief hartmut mehdorn said in october 2006 .
" it deserves more than commuters ' divided attention as they run to catch their trains while gulping down a sandwich . " in response , the rail company drew harsh criticism from the klarsfelds , who accused it of not owning up to its past . the reichsbahn , predecessor of germany 's present day train service , played an essential role in the nazi scheme to deport and exterminate millions of jews , roma and other " unwanted " people .
it also received money from the nazi government for each person it deported . trains made genocide possible bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : track 17 in grunewald is a memorial to holocaust victims deutsche bahn finally gave in to pressure from the transport minister . " it was important to me that this exhibition should go ahead and expose the troubled past of the reichsbahn , " tiefensee said wednesday at the opening of the exhibition . mehdorn did not attend the ceremony , but margret suckale , deutsche bahn 's personnel and legal manager , affirmed that , " without a doubt , the reichsbahn played a supporting role in the national socialist genocide . " a deutsche bahn press statement emphasized that the company seeks to uncover and remember its nazi past in other ways as well , including a memorial at track 17 at the grunewald station and with an exhibition at its museum in nuremberg . the deportation exhibition , titled " chartered trains to death - deportation with the german reichsbahn , " will be on display at the potsdamer platz station in berlin through feb .

germany 's rail company had initially rejected the idea , but bowed to pressure from the transport minister . ordinary people supported the nazi dictatorship in their everyday lives , which is why the exhibit about these crimes must be shown in an everyday place , transport minister wolfgang tiefensee said wednesday , jan .
23 , at the opening of the exhibition potsdamer platz station in downtown berlin . forty information boards with photos , personal testimonies , biographies and diagrams detail the fate of , among others , 11,400 jewish children who were deported from france to the auschwitz death camp by train between 1942 and 1944 . the exhibition , which also honors the sinti roma deported and killed by the nazis , is a replicate of a similar show that took place in french train stations four years ago .
both were organized by the french-german couple beate and serge klarsfeld , who founded the organization sons and daughters of jews deported from france . poignant location despite commuter chaos bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : nazi-hunter klarsfeld outlined the personal stories of thousands of deported children " putting an exhibition in a station is very different from putting it in a museum , " serge klarsfeld told the afp news agency on wednesday .
" it speaks to the german people directly . " however , deutsche bahn , germany 's national rail operator , had at first opposed the proposal to transform train station into a place of remembrance . " the subject is too serious , " deutsche bahn chief hartmut mehdorn said in october 2006 .
" it deserves more than commuters ' divided attention as they run to catch their trains while gulping down a sandwich . " in response , the rail company drew harsh criticism from the klarsfelds , who accused it of not owning up to its past . the reichsbahn , predecessor of germany 's present day train service , played an essential role in the nazi scheme to deport and exterminate millions of jews , roma and other " unwanted " people .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de food and drink -pipe- 24.01.2008 micro-brewers hope to fight sinking beer sales in germany großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : germans are drinking less beer , but local specialties still sell well german beer consumption has been in steady decline since the early 1990s – - especially among young people .
speciality breweries and brew-pubs could change that , but they 've not really become popular - so far . beer may be germany 's unofficial national drink , but more and more germans seem to be losing their taste for it .
according to the german brewer 's association , beer consumption fell by around 18 percent from 1992 to 2006 . one person who 's not affected by the decline is berlin 's oliver lemke , the owner of one of the few independent brewpubs in the german capital .
business is up in all four of his establishments , the first of which opened in 1999 .
he said the overall slump reflects the destruction of small local breweries by big corporations . " there used to be 100 breweries in this neighborhood alone , " lemke said .
" they died out in the 1970s with the trend toward mono-breweries .
the big breweries - for example warsteiner or licher – said : ‘ we 're only going to make one sort of beer , a premium pilsner , and we 'll market it nationwide . '
and that inevitably leads to a dead-end .
at some point , even the world 's biggest idiot notices that there 's virtually no difference between a warsteiner and licher . " popsicle flavorings or real ale ? bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : berlin 's brauhaus lemke has n't been affected by the slump germany has some 1,300 brewing companies , but the vast majority - including germany 's most famous brand , beck 's - belong to huge international conglomerates , and styles rarely stray from the standard pilsner and wheat varieties .
the main strategy among major brewers for interesting young people is to mix their products with everything from lemon flavor to cola . but why has n't germany gotten in on the micro-brewery and real-ale trends in the us or the uk ?
after all , no self-respecting manhattan yuppie would be seen with a bud light in his hand . " it 's a global interplay between wrong-headed marketing , the wrong sort of people as bar owners and the wrong retailing structures , " lemke said .
" that 's why those trends are under-represented here compared with the united states . " lemke is trying to change that .
his brewpubs revive almost forgotten brewing styles , such as amber ale or the double-hopped , non-filtered zwickel , and seasonal specialities such as the extra-strength märzen -lrb- " march beer " -rrb- .
they sell a respectable 2,500 hectoliters -lrb- 66,000 gallons -rrb- a year - and there 's no mistaking them for beck 's . alcohol abuse bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : nationally marketed brands forced many local breweries out of business in the 1970s but it 's difficult for independents to break through against the conglomerates .
the big brewing companies control distribution networks and encourage pub owners to feature their products exclusively by offering loans , price rebates and free tapping and refrigeration systems , beer glasses and even ashtrays . and german consumers and bar owners are ignorant about the drink itself , lemke said . " the german beer drinker thinks he knows a lot about beer , but most of them know very , very , little , " he said .
" it start 's with the myth that you need seven minutes to tap a good pilsner .
nonsense - that just makes it go flat and warm .
when i go to bars , i usually drink bottled beer because i know the tap beer has usually been physically abused .
it 's atrocious .
i know a lot of people in america that know far more about beer than people here in germany . " name recognition bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : what would a brewpub be without the obligatory copper brewing kettles ?

germany 's notorious bureaucracy has n't made things any easier , brokamp said . " there 's the stereotype about bureaucracy , but i now know it 's not a stereotype , " said brokamp , who was forced to postpone opening due to red tape .
" i 've had to deal with at least eight separate government permit agencies , everything from the civil engineering office to offices for the environment and handicapped accessibility .
every one of them considered itself particularly important , but they could n't even agree on what the regulations were . " all that for a bar with a capacity of 100 , where the beer is made in the basement . while he 's tying up loose ends , brokamp is brewing light and dark beers as well as red ale and cider .
his style emphasizes malt more than lemke 's without being overly sweet . brokamp 's beers are also non-filtered , which means they look cloudy when poured .

speciality breweries and brew-pubs could change that , but they 've not really become popular - so far . beer may be germany 's unofficial national drink , but more and more germans seem to be losing their taste for it .
according to the german brewer 's association , beer consumption fell by around 18 percent from 1992 to 2006 . one person who 's not affected by the decline is berlin 's oliver lemke , the owner of one of the few independent brewpubs in the german capital .
business is up in all four of his establishments , the first of which opened in 1999 .
he said the overall slump reflects the destruction of small local breweries by big corporations . " there used to be 100 breweries in this neighborhood alone , " lemke said .
" they died out in the 1970s with the trend toward mono-breweries .
the big breweries - for example warsteiner or licher – said : ‘ we 're only going to make one sort of beer , a premium pilsner , and we 'll market it nationwide . '
and that inevitably leads to a dead-end .
at some point , even the world 's biggest idiot notices that there 's virtually no difference between a warsteiner and licher . " popsicle flavorings or real ale ? bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : berlin 's brauhaus lemke has n't been affected by the slump germany has some 1,300 brewing companies , but the vast majority - including germany 's most famous brand , beck 's - belong to huge international conglomerates , and styles rarely stray from the standard pilsner and wheat varieties .
the main strategy among major brewers for interesting young people is to mix their products with everything from lemon flavor to cola . but why has n't germany gotten in on the micro-brewery and real-ale trends in the us or the uk ?
after all , no self-respecting manhattan yuppie would be seen with a bud light in his hand . " it 's a global interplay between wrong-headed marketing , the wrong sort of people as bar owners and the wrong retailing structures , " lemke said .
" that 's why those trends are under-represented here compared with the united states . " lemke is trying to change that .
his brewpubs revive almost forgotten brewing styles , such as amber ale or the double-hopped , non-filtered zwickel , and seasonal specialities such as the extra-strength märzen -lrb- " march beer " -rrb- .
they sell a respectable 2,500 hectoliters -lrb- 66,000 gallons -rrb- a year - and there 's no mistaking them for beck 's . alcohol abuse bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : nationally marketed brands forced many local breweries out of business in the 1970s but it 's difficult for independents to break through against the conglomerates .
the big brewing companies control distribution networks and encourage pub owners to feature their products exclusively by offering loans , price rebates and free tapping and refrigeration systems , beer glasses and even ashtrays . and german consumers and bar owners are ignorant about the drink itself , lemke said . " the german beer drinker thinks he knows a lot about beer , but most of them know very , very , little , " he said .
" it start 's with the myth that you need seven minutes to tap a good pilsner .
nonsense - that just makes it go flat and warm .
when i go to bars , i usually drink bottled beer because i know the tap beer has usually been physically abused .
it 's atrocious .

the 32-year-old brewer moved to berlin last year and is set to open his first brewpub , appropriately named hops and barley . without the support of a major corporation , that 's proven a daunting task .
germany 's notorious bureaucracy has n't made things any easier , brokamp said . " there 's the stereotype about bureaucracy , but i now know it 's not a stereotype , " said brokamp , who was forced to postpone opening due to red tape .
" i 've had to deal with at least eight separate government permit agencies , everything from the civil engineering office to offices for the environment and handicapped accessibility .

" all that for a bar with a capacity of 100 , where the beer is made in the basement . while he 's tying up loose ends , brokamp is brewing light and dark beers as well as red ale and cider .
his style emphasizes malt more than lemke 's without being overly sweet . brokamp 's beers are also non-filtered , which means they look cloudy when poured .
but as he explains , cloudiness is good . " the things mass breweries filter out are n't impurities , " brokamp said .

speciality breweries and brew-pubs could change that , but they 've not really become popular - so far . beer may be germany 's unofficial national drink , but more and more germans seem to be losing their taste for it .
according to the german brewer 's association , beer consumption fell by around 18 percent from 1992 to 2006 . one person who 's not affected by the decline is berlin 's oliver lemke , the owner of one of the few independent brewpubs in the german capital .
business is up in all four of his establishments , the first of which opened in 1999 .
he said the overall slump reflects the destruction of small local breweries by big corporations . " there used to be 100 breweries in this neighborhood alone , " lemke said .
" they died out in the 1970s with the trend toward mono-breweries .
the big breweries - for example warsteiner or licher – said : ‘ we 're only going to make one sort of beer , a premium pilsner , and we 'll market it nationwide . '
and that inevitably leads to a dead-end .
at some point , even the world 's biggest idiot notices that there 's virtually no difference between a warsteiner and licher . " popsicle flavorings or real ale ? bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : berlin 's brauhaus lemke has n't been affected by the slump germany has some 1,300 brewing companies , but the vast majority - including germany 's most famous brand , beck 's - belong to huge international conglomerates , and styles rarely stray from the standard pilsner and wheat varieties .
the main strategy among major brewers for interesting young people is to mix their products with everything from lemon flavor to cola . but why has n't germany gotten in on the micro-brewery and real-ale trends in the us or the uk ?
after all , no self-respecting manhattan yuppie would be seen with a bud light in his hand . " it 's a global interplay between wrong-headed marketing , the wrong sort of people as bar owners and the wrong retailing structures , " lemke said .
" that 's why those trends are under-represented here compared with the united states . " lemke is trying to change that .
his brewpubs revive almost forgotten brewing styles , such as amber ale or the double-hopped , non-filtered zwickel , and seasonal specialities such as the extra-strength märzen -lrb- " march beer " -rrb- .
they sell a respectable 2,500 hectoliters -lrb- 66,000 gallons -rrb- a year - and there 's no mistaking them for beck 's . alcohol abuse bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : nationally marketed brands forced many local breweries out of business in the 1970s but it 's difficult for independents to break through against the conglomerates .
the big brewing companies control distribution networks and encourage pub owners to feature their products exclusively by offering loans , price rebates and free tapping and refrigeration systems , beer glasses and even ashtrays . and german consumers and bar owners are ignorant about the drink itself , lemke said . " the german beer drinker thinks he knows a lot about beer , but most of them know very , very , little , " he said .
" it start 's with the myth that you need seven minutes to tap a good pilsner .
nonsense - that just makes it go flat and warm .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de terrorism -pipe- 24.01.2008 european rights watchdog slams eu , un terrorism blacklists großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the terrorism blacklists were set up in the wake of the sept .
11 attacks lawmakers from 47 european nations have strongly criticized a system of un and eu sanctions against suspected backers of global terrorism , saying the use of terrorist blacklists violates fundamental rights . the council of europe , the eu 's rights watchdog , rules urged the united nations and the european union to overhaul procedures to blacklist individuals and groups suspected of having links to terrorism .
not only does the practice violate human rights , the lawmakers concluded , but they are " completely arbitrary , " according to a statement released by the 47-member body .
a report commissioned by the rights body said people were blacklisted on the basis of " mere suspicion " and called the measures " deplorable and violation of human rights and fundamental freedoms . "
harsh penalties against suspects dick marty , a swiss senator and former prosecutor who has published critical reports into alleged anti-terrorist practices by states and institutions , including reported secret cia prisons on european soil , said those affected by the terrorist blacklists had absolutely no rights to defend themselves against terrorist allegations .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : marty said the practice gave suspects no chance of defending themselves " i have seldom experienced anything as unfair as the compilation of these lists , " marty said at the european parliament in strasbourg this week .
according to the report , around 370 people and 130 groups or organizations are currently on the un 's blacklist .
they include alleged taliban individuals and those linked to al qaeda .
the eu lists 60 people or groups - including the radical palestinian group hamas and the basque separatist group , eta .
set up after the sept .
11 attacks in 2001 , the lists impose a number of penalties on those suspected of backing terrorism .
they include freezing suspects ' assets and preventing them from traveling without giving them a court hearing or disclosing the evidence against them .
the council of europe said in its report that many suspects on the lists only discovered that they were on it after they were stopped at a border while travelling or when their bank accounts were frozen .
" people remain on these lists for years without knowing why , and their lives are ruined , " marty said .
marty 's investigation into the practice was sparked by the case of a 78-year-old italian citizen of arab descent , youssef nada whose business was ruined after he landed on the blacklist .
the cia reportedly suspected nada of belonging to a group of financiers behind the sept .
11 attacks .
but a four-year investigation by swiss authorities into nada 's case was suspended in 2005 due to a lack of evidence .
nada 's assets were seized and he was barred from leaving his home of 30 years in switzerland .
nada 's name remains on the terror blacklist .
top eu court may rule against un practice the un system is at present being scrutinized by the eu 's top court and there is a strong likelihood it may rule that the 27-member bloc has violated basic rights by applying them .
according to news agency reuters , an eu legal advisor has recommended the eu court of justice in luxembourg should cancel financial sanctions against a saudi businessman and a swedish-based money transfer business in two separate cases .
the agency quoted cameron doley , a british lawyer representing saudi businessman yassin kadi as saying that his client had never received a clear statement of the allegations against him .
kadi had filed his case in the eu because the un had no equivalent tribunal to which he could appeal .
" what this gives us , we hope , is a statement by one of the most prominent and respected courts in the world that this system is an unjustified infringement of the fundamental human rights of those persons who are listed , " doley told reuters . dw staff -lrb- sp -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

he lost both italy was again thrown into political turmoil as prime minister romano prodi decided to leave office after he lost a crucial vote of confidence in the italian senate .
the opposition is calling for new elections . italy 's embattled prime minister romano prodi tendered his resignation after losing a vote of confidence in the senate on thursday , jan .
24 , by five votes . italian president giorgio napolitano who , according to news reports , " reserved the right " on whether to accept prodi 's resignation , convened the speakers of both houses of parliament for consultations friday . the result was 156 for the center-left government , 161 against and one abstention .
three senators were absent , including two non-elected life senators . napolitano must choose between calling early elections and setting up a transitional government to allow electoral reforms , which many deputies say are badly needed , to be enacted . prodi , the center-left leader who won elections in april 2006 by a handful of votes , went before the senate despite appeals by top leaders including napolitano to resign rather than face the vote . he appeared resigned to the prospect of losing the vote but determined to carry through with it on principle . " i am here because you can not hide from the judgment of those who represent the people , and our people are watching us , " he said . prodi has walked a tightrope trying to keep together his squabbling coalition , which ranges from centrist catholics to far-left communists . earlier plea falls on senate 's deaf ears dismissing calls for his resignation , prodi earlier urged senators to support his government . " italy does not have the luxury of halting -lrb- the work of -rrb- this government , " prodi said in the senate as he opened the scheduled debate preceding the vote . to those voting against him , prodi said they should ask what government and what parliamentary majority they wanted in place of " the legitimate one currently in office . " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : president napolitano wanted prodi to step aside ahead of the vote earlier prodi met napolitano - who like others in the governing center-left coalition reportedly wanted the premier to make way for a caretaker government - before the senate vote . the embattled prime minister had already met napolitano before winning wednesday 's confidence vote in parliament 's lower house chamber of deputies where , unlike the senate , the government has a clear majority . recent defections have left the governing centre-left coalition with some 157 votes in the senate , while the opposition is expected to muster around 160 votes . " we will have early elections , " university and research minister fabio mussi said thursday , voicing a view shared by some members of prodi 's eight-party coalition and the vast majority of the opposition including former prime minister silvio berlusconi . however the democratic party , the largest in the center-left government had said that if prodi were to fall , then electoral reforms - aimed at giving governments more stability by decreasing the influence of small parties - should be introduced before a new poll . napolitano , who has the power to dissolve parliament had also said in the past that a new electoral law would be needed before elections are held . mastella 's withdrawal of support prompts crisis prodi 's decision to test his support in parliament came after former justice minister clemente mastella said monday his small moderate udeur party would no longer support the governing coalition .
mastella resigned last week in the wake of a corruption scandal . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : mastella decided to pull his party out of prodi 's coalition his decision triggered the latest , and most serious crisis to strike prodi since he took office 20 months ago after winning italy 's closest post-world war ii election by just 25,000 votes in april 2006 .
prodi has had to rely on more than 30 confidence votes to push through legislation , including the government 's budget and foreign policy . in the wake of prodi 's resignation , berlusconi called for the president to dissolve parliament and call elections immediately . berlusconi also had to face four votes of confidence during his government 's turn in office .

it is based on the x-prize-winning spaceshipone concept - a rocket ship that is lifted initially by a carrier plane before blasting skywards .
the virgin system is essentially a refinement , but has been increased in size to take eight people at a time on a sub-orbital trip , starting in 2010 .
virgin boss sir richard branson said the space business had huge potential .
see detailed view of the space craft " i think it 's very important that we make a genuine commercial success of this project , " he told a news conference in new york .
" if we do , i believe we 'll unlock a wall of private sector money into both space launch systems and space technology .
" this could rival the scale of investment in the mobile phone and internet technologies after they were unlocked from their military origins and thrown open to the private sector . "
the ' experience ' virgin galactic has contracted the innovative aerospace designer burt rutan to build its spaceliners .
the carrier - white knight two -lrb- wk2 -rrb- - is said to be very nearly complete and is expected to begin flight-testing later this year .
spaceshiptwo -lrb- ss2 -rrb- is about 60 % complete , virgin galactic says .
both vehicles are being constructed at mr rutan 's scaled composites factory in california .
the rocket spaceliner will carry two pilot astronauts and six ticketed passengers .
they will fly initially from a new facility called spaceport america in the new mexico desert .
the journeys will last about two-and-a-half hours from beginning to end .
passengers on ss2 will climb to an altitude of 110km , from where they will get to experience weightlessness for a few minutes , and see the curvature of the earth and the black of space .
seats cost $ 200,000 .
virgin galactic says more than 200 individuals have booked , and another 85,000 have registered an interest to fly .
tens of millions of dollars in deposits have already been taken , the company adds .
satellite potential sir richard said the launch system would also be made available to industrial and research groups .
" the fact that this system will have the capability to launch small payloads and satellites at low cost is hugely important , " he told the launch event at the american museum of natural history .
" as far as science is concerned , this system offers tremendous potential to researchers who will be able to fly experiments much more often than before , helping to answer key questions about earth 's climate and the mysteries of the universe . "
the designs released on wednesday are a clear evolution of the concept that won the $ 10m ansari x-prize in 2005 for the first successful , privately developed , sub-orbital human launch-system .
the most obvious difference is the scale .
at 18.3m -lrb- 60ft -rrb- in length , ss2 is twice as big as its predecessor .
virgin galactic said in a statement : " it incorporates both the lessons learned from the spaceshipone programme and the market research conducted by virgin galactic into the requirements future astronauts have for their space flight experience .
" it also has built-in flexibility to encompass future requirements for other scientific and commercial applications . "
an ss2 simulator is now available to train the pilots .
wk2 is 23.7m-long -lrb- 78ft -rrb- .
its wingspan is unchanged at 42.7m -lrb- 140ft -rrb- , but it will now sport four pratt and whitney pw308 engines .
virgin galactic is one of several companies hoping shortly to offer space trips .
amazon.com entrepreneur jeff bezos has his own scheme , as does the paypal founder , elon musk .
even europe 's eads astrium , the company that coordinates the manufacture of the ariane 5 rocket , is developing a commercial suborbital ship .
currently , the only way to buy a trip into space is to pay for a seat on the russian soyuz launcher .
tickets purchased through space adventures cost a reported $ 20m and take the recipient to the international space station for a short holiday .

it came after ceredigion councillors approved three applications against the advice of planners which were later rejected by the assembly government .
the assembly government 's planning inspector said it was " discriminatory " to grant plans on a language basis .
but one planning committee member said it was trying to protect communities .
the incident came to light when one of the three approved applications was called in by the assembly government .
in a subsequent report , planning inspector ian osborne said it would be " discriminatory " to grant permission solely on the grounds the applicant was a welsh speaker .
it would be discriminatory to grant permission solely or largely on the grounds that the applicant is welsh-speaking ian osborne " whilst the planning system should take account of the needs and interest of the welsh language , the fact that the applicant is a local , welsh-speaking person active in the community does not outweigh the environmental harm , " said mr osborne .
" moreover it would be discriminatory to grant permission solely or largely on the grounds that the applicant is welsh-speaking . "
ceredigion council 's senior planning officer aled richards has warned the council 's planning committee that it could lose its planning powers if it continued to take decisions that breached regulations .
" we have to take this very seriously , " he added .
" what 's happening is that time and time again we refer to the fact that the applicant is a local welsh speaker .
we have to look at the application , not the applicant . "
all we 're trying to do is stand up for our young people and our communities cllr lyndon lloyd but cllr lyndon lloyd who sits on the planning committee said he disagreed with mr osborne 's comments .
" we have assembly government ministers saying there should be policies in rural areas that rely on positive discretion , and then we have comments from mr osborne that seem so rigid , " he explained .
" all we 're trying to do is stand up for our young people and our communities .
there seems to be a lack of awareness of that in cardiff from the assembly 's officials . "
he was supported by the welsh language society -lrb- cymdeithas yr iaith gymraeg -rrb- .
angharad clwyd , chair of the group in ceredigion , said it supported planners ' decision to support local people .
she added : " we support ceredigion county council 's decision to look at the needs of local people and the welsh language when it comes to planning .
" cymdeithas believe that preference should be given to local people and are calling for a property act that would secure this amongst other planning issues that would safeguard our communities . "

it came after ceredigion councillors approved three applications against the advice of planners which were later rejected by the assembly government .
the assembly government 's planning inspector said it was " discriminatory " to grant plans on a language basis .
but one planning committee member said it was trying to protect communities .
the incident came to light when one of the three approved applications was called in by the assembly government .
in a subsequent report , planning inspector ian osborne said it would be " discriminatory " to grant permission solely on the grounds the applicant was a welsh speaker .
it would be discriminatory to grant permission solely or largely on the grounds that the applicant is welsh-speaking ian osborne " whilst the planning system should take account of the needs and interest of the welsh language , the fact that the applicant is a local , welsh-speaking person active in the community does not outweigh the environmental harm , " said mr osborne .
" moreover it would be discriminatory to grant permission solely or largely on the grounds that the applicant is welsh-speaking . "
ceredigion council 's senior planning officer aled richards has warned the council 's planning committee that it could lose its planning powers if it continued to take decisions that breached regulations .
" we have to take this very seriously , " he added .
" what 's happening is that time and time again we refer to the fact that the applicant is a local welsh speaker .
we have to look at the application , not the applicant . "
all we 're trying to do is stand up for our young people and our communities cllr lyndon lloyd but cllr lyndon lloyd who sits on the planning committee said he disagreed with mr osborne 's comments .
" we have assembly government ministers saying there should be policies in rural areas that rely on positive discretion , and then we have comments from mr osborne that seem so rigid , " he explained .
" all we 're trying to do is stand up for our young people and our communities .
there seems to be a lack of awareness of that in cardiff from the assembly 's officials . "

angharad clwyd , chair of the group in ceredigion , said it supported planners ' decision to support local people .
she added : " we support ceredigion county council 's decision to look at the needs of local people and the welsh language when it comes to planning .

it has not yet been decided when the case of sarika singh , 14 , who was excluded from an aberdare school for wearing the sikh bangle , will be heard .
the chair of governors at aberdare girls ' school would not say where funds to fight the case were coming from .
it is claimed the school breached race relations and human rights laws .
sarika has not attended the school , which is in rhondda cynon taf , since being told she can not wear her bracelet , known as a kara , in november .
it was decided on wednesday the case could be heard in the high court in london .
an interim hearing will be held in the next two weeks to decide whether sarika , the only sikh at her school , can return to the classroom while the case is continuing .
the council is not providing any support or financial assistance with regard to this matter for as long as the current situation prevails rhondda cynon taf spokesman rhondda cynon taf council told the school 's governors earlier this month it would no longer give them any more support or financial assistance and confirmed this was continuing for the court case .
a spokesman for the council said : " the current court case essentially involves the school and the family .
" the council is not providing any support or financial assistance with regard to this matter for as long as the current situation prevails .
" matters of funding are therefore the responsibility of those involved in the legal proceedings and any queries should therefore be directly addressed to them . "
chair of the school 's governors ian blake said they would not continue to fight the case if they did not have the funding .
" this case is going ahead .
there is funding available , " he said .
" contingency plans for this were made before christmas .
the school has been managing . "
aberdare girls ' school only allows ear studs and a wrist-watch mr blake added the issues had been discussed in a governors meeting .
human rights group liberty claims the school is violating the race relations act 1976 , the equality act 2006 and the human rights act 1998 .
it wants sarika to be allowed to attend normal lessons at the school while wearing the kara , and for the school to amend its uniform policy to comply with the race relations act .
the governors rejected the girl 's request to wear the bangle in november after a " significant period of research " examining the uniform policy and human rights legislation in detail .
new guidelines published by the welsh assembly government last week said school governors should take in religious views and consider whether their uniform policy interferes with the right to manifest a religion or belief .

liam clarke hanged himself in bridgend in december .
the region 's coroner said he was one of 13 young people to commit suicide there over the last year .
south wales police are investigating if any made contact on the internet , by e-mail or on a networking site .
bridgend 's mp said social networking sites could be " romanticising " suicide .
fears over a link between the suicides were raised when natasha randall , 17 , was found hanged at her home in blaengarw , near bridgend , and a girl believed to know her self-harmed a day later .
before she died , natasha left a message on her page on bebo to mr clarke after his death , reading : " rip clarky boy ! ! gonna miss ya ! always remember the gd times ! love ya x . "
mr clarke 's father kevin said : " i do n't think they -lrb- the deaths -rrb- are linked and i do n't think the bebo website is linked to it either .
" it would be intriguing to find out what has got them doing it so close to each other .
" i know natasha and liam were very friendly - there is a photograph somewhere of them dancing together in a pub .
i think the welsh assembly government and all the appropriate authorities should be enlightened and look into it in some depth philip walters , coroner " it could be a coincidence .
being with liam the afternoon before he decided to kill himself , he was just as normal as i have ever known him .
" we will never discover what caused it . "
he went on to explain that his son was also in school with thomas davies from north cornelly who hanged himself at the age of 20 in february 2007 .
but he said the two were not close .
thomas was friends with david dilling , 19 , and dale crole , 18 , who had been found dead weeks earlier .
at first , a spate of seven deaths of young people were highlighted but on wednesday , the coroner for bridgend and the valleys philip walters said the number of suicides among young people under 26 over the previous 12 months in the area actually numbered 13 .
he said that three of the boys were friends and had died some months after each other but that was the only link that had been found so far .
he called for a task force to be set up to look at the numbers of young suicides .
" it is very important that we get to grips with the situation , " he said .
coroner philip waters said these seven were among 13 to have died " what can be done i 'm not exactly sure because we have great difficulty in finding the causes .
" i think the welsh assembly government and all the appropriate authorities should be enlightened and look into it in some depth . "
a focus group which includes south wales police , bro morgannwg health trust , local schools and bridgend council has been set up to help prevent suicides and attempted suicides .
health minister edwina hart also said the care and social inspectorate wales would be working with the local authority on the case of natasha randall .
south wales police said they had yet to find evidence linking natasha 's death to the others .
supt tim jones , divisional commander of police in bridgend , said : " i think it 's quite clear that some individuals within this group did know one another , but what is equally clear is that we 've found no theme that links them all together . "

increased exports and a boom in the construction industry helped the rapid expansion during 2007 .
but officials warned that overheating remained a danger , despite a slight slow-down in the fourth quarter .
inflation is also a serious concern , with many chinese people hit by recent dramatic increases in food prices .
' still developing ' announcing the figures , national statistics bureau chief xie fuzhan said beijing was paying " close attention " to the us credit crisis .
he said beijing would respond by making " timely and proper adjustments " in exchange and interest rate policy , but gave no details .
speculation has been mounting among analysts over whether china has overtaken germany to become the world 's third-largest economy .
but mr xie played down the comparison , saying : " it 's not really important to know whether china is the fourth-largest or the third-largest .
" even if the total surpasses germany , china is still a developing country - in particular , the per capita gdp of china is really low . "
price controls the bbc 's quentin sommerville , in shanghai , says economic growth is not a problem in china , but keeping the ever-expanding economy under control is proving tricky .
it took six interest rate rises by the government last year to slow the expansion .
the last quarter of 2007 saw growth ease to 11.2 % .
but while other governments around the world are cutting interest rates , china will likely have to raise them again if it is to keep its economy growing at a sustainable level , our correspondent says .
another headache for beijing last year was inflation .
despite its growing wealth , china still has a large number of poor people struggling with dramatic increases in the price of daily essentials such as pork , which jumped by 50 % .
inflation hit an 11-year year high in november .
thursday 's figures show that it fell back in december , although at 6.5 % it remains a worry .
the government has introduced a range of price controls recently aimed at bring the cost of ordinary goods , particularly food , under control .
dramatic price rises have led to social unrest in the past and beijing can not afford for its millions of poor to go hungry .

the investment , by the assembly government , local councils and private sector , aims to attract nearly a quarter of a million visitors a year .
projects include extending pontypool and blaenavon railway near big pit and restoring historic buildings .
but a business expert warned there might not be enough places for visitors to stay in the region overnight .
the strategy is designed to develop the tourist attractions that will attract not just day trips but also short breaks and activity holidays .
the welsh assembly government said this could unlock the tourism potential of the region .
under the plans , bedwellty house and park in tredegar , a former ironmaster 's residence , will be restored and upgraded , subject to public consultation .
a " contemporary garden " on the theme of " the environment and climate change " will be built on the former markham colliery site near blackwood .
cyfarthfa park in merthyr tydfil is to be established as an " activities and events venue " and the visitor centre at the dare valley country park , to the south of brecon beacons , will be upgraded .
deputy regeneration minister leighton andrews said he believed the tourism industry in the area was already worth more than £ 100m .
" we think this package overall , when we 've leveraged in the additional private investment , will contribute to probably about another 250 or 300 jobs in the area , specifically in tourism , " he said .
" what we think is that people need to understand that the valleys have changed radically , that they are green , that they offer wonderful outdoor activities but they also offer fantastic industrial heritage as well . "
bed shortages but dr calvin jones from the cardiff business school was worried the region might not be in a position to take full advantage of the new investment .
" if you can imagine a quarter of a million people staying in the valleys overnight - that 's where the really big hits come in terms of economic impact , " he said .
" and that 's the difficulty - finding the capacity to host all those visitors from the beginning to the end of their trip , rather than just making it an hour or two out of a longer trip elsewhere , where the big money is spent . "

the investment , by the assembly government , local councils and private sector , aims to attract nearly a quarter of a million visitors a year .
projects include extending pontypool and blaenavon railway near big pit and restoring historic buildings .
but a business expert warned there might not be enough places for visitors to stay in the region overnight .
the strategy is designed to develop the tourist attractions that will attract not just day trips but also short breaks and activity holidays .
the welsh assembly government said this could unlock the tourism potential of the region .
under the plans , bedwellty house and park in tredegar , a former ironmaster 's residence , will be restored and upgraded , subject to public consultation .
a " contemporary garden " on the theme of " the environment and climate change " will be built on the former markham colliery site near blackwood .
cyfarthfa park in merthyr tydfil is to be established as an " activities and events venue " and the visitor centre at the dare valley country park , to the south of brecon beacons , will be upgraded .
deputy regeneration minister leighton andrews said he believed the tourism industry in the area was already worth more than £ 100m .
" we think this package overall , when we 've leveraged in the additional private investment , will contribute to probably about another 250 or 300 jobs in the area , specifically in tourism , " he said .
" what we think is that people need to understand that the valleys have changed radically , that they are green , that they offer wonderful outdoor activities but they also offer fantastic industrial heritage as well . "

one of the youngest survivors of the holocaust , eva clarke , has been talking to groups in the hope that the lessons of the past will not be forgotten .
" i am here today because i am a survivor of the holocaust .
i am a survivor , but only just . "
this is how eva clarke begins her story to a group of school children at fermanagh county museum .
she was born in a concentration camp at mauthausen , austria on 29 april , 1945 .
talking for more than an hour , she shows family photographs including her parents ' wedding day and pictures of uncles , aunts and cousins smiling for the camera .
many of them , including her father , were killed in nazi concentration camps .
her mother anka bergmann hid her pregnancy from the guards at auschwitz-birkenau and later when she was transported to a labour camp .
becoming pregnant in a concentration camp was seen by the nazis as a crime punishable by death .
anka described herself as a " scarcely living pregnant skeleton " when she gave birth - weighing just five stone .
her baby weighed three pounds and was wrapped in newspapers .
three days later the camp was liberated by american troops .
as she recalls how her mother returned to prague to be reunited with her cousin , her voice begins to tremble .
" i tend to get upset about the happy things " , she says .
her mother remarried and they came to britain in 1948 as refugees and asylum seekers .
it 's a reminder to her audience that this is not just a history lesson , but a story that is relevant to issues that preoccupy us today .
the pupils listen to every word - one says afterwards that as she spoke the hairs on the back of his neck stood up .
she has been telling her story to groups for eight years .
she says she feels it 's her duty and she is happy to do it .
" to remember all those millions and millions who died , who were killed in the holocaust , who have never had one single person remember them because all their families were killed , all their communities were destroyed , " she said .
" the second reason is just to tell one survivor 's story because as many as there are survivors , there are that many different stories and they 're all unique .
" the third reason is to try to enable us all to learn the lessons of the holocaust which tragically as a human race we 're not doing brilliantly when you think about all the genocides that have happened since the war .
" to name but a few , cambodia , bosnia and today , now , this minute , what 's happening in darfur in the sudan .
" and the last reason is to try to counteract any form of racism , because what happened to my family happened to them only because they were jewish , for no other reason whatsoever .
" and racism starts in a very , very small way but the logical conclusion to racism is genocide . "
she says it takes a lot out of her : " i find it very emotionally and physically draining .
" emotionally draining because i am talking about my family , most of whom i never met , but nevertheless i feel i know them well and so , yes , i do find it very tiring . "
given the subject matter it is surprising that eva says her 's is a story with a happy ending .
last year her mother celebrated her 90th birthday .
" there 's definitely a happy ending for my mother and myself , you know , " she says .
" we 're here . "

her mother remarried and they came to britain in 1948 as refugees and asylum seekers .
it 's a reminder to her audience that this is not just a history lesson , but a story that is relevant to issues that preoccupy us today .
the pupils listen to every word - one says afterwards that as she spoke the hairs on the back of his neck stood up .
she has been telling her story to groups for eight years .
she says she feels it 's her duty and she is happy to do it .
" to remember all those millions and millions who died , who were killed in the holocaust , who have never had one single person remember them because all their families were killed , all their communities were destroyed , " she said .
" the second reason is just to tell one survivor 's story because as many as there are survivors , there are that many different stories and they 're all unique .
" the third reason is to try to enable us all to learn the lessons of the holocaust which tragically as a human race we 're not doing brilliantly when you think about all the genocides that have happened since the war .
anka survived the war but her husband did not " to name but a few , cambodia , bosnia and today , now , this minute , what 's happening in darfur in the sudan .
" and the last reason is to try to counteract any form of racism , because what happened to my family happened to them only because they were jewish , for no other reason whatsoever .
" and racism starts in a very , very small way but the logical conclusion to racism is genocide . "
she says it takes a lot out of her : " i find it very emotionally and physically draining .
" emotionally draining because i am talking about my family , most of whom i never met , but nevertheless i feel i know them well and so , yes , i do find it very tiring . "
given the subject matter it is surprising that eva says her 's is a story with a happy ending .
last year her mother celebrated her 90th birthday .
" there 's definitely a happy ending for my mother and myself , you know , " she says .
" we 're here . "

the gap between what japan exports and imports fell 20.9 % in december from a year earlier to 877.9bn yen -lrb- $ 8.2bn , £ 4.2bn -rrb- , the finance ministry said .
exports to china , the united states and europe all slowed in december , the figures showed .
but for 2007 as a whole the trade surplus rose 37 % , representing the first increase in three years .
the data also showed that china overtook the us to become japan 's biggest export market in 2007 .
us concerns " shipments to the united states will likely continue to be sluggish and those to eu could fall as there are some signs that the slowdown in the us economy is rippling out to europe , " said takeshi minami at norinchukin research institute .
" exports to asia remain firm , but if the us economy slows further , the impact on the region will be inevitable , " he added .
exports amount to about 15 % of japan 's gross domestic product .
december was the second month in a row that japan 's surplus has narrowed .

richard holbrooke has described the us policy as " spectacularly unsuccessful " .
the administration is " wasting " around $ 1bn annually on a programme which actually encourages farmers to support the taleban , he says .
according to the un office on drugs and crime , only 13 of afghanistan 's 34 provinces are " poppy free " .
the problem is specially acute in the unstable south of the country .
' ineffective ' writing a column in the washington post newspaper , mr holbrooke says mr bush 's vocal support in the last two years for aerial spraying of poppy fields highlighted what was wrong with the us policy .
mr bush 's remarks " are part of the story behind the spectacularly unsuccessful us counter-narcotics program in afghanistan " , he says .
mr bush backed down from backing aerial spraying because the afghan government and the international community argued it would " create a backlash against " kabul and washington .
" but even without aerial eradication , the programme , which costs $ 1bn a year , may be the single most ineffective programme in the history of american foreign policy , " mr holbrooke writes .
" it 's not just a waste of money .
it actually strengthens the taleban and al-qaeda , as well as criminal elements within afghanistan , " he writes .
with the taleban insurgency still raging , counter-narcotics teams in afghanistan have been unable to make any impact on the poppy problem in the south .
experts say stopping poppy production requires more than just laws .
the authorities have to also provide alternative livelihoods for the cultivators and build access to markets and education , among other things - things which are very difficult to deliver in an unstable environment .

there were more than 450 reported or attempted rapes last year .
the highest figure was in foyle where 40 assaults were reported last year , whilst 39 incidents were reported in south belfast .
dup assembly member for south belfast jimmy spratt called for tougher legislation to support victims of rape as well as a " robust action " by police .
he said the " clear-up rate is far too low in northern ireland " .
" that needs to dramatically increase , there are far too few cases coming to conviction and certainly that needs to change .
" it needs to be shown that the victim is being fully supported . "
the figures were released by justice minister paul goggins in response to a parliamentary question from dup mp nigel dodds .
' skilled personnel ' mr dodds said the figures were " quite disturbing " .
" we need to restore confidence in law and order .
as a society we need to get back to a point where the community has faith in our justice system , " he said .
mr goggins said the government was committed to improving the rates of successful prosecution in rape cases .
" specialist police units , staffed by highly skilled and trained personnel , are dedicated to enhancing the service to victims of rape and sexual assault , " he said .
" both psni and the public prosecution service are seeking to develop models of best investigative practice so that more offences can achieve the threshold for prosecution . "

that future may well be bleak , in spite of the shiny cars and trucks on display .
although no longer the major engine for growth in an economy increasingly powered by the service sector , the us automotive industry is still seen as a barometer of the economy 's health .
too bad , then , that its outlook is so gloomy .
" we 're really facing some challenging economic times , " says paul traub , senior manager , economics and industry analysis , chrysler llc .
" we 're in a more difficult time this year than what we may be feeling right now . "
double whammy economists representing the three us auto makers , general motors , ford and chrysler , agree that cars and trucks are getting cheaper .
" automotive vehicle prices are decisively in the negative territory , " laments ted chu , lead economist in global market and industry analysis at general motors .
" we do n't expect that situation to change drastically , given the intensive competition we have in the market place . "
selling cars and trucks , a category that includes pickups and sports utility vehicles , for less money is painful for the auto makers .
not least given the fact that the price cuts are doing little to boost sales , which are predicted to fall quite sharply this year to below 16 million units for the first time in years .
" our best guess is something around 16 million ; that would be around 15.7 million for light vehicles , " predicts ellen hughes-cromwick , director and chief economist at ford motor .
wealthy drivers in suburban detroit , car and truck dealers have seen it coming for some time .
the wealthiest fifth of the us population account for 40 % of spending on new vehicles the poorest fifth account for 5 % of the total spending on new cars and trucks toyota catches up with gm " michigan 's been a one-recession state for a while , " explains one local ford dealer who wants to remain anonymous , " so customers are a bit more cautious right now . "
" everything 's on their mind right now .
they 're worried about their -lsb- monthly -rsb- payments , they 're worried about their jobs . "
america 's so-called sub-prime crisis , which has led to falling house prices , is also weighing on sentiment .
" we think there 's a continued acceleration of mortgage defaults , " predicts mr traub .
this too is hitting sales , though again largely because it puts people off spending even if they have the cash .
after all , the ones that are hit the hardest by the sub-prime crisis are the poorest fifth of the population .
this group accounts for no more than 5 % of new car and truck sales , according to figures from ford .
in contrast , the richest fifth of the population accounts for 40 % of new vehicle sales .
nervous consumers " while there is intensive fear in the financial markets , fear itself does not generate a recession " ted chu , economist , general motors detroit 's desperate struggle you see it in the driveways in grosse pointe , a wealthy suburb to the east of detroit where expensive cars and suvs line the driveways : falling vehicle sales in the us do not necessarily mean that customers are running out of cash .
rather , weak sales are seen as a sign that many americans are becoming nervous about the future and therefore tightening their purse strings .
" the saying in the auto industry , " says mr traub , " is that it 's one thing to have money and another to be willing to part with that money , at least to commit to the purchase of a automobile . "
" the sentiment out there is getting hammered , " agrees ms hughes-cromwick , pointing to : the seizing up in the credit markets high and rising energy prices a long period of high food and rising food prices a very severe downturn in the housing market .
" food prices are growing well above 4 % and that is having an effect in terms of discretionary income , " ms hughes-cromwick observes .
and people are finding that " a larger percentage of their disposable income is going towards servicing their debt " as well as to put " heat in the house and gasoline in the tank " , adds mr traub .
in fact , us drivers currently spend more than 4 % of their wages on petrol , up from less than 2 % in 2001 , according to figures from gm .
consequently , concludes mr chu , they have " less money left to pay car loans and to spend on new vehicles " .
overly gloomy ?
during previous recessions , michigan has been ahead of the curve , recalls the detroit ford dealer .
in the past , he points out , the state has slid into recession earlier than the rest of the us , only to be the first to bounce back .
but he also acknowledges there are no guarantees that history will repeat itself .
indeed , the rest of the us may avoid a recession altogether , and the growing army of doomsayers may be wrong , points out gm 's mr chu .
" recession was predicted , as you may recall , back in 1998 , and going back to 2005 during the -lsb- hurricane -rsb- katrina crisis , " he says .
" economists have predicted about 13 recessions for the last three recessions .
" while there is intensive fear in the financial markets , fear itself does not generate a recession . "
during press preview days at the auto show last week , where chrysler 's cowboys drove a herd of texas longhorns down washington boulevard , the industry was clinging on to such optimistic sentiments .
this week , the american consumer can only hope the bulls will come out on top .

show visitors love to browse , but many are loath to buy that future may well be bleak , in spite of the shiny cars and trucks on display .
although no longer the major engine for growth in an economy increasingly powered by the service sector , the us automotive industry is still seen as a barometer of the economy 's health .
too bad , then , that its outlook is so gloomy .
" we 're really facing some challenging economic times , " says paul traub , senior manager , economics and industry analysis , chrysler llc .
" we 're in a more difficult time this year than what we may be feeling right now . "
double whammy economists representing the three us auto makers , general motors , ford and chrysler , agree that cars and trucks are getting cheaper .
" automotive vehicle prices are decisively in the negative territory , " laments ted chu , lead economist in global market and industry analysis at general motors .
" we do n't expect that situation to change drastically , given the intensive competition we have in the market place . "
selling cars and trucks , a category that includes pickups and sports utility vehicles , for less money is painful for the auto makers .
not least given the fact that the price cuts are doing little to boost sales , which are predicted to fall quite sharply this year to below 16 million units for the first time in years .
" our best guess is something around 16 million ; that would be around 15.7 million for light vehicles , " predicts ellen hughes-cromwick , director and chief economist at ford motor .
wealthy drivers in suburban detroit , car and truck dealers have seen it coming for some time .
the wealthiest fifth of the us population account for 40 % of spending on new vehicles the poorest fifth account for 5 % of the total spending on new cars and trucks toyota catches up with gm " michigan 's been a one-recession state for a while , " explains one local ford dealer who wants to remain anonymous , " so customers are a bit more cautious right now . "
" everything 's on their mind right now .
they 're worried about their -lsb- monthly -rsb- payments , they 're worried about their jobs . "
america 's so-called sub-prime crisis , which has led to falling house prices , is also weighing on sentiment .
" we think there 's a continued acceleration of mortgage defaults , " predicts mr traub .
this too is hitting sales , though again largely because it puts people off spending even if they have the cash .
after all , the ones that are hit the hardest by the sub-prime crisis are the poorest fifth of the population .
this group accounts for no more than 5 % of new car and truck sales , according to figures from ford .
in contrast , the richest fifth of the population accounts for 40 % of new vehicle sales .
nervous consumers while there is intensive fear in the financial markets , fear itself does not generate a recession ted chu , economist , general motors detroit 's desperate struggle you see it in the driveways in grosse pointe , a wealthy suburb to the east of detroit where expensive cars and suvs line the driveways : falling vehicle sales in the us do not necessarily mean that customers are running out of cash .
rather , weak sales are seen as a sign that many americans are becoming nervous about the future and therefore tightening their purse strings .
" the saying in the auto industry , " says mr traub , " is that it 's one thing to have money and another to be willing to part with that money , at least to commit to the purchase of a automobile . "
" the sentiment out there is getting hammered , " agrees ms hughes-cromwick , pointing to : the seizing up in the credit markets high and rising energy prices a long period of high food and rising food prices a very severe downturn in the housing market .
" food prices are growing well above 4 % and that is having an effect in terms of discretionary income , " ms hughes-cromwick observes .
and people are finding that " a larger percentage of their disposable income is going towards servicing their debt " as well as to put " heat in the house and gasoline in the tank " , adds mr traub .
in fact , us drivers currently spend more than 4 % of their wages on petrol , up from less than 2 % in 2001 , according to figures from gm .
consequently , concludes mr chu , they have " less money left to pay car loans and to spend on new vehicles " .
overly gloomy ?
during previous recessions , michigan has been ahead of the curve , recalls the detroit ford dealer .
america 's consumers can only hope the bulls , or optimists , are right in the past , he points out , the state has slid into recession earlier than the rest of the us , only to be the first to bounce back .
but he also acknowledges there are no guarantees that history will repeat itself .
