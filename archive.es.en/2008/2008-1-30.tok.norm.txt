afghan president karzai sees the proposed increase of troops in the country as unnecessary . a day after it was officially confirmed that nato had made a request to the german defense ministry to provide 250 combat troops to a quick reaction force in northern afghanistan , former nato chief of staff harald kujat warned that german soldiers were ill-equipped to deal with combat operations against the taliban and al qaeda insurgents . kujat , a former chairperson of nato 's military committee , deplored the lack of adequate hardware at the disposal of the german military and said on wednesday , jan .
30 , that bundeswehr troops " did not even have functioning devices , with which they could communicate with their allies in afghanistan . " nato submitted a formal request on tuesday for germany to provide a replacement for the 350-strong norwegian force that leaves in july after an initial inquiry had been made late last year . the german defense ministry confirmed earlier this month that it was considering whether to deploy the troops , responding to a media report that referred to a " new quality " in the german engagement in afghanistan . government officials have , however , in recent weeks denied that supplying a rapid reaction force would amount to sending men into combat .
they said the force was designed to provide emergency support to other troops in the north and that though its brief would include hunting " terrorists " and dealing with kidnappings this would not be its main task . inadequate equipment could cost lives bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : soldiers could be at risk from lack of equipment kujat called on german defense minister franz josef jung to prevent such a deployment as the inadequacy of german military equipment and lack of necessary supplies could lead to casualties , in addition to those which would come from engaging the enemy . he maintained that the soldiers themselves were well-trained and qualified to deal with the challenges of combat but the serious deficits in modern and efficient guidance systems and communication devices could negate their skills as soldiers . jung was in kabul for discussions with afghan president hamid karzai on tuesday , and made it clear that german soldiers were " ready to participate in operations against terrorists and cooperate with other international forces in any other part of the country . " reacting to the news that nato planned to send more troops to his country to counter the threat of a resurgent taliban back by supporters of al qaeda , karzai said training the afghan police and army was more important than sending more foreign troops to the country . karzai doubts wisdom of sending more troops bildunterschrift : president karzai advocated more investment in the afghan police and army " more than anything else , we need help to rebuild our human capital and our institutions , our army , our police force , our administrative structure , our judiciary and so on , " karzai told german newspaper die welt on wednesday . " although the situation has finally improved , the unintentional bombing of afghan civilians by nato and us troops is particularly painful , although it stems from a lack of ground troops , " he added .
" however , i am not sure that sending more troops is the right answer . " the western alliance already has around 37,000 troops deployed in the country .
nato commanders say they need some 7,500 extra troops to carry out their mission as they battle the taliban .
afghanistan 's army currently numbers 58,000 troops , with a target of 70,000 . karzai said he had the impression that the war " is not happening here , " but was being exported to afghanistan from other countries . " we should concentrate on the sanctuaries and the training camps , " he said .
" afghanistan is not a sanctuary .
it was one , but we have taken it back . " focus should shift to pakistan bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : taliban fighters are thought to be re-grouping in pakistan most concern focuses on the mountainous border area with pakistan , where afghan and western forces believe taliban extremists regroup to launch attacks in southern afghanistan . karzai said his recent meeting with pakistan 's under-pressure president pervez musharraf had been " very constructive . " " my hope is that pakistan will take harder and clearer measures in the future and thus becomes a region where extremism is no longer used as a political instrument , " he was quoted as saying .
" if pakistan takes a step in this direction , we in afghanistan will take many steps to support it . " dw staff -lrb- nda -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

michael ballack is the biggest german soccer star in years : success at home and abroad , captain of his country , immense wealth .
but has he done enough to be regarded as a legend should he retire at the tender age of 31 ? germans love their talismanic soccer players , especially those who can control games and lead with passion and by example .
germany 's soccer history is full of men who drove their nation towards greatness while sweeping all before them at club level .
most of them enjoyed hugely successful careers and finished their playing days having achieved everything , and in some cases more , than had been expected of them . michael ballack has always been expected to join the likes of beckenbauer , rummenigge , matthäus , et al. in the pantheon of german soccer greats .
ever since a young ballack first arrived on the professional soccer scene in 1995 , he has been spoken of in the most glowing of terms .
his destiny as a german legend has always been discussed in absolutes .
no one who has watched ballack 's rise has been anything other than convinced that he would become a german icon . so what , then , would all those observers make of news that ballack pack it in in a year 's time and end a career that has yet to reach the heights expected of it ? ballack hints at early retirement " what comes when my contract expires , we 'll just have to see , " british media have quoted him as saying .
" whether i stay another year , go somewhere else or hang up my boots - you never know in soccer . " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : ballack waxed lyrical about hanging up his boots in a year while the player himself has not actually confirmed that this statement , reported in his adopted homeland of the uk this week , is a sign of his impending retirement at the end of the 2008/2009 season , the mere fact that he has spoken of ending his career at the young age of 31 raises questions about ballack 's legacy . from those early days at fc chemnitzer , where his precocious , driving midfield performances led to a transfer to the bundesliga 's kaiserslautern and then leverkusen , through his trophy-laden days at bayern munich to his multi-million-euro move to chelsea , ballack has been reaching for the status and titles which would assure his place in germany 's history . trophy haul lacking international sparkle ballack has collected a fair haul of silverware in his time , picking up four bundesliga titles , three german cups and one league cup with bayern munich and an fa cup and league cup in england with chelsea .
but , one champions league runners-up medal aside , ballack has yet to make his stamp on european club soccer like those his legendary compatriots left behind . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the premiership has proved a real challenge to ballack if his career ends in the blue of chelsea , will observers look back and wonder whether ballack would have achieved more at , say , real madrid or either of the milan teams ? it was obvious in his first year in london that the premiership was a more brutal and quicker beast than the bundesliga he had been used to .
ballack 's clever eye and languid style may have flourished faster and with more confidence in the slower italian league and the spanish game may have suited his creative flair .
who knows what he could have achieved if he had moved to either country from bayern munich in 2006 ? ballack 's collection of consolation trophies away from the domestic and european scene , ballack has also been building a legacy on the international level .
since making his germany debut in 1999 , ballack has won 77 caps and scored 35 goals .
he has played in two world cup semi-finals - missing out on the 2002 world cup final through suspension - and one confederations cup semi-final .
he has led his country as captain since 2004 . and yet , for all the celebrations and plaudits , germany have not won an international tournament since the 1996 european championships .
ballack has led the side in some great victories but as yet , none of these victories resulted in a trophy -lsb- other than a third-place consolation -rsb- being lifted by the captain . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : can ballack end his international career with glory ?
so what would ballack be leaving behind in terms of a record if he were to retire in a year 's time ?
well , he could spend his free time polishing a clutch of german domestic trophies , a couple of english cups and a handful of reminders of some international near-misses .
but would this be enough to warrant his own pedestal in germany 's hall of fame ? compared with franz beckenbauer 's one world cup , one european championship and three european cups , rummenigge 's one european championship and two european cups , and matthäus with his one world cup and one european championship , ballack would struggle to make the list in terms of significant titles . ballack 's performances rate highly - but high enough ? trophies aside , could any of ballack 's individual performances stand out in much the same way as the kaiser 's mercurial domination of the 1974 world cup final , or the way matthäus outshone maradona in the 1990 final in rome ? bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : ballack 's performances in the 2002 world cup made him a star the closest would be his performances during the 2002 world cup - among his finest in a germany jersey .
it would not be an exaggeration to say ballack won the quarter and semi-finals for his country on his own , not only through his deciding goals but through his overall commitment .
again , would this be enough ? if ballack does retire without any further major honors to his name and a season of workmanlike performances behind him , he will forever be known as a " good " german player .

did germany 's experiment with democracy between 1919 and 1933 ever stand a real chance ?
eric weitz , a us historian and author , has the answers . on jan .
30 , 1933 , hitler was named german chancellor , spelling the end to the weimar republic - germany 's convulsive experiment with democracy between 1919 and 1933 .
the period was dubbed the " weimar republic " by historians in honor of the city of weimar , where a national assembly convened to write and adopt a new constitution for the german reich following the nation 's defeat in world war i. the weimar republic was marked on the one hand by hyperinflation , mass unemployment and political instability ; on the other , by dazzling creativity in the arts and sciences and a legendary nightlife in berlin . eric weitz , chairman of the history department at the university of minnesota in the united states , last year published an acclaimed book on the period : " weimar germany : promise and tragedy . "
dw-world.de spoke with him about the spirit of the time , the factors leading to the nazi seizure of power and the lessons to be drawn from the weimar republic . dw-world.de : one of the premises of your book is that the weimar republic should not be seen simply as a prelude to nazi dictatorship but as an era in its own right . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : weitz argues that the weimar republic should be valued in its own right eric weitz : it certainly should be seen as an era in its own right .
the weimar republic was a wonderfully creative period .
we should not constantly look back from the 12 years of the third reich to the 14 years of the weimar republic because the republic was a period of very important political , cultural and social innovation .
we need to remember and value it in its own right .
every issue about the weimar republic , about life in germany in the 1920s was intensely debated - both at the high intellectual and artistic level as well at the level of politics and society . how do you explain the cultural and artistic blossoming in germany , and particularly in berlin , in the 1920s ?
after all , this was a nation battered by war , with millions of dead , and plagued by hyperinflation and instability . the intense innovation of weimar is related precisely to these factors .
many people focus exclusively on the despair that came out of world war i. there was despair in abundance to be sure .
two million germans died in world war i , 4 million were wounded , and men who came back were often severely wounded , both physically and psychologically .
women at the home front during the war , experienced four years of intense privation .
and afterwards there came the post-war crisis - readjustment and hyperinflation . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : otto dix , who created this work in 1920 , was one of the prominent german artists of the weimar republic but to a certain extent , that intense instability of economy , society and politics fuelled this deep intellectual engagement with the problems of living in the modern age , of what should be germany 's political configuration .
but beyond that , the revolution of 1918/19 was crucial to this cultural efflorescence as well .
the revolution threw out the kaiser and established a democratic system - the most democratic system the germans had lived under to that point .
the spirit of revolution created a sense that the future was open , it was one of unbounded possibilities that it could be shaped in a more humanitarian way .
it could not last forever , but it 's that sense that underpins much of the cultural innovation of the republic . yet there were people in germany who hated the weimar republic .
who were they ?
and why did they want it to fail if it was so promising and attractive ? everything about the weimar republic was contested .
the kinds of artists , thinkers , architects whom i focus on in the book - much or all of their work was intensely challenged from the right .
by that i mean the establishment right - the old-line aristocrats , high government officials , army officers , businessmen , bankers , people from the church who by and large were not only anti-socialist and anti-communist but anti-democratic as well .
the revolution in 1918/19 left their powers intact by and large .
it established a political democracy but did not undermine at all the social situation and powers of this old-line conservative elite . that conservative elite , after the initial flurry of revolution , challenged the republic every step of the way .
many of the focal points of conflict were not just in the political sphere but in the cultural and social sphere as well .
there was , for example , the so-called " zehlendorf roof wars " in which conservatives , architects , and critics - nazis as well - claimed that the flat roofs of modern architectural style was distinctly un-german and true german architecture had pitched roofs .
these critics would charge that flat roofs were a form of jewish architecture .
the emancipation of women in the 1920s and very active talk of erotic fulfillment was another focal point of intense conflict . would you say the weimar republic was an early victim of globalization ?
do you think it would have survived if the great depression of 1929 had n't occurred ? the great depression was the final blow .
if we look at the economy and the election of 1928 just prior to the onset of the great depression , we can see a move back to the center politically and signs of serious economic progress .
this is the last year of the so-called fabled golden years of the republic .
without the depression , the republic would at least have had a chance .
it had managed to survive the hyperinflation of 1923 , as disruptive and disorienting as that event was .
but it was the depression that came from the united states to germany very fast and very strongly that certainly unleashed the final blow . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : hyperinflation in 1923 made german currency worthless and sparked an economic crisis at the same time we should not forget that few democracies have been founded in such difficult circumstances as the weimar republic .
the republic needed a long breathing space , it needed a more expansive and forgiving attitude on the part of the western allies , it needed economic stability and progress - all of that was in precious short supply in the post-world war i years . what led finally to the demise of democracy in the weimar republic ?
after all , in the 1928 general election , the nazis won just 2.6 percent of the vote ; five years later hitler was in power . it 's true , in 1928 , the nazi party was a marginal , unimportant political group which had very little resonance beyond some very distinctive places that were already in depression before the great depression - agricultural areas in particular .
but in many ways , the republic was seriously undermined and the political system paralyzed prior to the nazi seizure of power .
in a depression especially , people look for solutions and the republic was not offering any to the economic crisis .
from 1930 onwards , germany was governed under a presidential dictatorship because the political system was so fragmented that the reichstag could not assemble or function in parliamentary majority .
so the chancellor from spring of 1930 onwards , heinrich brüning and his successors , governed largely through emergency powers proclaimed by the president , field marshall paul von hindenburg . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the nazis never received a majority vote but i do want to underscore the fact that the nazis never received a majority vote in a popular , freely contested election .
in the summer of 1932 , they received 37.4 percent of the vote - the highest they would ever receive .
it 's a significant jump to be sure but that 's not a majority and the popular phrase that one hears so often in the united states , " the german people elected hitler to power or elected the nazis to power " - that 's wrong , it 's inaccurate , it 's untrue .
the nazis were never elected to power .
in the next election , in the fall of 1932 , they already lost a significant percentage of the support they had gained in the summer .
the nazi party was in disarray .
at the very end , they came to power because the establishment conservative elite , a coterie of powerful men around president hindenburg , handed power over to the nazis .
that alliance is what ultimately killed the republic . what lessons can be drawn from the weimar republic ?
implied throughout your book is the question of whether it is possible for contemporary democracies to succumb to neo-fascist forces in the same way that the weimar republic fell to the nazis . present day germany is a well-established democratic system .
it gives me no worries whatsoever .
to be sure there are some extreme right-wing groups that can be dangerous and the reaction against them is still a little slow sometimes .
but these groups are marginal and berlin is not weimar . my worries are more about my own country , the us , in the sense that the threats to democracy do n't always come from abroad .
the most dangerous threat may come from within .
that was certainly the case in weimar , especially in its last years .
what worries me is when certain people or institutions mouth talk of democracy but in reality undermine the very practices of democracy .
of course the nazis were never committed to democracy but they used the populist rhetoric that resonated with people .
when that kind of populist rhetoric masks undemocratic practices , that 's where i think we truly need to be concerned . the analogy that does worry me greatly is when establishment conservatives make radical conservatives salonfähig or in colloquial english " acceptable in polite society . "
i think to a certain extent that indeed has occurred in the united states .
when establishment conservatives go beyond the bounds of legitimate democratic discourse and constitutional provisions and make the program , the individuals and ideas of radical conservatives acceptable - that 's when we 're in trouble . in recent months , there seems to be a revival of interest in the weimar republic in the united states , whether it 's in fashion , art or music .

did germany 's experiment with democracy between 1919 and 1933 ever stand a real chance ?
eric weitz , a us historian and author , has the answers . on jan .
30 , 1933 , hitler was named german chancellor , spelling the end to the weimar republic - germany 's convulsive experiment with democracy between 1919 and 1933 .
the period was dubbed the " weimar republic " by historians in honor of the city of weimar , where a national assembly convened to write and adopt a new constitution for the german reich following the nation 's defeat in world war i. the weimar republic was marked on the one hand by hyperinflation , mass unemployment and political instability ; on the other , by dazzling creativity in the arts and sciences and a legendary nightlife in berlin . eric weitz , chairman of the history department at the university of minnesota in the united states , last year published an acclaimed book on the period : " weimar germany : promise and tragedy . "
dw-world.de spoke with him about the spirit of the time , the factors leading to the nazi seizure of power and the lessons to be drawn from the weimar republic . dw-world.de : one of the premises of your book is that the weimar republic should not be seen simply as a prelude to nazi dictatorship but as an era in its own right . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : weitz argues that the weimar republic should be valued in its own right eric weitz : it certainly should be seen as an era in its own right .
the weimar republic was a wonderfully creative period .
we should not constantly look back from the 12 years of the third reich to the 14 years of the weimar republic because the republic was a period of very important political , cultural and social innovation .
we need to remember and value it in its own right .
every issue about the weimar republic , about life in germany in the 1920s was intensely debated - both at the high intellectual and artistic level as well at the level of politics and society . how do you explain the cultural and artistic blossoming in germany , and particularly in berlin , in the 1920s ?
after all , this was a nation battered by war , with millions of dead , and plagued by hyperinflation and instability . the intense innovation of weimar is related precisely to these factors .
many people focus exclusively on the despair that came out of world war i. there was despair in abundance to be sure .
two million germans died in world war i , 4 million were wounded , and men who came back were often severely wounded , both physically and psychologically .
women at the home front during the war , experienced four years of intense privation .
and afterwards there came the post-war crisis - readjustment and hyperinflation . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : otto dix , who created this work in 1920 , was one of the prominent german artists of the weimar republic but to a certain extent , that intense instability of economy , society and politics fuelled this deep intellectual engagement with the problems of living in the modern age , of what should be germany 's political configuration .
but beyond that , the revolution of 1918/19 was crucial to this cultural efflorescence as well .
the revolution threw out the kaiser and established a democratic system - the most democratic system the germans had lived under to that point .
the spirit of revolution created a sense that the future was open , it was one of unbounded possibilities that it could be shaped in a more humanitarian way .
it could not last forever , but it 's that sense that underpins much of the cultural innovation of the republic . yet there were people in germany who hated the weimar republic .
who were they ?
and why did they want it to fail if it was so promising and attractive ? everything about the weimar republic was contested .
the kinds of artists , thinkers , architects whom i focus on in the book - much or all of their work was intensely challenged from the right .
by that i mean the establishment right - the old-line aristocrats , high government officials , army officers , businessmen , bankers , people from the church who by and large were not only anti-socialist and anti-communist but anti-democratic as well .
the revolution in 1918/19 left their powers intact by and large .
it established a political democracy but did not undermine at all the social situation and powers of this old-line conservative elite . that conservative elite , after the initial flurry of revolution , challenged the republic every step of the way .
many of the focal points of conflict were not just in the political sphere but in the cultural and social sphere as well .
there was , for example , the so-called " zehlendorf roof wars " in which conservatives , architects , and critics - nazis as well - claimed that the flat roofs of modern architectural style was distinctly un-german and true german architecture had pitched roofs .
these critics would charge that flat roofs were a form of jewish architecture .
the emancipation of women in the 1920s and very active talk of erotic fulfillment was another focal point of intense conflict . would you say the weimar republic was an early victim of globalization ?
do you think it would have survived if the great depression of 1929 had n't occurred ? the great depression was the final blow .
if we look at the economy and the election of 1928 just prior to the onset of the great depression , we can see a move back to the center politically and signs of serious economic progress .
this is the last year of the so-called fabled golden years of the republic .
without the depression , the republic would at least have had a chance .
it had managed to survive the hyperinflation of 1923 , as disruptive and disorienting as that event was .
but it was the depression that came from the united states to germany very fast and very strongly that certainly unleashed the final blow . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : hyperinflation in 1923 made german currency worthless and sparked an economic crisis at the same time we should not forget that few democracies have been founded in such difficult circumstances as the weimar republic .

michael ballack is the biggest german soccer star in years : success at home and abroad , captain of his country , immense wealth .
but has he done enough to be regarded as a legend should he retire at the tender age of 31 ? germans love their talismanic soccer players , especially those who can control games and lead with passion and by example .
germany 's soccer history is full of men who drove their nation towards greatness while sweeping all before them at club level .
most of them enjoyed hugely successful careers and finished their playing days having achieved everything , and in some cases more , than had been expected of them . michael ballack has always been expected to join the likes of beckenbauer , rummenigge , matthäus , et al. in the pantheon of german soccer greats .
ever since a young ballack first arrived on the professional soccer scene in 1995 , he has been spoken of in the most glowing of terms .
his destiny as a german legend has always been discussed in absolutes .
no one who has watched ballack 's rise has been anything other than convinced that he would become a german icon . so what , then , would all those observers make of news that ballack pack it in in a year 's time and end a career that has yet to reach the heights expected of it ? ballack hints at early retirement " what comes when my contract expires , we 'll just have to see , " british media have quoted him as saying .
" whether i stay another year , go somewhere else or hang up my boots - you never know in soccer . " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : ballack waxed lyrical about hanging up his boots in a year while the player himself has not actually confirmed that this statement , reported in his adopted homeland of the uk this week , is a sign of his impending retirement at the end of the 2008/2009 season , the mere fact that he has spoken of ending his career at the young age of 31 raises questions about ballack 's legacy . from those early days at fc chemnitzer , where his precocious , driving midfield performances led to a transfer to the bundesliga 's kaiserslautern and then leverkusen , through his trophy-laden days at bayern munich to his multi-million-euro move to chelsea , ballack has been reaching for the status and titles which would assure his place in germany 's history . trophy haul lacking international sparkle ballack has collected a fair haul of silverware in his time , picking up four bundesliga titles , three german cups and one league cup with bayern munich and an fa cup and league cup in england with chelsea .
but , one champions league runners-up medal aside , ballack has yet to make his stamp on european club soccer like those his legendary compatriots left behind . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the premiership has proved a real challenge to ballack if his career ends in the blue of chelsea , will observers look back and wonder whether ballack would have achieved more at , say , real madrid or either of the milan teams ? it was obvious in his first year in london that the premiership was a more brutal and quicker beast than the bundesliga he had been used to .
ballack 's clever eye and languid style may have flourished faster and with more confidence in the slower italian league and the spanish game may have suited his creative flair .
who knows what he could have achieved if he had moved to either country from bayern munich in 2006 ? ballack 's collection of consolation trophies away from the domestic and european scene , ballack has also been building a legacy on the international level .
since making his germany debut in 1999 , ballack has won 77 caps and scored 35 goals .
he has played in two world cup semi-finals - missing out on the 2002 world cup final through suspension - and one confederations cup semi-final .
he has led his country as captain since 2004 . and yet , for all the celebrations and plaudits , germany have not won an international tournament since the 1996 european championships .
ballack has led the side in some great victories but as yet , none of these victories resulted in a trophy -lsb- other than a third-place consolation -rsb- being lifted by the captain . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : can ballack end his international career with glory ?
so what would ballack be leaving behind in terms of a record if he were to retire in a year 's time ?
well , he could spend his free time polishing a clutch of german domestic trophies , a couple of english cups and a handful of reminders of some international near-misses .
but would this be enough to warrant his own pedestal in germany 's hall of fame ? compared with franz beckenbauer 's one world cup , one european championship and three european cups , rummenigge 's one european championship and two european cups , and matthäus with his one world cup and one european championship , ballack would struggle to make the list in terms of significant titles . ballack 's performances rate highly - but high enough ? trophies aside , could any of ballack 's individual performances stand out in much the same way as the kaiser 's mercurial domination of the 1974 world cup final , or the way matthäus outshone maradona in the 1990 final in rome ? bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : ballack 's performances in the 2002 world cup made him a star the closest would be his performances during the 2002 world cup - among his finest in a germany jersey .
it would not be an exaggeration to say ballack won the quarter and semi-finals for his country on his own , not only through his deciding goals but through his overall commitment .
again , would this be enough ? if ballack does retire without any further major honors to his name and a season of workmanlike performances behind him , he will forever be known as a " good " german player .
by prolonging his career past this hypothetical end-date and giving himself more opportunities to show what he can clearly do very well when the mood takes him , michael ballack could still be in with a chance of joining the greats . nick amies send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

no one who has watched ballack 's rise has been anything other than convinced that he would become a german icon . so what , then , would all those observers make of news that ballack pack it in in a year 's time and end a career that has yet to reach the heights expected of it ? ballack hints at early retirement " what comes when my contract expires , we 'll just have to see , " british media have quoted him as saying .
" whether i stay another year , go somewhere else or hang up my boots - you never know in soccer . " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : ballack waxed lyrical about hanging up his boots in a year while the player himself has not actually confirmed that this statement , reported in his adopted homeland of the uk this week , is a sign of his impending retirement at the end of the 2008/2009 season , the mere fact that he has spoken of ending his career at the young age of 31 raises questions about ballack 's legacy . from those early days at fc chemnitzer , where his precocious , driving midfield performances led to a transfer to the bundesliga 's kaiserslautern and then leverkusen , through his trophy-laden days at bayern munich to his multi-million-euro move to chelsea , ballack has been reaching for the status and titles which would assure his place in germany 's history . trophy haul lacking international sparkle ballack has collected a fair haul of silverware in his time , picking up four bundesliga titles , three german cups and one league cup with bayern munich and an fa cup and league cup in england with chelsea .
but , one champions league runners-up medal aside , ballack has yet to make his stamp on european club soccer like those his legendary compatriots left behind . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the premiership has proved a real challenge to ballack if his career ends in the blue of chelsea , will observers look back and wonder whether ballack would have achieved more at , say , real madrid or either of the milan teams ? it was obvious in his first year in london that the premiership was a more brutal and quicker beast than the bundesliga he had been used to .
ballack 's clever eye and languid style may have flourished faster and with more confidence in the slower italian league and the spanish game may have suited his creative flair .
who knows what he could have achieved if he had moved to either country from bayern munich in 2006 ? ballack 's collection of consolation trophies away from the domestic and european scene , ballack has also been building a legacy on the international level .
since making his germany debut in 1999 , ballack has won 77 caps and scored 35 goals .
he has played in two world cup semi-finals - missing out on the 2002 world cup final through suspension - and one confederations cup semi-final .
he has led his country as captain since 2004 . and yet , for all the celebrations and plaudits , germany have not won an international tournament since the 1996 european championships .
ballack has led the side in some great victories but as yet , none of these victories resulted in a trophy -lsb- other than a third-place consolation -rsb- being lifted by the captain . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : can ballack end his international career with glory ?
so what would ballack be leaving behind in terms of a record if he were to retire in a year 's time ?
well , he could spend his free time polishing a clutch of german domestic trophies , a couple of english cups and a handful of reminders of some international near-misses .
but would this be enough to warrant his own pedestal in germany 's hall of fame ? compared with franz beckenbauer 's one world cup , one european championship and three european cups , rummenigge 's one european championship and two european cups , and matthäus with his one world cup and one european championship , ballack would struggle to make the list in terms of significant titles . ballack 's performances rate highly - but high enough ? trophies aside , could any of ballack 's individual performances stand out in much the same way as the kaiser 's mercurial domination of the 1974 world cup final , or the way matthäus outshone maradona in the 1990 final in rome ? bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : ballack 's performances in the 2002 world cup made him a star the closest would be his performances during the 2002 world cup - among his finest in a germany jersey .
it would not be an exaggeration to say ballack won the quarter and semi-finals for his country on his own , not only through his deciding goals but through his overall commitment .
again , would this be enough ? if ballack does retire without any further major honors to his name and a season of workmanlike performances behind him , he will forever be known as a " good " german player .
by prolonging his career past this hypothetical end-date and giving himself more opportunities to show what he can clearly do very well when the mood takes him , michael ballack could still be in with a chance of joining the greats . nick amies send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

afghan president karzai sees the proposed increase of troops in the country as unnecessary . a day after it was officially confirmed that nato had made a request to the german defense ministry to provide 250 combat troops to a quick reaction force in northern afghanistan , former nato chief of staff harald kujat warned that german soldiers were ill-equipped to deal with combat operations against the taliban and al qaeda insurgents . kujat , a former chairperson of nato 's military committee , deplored the lack of adequate hardware at the disposal of the german military and said on wednesday , jan .
30 , that bundeswehr troops " did not even have functioning devices , with which they could communicate with their allies in afghanistan . " nato submitted a formal request on tuesday for germany to provide a replacement for the 350-strong norwegian force that leaves in july after an initial inquiry had been made late last year . the german defense ministry confirmed earlier this month that it was considering whether to deploy the troops , responding to a media report that referred to a " new quality " in the german engagement in afghanistan . government officials have , however , in recent weeks denied that supplying a rapid reaction force would amount to sending men into combat .
they said the force was designed to provide emergency support to other troops in the north and that though its brief would include hunting " terrorists " and dealing with kidnappings this would not be its main task . inadequate equipment could cost lives bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : soldiers could be at risk from lack of equipment kujat called on german defense minister franz josef jung to prevent such a deployment as the inadequacy of german military equipment and lack of necessary supplies could lead to casualties , in addition to those which would come from engaging the enemy . he maintained that the soldiers themselves were well-trained and qualified to deal with the challenges of combat but the serious deficits in modern and efficient guidance systems and communication devices could negate their skills as soldiers . jung was in kabul for discussions with afghan president hamid karzai on tuesday , and made it clear that german soldiers were " ready to participate in operations against terrorists and cooperate with other international forces in any other part of the country . " reacting to the news that nato planned to send more troops to his country to counter the threat of a resurgent taliban back by supporters of al qaeda , karzai said training the afghan police and army was more important than sending more foreign troops to the country . karzai doubts wisdom of sending more troops bildunterschrift : president karzai advocated more investment in the afghan police and army " more than anything else , we need help to rebuild our human capital and our institutions , our army , our police force , our administrative structure , our judiciary and so on , " karzai told german newspaper die welt on wednesday . " although the situation has finally improved , the unintentional bombing of afghan civilians by nato and us troops is particularly painful , although it stems from a lack of ground troops , " he added .
" however , i am not sure that sending more troops is the right answer . " the western alliance already has around 37,000 troops deployed in the country .
nato commanders say they need some 7,500 extra troops to carry out their mission as they battle the taliban .
afghanistan 's army currently numbers 58,000 troops , with a target of 70,000 . karzai said he had the impression that the war " is not happening here , " but was being exported to afghanistan from other countries . " we should concentrate on the sanctuaries and the training camps , " he said .
" afghanistan is not a sanctuary .
it was one , but we have taken it back . " focus should shift to pakistan bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : taliban fighters are thought to be re-grouping in pakistan most concern focuses on the mountainous border area with pakistan , where afghan and western forces believe taliban extremists regroup to launch attacks in southern afghanistan . karzai said his recent meeting with pakistan 's under-pressure president pervez musharraf had been " very constructive . " " my hope is that pakistan will take harder and clearer measures in the future and thus becomes a region where extremism is no longer used as a political instrument , " he was quoted as saying .
" if pakistan takes a step in this direction , we in afghanistan will take many steps to support it . " dw staff -lrb- nda -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

30 that the serbian province will declare its independence within days of this weekend 's serbian presidential elections , regardless of who wins the vote . " the developments in serbia do not have any influence on kosovo , " thaci , the leader of the ethnic albanian majority in the breakaway serbian province , told journalists after meeting with senior police officials .
" the independence of kosovo will happen in the next few days , regardless if tadic or nikolic wins . " reuters news agency reported wednesday , quoting unnamed sources , that kosovo would declare independence after the serbian presidential election on feb .
3 if the nationalist candidate tomislav nikolic wins . " if -lrb- tomislav -rrb- nikolic wins , it 's the 9th or 10th , " a senior political source said about the possible date of independence on condition of anonymity . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : tadic has the backing of the us and the european union a second source confirmed that if pro-western incumbent boris tadic wins the closely fought race , ethnic albanians in the breakaway province would be expected to wait at least another week , possibly declaring on feb .
17 . sunday 's presidential run-off pits hard-line serb nationalist nikolic against pro-western tadic .
analysts say the election , which could decide serbia 's attitude to the west after kosovo 's independence , will go all the way to the wire .
tadic 's two-point lead in recent polls is well within the statistical margin of error . independence backed by west , opposed by russia the plan by kosovo 's ethnic albanian leaders to make a unilateral declaration of independence is backed by the united states and most members of the european union .
serbia and its ally russia staunchly oppose any such move .
serbia and russia have warned of chaos in the fragile balkans if kosovo strikes out alone . the us and the major eu powers have been trying to coordinate a declaration of independence within their own timeframe , seeing no prospect of returning the 90-percent albanian majority to serb rule .
negotiations between the serbs and albanians ended in deadlock in december after nearly two years of fraught and often strained diplomacy . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : kosovo could move quickly should nikolic win the vote the west has been pursuing a delay to independence in a bid to shore up support for the pro-european tadic . should tadic win on sunday , the us and eu would want kosovo to hold off on a declaration until at least the end of the february in an attempt to help him control the inevitable political fallout from the loss of what many serbs regard as their religious heartland . if the hardliner nikolic wins , experts believe that kosovo would speed up its plans for independence in a bid to out-maneuver any move by the russian-backed candidate to intervene . nato braces for violent reaction to declaration fearing a violent reaction to kosovo 's apparently imminent declaration , nato 's 16,000-strong peace force has been put on alert for possible unrest while european union foreign ministers plan to discuss the deployment of a 1,800-strong police and justice mission to the province at a meeting on feb .

a subsequent german review revealed the country 's weight demographics .
now a new study shows the extent of the problem . germany is facing more of a challenge in the battle of the bulge than first thought , according to a new study on eating habits in the country .
the survey showed that more than half of all germans were too fat , with two-thirds of all men and 51 percent of women officially overweight .
but in another shocking revelation , the national consumption study has shown that 10 percent of german girls under 17 years of age were underweight and were not eating enough to remain healthy .
the study showed that the difference between the consumption of men and women was striking .
while almost one-third of 18- to 29-year-old men were overweight , every tenth young woman was too thin .
germans suffering from calorific ignorance bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : few germans realize how many calories they consume it also shows that the majority of germans have very little knowledge about what they eat and what effect the food has on their bodies .
only 10 percent of the interviewees had any idea how many calories they needed each day or how many they consumed .
the study 's figures were based on the body mass index -lrb- bmi -rrb- of an overweight person being between 25 and 30 .
this bmi is calculated by dividing an individual 's bodyweight by the square of their height .
the higher the bmi , the higher the risk that the person will develop an illness such as diabetes or heart disease .
a separate report in the stuttgarter zeitung newspaper stated that every fifth german had a bmi of over 30 .
over 20,000 germans between 14 and 80 took part in the national consumption study and divulged information on eating behavior , sporting activities , shopping practices and lifestyle .
studies show extent of challenge facing germany the last government survey on obesity in germany , taken last may , stated that around 37 million adults and around 2 million children in germany were overweight .
one-fourth of adult germans suffered from cardiovascular diseases , while there were around 4 million diabetics in the country .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : fat is no longer just a feminist issue one in five german women and one in seven men reportedly suffered from chronic back pain .
the annual costs of treating nutrition-related illnesses amounted to 70 billion euros -lrb- $ 95.3 billion -rrb- , which was 30 percent of germany 's overall health costs recorded at the time .
the government survey followed on from a similar one done by the international association for the study of obesity , in 2007 .
it found that among eu countries , germany had the most overweight women and men .
among adults , the study found that 58.9 percent of german women were overweight ; 75.4 percent of men tipped the scales .
beer , fatty foods and a lack of physical activity are the main culprits behind germans ' expanding waistlines , according to experts , and the rates of obese and overweight germans now match those of americans . dw staff -lrb- nda -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

afghan president karzai sees the proposed increase of troops in the country as unnecessary . a day after it was officially confirmed that nato had made a request to the german defense ministry to provide 250 combat troops to a quick reaction force in northern afghanistan , former nato chief of staff harald kujat warned that german soldiers were ill-equipped to deal with combat operations against the taliban and al qaeda insurgents . kujat , a former chairperson of nato 's military committee , deplored the lack of adequate hardware at the disposal of the german military and said on wednesday , jan .
30 , that bundeswehr troops " did not even have functioning devices , with which they could communicate with their allies in afghanistan . " nato submitted a formal request on tuesday for germany to provide a replacement for the 350-strong norwegian force that leaves in july after an initial inquiry had been made late last year . the german defense ministry confirmed earlier this month that it was considering whether to deploy the troops , responding to a media report that referred to a " new quality " in the german engagement in afghanistan . government officials have , however , in recent weeks denied that supplying a rapid reaction force would amount to sending men into combat .
they said the force was designed to provide emergency support to other troops in the north and that though its brief would include hunting " terrorists " and dealing with kidnappings this would not be its main task . inadequate equipment could cost lives bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : soldiers could be at risk from lack of equipment kujat called on german defense minister franz josef jung to prevent such a deployment as the inadequacy of german military equipment and lack of necessary supplies could lead to casualties , in addition to those which would come from engaging the enemy . he maintained that the soldiers themselves were well-trained and qualified to deal with the challenges of combat but the serious deficits in modern and efficient guidance systems and communication devices could negate their skills as soldiers . jung was in kabul for discussions with afghan president hamid karzai on tuesday , and made it clear that german soldiers were " ready to participate in operations against terrorists and cooperate with other international forces in any other part of the country . " reacting to the news that nato planned to send more troops to his country to counter the threat of a resurgent taliban back by supporters of al qaeda , karzai said training the afghan police and army was more important than sending more foreign troops to the country . karzai doubts wisdom of sending more troops bildunterschrift : president karzai advocated more investment in the afghan police and army " more than anything else , we need help to rebuild our human capital and our institutions , our army , our police force , our administrative structure , our judiciary and so on , " karzai told german newspaper die welt on wednesday . " although the situation has finally improved , the unintentional bombing of afghan civilians by nato and us troops is particularly painful , although it stems from a lack of ground troops , " he added .
" however , i am not sure that sending more troops is the right answer . " the western alliance already has around 37,000 troops deployed in the country .
nato commanders say they need some 7,500 extra troops to carry out their mission as they battle the taliban .
afghanistan 's army currently numbers 58,000 troops , with a target of 70,000 . karzai said he had the impression that the war " is not happening here , " but was being exported to afghanistan from other countries . " we should concentrate on the sanctuaries and the training camps , " he said .
" afghanistan is not a sanctuary .
it was one , but we have taken it back . " focus should shift to pakistan bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : taliban fighters are thought to be re-grouping in pakistan most concern focuses on the mountainous border area with pakistan , where afghan and western forces believe taliban extremists regroup to launch attacks in southern afghanistan . karzai said his recent meeting with pakistan 's under-pressure president pervez musharraf had been " very constructive . " " my hope is that pakistan will take harder and clearer measures in the future and thus becomes a region where extremism is no longer used as a political instrument , " he was quoted as saying .
" if pakistan takes a step in this direction , we in afghanistan will take many steps to support it . " dw staff -lrb- nda -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

" i will concentrate my efforts on trying to do this as quickly as possible , " the 74-year-old said on wednesday , jan 30 , after meeting with the president . after consulting leaders across the political spectrum , napolitano decided in favor of an interim government this week .
he has said that he wants the interim administration to change the electoral system , widely blamed for fueling italy 's political instability , before any new parliamentary elections . berlusconi eager for snap polls napolitano 's stance flies in the face of berlusconi 's argument that early elections are the only way out of the political deadlock . the leader of the forza italia party , as well as other conservative politicians , did not want the president to back a transitional government . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : berlusconi hopes to get back to power soon if snap polls are held berlusconi served as prime minister for five years - a record in postwar italy - and is eager to avenge his 2006 defeat to prodi .
he is likely to return to power if there is an early vote , according to recent polls showing the conservatives holding as much as a 10 percent lead over their rivals . " we believe there is no other way than returning to the polls and giving the country a government as soon as possible , a government that is immediately operational , " berlusconi said . italy 's latest political crisis erupted after prime minister romano prodi was forced to resign following the withdrawal of support by a centrist party in his center-left coalition .

afghan president karzai sees the proposed increase of troops in the country as unnecessary . a day after it was officially confirmed that nato had made a request to the german defense ministry to provide 250 combat troops to a quick reaction force in northern afghanistan , former nato chief of staff harald kujat warned that german soldiers were ill-equipped to deal with combat operations against the taliban and al qaeda insurgents . kujat , a former chairperson of nato 's military committee , deplored the lack of adequate hardware at the disposal of the german military and said on wednesday , jan .

" nato submitted a formal request on tuesday for germany to provide a replacement for the 350-strong norwegian force that leaves in july after an initial inquiry had been made late last year . the german defense ministry confirmed earlier this month that it was considering whether to deploy the troops , responding to a media report that referred to a " new quality " in the german engagement in afghanistan . government officials have , however , in recent weeks denied that supplying a rapid reaction force would amount to sending men into combat .
they said the force was designed to provide emergency support to other troops in the north and that though its brief would include hunting " terrorists " and dealing with kidnappings this would not be its main task . inadequate equipment could cost lives bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : soldiers could be at risk from lack of equipment kujat called on german defense minister franz josef jung to prevent such a deployment as the inadequacy of german military equipment and lack of necessary supplies could lead to casualties , in addition to those which would come from engaging the enemy . he maintained that the soldiers themselves were well-trained and qualified to deal with the challenges of combat but the serious deficits in modern and efficient guidance systems and communication devices could negate their skills as soldiers . jung was in kabul for discussions with afghan president hamid karzai on tuesday , and made it clear that german soldiers were " ready to participate in operations against terrorists and cooperate with other international forces in any other part of the country . " reacting to the news that nato planned to send more troops to his country to counter the threat of a resurgent taliban back by supporters of al qaeda , karzai said training the afghan police and army was more important than sending more foreign troops to the country . karzai doubts wisdom of sending more troops bildunterschrift : president karzai advocated more investment in the afghan police and army " more than anything else , we need help to rebuild our human capital and our institutions , our army , our police force , our administrative structure , our judiciary and so on , " karzai told german newspaper die welt on wednesday . " although the situation has finally improved , the unintentional bombing of afghan civilians by nato and us troops is particularly painful , although it stems from a lack of ground troops , " he added .
" however , i am not sure that sending more troops is the right answer . " the western alliance already has around 37,000 troops deployed in the country .
nato commanders say they need some 7,500 extra troops to carry out their mission as they battle the taliban .
afghanistan 's army currently numbers 58,000 troops , with a target of 70,000 . karzai said he had the impression that the war " is not happening here , " but was being exported to afghanistan from other countries . " we should concentrate on the sanctuaries and the training camps , " he said .

" " my hope is that pakistan will take harder and clearer measures in the future and thus becomes a region where extremism is no longer used as a political instrument , " he was quoted as saying .

" nato submitted a formal request on tuesday for germany to provide a replacement for the 350-strong norwegian force that leaves in july after an initial inquiry had been made late last year . the german defense ministry confirmed earlier this month that it was considering whether to deploy the troops , responding to a media report that referred to a " new quality " in the german engagement in afghanistan . government officials have , however , in recent weeks denied that supplying a rapid reaction force would amount to sending men into combat .
they said the force was designed to provide emergency support to other troops in the north and that though its brief would include hunting " terrorists " and dealing with kidnappings this would not be its main task . inadequate equipment could cost lives bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : soldiers could be at risk from lack of equipment kujat called on german defense minister franz josef jung to prevent such a deployment as the inadequacy of german military equipment and lack of necessary supplies could lead to casualties , in addition to those which would come from engaging the enemy . he maintained that the soldiers themselves were well-trained and qualified to deal with the challenges of combat but the serious deficits in modern and efficient guidance systems and communication devices could negate their skills as soldiers . jung was in kabul for discussions with afghan president hamid karzai on tuesday , and made it clear that german soldiers were " ready to participate in operations against terrorists and cooperate with other international forces in any other part of the country . " reacting to the news that nato planned to send more troops to his country to counter the threat of a resurgent taliban back by supporters of al qaeda , karzai said training the afghan police and army was more important than sending more foreign troops to the country . karzai doubts wisdom of sending more troops bildunterschrift : president karzai advocated more investment in the afghan police and army " more than anything else , we need help to rebuild our human capital and our institutions , our army , our police force , our administrative structure , our judiciary and so on , " karzai told german newspaper die welt on wednesday . " although the situation has finally improved , the unintentional bombing of afghan civilians by nato and us troops is particularly painful , although it stems from a lack of ground troops , " he added .
" however , i am not sure that sending more troops is the right answer . " the western alliance already has around 37,000 troops deployed in the country .
nato commanders say they need some 7,500 extra troops to carry out their mission as they battle the taliban .
afghanistan 's army currently numbers 58,000 troops , with a target of 70,000 . karzai said he had the impression that the war " is not happening here , " but was being exported to afghanistan from other countries . " we should concentrate on the sanctuaries and the training camps , " he said .

" " my hope is that pakistan will take harder and clearer measures in the future and thus becomes a region where extremism is no longer used as a political instrument , " he was quoted as saying .

michael ballack is the biggest german soccer star in years : success at home and abroad , captain of his country , immense wealth .
but has he done enough to be regarded as a legend should he retire at the tender age of 31 ? germans love their talismanic soccer players , especially those who can control games and lead with passion and by example .
germany 's soccer history is full of men who drove their nation towards greatness while sweeping all before them at club level .
most of them enjoyed hugely successful careers and finished their playing days having achieved everything , and in some cases more , than had been expected of them . michael ballack has always been expected to join the likes of beckenbauer , rummenigge , matthäus , et al. in the pantheon of german soccer greats .
ever since a young ballack first arrived on the professional soccer scene in 1995 , he has been spoken of in the most glowing of terms .
his destiny as a german legend has always been discussed in absolutes .
no one who has watched ballack 's rise has been anything other than convinced that he would become a german icon . so what , then , would all those observers make of news that ballack pack it in in a year 's time and end a career that has yet to reach the heights expected of it ? ballack hints at early retirement " what comes when my contract expires , we 'll just have to see , " british media have quoted him as saying .
" whether i stay another year , go somewhere else or hang up my boots - you never know in soccer . " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : ballack waxed lyrical about hanging up his boots in a year while the player himself has not actually confirmed that this statement , reported in his adopted homeland of the uk this week , is a sign of his impending retirement at the end of the 2008/2009 season , the mere fact that he has spoken of ending his career at the young age of 31 raises questions about ballack 's legacy . from those early days at fc chemnitzer , where his precocious , driving midfield performances led to a transfer to the bundesliga 's kaiserslautern and then leverkusen , through his trophy-laden days at bayern munich to his multi-million-euro move to chelsea , ballack has been reaching for the status and titles which would assure his place in germany 's history . trophy haul lacking international sparkle ballack has collected a fair haul of silverware in his time , picking up four bundesliga titles , three german cups and one league cup with bayern munich and an fa cup and league cup in england with chelsea .
but , one champions league runners-up medal aside , ballack has yet to make his stamp on european club soccer like those his legendary compatriots left behind . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the premiership has proved a real challenge to ballack if his career ends in the blue of chelsea , will observers look back and wonder whether ballack would have achieved more at , say , real madrid or either of the milan teams ? it was obvious in his first year in london that the premiership was a more brutal and quicker beast than the bundesliga he had been used to .
ballack 's clever eye and languid style may have flourished faster and with more confidence in the slower italian league and the spanish game may have suited his creative flair .
who knows what he could have achieved if he had moved to either country from bayern munich in 2006 ? ballack 's collection of consolation trophies away from the domestic and european scene , ballack has also been building a legacy on the international level .
since making his germany debut in 1999 , ballack has won 77 caps and scored 35 goals .
he has played in two world cup semi-finals - missing out on the 2002 world cup final through suspension - and one confederations cup semi-final .
he has led his country as captain since 2004 . and yet , for all the celebrations and plaudits , germany have not won an international tournament since the 1996 european championships .
ballack has led the side in some great victories but as yet , none of these victories resulted in a trophy -lsb- other than a third-place consolation -rsb- being lifted by the captain . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : can ballack end his international career with glory ?
so what would ballack be leaving behind in terms of a record if he were to retire in a year 's time ?
well , he could spend his free time polishing a clutch of german domestic trophies , a couple of english cups and a handful of reminders of some international near-misses .
but would this be enough to warrant his own pedestal in germany 's hall of fame ? compared with franz beckenbauer 's one world cup , one european championship and three european cups , rummenigge 's one european championship and two european cups , and matthäus with his one world cup and one european championship , ballack would struggle to make the list in terms of significant titles . ballack 's performances rate highly - but high enough ? trophies aside , could any of ballack 's individual performances stand out in much the same way as the kaiser 's mercurial domination of the 1974 world cup final , or the way matthäus outshone maradona in the 1990 final in rome ? bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : ballack 's performances in the 2002 world cup made him a star the closest would be his performances during the 2002 world cup - among his finest in a germany jersey .
it would not be an exaggeration to say ballack won the quarter and semi-finals for his country on his own , not only through his deciding goals but through his overall commitment .
again , would this be enough ? if ballack does retire without any further major honors to his name and a season of workmanlike performances behind him , he will forever be known as a " good " german player .
by prolonging his career past this hypothetical end-date and giving himself more opportunities to show what he can clearly do very well when the mood takes him , michael ballack could still be in with a chance of joining the greats . nick amies send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

30 that the serbian province will declare its independence within days of this weekend 's serbian presidential elections , regardless of who wins the vote . " the developments in serbia do not have any influence on kosovo , " thaci , the leader of the ethnic albanian majority in the breakaway serbian province , told journalists after meeting with senior police officials .
" the independence of kosovo will happen in the next few days , regardless if tadic or nikolic wins . " reuters news agency reported wednesday , quoting unnamed sources , that kosovo would declare independence after the serbian presidential election on feb .
3 if the nationalist candidate tomislav nikolic wins . " if -lrb- tomislav -rrb- nikolic wins , it 's the 9th or 10th , " a senior political source said about the possible date of independence on condition of anonymity . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : tadic has the backing of the us and the european union a second source confirmed that if pro-western incumbent boris tadic wins the closely fought race , ethnic albanians in the breakaway province would be expected to wait at least another week , possibly declaring on feb .
17 . sunday 's presidential run-off pits hard-line serb nationalist nikolic against pro-western tadic .
analysts say the election , which could decide serbia 's attitude to the west after kosovo 's independence , will go all the way to the wire .
tadic 's two-point lead in recent polls is well within the statistical margin of error . independence backed by west , opposed by russia the plan by kosovo 's ethnic albanian leaders to make a unilateral declaration of independence is backed by the united states and most members of the european union .
serbia and its ally russia staunchly oppose any such move .
serbia and russia have warned of chaos in the fragile balkans if kosovo strikes out alone . the us and the major eu powers have been trying to coordinate a declaration of independence within their own timeframe , seeing no prospect of returning the 90-percent albanian majority to serb rule .
negotiations between the serbs and albanians ended in deadlock in december after nearly two years of fraught and often strained diplomacy . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : kosovo could move quickly should nikolic win the vote the west has been pursuing a delay to independence in a bid to shore up support for the pro-european tadic . should tadic win on sunday , the us and eu would want kosovo to hold off on a declaration until at least the end of the february in an attempt to help him control the inevitable political fallout from the loss of what many serbs regard as their religious heartland . if the hardliner nikolic wins , experts believe that kosovo would speed up its plans for independence in a bid to out-maneuver any move by the russian-backed candidate to intervene . nato braces for violent reaction to declaration fearing a violent reaction to kosovo 's apparently imminent declaration , nato 's 16,000-strong peace force has been put on alert for possible unrest while european union foreign ministers plan to discuss the deployment of a 1,800-strong police and justice mission to the province at a meeting on feb .

did germany 's experiment with democracy between 1919 and 1933 ever stand a real chance ?
eric weitz , a us historian and author , has the answers . on jan .
30 , 1933 , hitler was named german chancellor , spelling the end to the weimar republic - germany 's convulsive experiment with democracy between 1919 and 1933 .
the period was dubbed the " weimar republic " by historians in honor of the city of weimar , where a national assembly convened to write and adopt a new constitution for the german reich following the nation 's defeat in world war i. the weimar republic was marked on the one hand by hyperinflation , mass unemployment and political instability ; on the other , by dazzling creativity in the arts and sciences and a legendary nightlife in berlin . eric weitz , chairman of the history department at the university of minnesota in the united states , last year published an acclaimed book on the period : " weimar germany : promise and tragedy . "
dw-world.de spoke with him about the spirit of the time , the factors leading to the nazi seizure of power and the lessons to be drawn from the weimar republic . dw-world.de : one of the premises of your book is that the weimar republic should not be seen simply as a prelude to nazi dictatorship but as an era in its own right . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : weitz argues that the weimar republic should be valued in its own right eric weitz : it certainly should be seen as an era in its own right .
the weimar republic was a wonderfully creative period .
we should not constantly look back from the 12 years of the third reich to the 14 years of the weimar republic because the republic was a period of very important political , cultural and social innovation .
we need to remember and value it in its own right .
every issue about the weimar republic , about life in germany in the 1920s was intensely debated - both at the high intellectual and artistic level as well at the level of politics and society . how do you explain the cultural and artistic blossoming in germany , and particularly in berlin , in the 1920s ?
after all , this was a nation battered by war , with millions of dead , and plagued by hyperinflation and instability . the intense innovation of weimar is related precisely to these factors .
many people focus exclusively on the despair that came out of world war i. there was despair in abundance to be sure .
two million germans died in world war i , 4 million were wounded , and men who came back were often severely wounded , both physically and psychologically .
women at the home front during the war , experienced four years of intense privation .
and afterwards there came the post-war crisis - readjustment and hyperinflation . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : otto dix , who created this work in 1920 , was one of the prominent german artists of the weimar republic but to a certain extent , that intense instability of economy , society and politics fuelled this deep intellectual engagement with the problems of living in the modern age , of what should be germany 's political configuration .
but beyond that , the revolution of 1918/19 was crucial to this cultural efflorescence as well .
the revolution threw out the kaiser and established a democratic system - the most democratic system the germans had lived under to that point .
the spirit of revolution created a sense that the future was open , it was one of unbounded possibilities that it could be shaped in a more humanitarian way .
it could not last forever , but it 's that sense that underpins much of the cultural innovation of the republic . yet there were people in germany who hated the weimar republic .
who were they ?
and why did they want it to fail if it was so promising and attractive ? everything about the weimar republic was contested .
the kinds of artists , thinkers , architects whom i focus on in the book - much or all of their work was intensely challenged from the right .
by that i mean the establishment right - the old-line aristocrats , high government officials , army officers , businessmen , bankers , people from the church who by and large were not only anti-socialist and anti-communist but anti-democratic as well .
the revolution in 1918/19 left their powers intact by and large .
it established a political democracy but did not undermine at all the social situation and powers of this old-line conservative elite . that conservative elite , after the initial flurry of revolution , challenged the republic every step of the way .
many of the focal points of conflict were not just in the political sphere but in the cultural and social sphere as well .
there was , for example , the so-called " zehlendorf roof wars " in which conservatives , architects , and critics - nazis as well - claimed that the flat roofs of modern architectural style was distinctly un-german and true german architecture had pitched roofs .
these critics would charge that flat roofs were a form of jewish architecture .
the emancipation of women in the 1920s and very active talk of erotic fulfillment was another focal point of intense conflict . would you say the weimar republic was an early victim of globalization ?
do you think it would have survived if the great depression of 1929 had n't occurred ? the great depression was the final blow .
if we look at the economy and the election of 1928 just prior to the onset of the great depression , we can see a move back to the center politically and signs of serious economic progress .
this is the last year of the so-called fabled golden years of the republic .
without the depression , the republic would at least have had a chance .
it had managed to survive the hyperinflation of 1923 , as disruptive and disorienting as that event was .
but it was the depression that came from the united states to germany very fast and very strongly that certainly unleashed the final blow . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : hyperinflation in 1923 made german currency worthless and sparked an economic crisis at the same time we should not forget that few democracies have been founded in such difficult circumstances as the weimar republic .
the republic needed a long breathing space , it needed a more expansive and forgiving attitude on the part of the western allies , it needed economic stability and progress - all of that was in precious short supply in the post-world war i years . what led finally to the demise of democracy in the weimar republic ?
after all , in the 1928 general election , the nazis won just 2.6 percent of the vote ; five years later hitler was in power . it 's true , in 1928 , the nazi party was a marginal , unimportant political group which had very little resonance beyond some very distinctive places that were already in depression before the great depression - agricultural areas in particular .
but in many ways , the republic was seriously undermined and the political system paralyzed prior to the nazi seizure of power .
in a depression especially , people look for solutions and the republic was not offering any to the economic crisis .
from 1930 onwards , germany was governed under a presidential dictatorship because the political system was so fragmented that the reichstag could not assemble or function in parliamentary majority .
so the chancellor from spring of 1930 onwards , heinrich brüning and his successors , governed largely through emergency powers proclaimed by the president , field marshall paul von hindenburg . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the nazis never received a majority vote but i do want to underscore the fact that the nazis never received a majority vote in a popular , freely contested election .
in the summer of 1932 , they received 37.4 percent of the vote - the highest they would ever receive .
it 's a significant jump to be sure but that 's not a majority and the popular phrase that one hears so often in the united states , " the german people elected hitler to power or elected the nazis to power " - that 's wrong , it 's inaccurate , it 's untrue .
the nazis were never elected to power .
in the next election , in the fall of 1932 , they already lost a significant percentage of the support they had gained in the summer .
the nazi party was in disarray .
at the very end , they came to power because the establishment conservative elite , a coterie of powerful men around president hindenburg , handed power over to the nazis .
that alliance is what ultimately killed the republic . what lessons can be drawn from the weimar republic ?
implied throughout your book is the question of whether it is possible for contemporary democracies to succumb to neo-fascist forces in the same way that the weimar republic fell to the nazis . present day germany is a well-established democratic system .
it gives me no worries whatsoever .
to be sure there are some extreme right-wing groups that can be dangerous and the reaction against them is still a little slow sometimes .
but these groups are marginal and berlin is not weimar . my worries are more about my own country , the us , in the sense that the threats to democracy do n't always come from abroad .
the most dangerous threat may come from within .
that was certainly the case in weimar , especially in its last years .
what worries me is when certain people or institutions mouth talk of democracy but in reality undermine the very practices of democracy .
of course the nazis were never committed to democracy but they used the populist rhetoric that resonated with people .
when that kind of populist rhetoric masks undemocratic practices , that 's where i think we truly need to be concerned . the analogy that does worry me greatly is when establishment conservatives make radical conservatives salonfähig or in colloquial english " acceptable in polite society . "
i think to a certain extent that indeed has occurred in the united states .
when establishment conservatives go beyond the bounds of legitimate democratic discourse and constitutional provisions and make the program , the individuals and ideas of radical conservatives acceptable - that 's when we 're in trouble . in recent months , there seems to be a revival of interest in the weimar republic in the united states , whether it 's in fashion , art or music .
how do you explain that ? bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : a 1922 work by george grosz it 's been most curious .
and it 's true especially in new york .
i think it has to do with the sense of fragility that comes out of the sept .
11 attacks .
what people adopt is the weimar republic as portrayed in the american production of " cabaret " for example - there 's a vision of weimar as degenerate , as crisis-ridden all of which is true in part .
there was an exhibit at the metropolitan museum on weimar portraiture featuring otto dix und george grosz .
of course , if that 's all you know , you think of weimar as a period of only mutilated bodies and distorted features .
but what that interpretation misses of course is the democratic promise , the cultural innovation .
but it is that sense of fragility that has given weimar this glow in downtown as well as uptown new york culture . interview : sonia phalnikar send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

but beyond that , the revolution of 1918/19 was crucial to this cultural efflorescence as well .
the revolution threw out the kaiser and established a democratic system - the most democratic system the germans had lived under to that point .
the spirit of revolution created a sense that the future was open , it was one of unbounded possibilities that it could be shaped in a more humanitarian way .
it could not last forever , but it 's that sense that underpins much of the cultural innovation of the republic . yet there were people in germany who hated the weimar republic .
who were they ?
and why did they want it to fail if it was so promising and attractive ? everything about the weimar republic was contested .
the kinds of artists , thinkers , architects whom i focus on in the book - much or all of their work was intensely challenged from the right .
by that i mean the establishment right - the old-line aristocrats , high government officials , army officers , businessmen , bankers , people from the church who by and large were not only anti-socialist and anti-communist but anti-democratic as well .
the revolution in 1918/19 left their powers intact by and large .
it established a political democracy but did not undermine at all the social situation and powers of this old-line conservative elite . that conservative elite , after the initial flurry of revolution , challenged the republic every step of the way .
many of the focal points of conflict were not just in the political sphere but in the cultural and social sphere as well .
there was , for example , the so-called " zehlendorf roof wars " in which conservatives , architects , and critics - nazis as well - claimed that the flat roofs of modern architectural style was distinctly un-german and true german architecture had pitched roofs .
these critics would charge that flat roofs were a form of jewish architecture .
the emancipation of women in the 1920s and very active talk of erotic fulfillment was another focal point of intense conflict . would you say the weimar republic was an early victim of globalization ?
do you think it would have survived if the great depression of 1929 had n't occurred ? the great depression was the final blow .
if we look at the economy and the election of 1928 just prior to the onset of the great depression , we can see a move back to the center politically and signs of serious economic progress .
this is the last year of the so-called fabled golden years of the republic .
without the depression , the republic would at least have had a chance .
it had managed to survive the hyperinflation of 1923 , as disruptive and disorienting as that event was .
but it was the depression that came from the united states to germany very fast and very strongly that certainly unleashed the final blow . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : hyperinflation in 1923 made german currency worthless and sparked an economic crisis at the same time we should not forget that few democracies have been founded in such difficult circumstances as the weimar republic .
the republic needed a long breathing space , it needed a more expansive and forgiving attitude on the part of the western allies , it needed economic stability and progress - all of that was in precious short supply in the post-world war i years . what led finally to the demise of democracy in the weimar republic ?
after all , in the 1928 general election , the nazis won just 2.6 percent of the vote ; five years later hitler was in power . it 's true , in 1928 , the nazi party was a marginal , unimportant political group which had very little resonance beyond some very distinctive places that were already in depression before the great depression - agricultural areas in particular .
but in many ways , the republic was seriously undermined and the political system paralyzed prior to the nazi seizure of power .
in a depression especially , people look for solutions and the republic was not offering any to the economic crisis .
from 1930 onwards , germany was governed under a presidential dictatorship because the political system was so fragmented that the reichstag could not assemble or function in parliamentary majority .
so the chancellor from spring of 1930 onwards , heinrich brüning and his successors , governed largely through emergency powers proclaimed by the president , field marshall paul von hindenburg . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the nazis never received a majority vote but i do want to underscore the fact that the nazis never received a majority vote in a popular , freely contested election .
in the summer of 1932 , they received 37.4 percent of the vote - the highest they would ever receive .
it 's a significant jump to be sure but that 's not a majority and the popular phrase that one hears so often in the united states , " the german people elected hitler to power or elected the nazis to power " - that 's wrong , it 's inaccurate , it 's untrue .
the nazis were never elected to power .
in the next election , in the fall of 1932 , they already lost a significant percentage of the support they had gained in the summer .
the nazi party was in disarray .
at the very end , they came to power because the establishment conservative elite , a coterie of powerful men around president hindenburg , handed power over to the nazis .
that alliance is what ultimately killed the republic . what lessons can be drawn from the weimar republic ?
implied throughout your book is the question of whether it is possible for contemporary democracies to succumb to neo-fascist forces in the same way that the weimar republic fell to the nazis . present day germany is a well-established democratic system .
it gives me no worries whatsoever .
to be sure there are some extreme right-wing groups that can be dangerous and the reaction against them is still a little slow sometimes .
but these groups are marginal and berlin is not weimar . my worries are more about my own country , the us , in the sense that the threats to democracy do n't always come from abroad .
the most dangerous threat may come from within .
that was certainly the case in weimar , especially in its last years .
what worries me is when certain people or institutions mouth talk of democracy but in reality undermine the very practices of democracy .
of course the nazis were never committed to democracy but they used the populist rhetoric that resonated with people .
when that kind of populist rhetoric masks undemocratic practices , that 's where i think we truly need to be concerned . the analogy that does worry me greatly is when establishment conservatives make radical conservatives salonfähig or in colloquial english " acceptable in polite society . "
i think to a certain extent that indeed has occurred in the united states .
when establishment conservatives go beyond the bounds of legitimate democratic discourse and constitutional provisions and make the program , the individuals and ideas of radical conservatives acceptable - that 's when we 're in trouble . in recent months , there seems to be a revival of interest in the weimar republic in the united states , whether it 's in fashion , art or music .
how do you explain that ? bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : a 1922 work by george grosz it 's been most curious .
and it 's true especially in new york .
i think it has to do with the sense of fragility that comes out of the sept .
11 attacks .
what people adopt is the weimar republic as portrayed in the american production of " cabaret " for example - there 's a vision of weimar as degenerate , as crisis-ridden all of which is true in part .
there was an exhibit at the metropolitan museum on weimar portraiture featuring otto dix und george grosz .
of course , if that 's all you know , you think of weimar as a period of only mutilated bodies and distorted features .
but what that interpretation misses of course is the democratic promise , the cultural innovation .
but it is that sense of fragility that has given weimar this glow in downtown as well as uptown new york culture . interview : sonia phalnikar send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

did germany 's experiment with democracy between 1919 and 1933 ever stand a real chance ?
eric weitz , a us historian and author , has the answers . on jan .
30 , 1933 , hitler was named german chancellor , spelling the end to the weimar republic - germany 's convulsive experiment with democracy between 1919 and 1933 .
the period was dubbed the " weimar republic " by historians in honor of the city of weimar , where a national assembly convened to write and adopt a new constitution for the german reich following the nation 's defeat in world war i. the weimar republic was marked on the one hand by hyperinflation , mass unemployment and political instability ; on the other , by dazzling creativity in the arts and sciences and a legendary nightlife in berlin . eric weitz , chairman of the history department at the university of minnesota in the united states , last year published an acclaimed book on the period : " weimar germany : promise and tragedy . "
dw-world.de spoke with him about the spirit of the time , the factors leading to the nazi seizure of power and the lessons to be drawn from the weimar republic . dw-world.de : one of the premises of your book is that the weimar republic should not be seen simply as a prelude to nazi dictatorship but as an era in its own right . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : weitz argues that the weimar republic should be valued in its own right eric weitz : it certainly should be seen as an era in its own right .
the weimar republic was a wonderfully creative period .
we should not constantly look back from the 12 years of the third reich to the 14 years of the weimar republic because the republic was a period of very important political , cultural and social innovation .
we need to remember and value it in its own right .
every issue about the weimar republic , about life in germany in the 1920s was intensely debated - both at the high intellectual and artistic level as well at the level of politics and society . how do you explain the cultural and artistic blossoming in germany , and particularly in berlin , in the 1920s ?
after all , this was a nation battered by war , with millions of dead , and plagued by hyperinflation and instability . the intense innovation of weimar is related precisely to these factors .
many people focus exclusively on the despair that came out of world war i. there was despair in abundance to be sure .
two million germans died in world war i , 4 million were wounded , and men who came back were often severely wounded , both physically and psychologically .
women at the home front during the war , experienced four years of intense privation .
and afterwards there came the post-war crisis - readjustment and hyperinflation . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : otto dix , who created this work in 1920 , was one of the prominent german artists of the weimar republic but to a certain extent , that intense instability of economy , society and politics fuelled this deep intellectual engagement with the problems of living in the modern age , of what should be germany 's political configuration .
but beyond that , the revolution of 1918/19 was crucial to this cultural efflorescence as well .
the revolution threw out the kaiser and established a democratic system - the most democratic system the germans had lived under to that point .
the spirit of revolution created a sense that the future was open , it was one of unbounded possibilities that it could be shaped in a more humanitarian way .
it could not last forever , but it 's that sense that underpins much of the cultural innovation of the republic . yet there were people in germany who hated the weimar republic .
who were they ?
and why did they want it to fail if it was so promising and attractive ? everything about the weimar republic was contested .
the kinds of artists , thinkers , architects whom i focus on in the book - much or all of their work was intensely challenged from the right .
by that i mean the establishment right - the old-line aristocrats , high government officials , army officers , businessmen , bankers , people from the church who by and large were not only anti-socialist and anti-communist but anti-democratic as well .

it established a political democracy but did not undermine at all the social situation and powers of this old-line conservative elite . that conservative elite , after the initial flurry of revolution , challenged the republic every step of the way .

implied throughout your book is the question of whether it is possible for contemporary democracies to succumb to neo-fascist forces in the same way that the weimar republic fell to the nazis . present day germany is a well-established democratic system .
it gives me no worries whatsoever .
to be sure there are some extreme right-wing groups that can be dangerous and the reaction against them is still a little slow sometimes .
but these groups are marginal and berlin is not weimar . my worries are more about my own country , the us , in the sense that the threats to democracy do n't always come from abroad .
the most dangerous threat may come from within .
that was certainly the case in weimar , especially in its last years .
what worries me is when certain people or institutions mouth talk of democracy but in reality undermine the very practices of democracy .
of course the nazis were never committed to democracy but they used the populist rhetoric that resonated with people .
when that kind of populist rhetoric masks undemocratic practices , that 's where i think we truly need to be concerned . the analogy that does worry me greatly is when establishment conservatives make radical conservatives salonfähig or in colloquial english " acceptable in polite society . "

did germany 's experiment with democracy between 1919 and 1933 ever stand a real chance ?
eric weitz , a us historian and author , has the answers . on jan .
30 , 1933 , hitler was named german chancellor , spelling the end to the weimar republic - germany 's convulsive experiment with democracy between 1919 and 1933 .
the period was dubbed the " weimar republic " by historians in honor of the city of weimar , where a national assembly convened to write and adopt a new constitution for the german reich following the nation 's defeat in world war i. the weimar republic was marked on the one hand by hyperinflation , mass unemployment and political instability ; on the other , by dazzling creativity in the arts and sciences and a legendary nightlife in berlin . eric weitz , chairman of the history department at the university of minnesota in the united states , last year published an acclaimed book on the period : " weimar germany : promise and tragedy . "
dw-world.de spoke with him about the spirit of the time , the factors leading to the nazi seizure of power and the lessons to be drawn from the weimar republic . dw-world.de : one of the premises of your book is that the weimar republic should not be seen simply as a prelude to nazi dictatorship but as an era in its own right . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : weitz argues that the weimar republic should be valued in its own right eric weitz : it certainly should be seen as an era in its own right .
the weimar republic was a wonderfully creative period .
we should not constantly look back from the 12 years of the third reich to the 14 years of the weimar republic because the republic was a period of very important political , cultural and social innovation .
we need to remember and value it in its own right .
every issue about the weimar republic , about life in germany in the 1920s was intensely debated - both at the high intellectual and artistic level as well at the level of politics and society . how do you explain the cultural and artistic blossoming in germany , and particularly in berlin , in the 1920s ?
after all , this was a nation battered by war , with millions of dead , and plagued by hyperinflation and instability . the intense innovation of weimar is related precisely to these factors .
many people focus exclusively on the despair that came out of world war i. there was despair in abundance to be sure .
two million germans died in world war i , 4 million were wounded , and men who came back were often severely wounded , both physically and psychologically .
women at the home front during the war , experienced four years of intense privation .
and afterwards there came the post-war crisis - readjustment and hyperinflation . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : otto dix , who created this work in 1920 , was one of the prominent german artists of the weimar republic but to a certain extent , that intense instability of economy , society and politics fuelled this deep intellectual engagement with the problems of living in the modern age , of what should be germany 's political configuration .
but beyond that , the revolution of 1918/19 was crucial to this cultural efflorescence as well .
the revolution threw out the kaiser and established a democratic system - the most democratic system the germans had lived under to that point .
the spirit of revolution created a sense that the future was open , it was one of unbounded possibilities that it could be shaped in a more humanitarian way .
it could not last forever , but it 's that sense that underpins much of the cultural innovation of the republic . yet there were people in germany who hated the weimar republic .
who were they ?
and why did they want it to fail if it was so promising and attractive ? everything about the weimar republic was contested .
the kinds of artists , thinkers , architects whom i focus on in the book - much or all of their work was intensely challenged from the right .
by that i mean the establishment right - the old-line aristocrats , high government officials , army officers , businessmen , bankers , people from the church who by and large were not only anti-socialist and anti-communist but anti-democratic as well .
the revolution in 1918/19 left their powers intact by and large .
it established a political democracy but did not undermine at all the social situation and powers of this old-line conservative elite . that conservative elite , after the initial flurry of revolution , challenged the republic every step of the way .
many of the focal points of conflict were not just in the political sphere but in the cultural and social sphere as well .
there was , for example , the so-called " zehlendorf roof wars " in which conservatives , architects , and critics - nazis as well - claimed that the flat roofs of modern architectural style was distinctly un-german and true german architecture had pitched roofs .
these critics would charge that flat roofs were a form of jewish architecture .
the emancipation of women in the 1920s and very active talk of erotic fulfillment was another focal point of intense conflict . would you say the weimar republic was an early victim of globalization ?
do you think it would have survived if the great depression of 1929 had n't occurred ? the great depression was the final blow .
if we look at the economy and the election of 1928 just prior to the onset of the great depression , we can see a move back to the center politically and signs of serious economic progress .
this is the last year of the so-called fabled golden years of the republic .
without the depression , the republic would at least have had a chance .
it had managed to survive the hyperinflation of 1923 , as disruptive and disorienting as that event was .
but it was the depression that came from the united states to germany very fast and very strongly that certainly unleashed the final blow . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : hyperinflation in 1923 made german currency worthless and sparked an economic crisis at the same time we should not forget that few democracies have been founded in such difficult circumstances as the weimar republic .
the republic needed a long breathing space , it needed a more expansive and forgiving attitude on the part of the western allies , it needed economic stability and progress - all of that was in precious short supply in the post-world war i years . what led finally to the demise of democracy in the weimar republic ?
after all , in the 1928 general election , the nazis won just 2.6 percent of the vote ; five years later hitler was in power . it 's true , in 1928 , the nazi party was a marginal , unimportant political group which had very little resonance beyond some very distinctive places that were already in depression before the great depression - agricultural areas in particular .
but in many ways , the republic was seriously undermined and the political system paralyzed prior to the nazi seizure of power .
in a depression especially , people look for solutions and the republic was not offering any to the economic crisis .
from 1930 onwards , germany was governed under a presidential dictatorship because the political system was so fragmented that the reichstag could not assemble or function in parliamentary majority .
so the chancellor from spring of 1930 onwards , heinrich brüning and his successors , governed largely through emergency powers proclaimed by the president , field marshall paul von hindenburg . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the nazis never received a majority vote but i do want to underscore the fact that the nazis never received a majority vote in a popular , freely contested election .
in the summer of 1932 , they received 37.4 percent of the vote - the highest they would ever receive .
it 's a significant jump to be sure but that 's not a majority and the popular phrase that one hears so often in the united states , " the german people elected hitler to power or elected the nazis to power " - that 's wrong , it 's inaccurate , it 's untrue .
the nazis were never elected to power .
in the next election , in the fall of 1932 , they already lost a significant percentage of the support they had gained in the summer .
the nazi party was in disarray .
at the very end , they came to power because the establishment conservative elite , a coterie of powerful men around president hindenburg , handed power over to the nazis .
that alliance is what ultimately killed the republic . what lessons can be drawn from the weimar republic ?

a subsequent german review revealed the country 's weight demographics .
now a new study shows the extent of the problem . germany is facing more of a challenge in the battle of the bulge than first thought , according to a new study on eating habits in the country .
the survey showed that more than half of all germans were too fat , with two-thirds of all men and 51 percent of women officially overweight .
but in another shocking revelation , the national consumption study has shown that 10 percent of german girls under 17 years of age were underweight and were not eating enough to remain healthy .

the government survey followed on from a similar one done by the international association for the study of obesity , in 2007 .
it found that among eu countries , germany had the most overweight women and men .
among adults , the study found that 58.9 percent of german women were overweight ; 75.4 percent of men tipped the scales .

a subsequent german review revealed the country 's weight demographics .
now a new study shows the extent of the problem . germany is facing more of a challenge in the battle of the bulge than first thought , according to a new study on eating habits in the country .
the survey showed that more than half of all germans were too fat , with two-thirds of all men and 51 percent of women officially overweight .
but in another shocking revelation , the national consumption study has shown that 10 percent of german girls under 17 years of age were underweight and were not eating enough to remain healthy .
the study showed that the difference between the consumption of men and women was striking .
while almost one-third of 18- to 29-year-old men were overweight , every tenth young woman was too thin .
germans suffering from calorific ignorance bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : few germans realize how many calories they consume it also shows that the majority of germans have very little knowledge about what they eat and what effect the food has on their bodies .
only 10 percent of the interviewees had any idea how many calories they needed each day or how many they consumed .
the study 's figures were based on the body mass index -lrb- bmi -rrb- of an overweight person being between 25 and 30 .
this bmi is calculated by dividing an individual 's bodyweight by the square of their height .
the higher the bmi , the higher the risk that the person will develop an illness such as diabetes or heart disease .
a separate report in the stuttgarter zeitung newspaper stated that every fifth german had a bmi of over 30 .
over 20,000 germans between 14 and 80 took part in the national consumption study and divulged information on eating behavior , sporting activities , shopping practices and lifestyle .
studies show extent of challenge facing germany the last government survey on obesity in germany , taken last may , stated that around 37 million adults and around 2 million children in germany were overweight .
one-fourth of adult germans suffered from cardiovascular diseases , while there were around 4 million diabetics in the country .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : fat is no longer just a feminist issue one in five german women and one in seven men reportedly suffered from chronic back pain .
the annual costs of treating nutrition-related illnesses amounted to 70 billion euros -lrb- $ 95.3 billion -rrb- , which was 30 percent of germany 's overall health costs recorded at the time .
the government survey followed on from a similar one done by the international association for the study of obesity , in 2007 .
it found that among eu countries , germany had the most overweight women and men .
among adults , the study found that 58.9 percent of german women were overweight ; 75.4 percent of men tipped the scales .
beer , fatty foods and a lack of physical activity are the main culprits behind germans ' expanding waistlines , according to experts , and the rates of obese and overweight germans now match those of americans . dw staff -lrb- nda -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

michael ballack is the biggest german soccer star in years : success at home and abroad , captain of his country , immense wealth .
but has he done enough to be regarded as a legend should he retire at the tender age of 31 ? germans love their talismanic soccer players , especially those who can control games and lead with passion and by example .
germany 's soccer history is full of men who drove their nation towards greatness while sweeping all before them at club level .
most of them enjoyed hugely successful careers and finished their playing days having achieved everything , and in some cases more , than had been expected of them . michael ballack has always been expected to join the likes of beckenbauer , rummenigge , matthäus , et al. in the pantheon of german soccer greats .
ever since a young ballack first arrived on the professional soccer scene in 1995 , he has been spoken of in the most glowing of terms .
his destiny as a german legend has always been discussed in absolutes .
no one who has watched ballack 's rise has been anything other than convinced that he would become a german icon . so what , then , would all those observers make of news that ballack pack it in in a year 's time and end a career that has yet to reach the heights expected of it ? ballack hints at early retirement " what comes when my contract expires , we 'll just have to see , " british media have quoted him as saying .
" whether i stay another year , go somewhere else or hang up my boots - you never know in soccer . " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : ballack waxed lyrical about hanging up his boots in a year while the player himself has not actually confirmed that this statement , reported in his adopted homeland of the uk this week , is a sign of his impending retirement at the end of the 2008/2009 season , the mere fact that he has spoken of ending his career at the young age of 31 raises questions about ballack 's legacy . from those early days at fc chemnitzer , where his precocious , driving midfield performances led to a transfer to the bundesliga 's kaiserslautern and then leverkusen , through his trophy-laden days at bayern munich to his multi-million-euro move to chelsea , ballack has been reaching for the status and titles which would assure his place in germany 's history . trophy haul lacking international sparkle ballack has collected a fair haul of silverware in his time , picking up four bundesliga titles , three german cups and one league cup with bayern munich and an fa cup and league cup in england with chelsea .
but , one champions league runners-up medal aside , ballack has yet to make his stamp on european club soccer like those his legendary compatriots left behind . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the premiership has proved a real challenge to ballack if his career ends in the blue of chelsea , will observers look back and wonder whether ballack would have achieved more at , say , real madrid or either of the milan teams ? it was obvious in his first year in london that the premiership was a more brutal and quicker beast than the bundesliga he had been used to .
ballack 's clever eye and languid style may have flourished faster and with more confidence in the slower italian league and the spanish game may have suited his creative flair .
who knows what he could have achieved if he had moved to either country from bayern munich in 2006 ? ballack 's collection of consolation trophies away from the domestic and european scene , ballack has also been building a legacy on the international level .
since making his germany debut in 1999 , ballack has won 77 caps and scored 35 goals .
he has played in two world cup semi-finals - missing out on the 2002 world cup final through suspension - and one confederations cup semi-final .
he has led his country as captain since 2004 . and yet , for all the celebrations and plaudits , germany have not won an international tournament since the 1996 european championships .
ballack has led the side in some great victories but as yet , none of these victories resulted in a trophy -lsb- other than a third-place consolation -rsb- being lifted by the captain . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : can ballack end his international career with glory ?
so what would ballack be leaving behind in terms of a record if he were to retire in a year 's time ?
well , he could spend his free time polishing a clutch of german domestic trophies , a couple of english cups and a handful of reminders of some international near-misses .
but would this be enough to warrant his own pedestal in germany 's hall of fame ? compared with franz beckenbauer 's one world cup , one european championship and three european cups , rummenigge 's one european championship and two european cups , and matthäus with his one world cup and one european championship , ballack would struggle to make the list in terms of significant titles . ballack 's performances rate highly - but high enough ? trophies aside , could any of ballack 's individual performances stand out in much the same way as the kaiser 's mercurial domination of the 1974 world cup final , or the way matthäus outshone maradona in the 1990 final in rome ? bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : ballack 's performances in the 2002 world cup made him a star the closest would be his performances during the 2002 world cup - among his finest in a germany jersey .
it would not be an exaggeration to say ballack won the quarter and semi-finals for his country on his own , not only through his deciding goals but through his overall commitment .
again , would this be enough ? if ballack does retire without any further major honors to his name and a season of workmanlike performances behind him , he will forever be known as a " good " german player .

michael ballack is the biggest german soccer star in years : success at home and abroad , captain of his country , immense wealth .
but has he done enough to be regarded as a legend should he retire at the tender age of 31 ? germans love their talismanic soccer players , especially those who can control games and lead with passion and by example .
germany 's soccer history is full of men who drove their nation towards greatness while sweeping all before them at club level .
most of them enjoyed hugely successful careers and finished their playing days having achieved everything , and in some cases more , than had been expected of them . michael ballack has always been expected to join the likes of beckenbauer , rummenigge , matthäus , et al. in the pantheon of german soccer greats .
ever since a young ballack first arrived on the professional soccer scene in 1995 , he has been spoken of in the most glowing of terms .
his destiny as a german legend has always been discussed in absolutes .
no one who has watched ballack 's rise has been anything other than convinced that he would become a german icon . so what , then , would all those observers make of news that ballack pack it in in a year 's time and end a career that has yet to reach the heights expected of it ? ballack hints at early retirement " what comes when my contract expires , we 'll just have to see , " british media have quoted him as saying .
" whether i stay another year , go somewhere else or hang up my boots - you never know in soccer . " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : ballack waxed lyrical about hanging up his boots in a year while the player himself has not actually confirmed that this statement , reported in his adopted homeland of the uk this week , is a sign of his impending retirement at the end of the 2008/2009 season , the mere fact that he has spoken of ending his career at the young age of 31 raises questions about ballack 's legacy . from those early days at fc chemnitzer , where his precocious , driving midfield performances led to a transfer to the bundesliga 's kaiserslautern and then leverkusen , through his trophy-laden days at bayern munich to his multi-million-euro move to chelsea , ballack has been reaching for the status and titles which would assure his place in germany 's history . trophy haul lacking international sparkle ballack has collected a fair haul of silverware in his time , picking up four bundesliga titles , three german cups and one league cup with bayern munich and an fa cup and league cup in england with chelsea .
but , one champions league runners-up medal aside , ballack has yet to make his stamp on european club soccer like those his legendary compatriots left behind . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the premiership has proved a real challenge to ballack if his career ends in the blue of chelsea , will observers look back and wonder whether ballack would have achieved more at , say , real madrid or either of the milan teams ? it was obvious in his first year in london that the premiership was a more brutal and quicker beast than the bundesliga he had been used to .
ballack 's clever eye and languid style may have flourished faster and with more confidence in the slower italian league and the spanish game may have suited his creative flair .
who knows what he could have achieved if he had moved to either country from bayern munich in 2006 ? ballack 's collection of consolation trophies away from the domestic and european scene , ballack has also been building a legacy on the international level .
since making his germany debut in 1999 , ballack has won 77 caps and scored 35 goals .
he has played in two world cup semi-finals - missing out on the 2002 world cup final through suspension - and one confederations cup semi-final .
he has led his country as captain since 2004 . and yet , for all the celebrations and plaudits , germany have not won an international tournament since the 1996 european championships .
ballack has led the side in some great victories but as yet , none of these victories resulted in a trophy -lsb- other than a third-place consolation -rsb- being lifted by the captain . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : can ballack end his international career with glory ?
so what would ballack be leaving behind in terms of a record if he were to retire in a year 's time ?
well , he could spend his free time polishing a clutch of german domestic trophies , a couple of english cups and a handful of reminders of some international near-misses .
but would this be enough to warrant his own pedestal in germany 's hall of fame ? compared with franz beckenbauer 's one world cup , one european championship and three european cups , rummenigge 's one european championship and two european cups , and matthäus with his one world cup and one european championship , ballack would struggle to make the list in terms of significant titles . ballack 's performances rate highly - but high enough ? trophies aside , could any of ballack 's individual performances stand out in much the same way as the kaiser 's mercurial domination of the 1974 world cup final , or the way matthäus outshone maradona in the 1990 final in rome ? bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : ballack 's performances in the 2002 world cup made him a star the closest would be his performances during the 2002 world cup - among his finest in a germany jersey .
it would not be an exaggeration to say ballack won the quarter and semi-finals for his country on his own , not only through his deciding goals but through his overall commitment .
again , would this be enough ? if ballack does retire without any further major honors to his name and a season of workmanlike performances behind him , he will forever be known as a " good " german player .
by prolonging his career past this hypothetical end-date and giving himself more opportunities to show what he can clearly do very well when the mood takes him , michael ballack could still be in with a chance of joining the greats . nick amies send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

a subsequent german review revealed the country 's weight demographics .
now a new study shows the extent of the problem . germany is facing more of a challenge in the battle of the bulge than first thought , according to a new study on eating habits in the country .
the survey showed that more than half of all germans were too fat , with two-thirds of all men and 51 percent of women officially overweight .
but in another shocking revelation , the national consumption study has shown that 10 percent of german girls under 17 years of age were underweight and were not eating enough to remain healthy .
the study showed that the difference between the consumption of men and women was striking .
while almost one-third of 18- to 29-year-old men were overweight , every tenth young woman was too thin .
germans suffering from calorific ignorance bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : few germans realize how many calories they consume it also shows that the majority of germans have very little knowledge about what they eat and what effect the food has on their bodies .
only 10 percent of the interviewees had any idea how many calories they needed each day or how many they consumed .
the study 's figures were based on the body mass index -lrb- bmi -rrb- of an overweight person being between 25 and 30 .
this bmi is calculated by dividing an individual 's bodyweight by the square of their height .
the higher the bmi , the higher the risk that the person will develop an illness such as diabetes or heart disease .
a separate report in the stuttgarter zeitung newspaper stated that every fifth german had a bmi of over 30 .
over 20,000 germans between 14 and 80 took part in the national consumption study and divulged information on eating behavior , sporting activities , shopping practices and lifestyle .
studies show extent of challenge facing germany the last government survey on obesity in germany , taken last may , stated that around 37 million adults and around 2 million children in germany were overweight .
one-fourth of adult germans suffered from cardiovascular diseases , while there were around 4 million diabetics in the country .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : fat is no longer just a feminist issue one in five german women and one in seven men reportedly suffered from chronic back pain .
the annual costs of treating nutrition-related illnesses amounted to 70 billion euros -lrb- $ 95.3 billion -rrb- , which was 30 percent of germany 's overall health costs recorded at the time .
the government survey followed on from a similar one done by the international association for the study of obesity , in 2007 .
it found that among eu countries , germany had the most overweight women and men .
among adults , the study found that 58.9 percent of german women were overweight ; 75.4 percent of men tipped the scales .
beer , fatty foods and a lack of physical activity are the main culprits behind germans ' expanding waistlines , according to experts , and the rates of obese and overweight germans now match those of americans . dw staff -lrb- nda -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

afghan president karzai sees the proposed increase of troops in the country as unnecessary . a day after it was officially confirmed that nato had made a request to the german defense ministry to provide 250 combat troops to a quick reaction force in northern afghanistan , former nato chief of staff harald kujat warned that german soldiers were ill-equipped to deal with combat operations against the taliban and al qaeda insurgents . kujat , a former chairperson of nato 's military committee , deplored the lack of adequate hardware at the disposal of the german military and said on wednesday , jan .

" nato submitted a formal request on tuesday for germany to provide a replacement for the 350-strong norwegian force that leaves in july after an initial inquiry had been made late last year . the german defense ministry confirmed earlier this month that it was considering whether to deploy the troops , responding to a media report that referred to a " new quality " in the german engagement in afghanistan . government officials have , however , in recent weeks denied that supplying a rapid reaction force would amount to sending men into combat .
they said the force was designed to provide emergency support to other troops in the north and that though its brief would include hunting " terrorists " and dealing with kidnappings this would not be its main task . inadequate equipment could cost lives bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : soldiers could be at risk from lack of equipment kujat called on german defense minister franz josef jung to prevent such a deployment as the inadequacy of german military equipment and lack of necessary supplies could lead to casualties , in addition to those which would come from engaging the enemy . he maintained that the soldiers themselves were well-trained and qualified to deal with the challenges of combat but the serious deficits in modern and efficient guidance systems and communication devices could negate their skills as soldiers . jung was in kabul for discussions with afghan president hamid karzai on tuesday , and made it clear that german soldiers were " ready to participate in operations against terrorists and cooperate with other international forces in any other part of the country . " reacting to the news that nato planned to send more troops to his country to counter the threat of a resurgent taliban back by supporters of al qaeda , karzai said training the afghan police and army was more important than sending more foreign troops to the country . karzai doubts wisdom of sending more troops bildunterschrift : president karzai advocated more investment in the afghan police and army " more than anything else , we need help to rebuild our human capital and our institutions , our army , our police force , our administrative structure , our judiciary and so on , " karzai told german newspaper die welt on wednesday . " although the situation has finally improved , the unintentional bombing of afghan civilians by nato and us troops is particularly painful , although it stems from a lack of ground troops , " he added .
" however , i am not sure that sending more troops is the right answer . " the western alliance already has around 37,000 troops deployed in the country .
nato commanders say they need some 7,500 extra troops to carry out their mission as they battle the taliban .
afghanistan 's army currently numbers 58,000 troops , with a target of 70,000 . karzai said he had the impression that the war " is not happening here , " but was being exported to afghanistan from other countries . " we should concentrate on the sanctuaries and the training camps , " he said .

afghan president karzai sees the proposed increase of troops in the country as unnecessary . a day after it was officially confirmed that nato had made a request to the german defense ministry to provide 250 combat troops to a quick reaction force in northern afghanistan , former nato chief of staff harald kujat warned that german soldiers were ill-equipped to deal with combat operations against the taliban and al qaeda insurgents . kujat , a former chairperson of nato 's military committee , deplored the lack of adequate hardware at the disposal of the german military and said on wednesday , jan .
30 , that bundeswehr troops " did not even have functioning devices , with which they could communicate with their allies in afghanistan . " nato submitted a formal request on tuesday for germany to provide a replacement for the 350-strong norwegian force that leaves in july after an initial inquiry had been made late last year . the german defense ministry confirmed earlier this month that it was considering whether to deploy the troops , responding to a media report that referred to a " new quality " in the german engagement in afghanistan . government officials have , however , in recent weeks denied that supplying a rapid reaction force would amount to sending men into combat .
they said the force was designed to provide emergency support to other troops in the north and that though its brief would include hunting " terrorists " and dealing with kidnappings this would not be its main task . inadequate equipment could cost lives bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : soldiers could be at risk from lack of equipment kujat called on german defense minister franz josef jung to prevent such a deployment as the inadequacy of german military equipment and lack of necessary supplies could lead to casualties , in addition to those which would come from engaging the enemy . he maintained that the soldiers themselves were well-trained and qualified to deal with the challenges of combat but the serious deficits in modern and efficient guidance systems and communication devices could negate their skills as soldiers . jung was in kabul for discussions with afghan president hamid karzai on tuesday , and made it clear that german soldiers were " ready to participate in operations against terrorists and cooperate with other international forces in any other part of the country . " reacting to the news that nato planned to send more troops to his country to counter the threat of a resurgent taliban back by supporters of al qaeda , karzai said training the afghan police and army was more important than sending more foreign troops to the country . karzai doubts wisdom of sending more troops bildunterschrift : president karzai advocated more investment in the afghan police and army " more than anything else , we need help to rebuild our human capital and our institutions , our army , our police force , our administrative structure , our judiciary and so on , " karzai told german newspaper die welt on wednesday . " although the situation has finally improved , the unintentional bombing of afghan civilians by nato and us troops is particularly painful , although it stems from a lack of ground troops , " he added .
" however , i am not sure that sending more troops is the right answer . " the western alliance already has around 37,000 troops deployed in the country .
nato commanders say they need some 7,500 extra troops to carry out their mission as they battle the taliban .
afghanistan 's army currently numbers 58,000 troops , with a target of 70,000 . karzai said he had the impression that the war " is not happening here , " but was being exported to afghanistan from other countries . " we should concentrate on the sanctuaries and the training camps , " he said .
" afghanistan is not a sanctuary .
it was one , but we have taken it back . " focus should shift to pakistan bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : taliban fighters are thought to be re-grouping in pakistan most concern focuses on the mountainous border area with pakistan , where afghan and western forces believe taliban extremists regroup to launch attacks in southern afghanistan . karzai said his recent meeting with pakistan 's under-pressure president pervez musharraf had been " very constructive . " " my hope is that pakistan will take harder and clearer measures in the future and thus becomes a region where extremism is no longer used as a political instrument , " he was quoted as saying .
" if pakistan takes a step in this direction , we in afghanistan will take many steps to support it . " dw staff -lrb- nda -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

" i will concentrate my efforts on trying to do this as quickly as possible , " the 74-year-old said on wednesday , jan 30 , after meeting with the president . after consulting leaders across the political spectrum , napolitano decided in favor of an interim government this week .
he has said that he wants the interim administration to change the electoral system , widely blamed for fueling italy 's political instability , before any new parliamentary elections . berlusconi eager for snap polls napolitano 's stance flies in the face of berlusconi 's argument that early elections are the only way out of the political deadlock . the leader of the forza italia party , as well as other conservative politicians , did not want the president to back a transitional government . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : berlusconi hopes to get back to power soon if snap polls are held berlusconi served as prime minister for five years - a record in postwar italy - and is eager to avenge his 2006 defeat to prodi .
he is likely to return to power if there is an early vote , according to recent polls showing the conservatives holding as much as a 10 percent lead over their rivals . " we believe there is no other way than returning to the polls and giving the country a government as soon as possible , a government that is immediately operational , " berlusconi said . italy 's latest political crisis erupted after prime minister romano prodi was forced to resign following the withdrawal of support by a centrist party in his center-left coalition .
prodi thereupon lost a confidence vote in the senate . italy hamstrung by political crisis the political crisis - it was the collapse of the 61st italian government since world war ii - has left the euro zone 's third largest economy floundering at a time when the global economy is slowing .
italian business and consumer confidence is at its lowest for at least two years . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : napolitano is determined to overhaul italy 's electoral practices italian industry leader , luca cordero di montezemolo told reuters , italy desperately needed " governability and economic growth ... both require united efforts towards a shared solution . " it 's hoped that marini 's neutral role as president of italy 's upper house of parliament may allow him to win cross-party support for reform of the current proportional representation system of voting . changes to the voting system were implemented by berlusconi during his time as prime minister and allow smaller parties with only a handful of seats to hold the balance of power in parliament .
the system is largely blamed for last week 's political turmoil . dw staff -lrb- sp -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

michael ballack is the biggest german soccer star in years : success at home and abroad , captain of his country , immense wealth .
but has he done enough to be regarded as a legend should he retire at the tender age of 31 ? germans love their talismanic soccer players , especially those who can control games and lead with passion and by example .
germany 's soccer history is full of men who drove their nation towards greatness while sweeping all before them at club level .
most of them enjoyed hugely successful careers and finished their playing days having achieved everything , and in some cases more , than had been expected of them . michael ballack has always been expected to join the likes of beckenbauer , rummenigge , matthäus , et al. in the pantheon of german soccer greats .
ever since a young ballack first arrived on the professional soccer scene in 1995 , he has been spoken of in the most glowing of terms .
his destiny as a german legend has always been discussed in absolutes .
no one who has watched ballack 's rise has been anything other than convinced that he would become a german icon . so what , then , would all those observers make of news that ballack pack it in in a year 's time and end a career that has yet to reach the heights expected of it ? ballack hints at early retirement " what comes when my contract expires , we 'll just have to see , " british media have quoted him as saying .
" whether i stay another year , go somewhere else or hang up my boots - you never know in soccer . " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : ballack waxed lyrical about hanging up his boots in a year while the player himself has not actually confirmed that this statement , reported in his adopted homeland of the uk this week , is a sign of his impending retirement at the end of the 2008/2009 season , the mere fact that he has spoken of ending his career at the young age of 31 raises questions about ballack 's legacy . from those early days at fc chemnitzer , where his precocious , driving midfield performances led to a transfer to the bundesliga 's kaiserslautern and then leverkusen , through his trophy-laden days at bayern munich to his multi-million-euro move to chelsea , ballack has been reaching for the status and titles which would assure his place in germany 's history . trophy haul lacking international sparkle ballack has collected a fair haul of silverware in his time , picking up four bundesliga titles , three german cups and one league cup with bayern munich and an fa cup and league cup in england with chelsea .
but , one champions league runners-up medal aside , ballack has yet to make his stamp on european club soccer like those his legendary compatriots left behind . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the premiership has proved a real challenge to ballack if his career ends in the blue of chelsea , will observers look back and wonder whether ballack would have achieved more at , say , real madrid or either of the milan teams ? it was obvious in his first year in london that the premiership was a more brutal and quicker beast than the bundesliga he had been used to .
ballack 's clever eye and languid style may have flourished faster and with more confidence in the slower italian league and the spanish game may have suited his creative flair .
who knows what he could have achieved if he had moved to either country from bayern munich in 2006 ? ballack 's collection of consolation trophies away from the domestic and european scene , ballack has also been building a legacy on the international level .
since making his germany debut in 1999 , ballack has won 77 caps and scored 35 goals .
he has played in two world cup semi-finals - missing out on the 2002 world cup final through suspension - and one confederations cup semi-final .
he has led his country as captain since 2004 . and yet , for all the celebrations and plaudits , germany have not won an international tournament since the 1996 european championships .
ballack has led the side in some great victories but as yet , none of these victories resulted in a trophy -lsb- other than a third-place consolation -rsb- being lifted by the captain . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : can ballack end his international career with glory ?
so what would ballack be leaving behind in terms of a record if he were to retire in a year 's time ?
well , he could spend his free time polishing a clutch of german domestic trophies , a couple of english cups and a handful of reminders of some international near-misses .
but would this be enough to warrant his own pedestal in germany 's hall of fame ? compared with franz beckenbauer 's one world cup , one european championship and three european cups , rummenigge 's one european championship and two european cups , and matthäus with his one world cup and one european championship , ballack would struggle to make the list in terms of significant titles . ballack 's performances rate highly - but high enough ? trophies aside , could any of ballack 's individual performances stand out in much the same way as the kaiser 's mercurial domination of the 1974 world cup final , or the way matthäus outshone maradona in the 1990 final in rome ? bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : ballack 's performances in the 2002 world cup made him a star the closest would be his performances during the 2002 world cup - among his finest in a germany jersey .
it would not be an exaggeration to say ballack won the quarter and semi-finals for his country on his own , not only through his deciding goals but through his overall commitment .
again , would this be enough ? if ballack does retire without any further major honors to his name and a season of workmanlike performances behind him , he will forever be known as a " good " german player .

germany 's soccer history is full of men who drove their nation towards greatness while sweeping all before them at club level .
most of them enjoyed hugely successful careers and finished their playing days having achieved everything , and in some cases more , than had been expected of them . michael ballack has always been expected to join the likes of beckenbauer , rummenigge , matthäus , et al. in the pantheon of german soccer greats .
ever since a young ballack first arrived on the professional soccer scene in 1995 , he has been spoken of in the most glowing of terms .

" dziennik reported that the new polish proposal had been " agreed with baltic and nordic states " and foresees the construction of a pipeline from russia to germany via estonia , latvia , lithuania and poland . polish proposal avoids seabed route the alternative route has been developed in an attempt by poland to avoid the seabed route planned by russian energy titan gazprom and germany 's eon and basf and which has been vehemently opposed by poland , estonia , latvia and lithuania .

a subsequent german review revealed the country 's weight demographics .
now a new study shows the extent of the problem . germany is facing more of a challenge in the battle of the bulge than first thought , according to a new study on eating habits in the country .
the survey showed that more than half of all germans were too fat , with two-thirds of all men and 51 percent of women officially overweight .
but in another shocking revelation , the national consumption study has shown that 10 percent of german girls under 17 years of age were underweight and were not eating enough to remain healthy .
the study showed that the difference between the consumption of men and women was striking .
while almost one-third of 18- to 29-year-old men were overweight , every tenth young woman was too thin .
germans suffering from calorific ignorance bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : few germans realize how many calories they consume it also shows that the majority of germans have very little knowledge about what they eat and what effect the food has on their bodies .
only 10 percent of the interviewees had any idea how many calories they needed each day or how many they consumed .
the study 's figures were based on the body mass index -lrb- bmi -rrb- of an overweight person being between 25 and 30 .
this bmi is calculated by dividing an individual 's bodyweight by the square of their height .

the government survey followed on from a similar one done by the international association for the study of obesity , in 2007 .
it found that among eu countries , germany had the most overweight women and men .
among adults , the study found that 58.9 percent of german women were overweight ; 75.4 percent of men tipped the scales .

afghan president karzai sees the proposed increase of troops in the country as unnecessary . a day after it was officially confirmed that nato had made a request to the german defense ministry to provide 250 combat troops to a quick reaction force in northern afghanistan , former nato chief of staff harald kujat warned that german soldiers were ill-equipped to deal with combat operations against the taliban and al qaeda insurgents . kujat , a former chairperson of nato 's military committee , deplored the lack of adequate hardware at the disposal of the german military and said on wednesday , jan .

" nato submitted a formal request on tuesday for germany to provide a replacement for the 350-strong norwegian force that leaves in july after an initial inquiry had been made late last year . the german defense ministry confirmed earlier this month that it was considering whether to deploy the troops , responding to a media report that referred to a " new quality " in the german engagement in afghanistan . government officials have , however , in recent weeks denied that supplying a rapid reaction force would amount to sending men into combat .

" reacting to the news that nato planned to send more troops to his country to counter the threat of a resurgent taliban back by supporters of al qaeda , karzai said training the afghan police and army was more important than sending more foreign troops to the country . karzai doubts wisdom of sending more troops bildunterschrift : president karzai advocated more investment in the afghan police and army " more than anything else , we need help to rebuild our human capital and our institutions , our army , our police force , our administrative structure , our judiciary and so on , " karzai told german newspaper die welt on wednesday . " although the situation has finally improved , the unintentional bombing of afghan civilians by nato and us troops is particularly painful , although it stems from a lack of ground troops , " he added .
" however , i am not sure that sending more troops is the right answer . " the western alliance already has around 37,000 troops deployed in the country .
nato commanders say they need some 7,500 extra troops to carry out their mission as they battle the taliban .
afghanistan 's army currently numbers 58,000 troops , with a target of 70,000 . karzai said he had the impression that the war " is not happening here , " but was being exported to afghanistan from other countries . " we should concentrate on the sanctuaries and the training camps , " he said .

afghan president karzai sees the proposed increase of troops in the country as unnecessary . a day after it was officially confirmed that nato had made a request to the german defense ministry to provide 250 combat troops to a quick reaction force in northern afghanistan , former nato chief of staff harald kujat warned that german soldiers were ill-equipped to deal with combat operations against the taliban and al qaeda insurgents . kujat , a former chairperson of nato 's military committee , deplored the lack of adequate hardware at the disposal of the german military and said on wednesday , jan .
30 , that bundeswehr troops " did not even have functioning devices , with which they could communicate with their allies in afghanistan . " nato submitted a formal request on tuesday for germany to provide a replacement for the 350-strong norwegian force that leaves in july after an initial inquiry had been made late last year . the german defense ministry confirmed earlier this month that it was considering whether to deploy the troops , responding to a media report that referred to a " new quality " in the german engagement in afghanistan . government officials have , however , in recent weeks denied that supplying a rapid reaction force would amount to sending men into combat .
they said the force was designed to provide emergency support to other troops in the north and that though its brief would include hunting " terrorists " and dealing with kidnappings this would not be its main task . inadequate equipment could cost lives bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : soldiers could be at risk from lack of equipment kujat called on german defense minister franz josef jung to prevent such a deployment as the inadequacy of german military equipment and lack of necessary supplies could lead to casualties , in addition to those which would come from engaging the enemy . he maintained that the soldiers themselves were well-trained and qualified to deal with the challenges of combat but the serious deficits in modern and efficient guidance systems and communication devices could negate their skills as soldiers . jung was in kabul for discussions with afghan president hamid karzai on tuesday , and made it clear that german soldiers were " ready to participate in operations against terrorists and cooperate with other international forces in any other part of the country . " reacting to the news that nato planned to send more troops to his country to counter the threat of a resurgent taliban back by supporters of al qaeda , karzai said training the afghan police and army was more important than sending more foreign troops to the country . karzai doubts wisdom of sending more troops bildunterschrift : president karzai advocated more investment in the afghan police and army " more than anything else , we need help to rebuild our human capital and our institutions , our army , our police force , our administrative structure , our judiciary and so on , " karzai told german newspaper die welt on wednesday . " although the situation has finally improved , the unintentional bombing of afghan civilians by nato and us troops is particularly painful , although it stems from a lack of ground troops , " he added .
" however , i am not sure that sending more troops is the right answer . " the western alliance already has around 37,000 troops deployed in the country .
nato commanders say they need some 7,500 extra troops to carry out their mission as they battle the taliban .
afghanistan 's army currently numbers 58,000 troops , with a target of 70,000 . karzai said he had the impression that the war " is not happening here , " but was being exported to afghanistan from other countries . " we should concentrate on the sanctuaries and the training camps , " he said .
" afghanistan is not a sanctuary .
it was one , but we have taken it back .

" " my hope is that pakistan will take harder and clearer measures in the future and thus becomes a region where extremism is no longer used as a political instrument , " he was quoted as saying .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de history -pipe- 30.01.2008 historian says weimar republic holds potent lessons for today großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the nazis ' rise to power in 1933 ended the 14-year-old weimar democracy seventy-five years ago , hitler came to power , ending the weimar republic .
did germany 's experiment with democracy between 1919 and 1933 ever stand a real chance ?
eric weitz , a us historian and author , has the answers . on jan .
30 , 1933 , hitler was named german chancellor , spelling the end to the weimar republic - germany 's convulsive experiment with democracy between 1919 and 1933 .
the period was dubbed the " weimar republic " by historians in honor of the city of weimar , where a national assembly convened to write and adopt a new constitution for the german reich following the nation 's defeat in world war i. the weimar republic was marked on the one hand by hyperinflation , mass unemployment and political instability ; on the other , by dazzling creativity in the arts and sciences and a legendary nightlife in berlin . eric weitz , chairman of the history department at the university of minnesota in the united states , last year published an acclaimed book on the period : " weimar germany : promise and tragedy . "
dw-world.de spoke with him about the spirit of the time , the factors leading to the nazi seizure of power and the lessons to be drawn from the weimar republic . dw-world.de : one of the premises of your book is that the weimar republic should not be seen simply as a prelude to nazi dictatorship but as an era in its own right . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : weitz argues that the weimar republic should be valued in its own right eric weitz : it certainly should be seen as an era in its own right .
the weimar republic was a wonderfully creative period .
we should not constantly look back from the 12 years of the third reich to the 14 years of the weimar republic because the republic was a period of very important political , cultural and social innovation .
we need to remember and value it in its own right .
every issue about the weimar republic , about life in germany in the 1920s was intensely debated - both at the high intellectual and artistic level as well at the level of politics and society . how do you explain the cultural and artistic blossoming in germany , and particularly in berlin , in the 1920s ?
after all , this was a nation battered by war , with millions of dead , and plagued by hyperinflation and instability . the intense innovation of weimar is related precisely to these factors .
many people focus exclusively on the despair that came out of world war i. there was despair in abundance to be sure .
two million germans died in world war i , 4 million were wounded , and men who came back were often severely wounded , both physically and psychologically .
women at the home front during the war , experienced four years of intense privation .
and afterwards there came the post-war crisis - readjustment and hyperinflation . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : otto dix , who created this work in 1920 , was one of the prominent german artists of the weimar republic but to a certain extent , that intense instability of economy , society and politics fuelled this deep intellectual engagement with the problems of living in the modern age , of what should be germany 's political configuration .
but beyond that , the revolution of 1918/19 was crucial to this cultural efflorescence as well .
the revolution threw out the kaiser and established a democratic system - the most democratic system the germans had lived under to that point .
the spirit of revolution created a sense that the future was open , it was one of unbounded possibilities that it could be shaped in a more humanitarian way .
it could not last forever , but it 's that sense that underpins much of the cultural innovation of the republic . yet there were people in germany who hated the weimar republic .
who were they ?
and why did they want it to fail if it was so promising and attractive ? everything about the weimar republic was contested .
the kinds of artists , thinkers , architects whom i focus on in the book - much or all of their work was intensely challenged from the right .
by that i mean the establishment right - the old-line aristocrats , high government officials , army officers , businessmen , bankers , people from the church who by and large were not only anti-socialist and anti-communist but anti-democratic as well .
the revolution in 1918/19 left their powers intact by and large .
it established a political democracy but did not undermine at all the social situation and powers of this old-line conservative elite . that conservative elite , after the initial flurry of revolution , challenged the republic every step of the way .
many of the focal points of conflict were not just in the political sphere but in the cultural and social sphere as well .
there was , for example , the so-called " zehlendorf roof wars " in which conservatives , architects , and critics - nazis as well - claimed that the flat roofs of modern architectural style was distinctly un-german and true german architecture had pitched roofs .
these critics would charge that flat roofs were a form of jewish architecture .
the emancipation of women in the 1920s and very active talk of erotic fulfillment was another focal point of intense conflict . would you say the weimar republic was an early victim of globalization ?
do you think it would have survived if the great depression of 1929 had n't occurred ? the great depression was the final blow .
if we look at the economy and the election of 1928 just prior to the onset of the great depression , we can see a move back to the center politically and signs of serious economic progress .
this is the last year of the so-called fabled golden years of the republic .
without the depression , the republic would at least have had a chance .
it had managed to survive the hyperinflation of 1923 , as disruptive and disorienting as that event was .
but it was the depression that came from the united states to germany very fast and very strongly that certainly unleashed the final blow . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : hyperinflation in 1923 made german currency worthless and sparked an economic crisis at the same time we should not forget that few democracies have been founded in such difficult circumstances as the weimar republic .
the republic needed a long breathing space , it needed a more expansive and forgiving attitude on the part of the western allies , it needed economic stability and progress - all of that was in precious short supply in the post-world war i years . what led finally to the demise of democracy in the weimar republic ?
after all , in the 1928 general election , the nazis won just 2.6 percent of the vote ; five years later hitler was in power . it 's true , in 1928 , the nazi party was a marginal , unimportant political group which had very little resonance beyond some very distinctive places that were already in depression before the great depression - agricultural areas in particular .
but in many ways , the republic was seriously undermined and the political system paralyzed prior to the nazi seizure of power .

did germany 's experiment with democracy between 1919 and 1933 ever stand a real chance ?
eric weitz , a us historian and author , has the answers . on jan .
30 , 1933 , hitler was named german chancellor , spelling the end to the weimar republic - germany 's convulsive experiment with democracy between 1919 and 1933 .
the period was dubbed the " weimar republic " by historians in honor of the city of weimar , where a national assembly convened to write and adopt a new constitution for the german reich following the nation 's defeat in world war i. the weimar republic was marked on the one hand by hyperinflation , mass unemployment and political instability ; on the other , by dazzling creativity in the arts and sciences and a legendary nightlife in berlin . eric weitz , chairman of the history department at the university of minnesota in the united states , last year published an acclaimed book on the period : " weimar germany : promise and tragedy . "
dw-world.de spoke with him about the spirit of the time , the factors leading to the nazi seizure of power and the lessons to be drawn from the weimar republic . dw-world.de : one of the premises of your book is that the weimar republic should not be seen simply as a prelude to nazi dictatorship but as an era in its own right . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : weitz argues that the weimar republic should be valued in its own right eric weitz : it certainly should be seen as an era in its own right .
the weimar republic was a wonderfully creative period .
we should not constantly look back from the 12 years of the third reich to the 14 years of the weimar republic because the republic was a period of very important political , cultural and social innovation .
we need to remember and value it in its own right .
every issue about the weimar republic , about life in germany in the 1920s was intensely debated - both at the high intellectual and artistic level as well at the level of politics and society . how do you explain the cultural and artistic blossoming in germany , and particularly in berlin , in the 1920s ?
after all , this was a nation battered by war , with millions of dead , and plagued by hyperinflation and instability . the intense innovation of weimar is related precisely to these factors .
many people focus exclusively on the despair that came out of world war i. there was despair in abundance to be sure .
two million germans died in world war i , 4 million were wounded , and men who came back were often severely wounded , both physically and psychologically .
women at the home front during the war , experienced four years of intense privation .
and afterwards there came the post-war crisis - readjustment and hyperinflation . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : otto dix , who created this work in 1920 , was one of the prominent german artists of the weimar republic but to a certain extent , that intense instability of economy , society and politics fuelled this deep intellectual engagement with the problems of living in the modern age , of what should be germany 's political configuration .
but beyond that , the revolution of 1918/19 was crucial to this cultural efflorescence as well .
the revolution threw out the kaiser and established a democratic system - the most democratic system the germans had lived under to that point .
the spirit of revolution created a sense that the future was open , it was one of unbounded possibilities that it could be shaped in a more humanitarian way .
it could not last forever , but it 's that sense that underpins much of the cultural innovation of the republic . yet there were people in germany who hated the weimar republic .
who were they ?
and why did they want it to fail if it was so promising and attractive ? everything about the weimar republic was contested .
the kinds of artists , thinkers , architects whom i focus on in the book - much or all of their work was intensely challenged from the right .
by that i mean the establishment right - the old-line aristocrats , high government officials , army officers , businessmen , bankers , people from the church who by and large were not only anti-socialist and anti-communist but anti-democratic as well .
the revolution in 1918/19 left their powers intact by and large .
it established a political democracy but did not undermine at all the social situation and powers of this old-line conservative elite . that conservative elite , after the initial flurry of revolution , challenged the republic every step of the way .
many of the focal points of conflict were not just in the political sphere but in the cultural and social sphere as well .
there was , for example , the so-called " zehlendorf roof wars " in which conservatives , architects , and critics - nazis as well - claimed that the flat roofs of modern architectural style was distinctly un-german and true german architecture had pitched roofs .
these critics would charge that flat roofs were a form of jewish architecture .
the emancipation of women in the 1920s and very active talk of erotic fulfillment was another focal point of intense conflict . would you say the weimar republic was an early victim of globalization ?
do you think it would have survived if the great depression of 1929 had n't occurred ? the great depression was the final blow .
if we look at the economy and the election of 1928 just prior to the onset of the great depression , we can see a move back to the center politically and signs of serious economic progress .
this is the last year of the so-called fabled golden years of the republic .
without the depression , the republic would at least have had a chance .
it had managed to survive the hyperinflation of 1923 , as disruptive and disorienting as that event was .
but it was the depression that came from the united states to germany very fast and very strongly that certainly unleashed the final blow . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : hyperinflation in 1923 made german currency worthless and sparked an economic crisis at the same time we should not forget that few democracies have been founded in such difficult circumstances as the weimar republic .
the republic needed a long breathing space , it needed a more expansive and forgiving attitude on the part of the western allies , it needed economic stability and progress - all of that was in precious short supply in the post-world war i years . what led finally to the demise of democracy in the weimar republic ?
after all , in the 1928 general election , the nazis won just 2.6 percent of the vote ; five years later hitler was in power . it 's true , in 1928 , the nazi party was a marginal , unimportant political group which had very little resonance beyond some very distinctive places that were already in depression before the great depression - agricultural areas in particular .
but in many ways , the republic was seriously undermined and the political system paralyzed prior to the nazi seizure of power .
in a depression especially , people look for solutions and the republic was not offering any to the economic crisis .
from 1930 onwards , germany was governed under a presidential dictatorship because the political system was so fragmented that the reichstag could not assemble or function in parliamentary majority .
so the chancellor from spring of 1930 onwards , heinrich brüning and his successors , governed largely through emergency powers proclaimed by the president , field marshall paul von hindenburg . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the nazis never received a majority vote but i do want to underscore the fact that the nazis never received a majority vote in a popular , freely contested election .

did germany 's experiment with democracy between 1919 and 1933 ever stand a real chance ?
eric weitz , a us historian and author , has the answers . on jan .
30 , 1933 , hitler was named german chancellor , spelling the end to the weimar republic - germany 's convulsive experiment with democracy between 1919 and 1933 .
the period was dubbed the " weimar republic " by historians in honor of the city of weimar , where a national assembly convened to write and adopt a new constitution for the german reich following the nation 's defeat in world war i. the weimar republic was marked on the one hand by hyperinflation , mass unemployment and political instability ; on the other , by dazzling creativity in the arts and sciences and a legendary nightlife in berlin . eric weitz , chairman of the history department at the university of minnesota in the united states , last year published an acclaimed book on the period : " weimar germany : promise and tragedy . "
dw-world.de spoke with him about the spirit of the time , the factors leading to the nazi seizure of power and the lessons to be drawn from the weimar republic . dw-world.de : one of the premises of your book is that the weimar republic should not be seen simply as a prelude to nazi dictatorship but as an era in its own right . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : weitz argues that the weimar republic should be valued in its own right eric weitz : it certainly should be seen as an era in its own right .
the weimar republic was a wonderfully creative period .
we should not constantly look back from the 12 years of the third reich to the 14 years of the weimar republic because the republic was a period of very important political , cultural and social innovation .
we need to remember and value it in its own right .
every issue about the weimar republic , about life in germany in the 1920s was intensely debated - both at the high intellectual and artistic level as well at the level of politics and society . how do you explain the cultural and artistic blossoming in germany , and particularly in berlin , in the 1920s ?
after all , this was a nation battered by war , with millions of dead , and plagued by hyperinflation and instability . the intense innovation of weimar is related precisely to these factors .
many people focus exclusively on the despair that came out of world war i. there was despair in abundance to be sure .
two million germans died in world war i , 4 million were wounded , and men who came back were often severely wounded , both physically and psychologically .
women at the home front during the war , experienced four years of intense privation .
and afterwards there came the post-war crisis - readjustment and hyperinflation . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : otto dix , who created this work in 1920 , was one of the prominent german artists of the weimar republic but to a certain extent , that intense instability of economy , society and politics fuelled this deep intellectual engagement with the problems of living in the modern age , of what should be germany 's political configuration .
but beyond that , the revolution of 1918/19 was crucial to this cultural efflorescence as well .
the revolution threw out the kaiser and established a democratic system - the most democratic system the germans had lived under to that point .
the spirit of revolution created a sense that the future was open , it was one of unbounded possibilities that it could be shaped in a more humanitarian way .
it could not last forever , but it 's that sense that underpins much of the cultural innovation of the republic . yet there were people in germany who hated the weimar republic .
who were they ?
and why did they want it to fail if it was so promising and attractive ? everything about the weimar republic was contested .
the kinds of artists , thinkers , architects whom i focus on in the book - much or all of their work was intensely challenged from the right .
by that i mean the establishment right - the old-line aristocrats , high government officials , army officers , businessmen , bankers , people from the church who by and large were not only anti-socialist and anti-communist but anti-democratic as well .
the revolution in 1918/19 left their powers intact by and large .
it established a political democracy but did not undermine at all the social situation and powers of this old-line conservative elite . that conservative elite , after the initial flurry of revolution , challenged the republic every step of the way .
many of the focal points of conflict were not just in the political sphere but in the cultural and social sphere as well .
there was , for example , the so-called " zehlendorf roof wars " in which conservatives , architects , and critics - nazis as well - claimed that the flat roofs of modern architectural style was distinctly un-german and true german architecture had pitched roofs .
these critics would charge that flat roofs were a form of jewish architecture .
the emancipation of women in the 1920s and very active talk of erotic fulfillment was another focal point of intense conflict . would you say the weimar republic was an early victim of globalization ?
do you think it would have survived if the great depression of 1929 had n't occurred ? the great depression was the final blow .
if we look at the economy and the election of 1928 just prior to the onset of the great depression , we can see a move back to the center politically and signs of serious economic progress .
this is the last year of the so-called fabled golden years of the republic .
without the depression , the republic would at least have had a chance .
it had managed to survive the hyperinflation of 1923 , as disruptive and disorienting as that event was .
but it was the depression that came from the united states to germany very fast and very strongly that certainly unleashed the final blow . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : hyperinflation in 1923 made german currency worthless and sparked an economic crisis at the same time we should not forget that few democracies have been founded in such difficult circumstances as the weimar republic .
the republic needed a long breathing space , it needed a more expansive and forgiving attitude on the part of the western allies , it needed economic stability and progress - all of that was in precious short supply in the post-world war i years . what led finally to the demise of democracy in the weimar republic ?
after all , in the 1928 general election , the nazis won just 2.6 percent of the vote ; five years later hitler was in power . it 's true , in 1928 , the nazi party was a marginal , unimportant political group which had very little resonance beyond some very distinctive places that were already in depression before the great depression - agricultural areas in particular .
but in many ways , the republic was seriously undermined and the political system paralyzed prior to the nazi seizure of power .
in a depression especially , people look for solutions and the republic was not offering any to the economic crisis .
from 1930 onwards , germany was governed under a presidential dictatorship because the political system was so fragmented that the reichstag could not assemble or function in parliamentary majority .
so the chancellor from spring of 1930 onwards , heinrich brüning and his successors , governed largely through emergency powers proclaimed by the president , field marshall paul von hindenburg . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the nazis never received a majority vote but i do want to underscore the fact that the nazis never received a majority vote in a popular , freely contested election .
in the summer of 1932 , they received 37.4 percent of the vote - the highest they would ever receive .
it 's a significant jump to be sure but that 's not a majority and the popular phrase that one hears so often in the united states , " the german people elected hitler to power or elected the nazis to power " - that 's wrong , it 's inaccurate , it 's untrue .
the nazis were never elected to power .
in the next election , in the fall of 1932 , they already lost a significant percentage of the support they had gained in the summer .
the nazi party was in disarray .
at the very end , they came to power because the establishment conservative elite , a coterie of powerful men around president hindenburg , handed power over to the nazis .
that alliance is what ultimately killed the republic . what lessons can be drawn from the weimar republic ?
implied throughout your book is the question of whether it is possible for contemporary democracies to succumb to neo-fascist forces in the same way that the weimar republic fell to the nazis . present day germany is a well-established democratic system .
it gives me no worries whatsoever .
to be sure there are some extreme right-wing groups that can be dangerous and the reaction against them is still a little slow sometimes .
but these groups are marginal and berlin is not weimar . my worries are more about my own country , the us , in the sense that the threats to democracy do n't always come from abroad .
the most dangerous threat may come from within .
that was certainly the case in weimar , especially in its last years .
what worries me is when certain people or institutions mouth talk of democracy but in reality undermine the very practices of democracy .
of course the nazis were never committed to democracy but they used the populist rhetoric that resonated with people .
when that kind of populist rhetoric masks undemocratic practices , that 's where i think we truly need to be concerned . the analogy that does worry me greatly is when establishment conservatives make radical conservatives salonfähig or in colloquial english " acceptable in polite society . "
i think to a certain extent that indeed has occurred in the united states .
when establishment conservatives go beyond the bounds of legitimate democratic discourse and constitutional provisions and make the program , the individuals and ideas of radical conservatives acceptable - that 's when we 're in trouble . in recent months , there seems to be a revival of interest in the weimar republic in the united states , whether it 's in fashion , art or music .
how do you explain that ? bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : a 1922 work by george grosz it 's been most curious .
and it 's true especially in new york .
i think it has to do with the sense of fragility that comes out of the sept .
11 attacks .
what people adopt is the weimar republic as portrayed in the american production of " cabaret " for example - there 's a vision of weimar as degenerate , as crisis-ridden all of which is true in part .
there was an exhibit at the metropolitan museum on weimar portraiture featuring otto dix und george grosz .
of course , if that 's all you know , you think of weimar as a period of only mutilated bodies and distorted features .
but what that interpretation misses of course is the democratic promise , the cultural innovation .
but it is that sense of fragility that has given weimar this glow in downtown as well as uptown new york culture . interview : sonia phalnikar send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

two million germans died in world war i , 4 million were wounded , and men who came back were often severely wounded , both physically and psychologically .
women at the home front during the war , experienced four years of intense privation .
and afterwards there came the post-war crisis - readjustment and hyperinflation . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : otto dix , who created this work in 1920 , was one of the prominent german artists of the weimar republic but to a certain extent , that intense instability of economy , society and politics fuelled this deep intellectual engagement with the problems of living in the modern age , of what should be germany 's political configuration .
but beyond that , the revolution of 1918/19 was crucial to this cultural efflorescence as well .
the revolution threw out the kaiser and established a democratic system - the most democratic system the germans had lived under to that point .
the spirit of revolution created a sense that the future was open , it was one of unbounded possibilities that it could be shaped in a more humanitarian way .
it could not last forever , but it 's that sense that underpins much of the cultural innovation of the republic . yet there were people in germany who hated the weimar republic .
who were they ?
and why did they want it to fail if it was so promising and attractive ? everything about the weimar republic was contested .
the kinds of artists , thinkers , architects whom i focus on in the book - much or all of their work was intensely challenged from the right .
by that i mean the establishment right - the old-line aristocrats , high government officials , army officers , businessmen , bankers , people from the church who by and large were not only anti-socialist and anti-communist but anti-democratic as well .
the revolution in 1918/19 left their powers intact by and large .
it established a political democracy but did not undermine at all the social situation and powers of this old-line conservative elite . that conservative elite , after the initial flurry of revolution , challenged the republic every step of the way .
many of the focal points of conflict were not just in the political sphere but in the cultural and social sphere as well .
there was , for example , the so-called " zehlendorf roof wars " in which conservatives , architects , and critics - nazis as well - claimed that the flat roofs of modern architectural style was distinctly un-german and true german architecture had pitched roofs .
these critics would charge that flat roofs were a form of jewish architecture .
the emancipation of women in the 1920s and very active talk of erotic fulfillment was another focal point of intense conflict . would you say the weimar republic was an early victim of globalization ?
do you think it would have survived if the great depression of 1929 had n't occurred ? the great depression was the final blow .
if we look at the economy and the election of 1928 just prior to the onset of the great depression , we can see a move back to the center politically and signs of serious economic progress .
this is the last year of the so-called fabled golden years of the republic .
without the depression , the republic would at least have had a chance .
it had managed to survive the hyperinflation of 1923 , as disruptive and disorienting as that event was .
but it was the depression that came from the united states to germany very fast and very strongly that certainly unleashed the final blow . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : hyperinflation in 1923 made german currency worthless and sparked an economic crisis at the same time we should not forget that few democracies have been founded in such difficult circumstances as the weimar republic .
the republic needed a long breathing space , it needed a more expansive and forgiving attitude on the part of the western allies , it needed economic stability and progress - all of that was in precious short supply in the post-world war i years . what led finally to the demise of democracy in the weimar republic ?
after all , in the 1928 general election , the nazis won just 2.6 percent of the vote ; five years later hitler was in power . it 's true , in 1928 , the nazi party was a marginal , unimportant political group which had very little resonance beyond some very distinctive places that were already in depression before the great depression - agricultural areas in particular .
but in many ways , the republic was seriously undermined and the political system paralyzed prior to the nazi seizure of power .
in a depression especially , people look for solutions and the republic was not offering any to the economic crisis .
from 1930 onwards , germany was governed under a presidential dictatorship because the political system was so fragmented that the reichstag could not assemble or function in parliamentary majority .
so the chancellor from spring of 1930 onwards , heinrich brüning and his successors , governed largely through emergency powers proclaimed by the president , field marshall paul von hindenburg . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the nazis never received a majority vote but i do want to underscore the fact that the nazis never received a majority vote in a popular , freely contested election .
in the summer of 1932 , they received 37.4 percent of the vote - the highest they would ever receive .
it 's a significant jump to be sure but that 's not a majority and the popular phrase that one hears so often in the united states , " the german people elected hitler to power or elected the nazis to power " - that 's wrong , it 's inaccurate , it 's untrue .
the nazis were never elected to power .
in the next election , in the fall of 1932 , they already lost a significant percentage of the support they had gained in the summer .
the nazi party was in disarray .
at the very end , they came to power because the establishment conservative elite , a coterie of powerful men around president hindenburg , handed power over to the nazis .
that alliance is what ultimately killed the republic . what lessons can be drawn from the weimar republic ?
implied throughout your book is the question of whether it is possible for contemporary democracies to succumb to neo-fascist forces in the same way that the weimar republic fell to the nazis . present day germany is a well-established democratic system .
it gives me no worries whatsoever .
to be sure there are some extreme right-wing groups that can be dangerous and the reaction against them is still a little slow sometimes .
but these groups are marginal and berlin is not weimar . my worries are more about my own country , the us , in the sense that the threats to democracy do n't always come from abroad .
the most dangerous threat may come from within .
that was certainly the case in weimar , especially in its last years .
what worries me is when certain people or institutions mouth talk of democracy but in reality undermine the very practices of democracy .
of course the nazis were never committed to democracy but they used the populist rhetoric that resonated with people .
when that kind of populist rhetoric masks undemocratic practices , that 's where i think we truly need to be concerned . the analogy that does worry me greatly is when establishment conservatives make radical conservatives salonfähig or in colloquial english " acceptable in polite society . "
i think to a certain extent that indeed has occurred in the united states .
when establishment conservatives go beyond the bounds of legitimate democratic discourse and constitutional provisions and make the program , the individuals and ideas of radical conservatives acceptable - that 's when we 're in trouble . in recent months , there seems to be a revival of interest in the weimar republic in the united states , whether it 's in fashion , art or music .
how do you explain that ? bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : a 1922 work by george grosz it 's been most curious .
and it 's true especially in new york .
i think it has to do with the sense of fragility that comes out of the sept .
11 attacks .
what people adopt is the weimar republic as portrayed in the american production of " cabaret " for example - there 's a vision of weimar as degenerate , as crisis-ridden all of which is true in part .
there was an exhibit at the metropolitan museum on weimar portraiture featuring otto dix und george grosz .
of course , if that 's all you know , you think of weimar as a period of only mutilated bodies and distorted features .
but what that interpretation misses of course is the democratic promise , the cultural innovation .
but it is that sense of fragility that has given weimar this glow in downtown as well as uptown new york culture . interview : sonia phalnikar send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

" i will concentrate my efforts on trying to do this as quickly as possible , " the 74-year-old said on wednesday , jan 30 , after meeting with the president . after consulting leaders across the political spectrum , napolitano decided in favor of an interim government this week .
he has said that he wants the interim administration to change the electoral system , widely blamed for fueling italy 's political instability , before any new parliamentary elections . berlusconi eager for snap polls napolitano 's stance flies in the face of berlusconi 's argument that early elections are the only way out of the political deadlock . the leader of the forza italia party , as well as other conservative politicians , did not want the president to back a transitional government . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : berlusconi hopes to get back to power soon if snap polls are held berlusconi served as prime minister for five years - a record in postwar italy - and is eager to avenge his 2006 defeat to prodi .
he is likely to return to power if there is an early vote , according to recent polls showing the conservatives holding as much as a 10 percent lead over their rivals . " we believe there is no other way than returning to the polls and giving the country a government as soon as possible , a government that is immediately operational , " berlusconi said . italy 's latest political crisis erupted after prime minister romano prodi was forced to resign following the withdrawal of support by a centrist party in his center-left coalition .
prodi thereupon lost a confidence vote in the senate . italy hamstrung by political crisis the political crisis - it was the collapse of the 61st italian government since world war ii - has left the euro zone 's third largest economy floundering at a time when the global economy is slowing .

" it 's hoped that marini 's neutral role as president of italy 's upper house of parliament may allow him to win cross-party support for reform of the current proportional representation system of voting . changes to the voting system were implemented by berlusconi during his time as prime minister and allow smaller parties with only a handful of seats to hold the balance of power in parliament .

michael ballack is the biggest german soccer star in years : success at home and abroad , captain of his country , immense wealth .
but has he done enough to be regarded as a legend should he retire at the tender age of 31 ? germans love their talismanic soccer players , especially those who can control games and lead with passion and by example .
germany 's soccer history is full of men who drove their nation towards greatness while sweeping all before them at club level .
most of them enjoyed hugely successful careers and finished their playing days having achieved everything , and in some cases more , than had been expected of them . michael ballack has always been expected to join the likes of beckenbauer , rummenigge , matthäus , et al. in the pantheon of german soccer greats .
ever since a young ballack first arrived on the professional soccer scene in 1995 , he has been spoken of in the most glowing of terms .
his destiny as a german legend has always been discussed in absolutes .
no one who has watched ballack 's rise has been anything other than convinced that he would become a german icon . so what , then , would all those observers make of news that ballack pack it in in a year 's time and end a career that has yet to reach the heights expected of it ? ballack hints at early retirement " what comes when my contract expires , we 'll just have to see , " british media have quoted him as saying .
" whether i stay another year , go somewhere else or hang up my boots - you never know in soccer . " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : ballack waxed lyrical about hanging up his boots in a year while the player himself has not actually confirmed that this statement , reported in his adopted homeland of the uk this week , is a sign of his impending retirement at the end of the 2008/2009 season , the mere fact that he has spoken of ending his career at the young age of 31 raises questions about ballack 's legacy . from those early days at fc chemnitzer , where his precocious , driving midfield performances led to a transfer to the bundesliga 's kaiserslautern and then leverkusen , through his trophy-laden days at bayern munich to his multi-million-euro move to chelsea , ballack has been reaching for the status and titles which would assure his place in germany 's history . trophy haul lacking international sparkle ballack has collected a fair haul of silverware in his time , picking up four bundesliga titles , three german cups and one league cup with bayern munich and an fa cup and league cup in england with chelsea .
but , one champions league runners-up medal aside , ballack has yet to make his stamp on european club soccer like those his legendary compatriots left behind . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the premiership has proved a real challenge to ballack if his career ends in the blue of chelsea , will observers look back and wonder whether ballack would have achieved more at , say , real madrid or either of the milan teams ? it was obvious in his first year in london that the premiership was a more brutal and quicker beast than the bundesliga he had been used to .
ballack 's clever eye and languid style may have flourished faster and with more confidence in the slower italian league and the spanish game may have suited his creative flair .
who knows what he could have achieved if he had moved to either country from bayern munich in 2006 ? ballack 's collection of consolation trophies away from the domestic and european scene , ballack has also been building a legacy on the international level .
since making his germany debut in 1999 , ballack has won 77 caps and scored 35 goals .
he has played in two world cup semi-finals - missing out on the 2002 world cup final through suspension - and one confederations cup semi-final .
he has led his country as captain since 2004 . and yet , for all the celebrations and plaudits , germany have not won an international tournament since the 1996 european championships .
ballack has led the side in some great victories but as yet , none of these victories resulted in a trophy -lsb- other than a third-place consolation -rsb- being lifted by the captain . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : can ballack end his international career with glory ?
so what would ballack be leaving behind in terms of a record if he were to retire in a year 's time ?
well , he could spend his free time polishing a clutch of german domestic trophies , a couple of english cups and a handful of reminders of some international near-misses .
but would this be enough to warrant his own pedestal in germany 's hall of fame ? compared with franz beckenbauer 's one world cup , one european championship and three european cups , rummenigge 's one european championship and two european cups , and matthäus with his one world cup and one european championship , ballack would struggle to make the list in terms of significant titles . ballack 's performances rate highly - but high enough ? trophies aside , could any of ballack 's individual performances stand out in much the same way as the kaiser 's mercurial domination of the 1974 world cup final , or the way matthäus outshone maradona in the 1990 final in rome ? bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : ballack 's performances in the 2002 world cup made him a star the closest would be his performances during the 2002 world cup - among his finest in a germany jersey .
it would not be an exaggeration to say ballack won the quarter and semi-finals for his country on his own , not only through his deciding goals but through his overall commitment .
again , would this be enough ? if ballack does retire without any further major honors to his name and a season of workmanlike performances behind him , he will forever be known as a " good " german player .

michael ballack is the biggest german soccer star in years : success at home and abroad , captain of his country , immense wealth .
but has he done enough to be regarded as a legend should he retire at the tender age of 31 ? germans love their talismanic soccer players , especially those who can control games and lead with passion and by example .
germany 's soccer history is full of men who drove their nation towards greatness while sweeping all before them at club level .
most of them enjoyed hugely successful careers and finished their playing days having achieved everything , and in some cases more , than had been expected of them . michael ballack has always been expected to join the likes of beckenbauer , rummenigge , matthäus , et al. in the pantheon of german soccer greats .
ever since a young ballack first arrived on the professional soccer scene in 1995 , he has been spoken of in the most glowing of terms .
his destiny as a german legend has always been discussed in absolutes .
no one who has watched ballack 's rise has been anything other than convinced that he would become a german icon . so what , then , would all those observers make of news that ballack pack it in in a year 's time and end a career that has yet to reach the heights expected of it ? ballack hints at early retirement " what comes when my contract expires , we 'll just have to see , " british media have quoted him as saying .
" whether i stay another year , go somewhere else or hang up my boots - you never know in soccer . " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : ballack waxed lyrical about hanging up his boots in a year while the player himself has not actually confirmed that this statement , reported in his adopted homeland of the uk this week , is a sign of his impending retirement at the end of the 2008/2009 season , the mere fact that he has spoken of ending his career at the young age of 31 raises questions about ballack 's legacy . from those early days at fc chemnitzer , where his precocious , driving midfield performances led to a transfer to the bundesliga 's kaiserslautern and then leverkusen , through his trophy-laden days at bayern munich to his multi-million-euro move to chelsea , ballack has been reaching for the status and titles which would assure his place in germany 's history . trophy haul lacking international sparkle ballack has collected a fair haul of silverware in his time , picking up four bundesliga titles , three german cups and one league cup with bayern munich and an fa cup and league cup in england with chelsea .
but , one champions league runners-up medal aside , ballack has yet to make his stamp on european club soccer like those his legendary compatriots left behind . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the premiership has proved a real challenge to ballack if his career ends in the blue of chelsea , will observers look back and wonder whether ballack would have achieved more at , say , real madrid or either of the milan teams ? it was obvious in his first year in london that the premiership was a more brutal and quicker beast than the bundesliga he had been used to .
ballack 's clever eye and languid style may have flourished faster and with more confidence in the slower italian league and the spanish game may have suited his creative flair .
who knows what he could have achieved if he had moved to either country from bayern munich in 2006 ? ballack 's collection of consolation trophies away from the domestic and european scene , ballack has also been building a legacy on the international level .
since making his germany debut in 1999 , ballack has won 77 caps and scored 35 goals .
he has played in two world cup semi-finals - missing out on the 2002 world cup final through suspension - and one confederations cup semi-final .
he has led his country as captain since 2004 . and yet , for all the celebrations and plaudits , germany have not won an international tournament since the 1996 european championships .
ballack has led the side in some great victories but as yet , none of these victories resulted in a trophy -lsb- other than a third-place consolation -rsb- being lifted by the captain . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : can ballack end his international career with glory ?
so what would ballack be leaving behind in terms of a record if he were to retire in a year 's time ?
well , he could spend his free time polishing a clutch of german domestic trophies , a couple of english cups and a handful of reminders of some international near-misses .
but would this be enough to warrant his own pedestal in germany 's hall of fame ? compared with franz beckenbauer 's one world cup , one european championship and three european cups , rummenigge 's one european championship and two european cups , and matthäus with his one world cup and one european championship , ballack would struggle to make the list in terms of significant titles . ballack 's performances rate highly - but high enough ? trophies aside , could any of ballack 's individual performances stand out in much the same way as the kaiser 's mercurial domination of the 1974 world cup final , or the way matthäus outshone maradona in the 1990 final in rome ? bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : ballack 's performances in the 2002 world cup made him a star the closest would be his performances during the 2002 world cup - among his finest in a germany jersey .
it would not be an exaggeration to say ballack won the quarter and semi-finals for his country on his own , not only through his deciding goals but through his overall commitment .
again , would this be enough ? if ballack does retire without any further major honors to his name and a season of workmanlike performances behind him , he will forever be known as a " good " german player .
by prolonging his career past this hypothetical end-date and giving himself more opportunities to show what he can clearly do very well when the mood takes him , michael ballack could still be in with a chance of joining the greats . nick amies send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

the survey showed that more than half of all germans were too fat , with two-thirds of all men and 51 percent of women officially overweight .

afghan president karzai sees the proposed increase of troops in the country as unnecessary . a day after it was officially confirmed that nato had made a request to the german defense ministry to provide 250 combat troops to a quick reaction force in northern afghanistan , former nato chief of staff harald kujat warned that german soldiers were ill-equipped to deal with combat operations against the taliban and al qaeda insurgents . kujat , a former chairperson of nato 's military committee , deplored the lack of adequate hardware at the disposal of the german military and said on wednesday , jan .

afghan president karzai sees the proposed increase of troops in the country as unnecessary . a day after it was officially confirmed that nato had made a request to the german defense ministry to provide 250 combat troops to a quick reaction force in northern afghanistan , former nato chief of staff harald kujat warned that german soldiers were ill-equipped to deal with combat operations against the taliban and al qaeda insurgents . kujat , a former chairperson of nato 's military committee , deplored the lack of adequate hardware at the disposal of the german military and said on wednesday , jan .
30 , that bundeswehr troops " did not even have functioning devices , with which they could communicate with their allies in afghanistan . " nato submitted a formal request on tuesday for germany to provide a replacement for the 350-strong norwegian force that leaves in july after an initial inquiry had been made late last year . the german defense ministry confirmed earlier this month that it was considering whether to deploy the troops , responding to a media report that referred to a " new quality " in the german engagement in afghanistan . government officials have , however , in recent weeks denied that supplying a rapid reaction force would amount to sending men into combat .
they said the force was designed to provide emergency support to other troops in the north and that though its brief would include hunting " terrorists " and dealing with kidnappings this would not be its main task . inadequate equipment could cost lives bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : soldiers could be at risk from lack of equipment kujat called on german defense minister franz josef jung to prevent such a deployment as the inadequacy of german military equipment and lack of necessary supplies could lead to casualties , in addition to those which would come from engaging the enemy . he maintained that the soldiers themselves were well-trained and qualified to deal with the challenges of combat but the serious deficits in modern and efficient guidance systems and communication devices could negate their skills as soldiers . jung was in kabul for discussions with afghan president hamid karzai on tuesday , and made it clear that german soldiers were " ready to participate in operations against terrorists and cooperate with other international forces in any other part of the country . " reacting to the news that nato planned to send more troops to his country to counter the threat of a resurgent taliban back by supporters of al qaeda , karzai said training the afghan police and army was more important than sending more foreign troops to the country . karzai doubts wisdom of sending more troops bildunterschrift : president karzai advocated more investment in the afghan police and army " more than anything else , we need help to rebuild our human capital and our institutions , our army , our police force , our administrative structure , our judiciary and so on , " karzai told german newspaper die welt on wednesday . " although the situation has finally improved , the unintentional bombing of afghan civilians by nato and us troops is particularly painful , although it stems from a lack of ground troops , " he added .
" however , i am not sure that sending more troops is the right answer . " the western alliance already has around 37,000 troops deployed in the country .
nato commanders say they need some 7,500 extra troops to carry out their mission as they battle the taliban .
afghanistan 's army currently numbers 58,000 troops , with a target of 70,000 . karzai said he had the impression that the war " is not happening here , " but was being exported to afghanistan from other countries . " we should concentrate on the sanctuaries and the training camps , " he said .
" afghanistan is not a sanctuary .
it was one , but we have taken it back . " focus should shift to pakistan bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : taliban fighters are thought to be re-grouping in pakistan most concern focuses on the mountainous border area with pakistan , where afghan and western forces believe taliban extremists regroup to launch attacks in southern afghanistan . karzai said his recent meeting with pakistan 's under-pressure president pervez musharraf had been " very constructive . " " my hope is that pakistan will take harder and clearer measures in the future and thus becomes a region where extremism is no longer used as a political instrument , " he was quoted as saying .

" i will concentrate my efforts on trying to do this as quickly as possible , " the 74-year-old said on wednesday , jan 30 , after meeting with the president . after consulting leaders across the political spectrum , napolitano decided in favor of an interim government this week .
he has said that he wants the interim administration to change the electoral system , widely blamed for fueling italy 's political instability , before any new parliamentary elections . berlusconi eager for snap polls napolitano 's stance flies in the face of berlusconi 's argument that early elections are the only way out of the political deadlock . the leader of the forza italia party , as well as other conservative politicians , did not want the president to back a transitional government . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : berlusconi hopes to get back to power soon if snap polls are held berlusconi served as prime minister for five years - a record in postwar italy - and is eager to avenge his 2006 defeat to prodi .
he is likely to return to power if there is an early vote , according to recent polls showing the conservatives holding as much as a 10 percent lead over their rivals . " we believe there is no other way than returning to the polls and giving the country a government as soon as possible , a government that is immediately operational , " berlusconi said . italy 's latest political crisis erupted after prime minister romano prodi was forced to resign following the withdrawal of support by a centrist party in his center-left coalition .
prodi thereupon lost a confidence vote in the senate . italy hamstrung by political crisis the political crisis - it was the collapse of the 61st italian government since world war ii - has left the euro zone 's third largest economy floundering at a time when the global economy is slowing .
italian business and consumer confidence is at its lowest for at least two years . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : napolitano is determined to overhaul italy 's electoral practices italian industry leader , luca cordero di montezemolo told reuters , italy desperately needed " governability and economic growth ... both require united efforts towards a shared solution . " it 's hoped that marini 's neutral role as president of italy 's upper house of parliament may allow him to win cross-party support for reform of the current proportional representation system of voting . changes to the voting system were implemented by berlusconi during his time as prime minister and allow smaller parties with only a handful of seats to hold the balance of power in parliament .

michael ballack is the biggest german soccer star in years : success at home and abroad , captain of his country , immense wealth .
but has he done enough to be regarded as a legend should he retire at the tender age of 31 ? germans love their talismanic soccer players , especially those who can control games and lead with passion and by example .
germany 's soccer history is full of men who drove their nation towards greatness while sweeping all before them at club level .
most of them enjoyed hugely successful careers and finished their playing days having achieved everything , and in some cases more , than had been expected of them . michael ballack has always been expected to join the likes of beckenbauer , rummenigge , matthäus , et al. in the pantheon of german soccer greats .
ever since a young ballack first arrived on the professional soccer scene in 1995 , he has been spoken of in the most glowing of terms .
his destiny as a german legend has always been discussed in absolutes .
no one who has watched ballack 's rise has been anything other than convinced that he would become a german icon . so what , then , would all those observers make of news that ballack pack it in in a year 's time and end a career that has yet to reach the heights expected of it ? ballack hints at early retirement " what comes when my contract expires , we 'll just have to see , " british media have quoted him as saying .
" whether i stay another year , go somewhere else or hang up my boots - you never know in soccer . " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : ballack waxed lyrical about hanging up his boots in a year while the player himself has not actually confirmed that this statement , reported in his adopted homeland of the uk this week , is a sign of his impending retirement at the end of the 2008/2009 season , the mere fact that he has spoken of ending his career at the young age of 31 raises questions about ballack 's legacy . from those early days at fc chemnitzer , where his precocious , driving midfield performances led to a transfer to the bundesliga 's kaiserslautern and then leverkusen , through his trophy-laden days at bayern munich to his multi-million-euro move to chelsea , ballack has been reaching for the status and titles which would assure his place in germany 's history . trophy haul lacking international sparkle ballack has collected a fair haul of silverware in his time , picking up four bundesliga titles , three german cups and one league cup with bayern munich and an fa cup and league cup in england with chelsea .
but , one champions league runners-up medal aside , ballack has yet to make his stamp on european club soccer like those his legendary compatriots left behind . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the premiership has proved a real challenge to ballack if his career ends in the blue of chelsea , will observers look back and wonder whether ballack would have achieved more at , say , real madrid or either of the milan teams ? it was obvious in his first year in london that the premiership was a more brutal and quicker beast than the bundesliga he had been used to .
ballack 's clever eye and languid style may have flourished faster and with more confidence in the slower italian league and the spanish game may have suited his creative flair .
who knows what he could have achieved if he had moved to either country from bayern munich in 2006 ? ballack 's collection of consolation trophies away from the domestic and european scene , ballack has also been building a legacy on the international level .
since making his germany debut in 1999 , ballack has won 77 caps and scored 35 goals .
he has played in two world cup semi-finals - missing out on the 2002 world cup final through suspension - and one confederations cup semi-final .
he has led his country as captain since 2004 . and yet , for all the celebrations and plaudits , germany have not won an international tournament since the 1996 european championships .
ballack has led the side in some great victories but as yet , none of these victories resulted in a trophy -lsb- other than a third-place consolation -rsb- being lifted by the captain . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : can ballack end his international career with glory ?
so what would ballack be leaving behind in terms of a record if he were to retire in a year 's time ?
well , he could spend his free time polishing a clutch of german domestic trophies , a couple of english cups and a handful of reminders of some international near-misses .
but would this be enough to warrant his own pedestal in germany 's hall of fame ? compared with franz beckenbauer 's one world cup , one european championship and three european cups , rummenigge 's one european championship and two european cups , and matthäus with his one world cup and one european championship , ballack would struggle to make the list in terms of significant titles . ballack 's performances rate highly - but high enough ? trophies aside , could any of ballack 's individual performances stand out in much the same way as the kaiser 's mercurial domination of the 1974 world cup final , or the way matthäus outshone maradona in the 1990 final in rome ? bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : ballack 's performances in the 2002 world cup made him a star the closest would be his performances during the 2002 world cup - among his finest in a germany jersey .
it would not be an exaggeration to say ballack won the quarter and semi-finals for his country on his own , not only through his deciding goals but through his overall commitment .
again , would this be enough ? if ballack does retire without any further major honors to his name and a season of workmanlike performances behind him , he will forever be known as a " good " german player .
by prolonging his career past this hypothetical end-date and giving himself more opportunities to show what he can clearly do very well when the mood takes him , michael ballack could still be in with a chance of joining the greats . nick amies send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

michael ballack is the biggest german soccer star in years : success at home and abroad , captain of his country , immense wealth .
but has he done enough to be regarded as a legend should he retire at the tender age of 31 ? germans love their talismanic soccer players , especially those who can control games and lead with passion and by example .
germany 's soccer history is full of men who drove their nation towards greatness while sweeping all before them at club level .
most of them enjoyed hugely successful careers and finished their playing days having achieved everything , and in some cases more , than had been expected of them . michael ballack has always been expected to join the likes of beckenbauer , rummenigge , matthäus , et al. in the pantheon of german soccer greats .
ever since a young ballack first arrived on the professional soccer scene in 1995 , he has been spoken of in the most glowing of terms .
his destiny as a german legend has always been discussed in absolutes .
no one who has watched ballack 's rise has been anything other than convinced that he would become a german icon . so what , then , would all those observers make of news that ballack pack it in in a year 's time and end a career that has yet to reach the heights expected of it ? ballack hints at early retirement " what comes when my contract expires , we 'll just have to see , " british media have quoted him as saying .
" whether i stay another year , go somewhere else or hang up my boots - you never know in soccer . " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : ballack waxed lyrical about hanging up his boots in a year while the player himself has not actually confirmed that this statement , reported in his adopted homeland of the uk this week , is a sign of his impending retirement at the end of the 2008/2009 season , the mere fact that he has spoken of ending his career at the young age of 31 raises questions about ballack 's legacy . from those early days at fc chemnitzer , where his precocious , driving midfield performances led to a transfer to the bundesliga 's kaiserslautern and then leverkusen , through his trophy-laden days at bayern munich to his multi-million-euro move to chelsea , ballack has been reaching for the status and titles which would assure his place in germany 's history . trophy haul lacking international sparkle ballack has collected a fair haul of silverware in his time , picking up four bundesliga titles , three german cups and one league cup with bayern munich and an fa cup and league cup in england with chelsea .
but , one champions league runners-up medal aside , ballack has yet to make his stamp on european club soccer like those his legendary compatriots left behind . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the premiership has proved a real challenge to ballack if his career ends in the blue of chelsea , will observers look back and wonder whether ballack would have achieved more at , say , real madrid or either of the milan teams ? it was obvious in his first year in london that the premiership was a more brutal and quicker beast than the bundesliga he had been used to .
ballack 's clever eye and languid style may have flourished faster and with more confidence in the slower italian league and the spanish game may have suited his creative flair .
who knows what he could have achieved if he had moved to either country from bayern munich in 2006 ? ballack 's collection of consolation trophies away from the domestic and european scene , ballack has also been building a legacy on the international level .
since making his germany debut in 1999 , ballack has won 77 caps and scored 35 goals .
he has played in two world cup semi-finals - missing out on the 2002 world cup final through suspension - and one confederations cup semi-final .
he has led his country as captain since 2004 . and yet , for all the celebrations and plaudits , germany have not won an international tournament since the 1996 european championships .
ballack has led the side in some great victories but as yet , none of these victories resulted in a trophy -lsb- other than a third-place consolation -rsb- being lifted by the captain . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : can ballack end his international career with glory ?
so what would ballack be leaving behind in terms of a record if he were to retire in a year 's time ?
well , he could spend his free time polishing a clutch of german domestic trophies , a couple of english cups and a handful of reminders of some international near-misses .
but would this be enough to warrant his own pedestal in germany 's hall of fame ? compared with franz beckenbauer 's one world cup , one european championship and three european cups , rummenigge 's one european championship and two european cups , and matthäus with his one world cup and one european championship , ballack would struggle to make the list in terms of significant titles . ballack 's performances rate highly - but high enough ? trophies aside , could any of ballack 's individual performances stand out in much the same way as the kaiser 's mercurial domination of the 1974 world cup final , or the way matthäus outshone maradona in the 1990 final in rome ? bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : ballack 's performances in the 2002 world cup made him a star the closest would be his performances during the 2002 world cup - among his finest in a germany jersey .

did germany 's experiment with democracy between 1919 and 1933 ever stand a real chance ?
eric weitz , a us historian and author , has the answers . on jan .
30 , 1933 , hitler was named german chancellor , spelling the end to the weimar republic - germany 's convulsive experiment with democracy between 1919 and 1933 .
the period was dubbed the " weimar republic " by historians in honor of the city of weimar , where a national assembly convened to write and adopt a new constitution for the german reich following the nation 's defeat in world war i. the weimar republic was marked on the one hand by hyperinflation , mass unemployment and political instability ; on the other , by dazzling creativity in the arts and sciences and a legendary nightlife in berlin . eric weitz , chairman of the history department at the university of minnesota in the united states , last year published an acclaimed book on the period : " weimar germany : promise and tragedy . "
dw-world.de spoke with him about the spirit of the time , the factors leading to the nazi seizure of power and the lessons to be drawn from the weimar republic . dw-world.de : one of the premises of your book is that the weimar republic should not be seen simply as a prelude to nazi dictatorship but as an era in its own right . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : weitz argues that the weimar republic should be valued in its own right eric weitz : it certainly should be seen as an era in its own right .
the weimar republic was a wonderfully creative period .
we should not constantly look back from the 12 years of the third reich to the 14 years of the weimar republic because the republic was a period of very important political , cultural and social innovation .
we need to remember and value it in its own right .
every issue about the weimar republic , about life in germany in the 1920s was intensely debated - both at the high intellectual and artistic level as well at the level of politics and society . how do you explain the cultural and artistic blossoming in germany , and particularly in berlin , in the 1920s ?
after all , this was a nation battered by war , with millions of dead , and plagued by hyperinflation and instability . the intense innovation of weimar is related precisely to these factors .
many people focus exclusively on the despair that came out of world war i. there was despair in abundance to be sure .
two million germans died in world war i , 4 million were wounded , and men who came back were often severely wounded , both physically and psychologically .
women at the home front during the war , experienced four years of intense privation .
and afterwards there came the post-war crisis - readjustment and hyperinflation . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : otto dix , who created this work in 1920 , was one of the prominent german artists of the weimar republic but to a certain extent , that intense instability of economy , society and politics fuelled this deep intellectual engagement with the problems of living in the modern age , of what should be germany 's political configuration .
but beyond that , the revolution of 1918/19 was crucial to this cultural efflorescence as well .
the revolution threw out the kaiser and established a democratic system - the most democratic system the germans had lived under to that point .
the spirit of revolution created a sense that the future was open , it was one of unbounded possibilities that it could be shaped in a more humanitarian way .
it could not last forever , but it 's that sense that underpins much of the cultural innovation of the republic . yet there were people in germany who hated the weimar republic .
who were they ?
and why did they want it to fail if it was so promising and attractive ? everything about the weimar republic was contested .
the kinds of artists , thinkers , architects whom i focus on in the book - much or all of their work was intensely challenged from the right .
by that i mean the establishment right - the old-line aristocrats , high government officials , army officers , businessmen , bankers , people from the church who by and large were not only anti-socialist and anti-communist but anti-democratic as well .
the revolution in 1918/19 left their powers intact by and large .
it established a political democracy but did not undermine at all the social situation and powers of this old-line conservative elite . that conservative elite , after the initial flurry of revolution , challenged the republic every step of the way .
many of the focal points of conflict were not just in the political sphere but in the cultural and social sphere as well .
there was , for example , the so-called " zehlendorf roof wars " in which conservatives , architects , and critics - nazis as well - claimed that the flat roofs of modern architectural style was distinctly un-german and true german architecture had pitched roofs .
these critics would charge that flat roofs were a form of jewish architecture .
the emancipation of women in the 1920s and very active talk of erotic fulfillment was another focal point of intense conflict . would you say the weimar republic was an early victim of globalization ?
do you think it would have survived if the great depression of 1929 had n't occurred ? the great depression was the final blow .
if we look at the economy and the election of 1928 just prior to the onset of the great depression , we can see a move back to the center politically and signs of serious economic progress .
this is the last year of the so-called fabled golden years of the republic .
without the depression , the republic would at least have had a chance .
it had managed to survive the hyperinflation of 1923 , as disruptive and disorienting as that event was .
but it was the depression that came from the united states to germany very fast and very strongly that certainly unleashed the final blow . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : hyperinflation in 1923 made german currency worthless and sparked an economic crisis at the same time we should not forget that few democracies have been founded in such difficult circumstances as the weimar republic .
the republic needed a long breathing space , it needed a more expansive and forgiving attitude on the part of the western allies , it needed economic stability and progress - all of that was in precious short supply in the post-world war i years . what led finally to the demise of democracy in the weimar republic ?
after all , in the 1928 general election , the nazis won just 2.6 percent of the vote ; five years later hitler was in power . it 's true , in 1928 , the nazi party was a marginal , unimportant political group which had very little resonance beyond some very distinctive places that were already in depression before the great depression - agricultural areas in particular .
but in many ways , the republic was seriously undermined and the political system paralyzed prior to the nazi seizure of power .
in a depression especially , people look for solutions and the republic was not offering any to the economic crisis .
from 1930 onwards , germany was governed under a presidential dictatorship because the political system was so fragmented that the reichstag could not assemble or function in parliamentary majority .
so the chancellor from spring of 1930 onwards , heinrich brüning and his successors , governed largely through emergency powers proclaimed by the president , field marshall paul von hindenburg . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the nazis never received a majority vote but i do want to underscore the fact that the nazis never received a majority vote in a popular , freely contested election .
in the summer of 1932 , they received 37.4 percent of the vote - the highest they would ever receive .
it 's a significant jump to be sure but that 's not a majority and the popular phrase that one hears so often in the united states , " the german people elected hitler to power or elected the nazis to power " - that 's wrong , it 's inaccurate , it 's untrue .
the nazis were never elected to power .
in the next election , in the fall of 1932 , they already lost a significant percentage of the support they had gained in the summer .
the nazi party was in disarray .
at the very end , they came to power because the establishment conservative elite , a coterie of powerful men around president hindenburg , handed power over to the nazis .
that alliance is what ultimately killed the republic . what lessons can be drawn from the weimar republic ?
implied throughout your book is the question of whether it is possible for contemporary democracies to succumb to neo-fascist forces in the same way that the weimar republic fell to the nazis . present day germany is a well-established democratic system .
it gives me no worries whatsoever .
to be sure there are some extreme right-wing groups that can be dangerous and the reaction against them is still a little slow sometimes .
but these groups are marginal and berlin is not weimar . my worries are more about my own country , the us , in the sense that the threats to democracy do n't always come from abroad .
the most dangerous threat may come from within .
that was certainly the case in weimar , especially in its last years .
what worries me is when certain people or institutions mouth talk of democracy but in reality undermine the very practices of democracy .
of course the nazis were never committed to democracy but they used the populist rhetoric that resonated with people .
when that kind of populist rhetoric masks undemocratic practices , that 's where i think we truly need to be concerned . the analogy that does worry me greatly is when establishment conservatives make radical conservatives salonfähig or in colloquial english " acceptable in polite society . "
i think to a certain extent that indeed has occurred in the united states .
when establishment conservatives go beyond the bounds of legitimate democratic discourse and constitutional provisions and make the program , the individuals and ideas of radical conservatives acceptable - that 's when we 're in trouble . in recent months , there seems to be a revival of interest in the weimar republic in the united states , whether it 's in fashion , art or music .
how do you explain that ? bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : a 1922 work by george grosz it 's been most curious .
and it 's true especially in new york .
i think it has to do with the sense of fragility that comes out of the sept .
11 attacks .
what people adopt is the weimar republic as portrayed in the american production of " cabaret " for example - there 's a vision of weimar as degenerate , as crisis-ridden all of which is true in part .
there was an exhibit at the metropolitan museum on weimar portraiture featuring otto dix und george grosz .
of course , if that 's all you know , you think of weimar as a period of only mutilated bodies and distorted features .
but what that interpretation misses of course is the democratic promise , the cultural innovation .
but it is that sense of fragility that has given weimar this glow in downtown as well as uptown new york culture . interview : sonia phalnikar send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

by that i mean the establishment right - the old-line aristocrats , high government officials , army officers , businessmen , bankers , people from the church who by and large were not only anti-socialist and anti-communist but anti-democratic as well .
the revolution in 1918/19 left their powers intact by and large .
it established a political democracy but did not undermine at all the social situation and powers of this old-line conservative elite . that conservative elite , after the initial flurry of revolution , challenged the republic every step of the way .
many of the focal points of conflict were not just in the political sphere but in the cultural and social sphere as well .
there was , for example , the so-called " zehlendorf roof wars " in which conservatives , architects , and critics - nazis as well - claimed that the flat roofs of modern architectural style was distinctly un-german and true german architecture had pitched roofs .
these critics would charge that flat roofs were a form of jewish architecture .
the emancipation of women in the 1920s and very active talk of erotic fulfillment was another focal point of intense conflict . would you say the weimar republic was an early victim of globalization ?
do you think it would have survived if the great depression of 1929 had n't occurred ? the great depression was the final blow .
if we look at the economy and the election of 1928 just prior to the onset of the great depression , we can see a move back to the center politically and signs of serious economic progress .
this is the last year of the so-called fabled golden years of the republic .
without the depression , the republic would at least have had a chance .
it had managed to survive the hyperinflation of 1923 , as disruptive and disorienting as that event was .
but it was the depression that came from the united states to germany very fast and very strongly that certainly unleashed the final blow . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : hyperinflation in 1923 made german currency worthless and sparked an economic crisis at the same time we should not forget that few democracies have been founded in such difficult circumstances as the weimar republic .
the republic needed a long breathing space , it needed a more expansive and forgiving attitude on the part of the western allies , it needed economic stability and progress - all of that was in precious short supply in the post-world war i years . what led finally to the demise of democracy in the weimar republic ?
after all , in the 1928 general election , the nazis won just 2.6 percent of the vote ; five years later hitler was in power . it 's true , in 1928 , the nazi party was a marginal , unimportant political group which had very little resonance beyond some very distinctive places that were already in depression before the great depression - agricultural areas in particular .
but in many ways , the republic was seriously undermined and the political system paralyzed prior to the nazi seizure of power .
in a depression especially , people look for solutions and the republic was not offering any to the economic crisis .
from 1930 onwards , germany was governed under a presidential dictatorship because the political system was so fragmented that the reichstag could not assemble or function in parliamentary majority .
so the chancellor from spring of 1930 onwards , heinrich brüning and his successors , governed largely through emergency powers proclaimed by the president , field marshall paul von hindenburg . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the nazis never received a majority vote but i do want to underscore the fact that the nazis never received a majority vote in a popular , freely contested election .
in the summer of 1932 , they received 37.4 percent of the vote - the highest they would ever receive .
it 's a significant jump to be sure but that 's not a majority and the popular phrase that one hears so often in the united states , " the german people elected hitler to power or elected the nazis to power " - that 's wrong , it 's inaccurate , it 's untrue .
the nazis were never elected to power .
in the next election , in the fall of 1932 , they already lost a significant percentage of the support they had gained in the summer .
the nazi party was in disarray .
at the very end , they came to power because the establishment conservative elite , a coterie of powerful men around president hindenburg , handed power over to the nazis .
that alliance is what ultimately killed the republic . what lessons can be drawn from the weimar republic ?
implied throughout your book is the question of whether it is possible for contemporary democracies to succumb to neo-fascist forces in the same way that the weimar republic fell to the nazis . present day germany is a well-established democratic system .
it gives me no worries whatsoever .
to be sure there are some extreme right-wing groups that can be dangerous and the reaction against them is still a little slow sometimes .
but these groups are marginal and berlin is not weimar . my worries are more about my own country , the us , in the sense that the threats to democracy do n't always come from abroad .
the most dangerous threat may come from within .
that was certainly the case in weimar , especially in its last years .
what worries me is when certain people or institutions mouth talk of democracy but in reality undermine the very practices of democracy .
of course the nazis were never committed to democracy but they used the populist rhetoric that resonated with people .
when that kind of populist rhetoric masks undemocratic practices , that 's where i think we truly need to be concerned . the analogy that does worry me greatly is when establishment conservatives make radical conservatives salonfähig or in colloquial english " acceptable in polite society . "
i think to a certain extent that indeed has occurred in the united states .
when establishment conservatives go beyond the bounds of legitimate democratic discourse and constitutional provisions and make the program , the individuals and ideas of radical conservatives acceptable - that 's when we 're in trouble . in recent months , there seems to be a revival of interest in the weimar republic in the united states , whether it 's in fashion , art or music .
how do you explain that ? bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : a 1922 work by george grosz it 's been most curious .
and it 's true especially in new york .
i think it has to do with the sense of fragility that comes out of the sept .

there was an exhibit at the metropolitan museum on weimar portraiture featuring otto dix und george grosz .
of course , if that 's all you know , you think of weimar as a period of only mutilated bodies and distorted features .
but what that interpretation misses of course is the democratic promise , the cultural innovation .
but it is that sense of fragility that has given weimar this glow in downtown as well as uptown new york culture . interview : sonia phalnikar send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

did germany 's experiment with democracy between 1919 and 1933 ever stand a real chance ?
eric weitz , a us historian and author , has the answers . on jan .
30 , 1933 , hitler was named german chancellor , spelling the end to the weimar republic - germany 's convulsive experiment with democracy between 1919 and 1933 .
the period was dubbed the " weimar republic " by historians in honor of the city of weimar , where a national assembly convened to write and adopt a new constitution for the german reich following the nation 's defeat in world war i. the weimar republic was marked on the one hand by hyperinflation , mass unemployment and political instability ; on the other , by dazzling creativity in the arts and sciences and a legendary nightlife in berlin . eric weitz , chairman of the history department at the university of minnesota in the united states , last year published an acclaimed book on the period : " weimar germany : promise and tragedy . "
dw-world.de spoke with him about the spirit of the time , the factors leading to the nazi seizure of power and the lessons to be drawn from the weimar republic . dw-world.de : one of the premises of your book is that the weimar republic should not be seen simply as a prelude to nazi dictatorship but as an era in its own right . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : weitz argues that the weimar republic should be valued in its own right eric weitz : it certainly should be seen as an era in its own right .
the weimar republic was a wonderfully creative period .
we should not constantly look back from the 12 years of the third reich to the 14 years of the weimar republic because the republic was a period of very important political , cultural and social innovation .
we need to remember and value it in its own right .
every issue about the weimar republic , about life in germany in the 1920s was intensely debated - both at the high intellectual and artistic level as well at the level of politics and society . how do you explain the cultural and artistic blossoming in germany , and particularly in berlin , in the 1920s ?
after all , this was a nation battered by war , with millions of dead , and plagued by hyperinflation and instability . the intense innovation of weimar is related precisely to these factors .
many people focus exclusively on the despair that came out of world war i. there was despair in abundance to be sure .
two million germans died in world war i , 4 million were wounded , and men who came back were often severely wounded , both physically and psychologically .
women at the home front during the war , experienced four years of intense privation .
and afterwards there came the post-war crisis - readjustment and hyperinflation . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : otto dix , who created this work in 1920 , was one of the prominent german artists of the weimar republic but to a certain extent , that intense instability of economy , society and politics fuelled this deep intellectual engagement with the problems of living in the modern age , of what should be germany 's political configuration .
but beyond that , the revolution of 1918/19 was crucial to this cultural efflorescence as well .
the revolution threw out the kaiser and established a democratic system - the most democratic system the germans had lived under to that point .
the spirit of revolution created a sense that the future was open , it was one of unbounded possibilities that it could be shaped in a more humanitarian way .
it could not last forever , but it 's that sense that underpins much of the cultural innovation of the republic . yet there were people in germany who hated the weimar republic .
who were they ?
and why did they want it to fail if it was so promising and attractive ? everything about the weimar republic was contested .
the kinds of artists , thinkers , architects whom i focus on in the book - much or all of their work was intensely challenged from the right .
by that i mean the establishment right - the old-line aristocrats , high government officials , army officers , businessmen , bankers , people from the church who by and large were not only anti-socialist and anti-communist but anti-democratic as well .

did germany 's experiment with democracy between 1919 and 1933 ever stand a real chance ?
eric weitz , a us historian and author , has the answers . on jan .
30 , 1933 , hitler was named german chancellor , spelling the end to the weimar republic - germany 's convulsive experiment with democracy between 1919 and 1933 .
the period was dubbed the " weimar republic " by historians in honor of the city of weimar , where a national assembly convened to write and adopt a new constitution for the german reich following the nation 's defeat in world war i. the weimar republic was marked on the one hand by hyperinflation , mass unemployment and political instability ; on the other , by dazzling creativity in the arts and sciences and a legendary nightlife in berlin . eric weitz , chairman of the history department at the university of minnesota in the united states , last year published an acclaimed book on the period : " weimar germany : promise and tragedy . "
dw-world.de spoke with him about the spirit of the time , the factors leading to the nazi seizure of power and the lessons to be drawn from the weimar republic . dw-world.de : one of the premises of your book is that the weimar republic should not be seen simply as a prelude to nazi dictatorship but as an era in its own right . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : weitz argues that the weimar republic should be valued in its own right eric weitz : it certainly should be seen as an era in its own right .
the weimar republic was a wonderfully creative period .
we should not constantly look back from the 12 years of the third reich to the 14 years of the weimar republic because the republic was a period of very important political , cultural and social innovation .
we need to remember and value it in its own right .
every issue about the weimar republic , about life in germany in the 1920s was intensely debated - both at the high intellectual and artistic level as well at the level of politics and society . how do you explain the cultural and artistic blossoming in germany , and particularly in berlin , in the 1920s ?
after all , this was a nation battered by war , with millions of dead , and plagued by hyperinflation and instability . the intense innovation of weimar is related precisely to these factors .
many people focus exclusively on the despair that came out of world war i. there was despair in abundance to be sure .
two million germans died in world war i , 4 million were wounded , and men who came back were often severely wounded , both physically and psychologically .
women at the home front during the war , experienced four years of intense privation .
and afterwards there came the post-war crisis - readjustment and hyperinflation . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : otto dix , who created this work in 1920 , was one of the prominent german artists of the weimar republic but to a certain extent , that intense instability of economy , society and politics fuelled this deep intellectual engagement with the problems of living in the modern age , of what should be germany 's political configuration .
but beyond that , the revolution of 1918/19 was crucial to this cultural efflorescence as well .
the revolution threw out the kaiser and established a democratic system - the most democratic system the germans had lived under to that point .
the spirit of revolution created a sense that the future was open , it was one of unbounded possibilities that it could be shaped in a more humanitarian way .
it could not last forever , but it 's that sense that underpins much of the cultural innovation of the republic . yet there were people in germany who hated the weimar republic .
who were they ?
and why did they want it to fail if it was so promising and attractive ? everything about the weimar republic was contested .
the kinds of artists , thinkers , architects whom i focus on in the book - much or all of their work was intensely challenged from the right .
by that i mean the establishment right - the old-line aristocrats , high government officials , army officers , businessmen , bankers , people from the church who by and large were not only anti-socialist and anti-communist but anti-democratic as well .
the revolution in 1918/19 left their powers intact by and large .
it established a political democracy but did not undermine at all the social situation and powers of this old-line conservative elite . that conservative elite , after the initial flurry of revolution , challenged the republic every step of the way .
many of the focal points of conflict were not just in the political sphere but in the cultural and social sphere as well .
there was , for example , the so-called " zehlendorf roof wars " in which conservatives , architects , and critics - nazis as well - claimed that the flat roofs of modern architectural style was distinctly un-german and true german architecture had pitched roofs .
these critics would charge that flat roofs were a form of jewish architecture .
the emancipation of women in the 1920s and very active talk of erotic fulfillment was another focal point of intense conflict . would you say the weimar republic was an early victim of globalization ?
do you think it would have survived if the great depression of 1929 had n't occurred ? the great depression was the final blow .
if we look at the economy and the election of 1928 just prior to the onset of the great depression , we can see a move back to the center politically and signs of serious economic progress .
this is the last year of the so-called fabled golden years of the republic .
without the depression , the republic would at least have had a chance .
it had managed to survive the hyperinflation of 1923 , as disruptive and disorienting as that event was .
but it was the depression that came from the united states to germany very fast and very strongly that certainly unleashed the final blow . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : hyperinflation in 1923 made german currency worthless and sparked an economic crisis at the same time we should not forget that few democracies have been founded in such difficult circumstances as the weimar republic .
the republic needed a long breathing space , it needed a more expansive and forgiving attitude on the part of the western allies , it needed economic stability and progress - all of that was in precious short supply in the post-world war i years . what led finally to the demise of democracy in the weimar republic ?
after all , in the 1928 general election , the nazis won just 2.6 percent of the vote ; five years later hitler was in power . it 's true , in 1928 , the nazi party was a marginal , unimportant political group which had very little resonance beyond some very distinctive places that were already in depression before the great depression - agricultural areas in particular .
but in many ways , the republic was seriously undermined and the political system paralyzed prior to the nazi seizure of power .
in a depression especially , people look for solutions and the republic was not offering any to the economic crisis .
from 1930 onwards , germany was governed under a presidential dictatorship because the political system was so fragmented that the reichstag could not assemble or function in parliamentary majority .
so the chancellor from spring of 1930 onwards , heinrich brüning and his successors , governed largely through emergency powers proclaimed by the president , field marshall paul von hindenburg . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the nazis never received a majority vote but i do want to underscore the fact that the nazis never received a majority vote in a popular , freely contested election .
in the summer of 1932 , they received 37.4 percent of the vote - the highest they would ever receive .
it 's a significant jump to be sure but that 's not a majority and the popular phrase that one hears so often in the united states , " the german people elected hitler to power or elected the nazis to power " - that 's wrong , it 's inaccurate , it 's untrue .
the nazis were never elected to power .
in the next election , in the fall of 1932 , they already lost a significant percentage of the support they had gained in the summer .
the nazi party was in disarray .
at the very end , they came to power because the establishment conservative elite , a coterie of powerful men around president hindenburg , handed power over to the nazis .
that alliance is what ultimately killed the republic . what lessons can be drawn from the weimar republic ?
implied throughout your book is the question of whether it is possible for contemporary democracies to succumb to neo-fascist forces in the same way that the weimar republic fell to the nazis . present day germany is a well-established democratic system .
it gives me no worries whatsoever .
to be sure there are some extreme right-wing groups that can be dangerous and the reaction against them is still a little slow sometimes .
but these groups are marginal and berlin is not weimar . my worries are more about my own country , the us , in the sense that the threats to democracy do n't always come from abroad .
the most dangerous threat may come from within .
that was certainly the case in weimar , especially in its last years .
what worries me is when certain people or institutions mouth talk of democracy but in reality undermine the very practices of democracy .
of course the nazis were never committed to democracy but they used the populist rhetoric that resonated with people .
when that kind of populist rhetoric masks undemocratic practices , that 's where i think we truly need to be concerned . the analogy that does worry me greatly is when establishment conservatives make radical conservatives salonfähig or in colloquial english " acceptable in polite society . "

afghan president karzai sees the proposed increase of troops in the country as unnecessary . a day after it was officially confirmed that nato had made a request to the german defense ministry to provide 250 combat troops to a quick reaction force in northern afghanistan , former nato chief of staff harald kujat warned that german soldiers were ill-equipped to deal with combat operations against the taliban and al qaeda insurgents . kujat , a former chairperson of nato 's military committee , deplored the lack of adequate hardware at the disposal of the german military and said on wednesday , jan .
30 , that bundeswehr troops " did not even have functioning devices , with which they could communicate with their allies in afghanistan . " nato submitted a formal request on tuesday for germany to provide a replacement for the 350-strong norwegian force that leaves in july after an initial inquiry had been made late last year . the german defense ministry confirmed earlier this month that it was considering whether to deploy the troops , responding to a media report that referred to a " new quality " in the german engagement in afghanistan . government officials have , however , in recent weeks denied that supplying a rapid reaction force would amount to sending men into combat .
they said the force was designed to provide emergency support to other troops in the north and that though its brief would include hunting " terrorists " and dealing with kidnappings this would not be its main task . inadequate equipment could cost lives bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : soldiers could be at risk from lack of equipment kujat called on german defense minister franz josef jung to prevent such a deployment as the inadequacy of german military equipment and lack of necessary supplies could lead to casualties , in addition to those which would come from engaging the enemy . he maintained that the soldiers themselves were well-trained and qualified to deal with the challenges of combat but the serious deficits in modern and efficient guidance systems and communication devices could negate their skills as soldiers . jung was in kabul for discussions with afghan president hamid karzai on tuesday , and made it clear that german soldiers were " ready to participate in operations against terrorists and cooperate with other international forces in any other part of the country . " reacting to the news that nato planned to send more troops to his country to counter the threat of a resurgent taliban back by supporters of al qaeda , karzai said training the afghan police and army was more important than sending more foreign troops to the country . karzai doubts wisdom of sending more troops bildunterschrift : president karzai advocated more investment in the afghan police and army " more than anything else , we need help to rebuild our human capital and our institutions , our army , our police force , our administrative structure , our judiciary and so on , " karzai told german newspaper die welt on wednesday . " although the situation has finally improved , the unintentional bombing of afghan civilians by nato and us troops is particularly painful , although it stems from a lack of ground troops , " he added .
" however , i am not sure that sending more troops is the right answer . " the western alliance already has around 37,000 troops deployed in the country .
nato commanders say they need some 7,500 extra troops to carry out their mission as they battle the taliban .
afghanistan 's army currently numbers 58,000 troops , with a target of 70,000 . karzai said he had the impression that the war " is not happening here , " but was being exported to afghanistan from other countries . " we should concentrate on the sanctuaries and the training camps , " he said .
" afghanistan is not a sanctuary .
it was one , but we have taken it back . " focus should shift to pakistan bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : taliban fighters are thought to be re-grouping in pakistan most concern focuses on the mountainous border area with pakistan , where afghan and western forces believe taliban extremists regroup to launch attacks in southern afghanistan . karzai said his recent meeting with pakistan 's under-pressure president pervez musharraf had been " very constructive . " " my hope is that pakistan will take harder and clearer measures in the future and thus becomes a region where extremism is no longer used as a political instrument , " he was quoted as saying .
" if pakistan takes a step in this direction , we in afghanistan will take many steps to support it . " dw staff -lrb- nda -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

" i will concentrate my efforts on trying to do this as quickly as possible , " the 74-year-old said on wednesday , jan 30 , after meeting with the president . after consulting leaders across the political spectrum , napolitano decided in favor of an interim government this week .
he has said that he wants the interim administration to change the electoral system , widely blamed for fueling italy 's political instability , before any new parliamentary elections . berlusconi eager for snap polls napolitano 's stance flies in the face of berlusconi 's argument that early elections are the only way out of the political deadlock . the leader of the forza italia party , as well as other conservative politicians , did not want the president to back a transitional government . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : berlusconi hopes to get back to power soon if snap polls are held berlusconi served as prime minister for five years - a record in postwar italy - and is eager to avenge his 2006 defeat to prodi .
he is likely to return to power if there is an early vote , according to recent polls showing the conservatives holding as much as a 10 percent lead over their rivals . " we believe there is no other way than returning to the polls and giving the country a government as soon as possible , a government that is immediately operational , " berlusconi said . italy 's latest political crisis erupted after prime minister romano prodi was forced to resign following the withdrawal of support by a centrist party in his center-left coalition .
prodi thereupon lost a confidence vote in the senate . italy hamstrung by political crisis the political crisis - it was the collapse of the 61st italian government since world war ii - has left the euro zone 's third largest economy floundering at a time when the global economy is slowing .
italian business and consumer confidence is at its lowest for at least two years . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : napolitano is determined to overhaul italy 's electoral practices italian industry leader , luca cordero di montezemolo told reuters , italy desperately needed " governability and economic growth ... both require united efforts towards a shared solution . " it 's hoped that marini 's neutral role as president of italy 's upper house of parliament may allow him to win cross-party support for reform of the current proportional representation system of voting . changes to the voting system were implemented by berlusconi during his time as prime minister and allow smaller parties with only a handful of seats to hold the balance of power in parliament .
the system is largely blamed for last week 's political turmoil . dw staff -lrb- sp -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

a subsequent german review revealed the country 's weight demographics .
now a new study shows the extent of the problem . germany is facing more of a challenge in the battle of the bulge than first thought , according to a new study on eating habits in the country .
the survey showed that more than half of all germans were too fat , with two-thirds of all men and 51 percent of women officially overweight .
but in another shocking revelation , the national consumption study has shown that 10 percent of german girls under 17 years of age were underweight and were not eating enough to remain healthy .
the study showed that the difference between the consumption of men and women was striking .
while almost one-third of 18- to 29-year-old men were overweight , every tenth young woman was too thin .
germans suffering from calorific ignorance bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : few germans realize how many calories they consume it also shows that the majority of germans have very little knowledge about what they eat and what effect the food has on their bodies .
only 10 percent of the interviewees had any idea how many calories they needed each day or how many they consumed .
the study 's figures were based on the body mass index -lrb- bmi -rrb- of an overweight person being between 25 and 30 .
this bmi is calculated by dividing an individual 's bodyweight by the square of their height .
the higher the bmi , the higher the risk that the person will develop an illness such as diabetes or heart disease .
a separate report in the stuttgarter zeitung newspaper stated that every fifth german had a bmi of over 30 .
over 20,000 germans between 14 and 80 took part in the national consumption study and divulged information on eating behavior , sporting activities , shopping practices and lifestyle .
studies show extent of challenge facing germany the last government survey on obesity in germany , taken last may , stated that around 37 million adults and around 2 million children in germany were overweight .
one-fourth of adult germans suffered from cardiovascular diseases , while there were around 4 million diabetics in the country .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : fat is no longer just a feminist issue one in five german women and one in seven men reportedly suffered from chronic back pain .
the annual costs of treating nutrition-related illnesses amounted to 70 billion euros -lrb- $ 95.3 billion -rrb- , which was 30 percent of germany 's overall health costs recorded at the time .
the government survey followed on from a similar one done by the international association for the study of obesity , in 2007 .
it found that among eu countries , germany had the most overweight women and men .
among adults , the study found that 58.9 percent of german women were overweight ; 75.4 percent of men tipped the scales .
beer , fatty foods and a lack of physical activity are the main culprits behind germans ' expanding waistlines , according to experts , and the rates of obese and overweight germans now match those of americans . dw staff -lrb- nda -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

afghan president karzai sees the proposed increase of troops in the country as unnecessary . a day after it was officially confirmed that nato had made a request to the german defense ministry to provide 250 combat troops to a quick reaction force in northern afghanistan , former nato chief of staff harald kujat warned that german soldiers were ill-equipped to deal with combat operations against the taliban and al qaeda insurgents . kujat , a former chairperson of nato 's military committee , deplored the lack of adequate hardware at the disposal of the german military and said on wednesday , jan .
30 , that bundeswehr troops " did not even have functioning devices , with which they could communicate with their allies in afghanistan . " nato submitted a formal request on tuesday for germany to provide a replacement for the 350-strong norwegian force that leaves in july after an initial inquiry had been made late last year . the german defense ministry confirmed earlier this month that it was considering whether to deploy the troops , responding to a media report that referred to a " new quality " in the german engagement in afghanistan . government officials have , however , in recent weeks denied that supplying a rapid reaction force would amount to sending men into combat .
they said the force was designed to provide emergency support to other troops in the north and that though its brief would include hunting " terrorists " and dealing with kidnappings this would not be its main task . inadequate equipment could cost lives bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : soldiers could be at risk from lack of equipment kujat called on german defense minister franz josef jung to prevent such a deployment as the inadequacy of german military equipment and lack of necessary supplies could lead to casualties , in addition to those which would come from engaging the enemy . he maintained that the soldiers themselves were well-trained and qualified to deal with the challenges of combat but the serious deficits in modern and efficient guidance systems and communication devices could negate their skills as soldiers . jung was in kabul for discussions with afghan president hamid karzai on tuesday , and made it clear that german soldiers were " ready to participate in operations against terrorists and cooperate with other international forces in any other part of the country . " reacting to the news that nato planned to send more troops to his country to counter the threat of a resurgent taliban back by supporters of al qaeda , karzai said training the afghan police and army was more important than sending more foreign troops to the country . karzai doubts wisdom of sending more troops bildunterschrift : president karzai advocated more investment in the afghan police and army " more than anything else , we need help to rebuild our human capital and our institutions , our army , our police force , our administrative structure , our judiciary and so on , " karzai told german newspaper die welt on wednesday . " although the situation has finally improved , the unintentional bombing of afghan civilians by nato and us troops is particularly painful , although it stems from a lack of ground troops , " he added .
" however , i am not sure that sending more troops is the right answer . " the western alliance already has around 37,000 troops deployed in the country .
nato commanders say they need some 7,500 extra troops to carry out their mission as they battle the taliban .
afghanistan 's army currently numbers 58,000 troops , with a target of 70,000 . karzai said he had the impression that the war " is not happening here , " but was being exported to afghanistan from other countries . " we should concentrate on the sanctuaries and the training camps , " he said .
" afghanistan is not a sanctuary .
it was one , but we have taken it back . " focus should shift to pakistan bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : taliban fighters are thought to be re-grouping in pakistan most concern focuses on the mountainous border area with pakistan , where afghan and western forces believe taliban extremists regroup to launch attacks in southern afghanistan . karzai said his recent meeting with pakistan 's under-pressure president pervez musharraf had been " very constructive . " " my hope is that pakistan will take harder and clearer measures in the future and thus becomes a region where extremism is no longer used as a political instrument , " he was quoted as saying .

michael ballack is the biggest german soccer star in years : success at home and abroad , captain of his country , immense wealth .
but has he done enough to be regarded as a legend should he retire at the tender age of 31 ? germans love their talismanic soccer players , especially those who can control games and lead with passion and by example .
germany 's soccer history is full of men who drove their nation towards greatness while sweeping all before them at club level .
most of them enjoyed hugely successful careers and finished their playing days having achieved everything , and in some cases more , than had been expected of them . michael ballack has always been expected to join the likes of beckenbauer , rummenigge , matthäus , et al. in the pantheon of german soccer greats .
ever since a young ballack first arrived on the professional soccer scene in 1995 , he has been spoken of in the most glowing of terms .
his destiny as a german legend has always been discussed in absolutes .
no one who has watched ballack 's rise has been anything other than convinced that he would become a german icon . so what , then , would all those observers make of news that ballack pack it in in a year 's time and end a career that has yet to reach the heights expected of it ? ballack hints at early retirement " what comes when my contract expires , we 'll just have to see , " british media have quoted him as saying .
" whether i stay another year , go somewhere else or hang up my boots - you never know in soccer . " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : ballack waxed lyrical about hanging up his boots in a year while the player himself has not actually confirmed that this statement , reported in his adopted homeland of the uk this week , is a sign of his impending retirement at the end of the 2008/2009 season , the mere fact that he has spoken of ending his career at the young age of 31 raises questions about ballack 's legacy . from those early days at fc chemnitzer , where his precocious , driving midfield performances led to a transfer to the bundesliga 's kaiserslautern and then leverkusen , through his trophy-laden days at bayern munich to his multi-million-euro move to chelsea , ballack has been reaching for the status and titles which would assure his place in germany 's history . trophy haul lacking international sparkle ballack has collected a fair haul of silverware in his time , picking up four bundesliga titles , three german cups and one league cup with bayern munich and an fa cup and league cup in england with chelsea .
but , one champions league runners-up medal aside , ballack has yet to make his stamp on european club soccer like those his legendary compatriots left behind . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the premiership has proved a real challenge to ballack if his career ends in the blue of chelsea , will observers look back and wonder whether ballack would have achieved more at , say , real madrid or either of the milan teams ? it was obvious in his first year in london that the premiership was a more brutal and quicker beast than the bundesliga he had been used to .
ballack 's clever eye and languid style may have flourished faster and with more confidence in the slower italian league and the spanish game may have suited his creative flair .
who knows what he could have achieved if he had moved to either country from bayern munich in 2006 ? ballack 's collection of consolation trophies away from the domestic and european scene , ballack has also been building a legacy on the international level .
since making his germany debut in 1999 , ballack has won 77 caps and scored 35 goals .
he has played in two world cup semi-finals - missing out on the 2002 world cup final through suspension - and one confederations cup semi-final .
he has led his country as captain since 2004 . and yet , for all the celebrations and plaudits , germany have not won an international tournament since the 1996 european championships .
ballack has led the side in some great victories but as yet , none of these victories resulted in a trophy -lsb- other than a third-place consolation -rsb- being lifted by the captain . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : can ballack end his international career with glory ?
so what would ballack be leaving behind in terms of a record if he were to retire in a year 's time ?
well , he could spend his free time polishing a clutch of german domestic trophies , a couple of english cups and a handful of reminders of some international near-misses .
but would this be enough to warrant his own pedestal in germany 's hall of fame ? compared with franz beckenbauer 's one world cup , one european championship and three european cups , rummenigge 's one european championship and two european cups , and matthäus with his one world cup and one european championship , ballack would struggle to make the list in terms of significant titles . ballack 's performances rate highly - but high enough ? trophies aside , could any of ballack 's individual performances stand out in much the same way as the kaiser 's mercurial domination of the 1974 world cup final , or the way matthäus outshone maradona in the 1990 final in rome ? bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : ballack 's performances in the 2002 world cup made him a star the closest would be his performances during the 2002 world cup - among his finest in a germany jersey .
it would not be an exaggeration to say ballack won the quarter and semi-finals for his country on his own , not only through his deciding goals but through his overall commitment .
again , would this be enough ? if ballack does retire without any further major honors to his name and a season of workmanlike performances behind him , he will forever be known as a " good " german player .
by prolonging his career past this hypothetical end-date and giving himself more opportunities to show what he can clearly do very well when the mood takes him , michael ballack could still be in with a chance of joining the greats . nick amies send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

a subsequent german review revealed the country 's weight demographics .
now a new study shows the extent of the problem . germany is facing more of a challenge in the battle of the bulge than first thought , according to a new study on eating habits in the country .
the survey showed that more than half of all germans were too fat , with two-thirds of all men and 51 percent of women officially overweight .
but in another shocking revelation , the national consumption study has shown that 10 percent of german girls under 17 years of age were underweight and were not eating enough to remain healthy .
the study showed that the difference between the consumption of men and women was striking .
while almost one-third of 18- to 29-year-old men were overweight , every tenth young woman was too thin .

only 10 percent of the interviewees had any idea how many calories they needed each day or how many they consumed .
the study 's figures were based on the body mass index -lrb- bmi -rrb- of an overweight person being between 25 and 30 .
this bmi is calculated by dividing an individual 's bodyweight by the square of their height .
the higher the bmi , the higher the risk that the person will develop an illness such as diabetes or heart disease .
a separate report in the stuttgarter zeitung newspaper stated that every fifth german had a bmi of over 30 .
over 20,000 germans between 14 and 80 took part in the national consumption study and divulged information on eating behavior , sporting activities , shopping practices and lifestyle .
studies show extent of challenge facing germany the last government survey on obesity in germany , taken last may , stated that around 37 million adults and around 2 million children in germany were overweight .
one-fourth of adult germans suffered from cardiovascular diseases , while there were around 4 million diabetics in the country .

the annual costs of treating nutrition-related illnesses amounted to 70 billion euros -lrb- $ 95.3 billion -rrb- , which was 30 percent of germany 's overall health costs recorded at the time .
the government survey followed on from a similar one done by the international association for the study of obesity , in 2007 .

a subsequent german review revealed the country 's weight demographics .
now a new study shows the extent of the problem . germany is facing more of a challenge in the battle of the bulge than first thought , according to a new study on eating habits in the country .
the survey showed that more than half of all germans were too fat , with two-thirds of all men and 51 percent of women officially overweight .
but in another shocking revelation , the national consumption study has shown that 10 percent of german girls under 17 years of age were underweight and were not eating enough to remain healthy .
the study showed that the difference between the consumption of men and women was striking .
while almost one-third of 18- to 29-year-old men were overweight , every tenth young woman was too thin .

the study 's figures were based on the body mass index -lrb- bmi -rrb- of an overweight person being between 25 and 30 .
this bmi is calculated by dividing an individual 's bodyweight by the square of their height .
the higher the bmi , the higher the risk that the person will develop an illness such as diabetes or heart disease .
a separate report in the stuttgarter zeitung newspaper stated that every fifth german had a bmi of over 30 .
over 20,000 germans between 14 and 80 took part in the national consumption study and divulged information on eating behavior , sporting activities , shopping practices and lifestyle .
studies show extent of challenge facing germany the last government survey on obesity in germany , taken last may , stated that around 37 million adults and around 2 million children in germany were overweight .

did germany 's experiment with democracy between 1919 and 1933 ever stand a real chance ?
eric weitz , a us historian and author , has the answers . on jan .
30 , 1933 , hitler was named german chancellor , spelling the end to the weimar republic - germany 's convulsive experiment with democracy between 1919 and 1933 .
the period was dubbed the " weimar republic " by historians in honor of the city of weimar , where a national assembly convened to write and adopt a new constitution for the german reich following the nation 's defeat in world war i. the weimar republic was marked on the one hand by hyperinflation , mass unemployment and political instability ; on the other , by dazzling creativity in the arts and sciences and a legendary nightlife in berlin . eric weitz , chairman of the history department at the university of minnesota in the united states , last year published an acclaimed book on the period : " weimar germany : promise and tragedy . "
dw-world.de spoke with him about the spirit of the time , the factors leading to the nazi seizure of power and the lessons to be drawn from the weimar republic . dw-world.de : one of the premises of your book is that the weimar republic should not be seen simply as a prelude to nazi dictatorship but as an era in its own right . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : weitz argues that the weimar republic should be valued in its own right eric weitz : it certainly should be seen as an era in its own right .
the weimar republic was a wonderfully creative period .
we should not constantly look back from the 12 years of the third reich to the 14 years of the weimar republic because the republic was a period of very important political , cultural and social innovation .
we need to remember and value it in its own right .
every issue about the weimar republic , about life in germany in the 1920s was intensely debated - both at the high intellectual and artistic level as well at the level of politics and society . how do you explain the cultural and artistic blossoming in germany , and particularly in berlin , in the 1920s ?
after all , this was a nation battered by war , with millions of dead , and plagued by hyperinflation and instability . the intense innovation of weimar is related precisely to these factors .
many people focus exclusively on the despair that came out of world war i. there was despair in abundance to be sure .
two million germans died in world war i , 4 million were wounded , and men who came back were often severely wounded , both physically and psychologically .
women at the home front during the war , experienced four years of intense privation .
and afterwards there came the post-war crisis - readjustment and hyperinflation . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : otto dix , who created this work in 1920 , was one of the prominent german artists of the weimar republic but to a certain extent , that intense instability of economy , society and politics fuelled this deep intellectual engagement with the problems of living in the modern age , of what should be germany 's political configuration .
but beyond that , the revolution of 1918/19 was crucial to this cultural efflorescence as well .
the revolution threw out the kaiser and established a democratic system - the most democratic system the germans had lived under to that point .
the spirit of revolution created a sense that the future was open , it was one of unbounded possibilities that it could be shaped in a more humanitarian way .
it could not last forever , but it 's that sense that underpins much of the cultural innovation of the republic . yet there were people in germany who hated the weimar republic .
who were they ?
and why did they want it to fail if it was so promising and attractive ? everything about the weimar republic was contested .
the kinds of artists , thinkers , architects whom i focus on in the book - much or all of their work was intensely challenged from the right .
by that i mean the establishment right - the old-line aristocrats , high government officials , army officers , businessmen , bankers , people from the church who by and large were not only anti-socialist and anti-communist but anti-democratic as well .
the revolution in 1918/19 left their powers intact by and large .
it established a political democracy but did not undermine at all the social situation and powers of this old-line conservative elite . that conservative elite , after the initial flurry of revolution , challenged the republic every step of the way .
many of the focal points of conflict were not just in the political sphere but in the cultural and social sphere as well .
there was , for example , the so-called " zehlendorf roof wars " in which conservatives , architects , and critics - nazis as well - claimed that the flat roofs of modern architectural style was distinctly un-german and true german architecture had pitched roofs .
these critics would charge that flat roofs were a form of jewish architecture .
the emancipation of women in the 1920s and very active talk of erotic fulfillment was another focal point of intense conflict . would you say the weimar republic was an early victim of globalization ?
do you think it would have survived if the great depression of 1929 had n't occurred ? the great depression was the final blow .
if we look at the economy and the election of 1928 just prior to the onset of the great depression , we can see a move back to the center politically and signs of serious economic progress .
this is the last year of the so-called fabled golden years of the republic .
without the depression , the republic would at least have had a chance .
it had managed to survive the hyperinflation of 1923 , as disruptive and disorienting as that event was .
but it was the depression that came from the united states to germany very fast and very strongly that certainly unleashed the final blow . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : hyperinflation in 1923 made german currency worthless and sparked an economic crisis at the same time we should not forget that few democracies have been founded in such difficult circumstances as the weimar republic .
the republic needed a long breathing space , it needed a more expansive and forgiving attitude on the part of the western allies , it needed economic stability and progress - all of that was in precious short supply in the post-world war i years . what led finally to the demise of democracy in the weimar republic ?
after all , in the 1928 general election , the nazis won just 2.6 percent of the vote ; five years later hitler was in power . it 's true , in 1928 , the nazi party was a marginal , unimportant political group which had very little resonance beyond some very distinctive places that were already in depression before the great depression - agricultural areas in particular .
but in many ways , the republic was seriously undermined and the political system paralyzed prior to the nazi seizure of power .
in a depression especially , people look for solutions and the republic was not offering any to the economic crisis .
from 1930 onwards , germany was governed under a presidential dictatorship because the political system was so fragmented that the reichstag could not assemble or function in parliamentary majority .
so the chancellor from spring of 1930 onwards , heinrich brüning and his successors , governed largely through emergency powers proclaimed by the president , field marshall paul von hindenburg . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the nazis never received a majority vote but i do want to underscore the fact that the nazis never received a majority vote in a popular , freely contested election .
in the summer of 1932 , they received 37.4 percent of the vote - the highest they would ever receive .
it 's a significant jump to be sure but that 's not a majority and the popular phrase that one hears so often in the united states , " the german people elected hitler to power or elected the nazis to power " - that 's wrong , it 's inaccurate , it 's untrue .
the nazis were never elected to power .
in the next election , in the fall of 1932 , they already lost a significant percentage of the support they had gained in the summer .
the nazi party was in disarray .
at the very end , they came to power because the establishment conservative elite , a coterie of powerful men around president hindenburg , handed power over to the nazis .
that alliance is what ultimately killed the republic . what lessons can be drawn from the weimar republic ?
implied throughout your book is the question of whether it is possible for contemporary democracies to succumb to neo-fascist forces in the same way that the weimar republic fell to the nazis . present day germany is a well-established democratic system .
it gives me no worries whatsoever .
to be sure there are some extreme right-wing groups that can be dangerous and the reaction against them is still a little slow sometimes .
but these groups are marginal and berlin is not weimar . my worries are more about my own country , the us , in the sense that the threats to democracy do n't always come from abroad .
the most dangerous threat may come from within .
that was certainly the case in weimar , especially in its last years .
what worries me is when certain people or institutions mouth talk of democracy but in reality undermine the very practices of democracy .
of course the nazis were never committed to democracy but they used the populist rhetoric that resonated with people .
when that kind of populist rhetoric masks undemocratic practices , that 's where i think we truly need to be concerned . the analogy that does worry me greatly is when establishment conservatives make radical conservatives salonfähig or in colloquial english " acceptable in polite society . "
i think to a certain extent that indeed has occurred in the united states .
when establishment conservatives go beyond the bounds of legitimate democratic discourse and constitutional provisions and make the program , the individuals and ideas of radical conservatives acceptable - that 's when we 're in trouble . in recent months , there seems to be a revival of interest in the weimar republic in the united states , whether it 's in fashion , art or music .
how do you explain that ? bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : a 1922 work by george grosz it 's been most curious .
and it 's true especially in new york .
i think it has to do with the sense of fragility that comes out of the sept .
11 attacks .
what people adopt is the weimar republic as portrayed in the american production of " cabaret " for example - there 's a vision of weimar as degenerate , as crisis-ridden all of which is true in part .
there was an exhibit at the metropolitan museum on weimar portraiture featuring otto dix und george grosz .
of course , if that 's all you know , you think of weimar as a period of only mutilated bodies and distorted features .
but what that interpretation misses of course is the democratic promise , the cultural innovation .
but it is that sense of fragility that has given weimar this glow in downtown as well as uptown new york culture . interview : sonia phalnikar send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

the emancipation of women in the 1920s and very active talk of erotic fulfillment was another focal point of intense conflict . would you say the weimar republic was an early victim of globalization ?
do you think it would have survived if the great depression of 1929 had n't occurred ? the great depression was the final blow .
if we look at the economy and the election of 1928 just prior to the onset of the great depression , we can see a move back to the center politically and signs of serious economic progress .
this is the last year of the so-called fabled golden years of the republic .
without the depression , the republic would at least have had a chance .
it had managed to survive the hyperinflation of 1923 , as disruptive and disorienting as that event was .
but it was the depression that came from the united states to germany very fast and very strongly that certainly unleashed the final blow . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : hyperinflation in 1923 made german currency worthless and sparked an economic crisis at the same time we should not forget that few democracies have been founded in such difficult circumstances as the weimar republic .
the republic needed a long breathing space , it needed a more expansive and forgiving attitude on the part of the western allies , it needed economic stability and progress - all of that was in precious short supply in the post-world war i years . what led finally to the demise of democracy in the weimar republic ?
after all , in the 1928 general election , the nazis won just 2.6 percent of the vote ; five years later hitler was in power . it 's true , in 1928 , the nazi party was a marginal , unimportant political group which had very little resonance beyond some very distinctive places that were already in depression before the great depression - agricultural areas in particular .
but in many ways , the republic was seriously undermined and the political system paralyzed prior to the nazi seizure of power .
in a depression especially , people look for solutions and the republic was not offering any to the economic crisis .
from 1930 onwards , germany was governed under a presidential dictatorship because the political system was so fragmented that the reichstag could not assemble or function in parliamentary majority .
so the chancellor from spring of 1930 onwards , heinrich brüning and his successors , governed largely through emergency powers proclaimed by the president , field marshall paul von hindenburg . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the nazis never received a majority vote but i do want to underscore the fact that the nazis never received a majority vote in a popular , freely contested election .
in the summer of 1932 , they received 37.4 percent of the vote - the highest they would ever receive .
it 's a significant jump to be sure but that 's not a majority and the popular phrase that one hears so often in the united states , " the german people elected hitler to power or elected the nazis to power " - that 's wrong , it 's inaccurate , it 's untrue .
the nazis were never elected to power .
in the next election , in the fall of 1932 , they already lost a significant percentage of the support they had gained in the summer .
the nazi party was in disarray .
at the very end , they came to power because the establishment conservative elite , a coterie of powerful men around president hindenburg , handed power over to the nazis .
that alliance is what ultimately killed the republic . what lessons can be drawn from the weimar republic ?
implied throughout your book is the question of whether it is possible for contemporary democracies to succumb to neo-fascist forces in the same way that the weimar republic fell to the nazis . present day germany is a well-established democratic system .
it gives me no worries whatsoever .
to be sure there are some extreme right-wing groups that can be dangerous and the reaction against them is still a little slow sometimes .
but these groups are marginal and berlin is not weimar . my worries are more about my own country , the us , in the sense that the threats to democracy do n't always come from abroad .
the most dangerous threat may come from within .
that was certainly the case in weimar , especially in its last years .
what worries me is when certain people or institutions mouth talk of democracy but in reality undermine the very practices of democracy .
of course the nazis were never committed to democracy but they used the populist rhetoric that resonated with people .
when that kind of populist rhetoric masks undemocratic practices , that 's where i think we truly need to be concerned . the analogy that does worry me greatly is when establishment conservatives make radical conservatives salonfähig or in colloquial english " acceptable in polite society . "
i think to a certain extent that indeed has occurred in the united states .
when establishment conservatives go beyond the bounds of legitimate democratic discourse and constitutional provisions and make the program , the individuals and ideas of radical conservatives acceptable - that 's when we 're in trouble . in recent months , there seems to be a revival of interest in the weimar republic in the united states , whether it 's in fashion , art or music .
how do you explain that ? bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : a 1922 work by george grosz it 's been most curious .
and it 's true especially in new york .
i think it has to do with the sense of fragility that comes out of the sept .
11 attacks .
what people adopt is the weimar republic as portrayed in the american production of " cabaret " for example - there 's a vision of weimar as degenerate , as crisis-ridden all of which is true in part .
there was an exhibit at the metropolitan museum on weimar portraiture featuring otto dix und george grosz .
of course , if that 's all you know , you think of weimar as a period of only mutilated bodies and distorted features .
but what that interpretation misses of course is the democratic promise , the cultural innovation .
but it is that sense of fragility that has given weimar this glow in downtown as well as uptown new york culture . interview : sonia phalnikar send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

30 that the serbian province will declare its independence within days of this weekend 's serbian presidential elections , regardless of who wins the vote . " the developments in serbia do not have any influence on kosovo , " thaci , the leader of the ethnic albanian majority in the breakaway serbian province , told journalists after meeting with senior police officials .
" the independence of kosovo will happen in the next few days , regardless if tadic or nikolic wins . " reuters news agency reported wednesday , quoting unnamed sources , that kosovo would declare independence after the serbian presidential election on feb .
3 if the nationalist candidate tomislav nikolic wins . " if -lrb- tomislav -rrb- nikolic wins , it 's the 9th or 10th , " a senior political source said about the possible date of independence on condition of anonymity . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : tadic has the backing of the us and the european union a second source confirmed that if pro-western incumbent boris tadic wins the closely fought race , ethnic albanians in the breakaway province would be expected to wait at least another week , possibly declaring on feb .
17 . sunday 's presidential run-off pits hard-line serb nationalist nikolic against pro-western tadic .
analysts say the election , which could decide serbia 's attitude to the west after kosovo 's independence , will go all the way to the wire .
tadic 's two-point lead in recent polls is well within the statistical margin of error . independence backed by west , opposed by russia the plan by kosovo 's ethnic albanian leaders to make a unilateral declaration of independence is backed by the united states and most members of the european union .
serbia and its ally russia staunchly oppose any such move .
serbia and russia have warned of chaos in the fragile balkans if kosovo strikes out alone . the us and the major eu powers have been trying to coordinate a declaration of independence within their own timeframe , seeing no prospect of returning the 90-percent albanian majority to serb rule .
negotiations between the serbs and albanians ended in deadlock in december after nearly two years of fraught and often strained diplomacy . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : kosovo could move quickly should nikolic win the vote the west has been pursuing a delay to independence in a bid to shore up support for the pro-european tadic . should tadic win on sunday , the us and eu would want kosovo to hold off on a declaration until at least the end of the february in an attempt to help him control the inevitable political fallout from the loss of what many serbs regard as their religious heartland . if the hardliner nikolic wins , experts believe that kosovo would speed up its plans for independence in a bid to out-maneuver any move by the russian-backed candidate to intervene . nato braces for violent reaction to declaration fearing a violent reaction to kosovo 's apparently imminent declaration , nato 's 16,000-strong peace force has been put on alert for possible unrest while european union foreign ministers plan to discuss the deployment of a 1,800-strong police and justice mission to the province at a meeting on feb .

afghan president karzai sees the proposed increase of troops in the country as unnecessary . a day after it was officially confirmed that nato had made a request to the german defense ministry to provide 250 combat troops to a quick reaction force in northern afghanistan , former nato chief of staff harald kujat warned that german soldiers were ill-equipped to deal with combat operations against the taliban and al qaeda insurgents . kujat , a former chairperson of nato 's military committee , deplored the lack of adequate hardware at the disposal of the german military and said on wednesday , jan .
30 , that bundeswehr troops " did not even have functioning devices , with which they could communicate with their allies in afghanistan . " nato submitted a formal request on tuesday for germany to provide a replacement for the 350-strong norwegian force that leaves in july after an initial inquiry had been made late last year . the german defense ministry confirmed earlier this month that it was considering whether to deploy the troops , responding to a media report that referred to a " new quality " in the german engagement in afghanistan . government officials have , however , in recent weeks denied that supplying a rapid reaction force would amount to sending men into combat .
they said the force was designed to provide emergency support to other troops in the north and that though its brief would include hunting " terrorists " and dealing with kidnappings this would not be its main task . inadequate equipment could cost lives bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : soldiers could be at risk from lack of equipment kujat called on german defense minister franz josef jung to prevent such a deployment as the inadequacy of german military equipment and lack of necessary supplies could lead to casualties , in addition to those which would come from engaging the enemy . he maintained that the soldiers themselves were well-trained and qualified to deal with the challenges of combat but the serious deficits in modern and efficient guidance systems and communication devices could negate their skills as soldiers . jung was in kabul for discussions with afghan president hamid karzai on tuesday , and made it clear that german soldiers were " ready to participate in operations against terrorists and cooperate with other international forces in any other part of the country . " reacting to the news that nato planned to send more troops to his country to counter the threat of a resurgent taliban back by supporters of al qaeda , karzai said training the afghan police and army was more important than sending more foreign troops to the country . karzai doubts wisdom of sending more troops bildunterschrift : president karzai advocated more investment in the afghan police and army " more than anything else , we need help to rebuild our human capital and our institutions , our army , our police force , our administrative structure , our judiciary and so on , " karzai told german newspaper die welt on wednesday . " although the situation has finally improved , the unintentional bombing of afghan civilians by nato and us troops is particularly painful , although it stems from a lack of ground troops , " he added .
" however , i am not sure that sending more troops is the right answer . " the western alliance already has around 37,000 troops deployed in the country .
nato commanders say they need some 7,500 extra troops to carry out their mission as they battle the taliban .
afghanistan 's army currently numbers 58,000 troops , with a target of 70,000 . karzai said he had the impression that the war " is not happening here , " but was being exported to afghanistan from other countries . " we should concentrate on the sanctuaries and the training camps , " he said .
" afghanistan is not a sanctuary .
it was one , but we have taken it back . " focus should shift to pakistan bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : taliban fighters are thought to be re-grouping in pakistan most concern focuses on the mountainous border area with pakistan , where afghan and western forces believe taliban extremists regroup to launch attacks in southern afghanistan . karzai said his recent meeting with pakistan 's under-pressure president pervez musharraf had been " very constructive . " " my hope is that pakistan will take harder and clearer measures in the future and thus becomes a region where extremism is no longer used as a political instrument , " he was quoted as saying .
" if pakistan takes a step in this direction , we in afghanistan will take many steps to support it . " dw staff -lrb- nda -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

did germany 's experiment with democracy between 1919 and 1933 ever stand a real chance ?
eric weitz , a us historian and author , has the answers . on jan .
30 , 1933 , hitler was named german chancellor , spelling the end to the weimar republic - germany 's convulsive experiment with democracy between 1919 and 1933 .
the period was dubbed the " weimar republic " by historians in honor of the city of weimar , where a national assembly convened to write and adopt a new constitution for the german reich following the nation 's defeat in world war i. the weimar republic was marked on the one hand by hyperinflation , mass unemployment and political instability ; on the other , by dazzling creativity in the arts and sciences and a legendary nightlife in berlin . eric weitz , chairman of the history department at the university of minnesota in the united states , last year published an acclaimed book on the period : " weimar germany : promise and tragedy . "
dw-world.de spoke with him about the spirit of the time , the factors leading to the nazi seizure of power and the lessons to be drawn from the weimar republic . dw-world.de : one of the premises of your book is that the weimar republic should not be seen simply as a prelude to nazi dictatorship but as an era in its own right . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : weitz argues that the weimar republic should be valued in its own right eric weitz : it certainly should be seen as an era in its own right .
the weimar republic was a wonderfully creative period .
we should not constantly look back from the 12 years of the third reich to the 14 years of the weimar republic because the republic was a period of very important political , cultural and social innovation .
we need to remember and value it in its own right .
every issue about the weimar republic , about life in germany in the 1920s was intensely debated - both at the high intellectual and artistic level as well at the level of politics and society . how do you explain the cultural and artistic blossoming in germany , and particularly in berlin , in the 1920s ?
after all , this was a nation battered by war , with millions of dead , and plagued by hyperinflation and instability . the intense innovation of weimar is related precisely to these factors .
many people focus exclusively on the despair that came out of world war i. there was despair in abundance to be sure .
two million germans died in world war i , 4 million were wounded , and men who came back were often severely wounded , both physically and psychologically .
women at the home front during the war , experienced four years of intense privation .
and afterwards there came the post-war crisis - readjustment and hyperinflation . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : otto dix , who created this work in 1920 , was one of the prominent german artists of the weimar republic but to a certain extent , that intense instability of economy , society and politics fuelled this deep intellectual engagement with the problems of living in the modern age , of what should be germany 's political configuration .
but beyond that , the revolution of 1918/19 was crucial to this cultural efflorescence as well .
the revolution threw out the kaiser and established a democratic system - the most democratic system the germans had lived under to that point .
the spirit of revolution created a sense that the future was open , it was one of unbounded possibilities that it could be shaped in a more humanitarian way .
it could not last forever , but it 's that sense that underpins much of the cultural innovation of the republic . yet there were people in germany who hated the weimar republic .
who were they ?
and why did they want it to fail if it was so promising and attractive ? everything about the weimar republic was contested .
the kinds of artists , thinkers , architects whom i focus on in the book - much or all of their work was intensely challenged from the right .
by that i mean the establishment right - the old-line aristocrats , high government officials , army officers , businessmen , bankers , people from the church who by and large were not only anti-socialist and anti-communist but anti-democratic as well .
the revolution in 1918/19 left their powers intact by and large .
it established a political democracy but did not undermine at all the social situation and powers of this old-line conservative elite . that conservative elite , after the initial flurry of revolution , challenged the republic every step of the way .
many of the focal points of conflict were not just in the political sphere but in the cultural and social sphere as well .
there was , for example , the so-called " zehlendorf roof wars " in which conservatives , architects , and critics - nazis as well - claimed that the flat roofs of modern architectural style was distinctly un-german and true german architecture had pitched roofs .
these critics would charge that flat roofs were a form of jewish architecture .
the emancipation of women in the 1920s and very active talk of erotic fulfillment was another focal point of intense conflict . would you say the weimar republic was an early victim of globalization ?
do you think it would have survived if the great depression of 1929 had n't occurred ? the great depression was the final blow .
if we look at the economy and the election of 1928 just prior to the onset of the great depression , we can see a move back to the center politically and signs of serious economic progress .
this is the last year of the so-called fabled golden years of the republic .
without the depression , the republic would at least have had a chance .
it had managed to survive the hyperinflation of 1923 , as disruptive and disorienting as that event was .
but it was the depression that came from the united states to germany very fast and very strongly that certainly unleashed the final blow . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : hyperinflation in 1923 made german currency worthless and sparked an economic crisis at the same time we should not forget that few democracies have been founded in such difficult circumstances as the weimar republic .
the republic needed a long breathing space , it needed a more expansive and forgiving attitude on the part of the western allies , it needed economic stability and progress - all of that was in precious short supply in the post-world war i years . what led finally to the demise of democracy in the weimar republic ?
after all , in the 1928 general election , the nazis won just 2.6 percent of the vote ; five years later hitler was in power . it 's true , in 1928 , the nazi party was a marginal , unimportant political group which had very little resonance beyond some very distinctive places that were already in depression before the great depression - agricultural areas in particular .
but in many ways , the republic was seriously undermined and the political system paralyzed prior to the nazi seizure of power .
in a depression especially , people look for solutions and the republic was not offering any to the economic crisis .
from 1930 onwards , germany was governed under a presidential dictatorship because the political system was so fragmented that the reichstag could not assemble or function in parliamentary majority .
so the chancellor from spring of 1930 onwards , heinrich brüning and his successors , governed largely through emergency powers proclaimed by the president , field marshall paul von hindenburg . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the nazis never received a majority vote but i do want to underscore the fact that the nazis never received a majority vote in a popular , freely contested election .
in the summer of 1932 , they received 37.4 percent of the vote - the highest they would ever receive .
it 's a significant jump to be sure but that 's not a majority and the popular phrase that one hears so often in the united states , " the german people elected hitler to power or elected the nazis to power " - that 's wrong , it 's inaccurate , it 's untrue .
the nazis were never elected to power .
in the next election , in the fall of 1932 , they already lost a significant percentage of the support they had gained in the summer .
the nazi party was in disarray .
at the very end , they came to power because the establishment conservative elite , a coterie of powerful men around president hindenburg , handed power over to the nazis .
that alliance is what ultimately killed the republic . what lessons can be drawn from the weimar republic ?
implied throughout your book is the question of whether it is possible for contemporary democracies to succumb to neo-fascist forces in the same way that the weimar republic fell to the nazis . present day germany is a well-established democratic system .
it gives me no worries whatsoever .
to be sure there are some extreme right-wing groups that can be dangerous and the reaction against them is still a little slow sometimes .
but these groups are marginal and berlin is not weimar . my worries are more about my own country , the us , in the sense that the threats to democracy do n't always come from abroad .
the most dangerous threat may come from within .
that was certainly the case in weimar , especially in its last years .
what worries me is when certain people or institutions mouth talk of democracy but in reality undermine the very practices of democracy .
of course the nazis were never committed to democracy but they used the populist rhetoric that resonated with people .
when that kind of populist rhetoric masks undemocratic practices , that 's where i think we truly need to be concerned . the analogy that does worry me greatly is when establishment conservatives make radical conservatives salonfähig or in colloquial english " acceptable in polite society . "
i think to a certain extent that indeed has occurred in the united states .
when establishment conservatives go beyond the bounds of legitimate democratic discourse and constitutional provisions and make the program , the individuals and ideas of radical conservatives acceptable - that 's when we 're in trouble . in recent months , there seems to be a revival of interest in the weimar republic in the united states , whether it 's in fashion , art or music .
how do you explain that ? bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : a 1922 work by george grosz it 's been most curious .
and it 's true especially in new york .
i think it has to do with the sense of fragility that comes out of the sept .
11 attacks .
what people adopt is the weimar republic as portrayed in the american production of " cabaret " for example - there 's a vision of weimar as degenerate , as crisis-ridden all of which is true in part .
there was an exhibit at the metropolitan museum on weimar portraiture featuring otto dix und george grosz .
of course , if that 's all you know , you think of weimar as a period of only mutilated bodies and distorted features .
but what that interpretation misses of course is the democratic promise , the cultural innovation .
but it is that sense of fragility that has given weimar this glow in downtown as well as uptown new york culture . interview : sonia phalnikar send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

by that i mean the establishment right - the old-line aristocrats , high government officials , army officers , businessmen , bankers , people from the church who by and large were not only anti-socialist and anti-communist but anti-democratic as well .
the revolution in 1918/19 left their powers intact by and large .
it established a political democracy but did not undermine at all the social situation and powers of this old-line conservative elite . that conservative elite , after the initial flurry of revolution , challenged the republic every step of the way .
many of the focal points of conflict were not just in the political sphere but in the cultural and social sphere as well .
there was , for example , the so-called " zehlendorf roof wars " in which conservatives , architects , and critics - nazis as well - claimed that the flat roofs of modern architectural style was distinctly un-german and true german architecture had pitched roofs .
these critics would charge that flat roofs were a form of jewish architecture .
the emancipation of women in the 1920s and very active talk of erotic fulfillment was another focal point of intense conflict . would you say the weimar republic was an early victim of globalization ?
do you think it would have survived if the great depression of 1929 had n't occurred ? the great depression was the final blow .
if we look at the economy and the election of 1928 just prior to the onset of the great depression , we can see a move back to the center politically and signs of serious economic progress .
this is the last year of the so-called fabled golden years of the republic .
without the depression , the republic would at least have had a chance .
it had managed to survive the hyperinflation of 1923 , as disruptive and disorienting as that event was .
but it was the depression that came from the united states to germany very fast and very strongly that certainly unleashed the final blow . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : hyperinflation in 1923 made german currency worthless and sparked an economic crisis at the same time we should not forget that few democracies have been founded in such difficult circumstances as the weimar republic .
the republic needed a long breathing space , it needed a more expansive and forgiving attitude on the part of the western allies , it needed economic stability and progress - all of that was in precious short supply in the post-world war i years . what led finally to the demise of democracy in the weimar republic ?
after all , in the 1928 general election , the nazis won just 2.6 percent of the vote ; five years later hitler was in power . it 's true , in 1928 , the nazi party was a marginal , unimportant political group which had very little resonance beyond some very distinctive places that were already in depression before the great depression - agricultural areas in particular .
but in many ways , the republic was seriously undermined and the political system paralyzed prior to the nazi seizure of power .
in a depression especially , people look for solutions and the republic was not offering any to the economic crisis .
from 1930 onwards , germany was governed under a presidential dictatorship because the political system was so fragmented that the reichstag could not assemble or function in parliamentary majority .
so the chancellor from spring of 1930 onwards , heinrich brüning and his successors , governed largely through emergency powers proclaimed by the president , field marshall paul von hindenburg . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the nazis never received a majority vote but i do want to underscore the fact that the nazis never received a majority vote in a popular , freely contested election .
in the summer of 1932 , they received 37.4 percent of the vote - the highest they would ever receive .
it 's a significant jump to be sure but that 's not a majority and the popular phrase that one hears so often in the united states , " the german people elected hitler to power or elected the nazis to power " - that 's wrong , it 's inaccurate , it 's untrue .
the nazis were never elected to power .
in the next election , in the fall of 1932 , they already lost a significant percentage of the support they had gained in the summer .
the nazi party was in disarray .
at the very end , they came to power because the establishment conservative elite , a coterie of powerful men around president hindenburg , handed power over to the nazis .
that alliance is what ultimately killed the republic . what lessons can be drawn from the weimar republic ?
implied throughout your book is the question of whether it is possible for contemporary democracies to succumb to neo-fascist forces in the same way that the weimar republic fell to the nazis . present day germany is a well-established democratic system .
it gives me no worries whatsoever .
to be sure there are some extreme right-wing groups that can be dangerous and the reaction against them is still a little slow sometimes .
but these groups are marginal and berlin is not weimar . my worries are more about my own country , the us , in the sense that the threats to democracy do n't always come from abroad .
the most dangerous threat may come from within .
that was certainly the case in weimar , especially in its last years .
what worries me is when certain people or institutions mouth talk of democracy but in reality undermine the very practices of democracy .
of course the nazis were never committed to democracy but they used the populist rhetoric that resonated with people .
when that kind of populist rhetoric masks undemocratic practices , that 's where i think we truly need to be concerned . the analogy that does worry me greatly is when establishment conservatives make radical conservatives salonfähig or in colloquial english " acceptable in polite society . "
i think to a certain extent that indeed has occurred in the united states .
when establishment conservatives go beyond the bounds of legitimate democratic discourse and constitutional provisions and make the program , the individuals and ideas of radical conservatives acceptable - that 's when we 're in trouble . in recent months , there seems to be a revival of interest in the weimar republic in the united states , whether it 's in fashion , art or music .
how do you explain that ? bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : a 1922 work by george grosz it 's been most curious .
and it 's true especially in new york .
i think it has to do with the sense of fragility that comes out of the sept .
11 attacks .
what people adopt is the weimar republic as portrayed in the american production of " cabaret " for example - there 's a vision of weimar as degenerate , as crisis-ridden all of which is true in part .
there was an exhibit at the metropolitan museum on weimar portraiture featuring otto dix und george grosz .
of course , if that 's all you know , you think of weimar as a period of only mutilated bodies and distorted features .
but what that interpretation misses of course is the democratic promise , the cultural innovation .
but it is that sense of fragility that has given weimar this glow in downtown as well as uptown new york culture . interview : sonia phalnikar send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

a subsequent german review revealed the country 's weight demographics .
now a new study shows the extent of the problem . germany is facing more of a challenge in the battle of the bulge than first thought , according to a new study on eating habits in the country .
the survey showed that more than half of all germans were too fat , with two-thirds of all men and 51 percent of women officially overweight .
but in another shocking revelation , the national consumption study has shown that 10 percent of german girls under 17 years of age were underweight and were not eating enough to remain healthy .
the study showed that the difference between the consumption of men and women was striking .
while almost one-third of 18- to 29-year-old men were overweight , every tenth young woman was too thin .
germans suffering from calorific ignorance bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : few germans realize how many calories they consume it also shows that the majority of germans have very little knowledge about what they eat and what effect the food has on their bodies .
only 10 percent of the interviewees had any idea how many calories they needed each day or how many they consumed .
the study 's figures were based on the body mass index -lrb- bmi -rrb- of an overweight person being between 25 and 30 .
this bmi is calculated by dividing an individual 's bodyweight by the square of their height .
the higher the bmi , the higher the risk that the person will develop an illness such as diabetes or heart disease .
a separate report in the stuttgarter zeitung newspaper stated that every fifth german had a bmi of over 30 .
over 20,000 germans between 14 and 80 took part in the national consumption study and divulged information on eating behavior , sporting activities , shopping practices and lifestyle .
studies show extent of challenge facing germany the last government survey on obesity in germany , taken last may , stated that around 37 million adults and around 2 million children in germany were overweight .
one-fourth of adult germans suffered from cardiovascular diseases , while there were around 4 million diabetics in the country .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : fat is no longer just a feminist issue one in five german women and one in seven men reportedly suffered from chronic back pain .
the annual costs of treating nutrition-related illnesses amounted to 70 billion euros -lrb- $ 95.3 billion -rrb- , which was 30 percent of germany 's overall health costs recorded at the time .
the government survey followed on from a similar one done by the international association for the study of obesity , in 2007 .
it found that among eu countries , germany had the most overweight women and men .
among adults , the study found that 58.9 percent of german women were overweight ; 75.4 percent of men tipped the scales .
beer , fatty foods and a lack of physical activity are the main culprits behind germans ' expanding waistlines , according to experts , and the rates of obese and overweight germans now match those of americans . dw staff -lrb- nda -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

michael ballack is the biggest german soccer star in years : success at home and abroad , captain of his country , immense wealth .
but has he done enough to be regarded as a legend should he retire at the tender age of 31 ? germans love their talismanic soccer players , especially those who can control games and lead with passion and by example .
germany 's soccer history is full of men who drove their nation towards greatness while sweeping all before them at club level .
most of them enjoyed hugely successful careers and finished their playing days having achieved everything , and in some cases more , than had been expected of them . michael ballack has always been expected to join the likes of beckenbauer , rummenigge , matthäus , et al. in the pantheon of german soccer greats .
ever since a young ballack first arrived on the professional soccer scene in 1995 , he has been spoken of in the most glowing of terms .
his destiny as a german legend has always been discussed in absolutes .
no one who has watched ballack 's rise has been anything other than convinced that he would become a german icon . so what , then , would all those observers make of news that ballack pack it in in a year 's time and end a career that has yet to reach the heights expected of it ? ballack hints at early retirement " what comes when my contract expires , we 'll just have to see , " british media have quoted him as saying .
" whether i stay another year , go somewhere else or hang up my boots - you never know in soccer . " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : ballack waxed lyrical about hanging up his boots in a year while the player himself has not actually confirmed that this statement , reported in his adopted homeland of the uk this week , is a sign of his impending retirement at the end of the 2008/2009 season , the mere fact that he has spoken of ending his career at the young age of 31 raises questions about ballack 's legacy . from those early days at fc chemnitzer , where his precocious , driving midfield performances led to a transfer to the bundesliga 's kaiserslautern and then leverkusen , through his trophy-laden days at bayern munich to his multi-million-euro move to chelsea , ballack has been reaching for the status and titles which would assure his place in germany 's history . trophy haul lacking international sparkle ballack has collected a fair haul of silverware in his time , picking up four bundesliga titles , three german cups and one league cup with bayern munich and an fa cup and league cup in england with chelsea .
but , one champions league runners-up medal aside , ballack has yet to make his stamp on european club soccer like those his legendary compatriots left behind . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the premiership has proved a real challenge to ballack if his career ends in the blue of chelsea , will observers look back and wonder whether ballack would have achieved more at , say , real madrid or either of the milan teams ? it was obvious in his first year in london that the premiership was a more brutal and quicker beast than the bundesliga he had been used to .
ballack 's clever eye and languid style may have flourished faster and with more confidence in the slower italian league and the spanish game may have suited his creative flair .
who knows what he could have achieved if he had moved to either country from bayern munich in 2006 ? ballack 's collection of consolation trophies away from the domestic and european scene , ballack has also been building a legacy on the international level .
since making his germany debut in 1999 , ballack has won 77 caps and scored 35 goals .
he has played in two world cup semi-finals - missing out on the 2002 world cup final through suspension - and one confederations cup semi-final .
he has led his country as captain since 2004 . and yet , for all the celebrations and plaudits , germany have not won an international tournament since the 1996 european championships .
ballack has led the side in some great victories but as yet , none of these victories resulted in a trophy -lsb- other than a third-place consolation -rsb- being lifted by the captain . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : can ballack end his international career with glory ?
so what would ballack be leaving behind in terms of a record if he were to retire in a year 's time ?
well , he could spend his free time polishing a clutch of german domestic trophies , a couple of english cups and a handful of reminders of some international near-misses .
but would this be enough to warrant his own pedestal in germany 's hall of fame ? compared with franz beckenbauer 's one world cup , one european championship and three european cups , rummenigge 's one european championship and two european cups , and matthäus with his one world cup and one european championship , ballack would struggle to make the list in terms of significant titles . ballack 's performances rate highly - but high enough ? trophies aside , could any of ballack 's individual performances stand out in much the same way as the kaiser 's mercurial domination of the 1974 world cup final , or the way matthäus outshone maradona in the 1990 final in rome ? bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : ballack 's performances in the 2002 world cup made him a star the closest would be his performances during the 2002 world cup - among his finest in a germany jersey .
it would not be an exaggeration to say ballack won the quarter and semi-finals for his country on his own , not only through his deciding goals but through his overall commitment .
again , would this be enough ? if ballack does retire without any further major honors to his name and a season of workmanlike performances behind him , he will forever be known as a " good " german player .
by prolonging his career past this hypothetical end-date and giving himself more opportunities to show what he can clearly do very well when the mood takes him , michael ballack could still be in with a chance of joining the greats . nick amies send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

michael ballack is the biggest german soccer star in years : success at home and abroad , captain of his country , immense wealth .
but has he done enough to be regarded as a legend should he retire at the tender age of 31 ? germans love their talismanic soccer players , especially those who can control games and lead with passion and by example .
germany 's soccer history is full of men who drove their nation towards greatness while sweeping all before them at club level .
most of them enjoyed hugely successful careers and finished their playing days having achieved everything , and in some cases more , than had been expected of them . michael ballack has always been expected to join the likes of beckenbauer , rummenigge , matthäus , et al. in the pantheon of german soccer greats .
ever since a young ballack first arrived on the professional soccer scene in 1995 , he has been spoken of in the most glowing of terms .
his destiny as a german legend has always been discussed in absolutes .
no one who has watched ballack 's rise has been anything other than convinced that he would become a german icon . so what , then , would all those observers make of news that ballack pack it in in a year 's time and end a career that has yet to reach the heights expected of it ? ballack hints at early retirement " what comes when my contract expires , we 'll just have to see , " british media have quoted him as saying .
" whether i stay another year , go somewhere else or hang up my boots - you never know in soccer . " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : ballack waxed lyrical about hanging up his boots in a year while the player himself has not actually confirmed that this statement , reported in his adopted homeland of the uk this week , is a sign of his impending retirement at the end of the 2008/2009 season , the mere fact that he has spoken of ending his career at the young age of 31 raises questions about ballack 's legacy . from those early days at fc chemnitzer , where his precocious , driving midfield performances led to a transfer to the bundesliga 's kaiserslautern and then leverkusen , through his trophy-laden days at bayern munich to his multi-million-euro move to chelsea , ballack has been reaching for the status and titles which would assure his place in germany 's history . trophy haul lacking international sparkle ballack has collected a fair haul of silverware in his time , picking up four bundesliga titles , three german cups and one league cup with bayern munich and an fa cup and league cup in england with chelsea .

ballack 's clever eye and languid style may have flourished faster and with more confidence in the slower italian league and the spanish game may have suited his creative flair .

since making his germany debut in 1999 , ballack has won 77 caps and scored 35 goals .
he has played in two world cup semi-finals - missing out on the 2002 world cup final through suspension - and one confederations cup semi-final .
he has led his country as captain since 2004 . and yet , for all the celebrations and plaudits , germany have not won an international tournament since the 1996 european championships .

so what would ballack be leaving behind in terms of a record if he were to retire in a year 's time ?
well , he could spend his free time polishing a clutch of german domestic trophies , a couple of english cups and a handful of reminders of some international near-misses .
but would this be enough to warrant his own pedestal in germany 's hall of fame ? compared with franz beckenbauer 's one world cup , one european championship and three european cups , rummenigge 's one european championship and two european cups , and matthäus with his one world cup and one european championship , ballack would struggle to make the list in terms of significant titles . ballack 's performances rate highly - but high enough ? trophies aside , could any of ballack 's individual performances stand out in much the same way as the kaiser 's mercurial domination of the 1974 world cup final , or the way matthäus outshone maradona in the 1990 final in rome ? bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : ballack 's performances in the 2002 world cup made him a star the closest would be his performances during the 2002 world cup - among his finest in a germany jersey .

a subsequent german review revealed the country 's weight demographics .
now a new study shows the extent of the problem . germany is facing more of a challenge in the battle of the bulge than first thought , according to a new study on eating habits in the country .
the survey showed that more than half of all germans were too fat , with two-thirds of all men and 51 percent of women officially overweight .
but in another shocking revelation , the national consumption study has shown that 10 percent of german girls under 17 years of age were underweight and were not eating enough to remain healthy .
the study showed that the difference between the consumption of men and women was striking .
while almost one-third of 18- to 29-year-old men were overweight , every tenth young woman was too thin .
germans suffering from calorific ignorance bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : few germans realize how many calories they consume it also shows that the majority of germans have very little knowledge about what they eat and what effect the food has on their bodies .
only 10 percent of the interviewees had any idea how many calories they needed each day or how many they consumed .
the study 's figures were based on the body mass index -lrb- bmi -rrb- of an overweight person being between 25 and 30 .
this bmi is calculated by dividing an individual 's bodyweight by the square of their height .
the higher the bmi , the higher the risk that the person will develop an illness such as diabetes or heart disease .
a separate report in the stuttgarter zeitung newspaper stated that every fifth german had a bmi of over 30 .
over 20,000 germans between 14 and 80 took part in the national consumption study and divulged information on eating behavior , sporting activities , shopping practices and lifestyle .
studies show extent of challenge facing germany the last government survey on obesity in germany , taken last may , stated that around 37 million adults and around 2 million children in germany were overweight .
one-fourth of adult germans suffered from cardiovascular diseases , while there were around 4 million diabetics in the country .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : fat is no longer just a feminist issue one in five german women and one in seven men reportedly suffered from chronic back pain .
the annual costs of treating nutrition-related illnesses amounted to 70 billion euros -lrb- $ 95.3 billion -rrb- , which was 30 percent of germany 's overall health costs recorded at the time .
the government survey followed on from a similar one done by the international association for the study of obesity , in 2007 .
it found that among eu countries , germany had the most overweight women and men .
among adults , the study found that 58.9 percent of german women were overweight ; 75.4 percent of men tipped the scales .
beer , fatty foods and a lack of physical activity are the main culprits behind germans ' expanding waistlines , according to experts , and the rates of obese and overweight germans now match those of americans . dw staff -lrb- nda -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

michael ballack is the biggest german soccer star in years : success at home and abroad , captain of his country , immense wealth .
but has he done enough to be regarded as a legend should he retire at the tender age of 31 ? germans love their talismanic soccer players , especially those who can control games and lead with passion and by example .
germany 's soccer history is full of men who drove their nation towards greatness while sweeping all before them at club level .
most of them enjoyed hugely successful careers and finished their playing days having achieved everything , and in some cases more , than had been expected of them . michael ballack has always been expected to join the likes of beckenbauer , rummenigge , matthäus , et al. in the pantheon of german soccer greats .
ever since a young ballack first arrived on the professional soccer scene in 1995 , he has been spoken of in the most glowing of terms .
his destiny as a german legend has always been discussed in absolutes .
no one who has watched ballack 's rise has been anything other than convinced that he would become a german icon . so what , then , would all those observers make of news that ballack pack it in in a year 's time and end a career that has yet to reach the heights expected of it ? ballack hints at early retirement " what comes when my contract expires , we 'll just have to see , " british media have quoted him as saying .
" whether i stay another year , go somewhere else or hang up my boots - you never know in soccer . " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : ballack waxed lyrical about hanging up his boots in a year while the player himself has not actually confirmed that this statement , reported in his adopted homeland of the uk this week , is a sign of his impending retirement at the end of the 2008/2009 season , the mere fact that he has spoken of ending his career at the young age of 31 raises questions about ballack 's legacy . from those early days at fc chemnitzer , where his precocious , driving midfield performances led to a transfer to the bundesliga 's kaiserslautern and then leverkusen , through his trophy-laden days at bayern munich to his multi-million-euro move to chelsea , ballack has been reaching for the status and titles which would assure his place in germany 's history . trophy haul lacking international sparkle ballack has collected a fair haul of silverware in his time , picking up four bundesliga titles , three german cups and one league cup with bayern munich and an fa cup and league cup in england with chelsea .
but , one champions league runners-up medal aside , ballack has yet to make his stamp on european club soccer like those his legendary compatriots left behind . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the premiership has proved a real challenge to ballack if his career ends in the blue of chelsea , will observers look back and wonder whether ballack would have achieved more at , say , real madrid or either of the milan teams ? it was obvious in his first year in london that the premiership was a more brutal and quicker beast than the bundesliga he had been used to .
ballack 's clever eye and languid style may have flourished faster and with more confidence in the slower italian league and the spanish game may have suited his creative flair .
who knows what he could have achieved if he had moved to either country from bayern munich in 2006 ? ballack 's collection of consolation trophies away from the domestic and european scene , ballack has also been building a legacy on the international level .
since making his germany debut in 1999 , ballack has won 77 caps and scored 35 goals .
he has played in two world cup semi-finals - missing out on the 2002 world cup final through suspension - and one confederations cup semi-final .
he has led his country as captain since 2004 . and yet , for all the celebrations and plaudits , germany have not won an international tournament since the 1996 european championships .
ballack has led the side in some great victories but as yet , none of these victories resulted in a trophy -lsb- other than a third-place consolation -rsb- being lifted by the captain . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : can ballack end his international career with glory ?
so what would ballack be leaving behind in terms of a record if he were to retire in a year 's time ?
well , he could spend his free time polishing a clutch of german domestic trophies , a couple of english cups and a handful of reminders of some international near-misses .
but would this be enough to warrant his own pedestal in germany 's hall of fame ? compared with franz beckenbauer 's one world cup , one european championship and three european cups , rummenigge 's one european championship and two european cups , and matthäus with his one world cup and one european championship , ballack would struggle to make the list in terms of significant titles . ballack 's performances rate highly - but high enough ? trophies aside , could any of ballack 's individual performances stand out in much the same way as the kaiser 's mercurial domination of the 1974 world cup final , or the way matthäus outshone maradona in the 1990 final in rome ? bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : ballack 's performances in the 2002 world cup made him a star the closest would be his performances during the 2002 world cup - among his finest in a germany jersey .
it would not be an exaggeration to say ballack won the quarter and semi-finals for his country on his own , not only through his deciding goals but through his overall commitment .
again , would this be enough ? if ballack does retire without any further major honors to his name and a season of workmanlike performances behind him , he will forever be known as a " good " german player .

did germany 's experiment with democracy between 1919 and 1933 ever stand a real chance ?
eric weitz , a us historian and author , has the answers . on jan .
30 , 1933 , hitler was named german chancellor , spelling the end to the weimar republic - germany 's convulsive experiment with democracy between 1919 and 1933 .
the period was dubbed the " weimar republic " by historians in honor of the city of weimar , where a national assembly convened to write and adopt a new constitution for the german reich following the nation 's defeat in world war i. the weimar republic was marked on the one hand by hyperinflation , mass unemployment and political instability ; on the other , by dazzling creativity in the arts and sciences and a legendary nightlife in berlin . eric weitz , chairman of the history department at the university of minnesota in the united states , last year published an acclaimed book on the period : " weimar germany : promise and tragedy . "
dw-world.de spoke with him about the spirit of the time , the factors leading to the nazi seizure of power and the lessons to be drawn from the weimar republic . dw-world.de : one of the premises of your book is that the weimar republic should not be seen simply as a prelude to nazi dictatorship but as an era in its own right . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : weitz argues that the weimar republic should be valued in its own right eric weitz : it certainly should be seen as an era in its own right .
the weimar republic was a wonderfully creative period .
we should not constantly look back from the 12 years of the third reich to the 14 years of the weimar republic because the republic was a period of very important political , cultural and social innovation .
we need to remember and value it in its own right .
every issue about the weimar republic , about life in germany in the 1920s was intensely debated - both at the high intellectual and artistic level as well at the level of politics and society . how do you explain the cultural and artistic blossoming in germany , and particularly in berlin , in the 1920s ?
after all , this was a nation battered by war , with millions of dead , and plagued by hyperinflation and instability . the intense innovation of weimar is related precisely to these factors .
many people focus exclusively on the despair that came out of world war i. there was despair in abundance to be sure .
two million germans died in world war i , 4 million were wounded , and men who came back were often severely wounded , both physically and psychologically .
women at the home front during the war , experienced four years of intense privation .
and afterwards there came the post-war crisis - readjustment and hyperinflation . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : otto dix , who created this work in 1920 , was one of the prominent german artists of the weimar republic but to a certain extent , that intense instability of economy , society and politics fuelled this deep intellectual engagement with the problems of living in the modern age , of what should be germany 's political configuration .
but beyond that , the revolution of 1918/19 was crucial to this cultural efflorescence as well .
the revolution threw out the kaiser and established a democratic system - the most democratic system the germans had lived under to that point .
the spirit of revolution created a sense that the future was open , it was one of unbounded possibilities that it could be shaped in a more humanitarian way .
it could not last forever , but it 's that sense that underpins much of the cultural innovation of the republic . yet there were people in germany who hated the weimar republic .
who were they ?
and why did they want it to fail if it was so promising and attractive ? everything about the weimar republic was contested .
the kinds of artists , thinkers , architects whom i focus on in the book - much or all of their work was intensely challenged from the right .
by that i mean the establishment right - the old-line aristocrats , high government officials , army officers , businessmen , bankers , people from the church who by and large were not only anti-socialist and anti-communist but anti-democratic as well .
the revolution in 1918/19 left their powers intact by and large .
it established a political democracy but did not undermine at all the social situation and powers of this old-line conservative elite . that conservative elite , after the initial flurry of revolution , challenged the republic every step of the way .
many of the focal points of conflict were not just in the political sphere but in the cultural and social sphere as well .
there was , for example , the so-called " zehlendorf roof wars " in which conservatives , architects , and critics - nazis as well - claimed that the flat roofs of modern architectural style was distinctly un-german and true german architecture had pitched roofs .
these critics would charge that flat roofs were a form of jewish architecture .
the emancipation of women in the 1920s and very active talk of erotic fulfillment was another focal point of intense conflict . would you say the weimar republic was an early victim of globalization ?
do you think it would have survived if the great depression of 1929 had n't occurred ? the great depression was the final blow .
if we look at the economy and the election of 1928 just prior to the onset of the great depression , we can see a move back to the center politically and signs of serious economic progress .
this is the last year of the so-called fabled golden years of the republic .
without the depression , the republic would at least have had a chance .
it had managed to survive the hyperinflation of 1923 , as disruptive and disorienting as that event was .
but it was the depression that came from the united states to germany very fast and very strongly that certainly unleashed the final blow . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : hyperinflation in 1923 made german currency worthless and sparked an economic crisis at the same time we should not forget that few democracies have been founded in such difficult circumstances as the weimar republic .
the republic needed a long breathing space , it needed a more expansive and forgiving attitude on the part of the western allies , it needed economic stability and progress - all of that was in precious short supply in the post-world war i years . what led finally to the demise of democracy in the weimar republic ?
after all , in the 1928 general election , the nazis won just 2.6 percent of the vote ; five years later hitler was in power . it 's true , in 1928 , the nazi party was a marginal , unimportant political group which had very little resonance beyond some very distinctive places that were already in depression before the great depression - agricultural areas in particular .
but in many ways , the republic was seriously undermined and the political system paralyzed prior to the nazi seizure of power .
in a depression especially , people look for solutions and the republic was not offering any to the economic crisis .
from 1930 onwards , germany was governed under a presidential dictatorship because the political system was so fragmented that the reichstag could not assemble or function in parliamentary majority .
so the chancellor from spring of 1930 onwards , heinrich brüning and his successors , governed largely through emergency powers proclaimed by the president , field marshall paul von hindenburg . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the nazis never received a majority vote but i do want to underscore the fact that the nazis never received a majority vote in a popular , freely contested election .
in the summer of 1932 , they received 37.4 percent of the vote - the highest they would ever receive .
it 's a significant jump to be sure but that 's not a majority and the popular phrase that one hears so often in the united states , " the german people elected hitler to power or elected the nazis to power " - that 's wrong , it 's inaccurate , it 's untrue .
the nazis were never elected to power .
in the next election , in the fall of 1932 , they already lost a significant percentage of the support they had gained in the summer .
the nazi party was in disarray .
at the very end , they came to power because the establishment conservative elite , a coterie of powerful men around president hindenburg , handed power over to the nazis .
that alliance is what ultimately killed the republic . what lessons can be drawn from the weimar republic ?
implied throughout your book is the question of whether it is possible for contemporary democracies to succumb to neo-fascist forces in the same way that the weimar republic fell to the nazis . present day germany is a well-established democratic system .
it gives me no worries whatsoever .
to be sure there are some extreme right-wing groups that can be dangerous and the reaction against them is still a little slow sometimes .
but these groups are marginal and berlin is not weimar . my worries are more about my own country , the us , in the sense that the threats to democracy do n't always come from abroad .
the most dangerous threat may come from within .
that was certainly the case in weimar , especially in its last years .
what worries me is when certain people or institutions mouth talk of democracy but in reality undermine the very practices of democracy .
of course the nazis were never committed to democracy but they used the populist rhetoric that resonated with people .
when that kind of populist rhetoric masks undemocratic practices , that 's where i think we truly need to be concerned . the analogy that does worry me greatly is when establishment conservatives make radical conservatives salonfähig or in colloquial english " acceptable in polite society . "
i think to a certain extent that indeed has occurred in the united states .
when establishment conservatives go beyond the bounds of legitimate democratic discourse and constitutional provisions and make the program , the individuals and ideas of radical conservatives acceptable - that 's when we 're in trouble . in recent months , there seems to be a revival of interest in the weimar republic in the united states , whether it 's in fashion , art or music .
how do you explain that ? bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : a 1922 work by george grosz it 's been most curious .
and it 's true especially in new york .
i think it has to do with the sense of fragility that comes out of the sept .
11 attacks .
what people adopt is the weimar republic as portrayed in the american production of " cabaret " for example - there 's a vision of weimar as degenerate , as crisis-ridden all of which is true in part .
there was an exhibit at the metropolitan museum on weimar portraiture featuring otto dix und george grosz .
of course , if that 's all you know , you think of weimar as a period of only mutilated bodies and distorted features .
but what that interpretation misses of course is the democratic promise , the cultural innovation .
but it is that sense of fragility that has given weimar this glow in downtown as well as uptown new york culture . interview : sonia phalnikar send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

afghan president karzai sees the proposed increase of troops in the country as unnecessary . a day after it was officially confirmed that nato had made a request to the german defense ministry to provide 250 combat troops to a quick reaction force in northern afghanistan , former nato chief of staff harald kujat warned that german soldiers were ill-equipped to deal with combat operations against the taliban and al qaeda insurgents . kujat , a former chairperson of nato 's military committee , deplored the lack of adequate hardware at the disposal of the german military and said on wednesday , jan .
30 , that bundeswehr troops " did not even have functioning devices , with which they could communicate with their allies in afghanistan . " nato submitted a formal request on tuesday for germany to provide a replacement for the 350-strong norwegian force that leaves in july after an initial inquiry had been made late last year . the german defense ministry confirmed earlier this month that it was considering whether to deploy the troops , responding to a media report that referred to a " new quality " in the german engagement in afghanistan . government officials have , however , in recent weeks denied that supplying a rapid reaction force would amount to sending men into combat .
they said the force was designed to provide emergency support to other troops in the north and that though its brief would include hunting " terrorists " and dealing with kidnappings this would not be its main task . inadequate equipment could cost lives bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : soldiers could be at risk from lack of equipment kujat called on german defense minister franz josef jung to prevent such a deployment as the inadequacy of german military equipment and lack of necessary supplies could lead to casualties , in addition to those which would come from engaging the enemy . he maintained that the soldiers themselves were well-trained and qualified to deal with the challenges of combat but the serious deficits in modern and efficient guidance systems and communication devices could negate their skills as soldiers . jung was in kabul for discussions with afghan president hamid karzai on tuesday , and made it clear that german soldiers were " ready to participate in operations against terrorists and cooperate with other international forces in any other part of the country . " reacting to the news that nato planned to send more troops to his country to counter the threat of a resurgent taliban back by supporters of al qaeda , karzai said training the afghan police and army was more important than sending more foreign troops to the country . karzai doubts wisdom of sending more troops bildunterschrift : president karzai advocated more investment in the afghan police and army " more than anything else , we need help to rebuild our human capital and our institutions , our army , our police force , our administrative structure , our judiciary and so on , " karzai told german newspaper die welt on wednesday . " although the situation has finally improved , the unintentional bombing of afghan civilians by nato and us troops is particularly painful , although it stems from a lack of ground troops , " he added .
" however , i am not sure that sending more troops is the right answer . " the western alliance already has around 37,000 troops deployed in the country .
nato commanders say they need some 7,500 extra troops to carry out their mission as they battle the taliban .
afghanistan 's army currently numbers 58,000 troops , with a target of 70,000 . karzai said he had the impression that the war " is not happening here , " but was being exported to afghanistan from other countries . " we should concentrate on the sanctuaries and the training camps , " he said .
" afghanistan is not a sanctuary .
it was one , but we have taken it back . " focus should shift to pakistan bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : taliban fighters are thought to be re-grouping in pakistan most concern focuses on the mountainous border area with pakistan , where afghan and western forces believe taliban extremists regroup to launch attacks in southern afghanistan . karzai said his recent meeting with pakistan 's under-pressure president pervez musharraf had been " very constructive . " " my hope is that pakistan will take harder and clearer measures in the future and thus becomes a region where extremism is no longer used as a political instrument , " he was quoted as saying .
" if pakistan takes a step in this direction , we in afghanistan will take many steps to support it . " dw staff -lrb- nda -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

did germany 's experiment with democracy between 1919 and 1933 ever stand a real chance ?
eric weitz , a us historian and author , has the answers . on jan .
30 , 1933 , hitler was named german chancellor , spelling the end to the weimar republic - germany 's convulsive experiment with democracy between 1919 and 1933 .
the period was dubbed the " weimar republic " by historians in honor of the city of weimar , where a national assembly convened to write and adopt a new constitution for the german reich following the nation 's defeat in world war i. the weimar republic was marked on the one hand by hyperinflation , mass unemployment and political instability ; on the other , by dazzling creativity in the arts and sciences and a legendary nightlife in berlin . eric weitz , chairman of the history department at the university of minnesota in the united states , last year published an acclaimed book on the period : " weimar germany : promise and tragedy . "
dw-world.de spoke with him about the spirit of the time , the factors leading to the nazi seizure of power and the lessons to be drawn from the weimar republic . dw-world.de : one of the premises of your book is that the weimar republic should not be seen simply as a prelude to nazi dictatorship but as an era in its own right . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : weitz argues that the weimar republic should be valued in its own right eric weitz : it certainly should be seen as an era in its own right .
the weimar republic was a wonderfully creative period .
we should not constantly look back from the 12 years of the third reich to the 14 years of the weimar republic because the republic was a period of very important political , cultural and social innovation .
we need to remember and value it in its own right .
every issue about the weimar republic , about life in germany in the 1920s was intensely debated - both at the high intellectual and artistic level as well at the level of politics and society . how do you explain the cultural and artistic blossoming in germany , and particularly in berlin , in the 1920s ?
after all , this was a nation battered by war , with millions of dead , and plagued by hyperinflation and instability . the intense innovation of weimar is related precisely to these factors .
many people focus exclusively on the despair that came out of world war i. there was despair in abundance to be sure .
two million germans died in world war i , 4 million were wounded , and men who came back were often severely wounded , both physically and psychologically .
women at the home front during the war , experienced four years of intense privation .
and afterwards there came the post-war crisis - readjustment and hyperinflation . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : otto dix , who created this work in 1920 , was one of the prominent german artists of the weimar republic but to a certain extent , that intense instability of economy , society and politics fuelled this deep intellectual engagement with the problems of living in the modern age , of what should be germany 's political configuration .
but beyond that , the revolution of 1918/19 was crucial to this cultural efflorescence as well .
the revolution threw out the kaiser and established a democratic system - the most democratic system the germans had lived under to that point .
the spirit of revolution created a sense that the future was open , it was one of unbounded possibilities that it could be shaped in a more humanitarian way .
it could not last forever , but it 's that sense that underpins much of the cultural innovation of the republic . yet there were people in germany who hated the weimar republic .
who were they ?
and why did they want it to fail if it was so promising and attractive ? everything about the weimar republic was contested .
the kinds of artists , thinkers , architects whom i focus on in the book - much or all of their work was intensely challenged from the right .
by that i mean the establishment right - the old-line aristocrats , high government officials , army officers , businessmen , bankers , people from the church who by and large were not only anti-socialist and anti-communist but anti-democratic as well .
the revolution in 1918/19 left their powers intact by and large .
it established a political democracy but did not undermine at all the social situation and powers of this old-line conservative elite . that conservative elite , after the initial flurry of revolution , challenged the republic every step of the way .
many of the focal points of conflict were not just in the political sphere but in the cultural and social sphere as well .
there was , for example , the so-called " zehlendorf roof wars " in which conservatives , architects , and critics - nazis as well - claimed that the flat roofs of modern architectural style was distinctly un-german and true german architecture had pitched roofs .
these critics would charge that flat roofs were a form of jewish architecture .
the emancipation of women in the 1920s and very active talk of erotic fulfillment was another focal point of intense conflict . would you say the weimar republic was an early victim of globalization ?
do you think it would have survived if the great depression of 1929 had n't occurred ? the great depression was the final blow .
if we look at the economy and the election of 1928 just prior to the onset of the great depression , we can see a move back to the center politically and signs of serious economic progress .
this is the last year of the so-called fabled golden years of the republic .
without the depression , the republic would at least have had a chance .
it had managed to survive the hyperinflation of 1923 , as disruptive and disorienting as that event was .
but it was the depression that came from the united states to germany very fast and very strongly that certainly unleashed the final blow . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : hyperinflation in 1923 made german currency worthless and sparked an economic crisis at the same time we should not forget that few democracies have been founded in such difficult circumstances as the weimar republic .
the republic needed a long breathing space , it needed a more expansive and forgiving attitude on the part of the western allies , it needed economic stability and progress - all of that was in precious short supply in the post-world war i years . what led finally to the demise of democracy in the weimar republic ?
after all , in the 1928 general election , the nazis won just 2.6 percent of the vote ; five years later hitler was in power . it 's true , in 1928 , the nazi party was a marginal , unimportant political group which had very little resonance beyond some very distinctive places that were already in depression before the great depression - agricultural areas in particular .
but in many ways , the republic was seriously undermined and the political system paralyzed prior to the nazi seizure of power .
in a depression especially , people look for solutions and the republic was not offering any to the economic crisis .
from 1930 onwards , germany was governed under a presidential dictatorship because the political system was so fragmented that the reichstag could not assemble or function in parliamentary majority .
so the chancellor from spring of 1930 onwards , heinrich brüning and his successors , governed largely through emergency powers proclaimed by the president , field marshall paul von hindenburg . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the nazis never received a majority vote but i do want to underscore the fact that the nazis never received a majority vote in a popular , freely contested election .
in the summer of 1932 , they received 37.4 percent of the vote - the highest they would ever receive .
it 's a significant jump to be sure but that 's not a majority and the popular phrase that one hears so often in the united states , " the german people elected hitler to power or elected the nazis to power " - that 's wrong , it 's inaccurate , it 's untrue .
the nazis were never elected to power .
in the next election , in the fall of 1932 , they already lost a significant percentage of the support they had gained in the summer .
the nazi party was in disarray .
at the very end , they came to power because the establishment conservative elite , a coterie of powerful men around president hindenburg , handed power over to the nazis .
that alliance is what ultimately killed the republic . what lessons can be drawn from the weimar republic ?
implied throughout your book is the question of whether it is possible for contemporary democracies to succumb to neo-fascist forces in the same way that the weimar republic fell to the nazis . present day germany is a well-established democratic system .
it gives me no worries whatsoever .
to be sure there are some extreme right-wing groups that can be dangerous and the reaction against them is still a little slow sometimes .
but these groups are marginal and berlin is not weimar . my worries are more about my own country , the us , in the sense that the threats to democracy do n't always come from abroad .
the most dangerous threat may come from within .
that was certainly the case in weimar , especially in its last years .
what worries me is when certain people or institutions mouth talk of democracy but in reality undermine the very practices of democracy .
of course the nazis were never committed to democracy but they used the populist rhetoric that resonated with people .
when that kind of populist rhetoric masks undemocratic practices , that 's where i think we truly need to be concerned . the analogy that does worry me greatly is when establishment conservatives make radical conservatives salonfähig or in colloquial english " acceptable in polite society . "
i think to a certain extent that indeed has occurred in the united states .
when establishment conservatives go beyond the bounds of legitimate democratic discourse and constitutional provisions and make the program , the individuals and ideas of radical conservatives acceptable - that 's when we 're in trouble . in recent months , there seems to be a revival of interest in the weimar republic in the united states , whether it 's in fashion , art or music .
how do you explain that ? bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : a 1922 work by george grosz it 's been most curious .
and it 's true especially in new york .
i think it has to do with the sense of fragility that comes out of the sept .
11 attacks .
what people adopt is the weimar republic as portrayed in the american production of " cabaret " for example - there 's a vision of weimar as degenerate , as crisis-ridden all of which is true in part .
there was an exhibit at the metropolitan museum on weimar portraiture featuring otto dix und george grosz .
of course , if that 's all you know , you think of weimar as a period of only mutilated bodies and distorted features .
but what that interpretation misses of course is the democratic promise , the cultural innovation .
but it is that sense of fragility that has given weimar this glow in downtown as well as uptown new york culture . interview : sonia phalnikar send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

and afterwards there came the post-war crisis - readjustment and hyperinflation . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : otto dix , who created this work in 1920 , was one of the prominent german artists of the weimar republic but to a certain extent , that intense instability of economy , society and politics fuelled this deep intellectual engagement with the problems of living in the modern age , of what should be germany 's political configuration .
but beyond that , the revolution of 1918/19 was crucial to this cultural efflorescence as well .
the revolution threw out the kaiser and established a democratic system - the most democratic system the germans had lived under to that point .
the spirit of revolution created a sense that the future was open , it was one of unbounded possibilities that it could be shaped in a more humanitarian way .
it could not last forever , but it 's that sense that underpins much of the cultural innovation of the republic . yet there were people in germany who hated the weimar republic .
who were they ?
and why did they want it to fail if it was so promising and attractive ? everything about the weimar republic was contested .
the kinds of artists , thinkers , architects whom i focus on in the book - much or all of their work was intensely challenged from the right .
by that i mean the establishment right - the old-line aristocrats , high government officials , army officers , businessmen , bankers , people from the church who by and large were not only anti-socialist and anti-communist but anti-democratic as well .
the revolution in 1918/19 left their powers intact by and large .
it established a political democracy but did not undermine at all the social situation and powers of this old-line conservative elite . that conservative elite , after the initial flurry of revolution , challenged the republic every step of the way .
many of the focal points of conflict were not just in the political sphere but in the cultural and social sphere as well .
there was , for example , the so-called " zehlendorf roof wars " in which conservatives , architects , and critics - nazis as well - claimed that the flat roofs of modern architectural style was distinctly un-german and true german architecture had pitched roofs .
these critics would charge that flat roofs were a form of jewish architecture .
the emancipation of women in the 1920s and very active talk of erotic fulfillment was another focal point of intense conflict . would you say the weimar republic was an early victim of globalization ?
do you think it would have survived if the great depression of 1929 had n't occurred ? the great depression was the final blow .
if we look at the economy and the election of 1928 just prior to the onset of the great depression , we can see a move back to the center politically and signs of serious economic progress .
this is the last year of the so-called fabled golden years of the republic .
without the depression , the republic would at least have had a chance .
it had managed to survive the hyperinflation of 1923 , as disruptive and disorienting as that event was .
but it was the depression that came from the united states to germany very fast and very strongly that certainly unleashed the final blow . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : hyperinflation in 1923 made german currency worthless and sparked an economic crisis at the same time we should not forget that few democracies have been founded in such difficult circumstances as the weimar republic .
the republic needed a long breathing space , it needed a more expansive and forgiving attitude on the part of the western allies , it needed economic stability and progress - all of that was in precious short supply in the post-world war i years . what led finally to the demise of democracy in the weimar republic ?
after all , in the 1928 general election , the nazis won just 2.6 percent of the vote ; five years later hitler was in power . it 's true , in 1928 , the nazi party was a marginal , unimportant political group which had very little resonance beyond some very distinctive places that were already in depression before the great depression - agricultural areas in particular .
but in many ways , the republic was seriously undermined and the political system paralyzed prior to the nazi seizure of power .
in a depression especially , people look for solutions and the republic was not offering any to the economic crisis .
from 1930 onwards , germany was governed under a presidential dictatorship because the political system was so fragmented that the reichstag could not assemble or function in parliamentary majority .
so the chancellor from spring of 1930 onwards , heinrich brüning and his successors , governed largely through emergency powers proclaimed by the president , field marshall paul von hindenburg . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the nazis never received a majority vote but i do want to underscore the fact that the nazis never received a majority vote in a popular , freely contested election .
in the summer of 1932 , they received 37.4 percent of the vote - the highest they would ever receive .
it 's a significant jump to be sure but that 's not a majority and the popular phrase that one hears so often in the united states , " the german people elected hitler to power or elected the nazis to power " - that 's wrong , it 's inaccurate , it 's untrue .
the nazis were never elected to power .
in the next election , in the fall of 1932 , they already lost a significant percentage of the support they had gained in the summer .
the nazi party was in disarray .
at the very end , they came to power because the establishment conservative elite , a coterie of powerful men around president hindenburg , handed power over to the nazis .
that alliance is what ultimately killed the republic . what lessons can be drawn from the weimar republic ?
implied throughout your book is the question of whether it is possible for contemporary democracies to succumb to neo-fascist forces in the same way that the weimar republic fell to the nazis . present day germany is a well-established democratic system .
it gives me no worries whatsoever .
to be sure there are some extreme right-wing groups that can be dangerous and the reaction against them is still a little slow sometimes .
but these groups are marginal and berlin is not weimar . my worries are more about my own country , the us , in the sense that the threats to democracy do n't always come from abroad .
the most dangerous threat may come from within .
that was certainly the case in weimar , especially in its last years .
what worries me is when certain people or institutions mouth talk of democracy but in reality undermine the very practices of democracy .
of course the nazis were never committed to democracy but they used the populist rhetoric that resonated with people .
when that kind of populist rhetoric masks undemocratic practices , that 's where i think we truly need to be concerned . the analogy that does worry me greatly is when establishment conservatives make radical conservatives salonfähig or in colloquial english " acceptable in polite society . "
i think to a certain extent that indeed has occurred in the united states .
when establishment conservatives go beyond the bounds of legitimate democratic discourse and constitutional provisions and make the program , the individuals and ideas of radical conservatives acceptable - that 's when we 're in trouble . in recent months , there seems to be a revival of interest in the weimar republic in the united states , whether it 's in fashion , art or music .
how do you explain that ? bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : a 1922 work by george grosz it 's been most curious .
and it 's true especially in new york .
i think it has to do with the sense of fragility that comes out of the sept .

of course , if that 's all you know , you think of weimar as a period of only mutilated bodies and distorted features .

did germany 's experiment with democracy between 1919 and 1933 ever stand a real chance ?
eric weitz , a us historian and author , has the answers . on jan .
30 , 1933 , hitler was named german chancellor , spelling the end to the weimar republic - germany 's convulsive experiment with democracy between 1919 and 1933 .
the period was dubbed the " weimar republic " by historians in honor of the city of weimar , where a national assembly convened to write and adopt a new constitution for the german reich following the nation 's defeat in world war i. the weimar republic was marked on the one hand by hyperinflation , mass unemployment and political instability ; on the other , by dazzling creativity in the arts and sciences and a legendary nightlife in berlin . eric weitz , chairman of the history department at the university of minnesota in the united states , last year published an acclaimed book on the period : " weimar germany : promise and tragedy . "
dw-world.de spoke with him about the spirit of the time , the factors leading to the nazi seizure of power and the lessons to be drawn from the weimar republic . dw-world.de : one of the premises of your book is that the weimar republic should not be seen simply as a prelude to nazi dictatorship but as an era in its own right . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : weitz argues that the weimar republic should be valued in its own right eric weitz : it certainly should be seen as an era in its own right .
the weimar republic was a wonderfully creative period .
we should not constantly look back from the 12 years of the third reich to the 14 years of the weimar republic because the republic was a period of very important political , cultural and social innovation .
we need to remember and value it in its own right .
every issue about the weimar republic , about life in germany in the 1920s was intensely debated - both at the high intellectual and artistic level as well at the level of politics and society . how do you explain the cultural and artistic blossoming in germany , and particularly in berlin , in the 1920s ?
after all , this was a nation battered by war , with millions of dead , and plagued by hyperinflation and instability . the intense innovation of weimar is related precisely to these factors .
many people focus exclusively on the despair that came out of world war i. there was despair in abundance to be sure .
two million germans died in world war i , 4 million were wounded , and men who came back were often severely wounded , both physically and psychologically .
women at the home front during the war , experienced four years of intense privation .
and afterwards there came the post-war crisis - readjustment and hyperinflation . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : otto dix , who created this work in 1920 , was one of the prominent german artists of the weimar republic but to a certain extent , that intense instability of economy , society and politics fuelled this deep intellectual engagement with the problems of living in the modern age , of what should be germany 's political configuration .
but beyond that , the revolution of 1918/19 was crucial to this cultural efflorescence as well .
the revolution threw out the kaiser and established a democratic system - the most democratic system the germans had lived under to that point .

it could not last forever , but it 's that sense that underpins much of the cultural innovation of the republic . yet there were people in germany who hated the weimar republic .
who were they ?
and why did they want it to fail if it was so promising and attractive ? everything about the weimar republic was contested .
the kinds of artists , thinkers , architects whom i focus on in the book - much or all of their work was intensely challenged from the right .
by that i mean the establishment right - the old-line aristocrats , high government officials , army officers , businessmen , bankers , people from the church who by and large were not only anti-socialist and anti-communist but anti-democratic as well .

implied throughout your book is the question of whether it is possible for contemporary democracies to succumb to neo-fascist forces in the same way that the weimar republic fell to the nazis . present day germany is a well-established democratic system .
it gives me no worries whatsoever .
to be sure there are some extreme right-wing groups that can be dangerous and the reaction against them is still a little slow sometimes .
but these groups are marginal and berlin is not weimar . my worries are more about my own country , the us , in the sense that the threats to democracy do n't always come from abroad .
the most dangerous threat may come from within .
that was certainly the case in weimar , especially in its last years .
what worries me is when certain people or institutions mouth talk of democracy but in reality undermine the very practices of democracy .
of course the nazis were never committed to democracy but they used the populist rhetoric that resonated with people .
when that kind of populist rhetoric masks undemocratic practices , that 's where i think we truly need to be concerned . the analogy that does worry me greatly is when establishment conservatives make radical conservatives salonfähig or in colloquial english " acceptable in polite society . "
i think to a certain extent that indeed has occurred in the united states .
when establishment conservatives go beyond the bounds of legitimate democratic discourse and constitutional provisions and make the program , the individuals and ideas of radical conservatives acceptable - that 's when we 're in trouble . in recent months , there seems to be a revival of interest in the weimar republic in the united states , whether it 's in fashion , art or music .

did germany 's experiment with democracy between 1919 and 1933 ever stand a real chance ?
eric weitz , a us historian and author , has the answers . on jan .
30 , 1933 , hitler was named german chancellor , spelling the end to the weimar republic - germany 's convulsive experiment with democracy between 1919 and 1933 .
the period was dubbed the " weimar republic " by historians in honor of the city of weimar , where a national assembly convened to write and adopt a new constitution for the german reich following the nation 's defeat in world war i. the weimar republic was marked on the one hand by hyperinflation , mass unemployment and political instability ; on the other , by dazzling creativity in the arts and sciences and a legendary nightlife in berlin . eric weitz , chairman of the history department at the university of minnesota in the united states , last year published an acclaimed book on the period : " weimar germany : promise and tragedy . "
dw-world.de spoke with him about the spirit of the time , the factors leading to the nazi seizure of power and the lessons to be drawn from the weimar republic . dw-world.de : one of the premises of your book is that the weimar republic should not be seen simply as a prelude to nazi dictatorship but as an era in its own right . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : weitz argues that the weimar republic should be valued in its own right eric weitz : it certainly should be seen as an era in its own right .
the weimar republic was a wonderfully creative period .
we should not constantly look back from the 12 years of the third reich to the 14 years of the weimar republic because the republic was a period of very important political , cultural and social innovation .
we need to remember and value it in its own right .
every issue about the weimar republic , about life in germany in the 1920s was intensely debated - both at the high intellectual and artistic level as well at the level of politics and society . how do you explain the cultural and artistic blossoming in germany , and particularly in berlin , in the 1920s ?
after all , this was a nation battered by war , with millions of dead , and plagued by hyperinflation and instability . the intense innovation of weimar is related precisely to these factors .
many people focus exclusively on the despair that came out of world war i. there was despair in abundance to be sure .
two million germans died in world war i , 4 million were wounded , and men who came back were often severely wounded , both physically and psychologically .
women at the home front during the war , experienced four years of intense privation .
and afterwards there came the post-war crisis - readjustment and hyperinflation . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : otto dix , who created this work in 1920 , was one of the prominent german artists of the weimar republic but to a certain extent , that intense instability of economy , society and politics fuelled this deep intellectual engagement with the problems of living in the modern age , of what should be germany 's political configuration .
but beyond that , the revolution of 1918/19 was crucial to this cultural efflorescence as well .
the revolution threw out the kaiser and established a democratic system - the most democratic system the germans had lived under to that point .
the spirit of revolution created a sense that the future was open , it was one of unbounded possibilities that it could be shaped in a more humanitarian way .
it could not last forever , but it 's that sense that underpins much of the cultural innovation of the republic . yet there were people in germany who hated the weimar republic .
who were they ?
and why did they want it to fail if it was so promising and attractive ? everything about the weimar republic was contested .
the kinds of artists , thinkers , architects whom i focus on in the book - much or all of their work was intensely challenged from the right .
by that i mean the establishment right - the old-line aristocrats , high government officials , army officers , businessmen , bankers , people from the church who by and large were not only anti-socialist and anti-communist but anti-democratic as well .
the revolution in 1918/19 left their powers intact by and large .
it established a political democracy but did not undermine at all the social situation and powers of this old-line conservative elite . that conservative elite , after the initial flurry of revolution , challenged the republic every step of the way .
many of the focal points of conflict were not just in the political sphere but in the cultural and social sphere as well .
there was , for example , the so-called " zehlendorf roof wars " in which conservatives , architects , and critics - nazis as well - claimed that the flat roofs of modern architectural style was distinctly un-german and true german architecture had pitched roofs .
these critics would charge that flat roofs were a form of jewish architecture .
the emancipation of women in the 1920s and very active talk of erotic fulfillment was another focal point of intense conflict . would you say the weimar republic was an early victim of globalization ?
do you think it would have survived if the great depression of 1929 had n't occurred ? the great depression was the final blow .
if we look at the economy and the election of 1928 just prior to the onset of the great depression , we can see a move back to the center politically and signs of serious economic progress .
this is the last year of the so-called fabled golden years of the republic .
without the depression , the republic would at least have had a chance .
it had managed to survive the hyperinflation of 1923 , as disruptive and disorienting as that event was .
but it was the depression that came from the united states to germany very fast and very strongly that certainly unleashed the final blow . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : hyperinflation in 1923 made german currency worthless and sparked an economic crisis at the same time we should not forget that few democracies have been founded in such difficult circumstances as the weimar republic .
the republic needed a long breathing space , it needed a more expansive and forgiving attitude on the part of the western allies , it needed economic stability and progress - all of that was in precious short supply in the post-world war i years . what led finally to the demise of democracy in the weimar republic ?
after all , in the 1928 general election , the nazis won just 2.6 percent of the vote ; five years later hitler was in power . it 's true , in 1928 , the nazi party was a marginal , unimportant political group which had very little resonance beyond some very distinctive places that were already in depression before the great depression - agricultural areas in particular .
but in many ways , the republic was seriously undermined and the political system paralyzed prior to the nazi seizure of power .
in a depression especially , people look for solutions and the republic was not offering any to the economic crisis .
from 1930 onwards , germany was governed under a presidential dictatorship because the political system was so fragmented that the reichstag could not assemble or function in parliamentary majority .
so the chancellor from spring of 1930 onwards , heinrich brüning and his successors , governed largely through emergency powers proclaimed by the president , field marshall paul von hindenburg . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the nazis never received a majority vote but i do want to underscore the fact that the nazis never received a majority vote in a popular , freely contested election .
in the summer of 1932 , they received 37.4 percent of the vote - the highest they would ever receive .
it 's a significant jump to be sure but that 's not a majority and the popular phrase that one hears so often in the united states , " the german people elected hitler to power or elected the nazis to power " - that 's wrong , it 's inaccurate , it 's untrue .
the nazis were never elected to power .
in the next election , in the fall of 1932 , they already lost a significant percentage of the support they had gained in the summer .
the nazi party was in disarray .
at the very end , they came to power because the establishment conservative elite , a coterie of powerful men around president hindenburg , handed power over to the nazis .

afghan president karzai sees the proposed increase of troops in the country as unnecessary . a day after it was officially confirmed that nato had made a request to the german defense ministry to provide 250 combat troops to a quick reaction force in northern afghanistan , former nato chief of staff harald kujat warned that german soldiers were ill-equipped to deal with combat operations against the taliban and al qaeda insurgents . kujat , a former chairperson of nato 's military committee , deplored the lack of adequate hardware at the disposal of the german military and said on wednesday , jan .

" nato submitted a formal request on tuesday for germany to provide a replacement for the 350-strong norwegian force that leaves in july after an initial inquiry had been made late last year . the german defense ministry confirmed earlier this month that it was considering whether to deploy the troops , responding to a media report that referred to a " new quality " in the german engagement in afghanistan . government officials have , however , in recent weeks denied that supplying a rapid reaction force would amount to sending men into combat .
they said the force was designed to provide emergency support to other troops in the north and that though its brief would include hunting " terrorists " and dealing with kidnappings this would not be its main task . inadequate equipment could cost lives bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : soldiers could be at risk from lack of equipment kujat called on german defense minister franz josef jung to prevent such a deployment as the inadequacy of german military equipment and lack of necessary supplies could lead to casualties , in addition to those which would come from engaging the enemy . he maintained that the soldiers themselves were well-trained and qualified to deal with the challenges of combat but the serious deficits in modern and efficient guidance systems and communication devices could negate their skills as soldiers . jung was in kabul for discussions with afghan president hamid karzai on tuesday , and made it clear that german soldiers were " ready to participate in operations against terrorists and cooperate with other international forces in any other part of the country . " reacting to the news that nato planned to send more troops to his country to counter the threat of a resurgent taliban back by supporters of al qaeda , karzai said training the afghan police and army was more important than sending more foreign troops to the country . karzai doubts wisdom of sending more troops bildunterschrift : president karzai advocated more investment in the afghan police and army " more than anything else , we need help to rebuild our human capital and our institutions , our army , our police force , our administrative structure , our judiciary and so on , " karzai told german newspaper die welt on wednesday . " although the situation has finally improved , the unintentional bombing of afghan civilians by nato and us troops is particularly painful , although it stems from a lack of ground troops , " he added .
" however , i am not sure that sending more troops is the right answer . " the western alliance already has around 37,000 troops deployed in the country .
nato commanders say they need some 7,500 extra troops to carry out their mission as they battle the taliban .
afghanistan 's army currently numbers 58,000 troops , with a target of 70,000 . karzai said he had the impression that the war " is not happening here , " but was being exported to afghanistan from other countries . " we should concentrate on the sanctuaries and the training camps , " he said .

michael ballack is the biggest german soccer star in years : success at home and abroad , captain of his country , immense wealth .
but has he done enough to be regarded as a legend should he retire at the tender age of 31 ? germans love their talismanic soccer players , especially those who can control games and lead with passion and by example .
germany 's soccer history is full of men who drove their nation towards greatness while sweeping all before them at club level .
most of them enjoyed hugely successful careers and finished their playing days having achieved everything , and in some cases more , than had been expected of them . michael ballack has always been expected to join the likes of beckenbauer , rummenigge , matthäus , et al. in the pantheon of german soccer greats .
ever since a young ballack first arrived on the professional soccer scene in 1995 , he has been spoken of in the most glowing of terms .
his destiny as a german legend has always been discussed in absolutes .
no one who has watched ballack 's rise has been anything other than convinced that he would become a german icon . so what , then , would all those observers make of news that ballack pack it in in a year 's time and end a career that has yet to reach the heights expected of it ? ballack hints at early retirement " what comes when my contract expires , we 'll just have to see , " british media have quoted him as saying .
" whether i stay another year , go somewhere else or hang up my boots - you never know in soccer . " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : ballack waxed lyrical about hanging up his boots in a year while the player himself has not actually confirmed that this statement , reported in his adopted homeland of the uk this week , is a sign of his impending retirement at the end of the 2008/2009 season , the mere fact that he has spoken of ending his career at the young age of 31 raises questions about ballack 's legacy . from those early days at fc chemnitzer , where his precocious , driving midfield performances led to a transfer to the bundesliga 's kaiserslautern and then leverkusen , through his trophy-laden days at bayern munich to his multi-million-euro move to chelsea , ballack has been reaching for the status and titles which would assure his place in germany 's history . trophy haul lacking international sparkle ballack has collected a fair haul of silverware in his time , picking up four bundesliga titles , three german cups and one league cup with bayern munich and an fa cup and league cup in england with chelsea .
but , one champions league runners-up medal aside , ballack has yet to make his stamp on european club soccer like those his legendary compatriots left behind . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the premiership has proved a real challenge to ballack if his career ends in the blue of chelsea , will observers look back and wonder whether ballack would have achieved more at , say , real madrid or either of the milan teams ? it was obvious in his first year in london that the premiership was a more brutal and quicker beast than the bundesliga he had been used to .
ballack 's clever eye and languid style may have flourished faster and with more confidence in the slower italian league and the spanish game may have suited his creative flair .
who knows what he could have achieved if he had moved to either country from bayern munich in 2006 ? ballack 's collection of consolation trophies away from the domestic and european scene , ballack has also been building a legacy on the international level .
since making his germany debut in 1999 , ballack has won 77 caps and scored 35 goals .
he has played in two world cup semi-finals - missing out on the 2002 world cup final through suspension - and one confederations cup semi-final .
he has led his country as captain since 2004 . and yet , for all the celebrations and plaudits , germany have not won an international tournament since the 1996 european championships .
ballack has led the side in some great victories but as yet , none of these victories resulted in a trophy -lsb- other than a third-place consolation -rsb- being lifted by the captain . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : can ballack end his international career with glory ?
so what would ballack be leaving behind in terms of a record if he were to retire in a year 's time ?
well , he could spend his free time polishing a clutch of german domestic trophies , a couple of english cups and a handful of reminders of some international near-misses .
but would this be enough to warrant his own pedestal in germany 's hall of fame ? compared with franz beckenbauer 's one world cup , one european championship and three european cups , rummenigge 's one european championship and two european cups , and matthäus with his one world cup and one european championship , ballack would struggle to make the list in terms of significant titles . ballack 's performances rate highly - but high enough ? trophies aside , could any of ballack 's individual performances stand out in much the same way as the kaiser 's mercurial domination of the 1974 world cup final , or the way matthäus outshone maradona in the 1990 final in rome ? bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : ballack 's performances in the 2002 world cup made him a star the closest would be his performances during the 2002 world cup - among his finest in a germany jersey .
it would not be an exaggeration to say ballack won the quarter and semi-finals for his country on his own , not only through his deciding goals but through his overall commitment .
again , would this be enough ? if ballack does retire without any further major honors to his name and a season of workmanlike performances behind him , he will forever be known as a " good " german player .

michael ballack is the biggest german soccer star in years : success at home and abroad , captain of his country , immense wealth .
but has he done enough to be regarded as a legend should he retire at the tender age of 31 ? germans love their talismanic soccer players , especially those who can control games and lead with passion and by example .
germany 's soccer history is full of men who drove their nation towards greatness while sweeping all before them at club level .
most of them enjoyed hugely successful careers and finished their playing days having achieved everything , and in some cases more , than had been expected of them . michael ballack has always been expected to join the likes of beckenbauer , rummenigge , matthäus , et al. in the pantheon of german soccer greats .
ever since a young ballack first arrived on the professional soccer scene in 1995 , he has been spoken of in the most glowing of terms .
his destiny as a german legend has always been discussed in absolutes .
no one who has watched ballack 's rise has been anything other than convinced that he would become a german icon . so what , then , would all those observers make of news that ballack pack it in in a year 's time and end a career that has yet to reach the heights expected of it ? ballack hints at early retirement " what comes when my contract expires , we 'll just have to see , " british media have quoted him as saying .
" whether i stay another year , go somewhere else or hang up my boots - you never know in soccer . " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : ballack waxed lyrical about hanging up his boots in a year while the player himself has not actually confirmed that this statement , reported in his adopted homeland of the uk this week , is a sign of his impending retirement at the end of the 2008/2009 season , the mere fact that he has spoken of ending his career at the young age of 31 raises questions about ballack 's legacy . from those early days at fc chemnitzer , where his precocious , driving midfield performances led to a transfer to the bundesliga 's kaiserslautern and then leverkusen , through his trophy-laden days at bayern munich to his multi-million-euro move to chelsea , ballack has been reaching for the status and titles which would assure his place in germany 's history . trophy haul lacking international sparkle ballack has collected a fair haul of silverware in his time , picking up four bundesliga titles , three german cups and one league cup with bayern munich and an fa cup and league cup in england with chelsea .
but , one champions league runners-up medal aside , ballack has yet to make his stamp on european club soccer like those his legendary compatriots left behind . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the premiership has proved a real challenge to ballack if his career ends in the blue of chelsea , will observers look back and wonder whether ballack would have achieved more at , say , real madrid or either of the milan teams ? it was obvious in his first year in london that the premiership was a more brutal and quicker beast than the bundesliga he had been used to .
ballack 's clever eye and languid style may have flourished faster and with more confidence in the slower italian league and the spanish game may have suited his creative flair .
who knows what he could have achieved if he had moved to either country from bayern munich in 2006 ? ballack 's collection of consolation trophies away from the domestic and european scene , ballack has also been building a legacy on the international level .
since making his germany debut in 1999 , ballack has won 77 caps and scored 35 goals .
he has played in two world cup semi-finals - missing out on the 2002 world cup final through suspension - and one confederations cup semi-final .
he has led his country as captain since 2004 . and yet , for all the celebrations and plaudits , germany have not won an international tournament since the 1996 european championships .
ballack has led the side in some great victories but as yet , none of these victories resulted in a trophy -lsb- other than a third-place consolation -rsb- being lifted by the captain . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : can ballack end his international career with glory ?
so what would ballack be leaving behind in terms of a record if he were to retire in a year 's time ?
well , he could spend his free time polishing a clutch of german domestic trophies , a couple of english cups and a handful of reminders of some international near-misses .
but would this be enough to warrant his own pedestal in germany 's hall of fame ? compared with franz beckenbauer 's one world cup , one european championship and three european cups , rummenigge 's one european championship and two european cups , and matthäus with his one world cup and one european championship , ballack would struggle to make the list in terms of significant titles . ballack 's performances rate highly - but high enough ? trophies aside , could any of ballack 's individual performances stand out in much the same way as the kaiser 's mercurial domination of the 1974 world cup final , or the way matthäus outshone maradona in the 1990 final in rome ? bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : ballack 's performances in the 2002 world cup made him a star the closest would be his performances during the 2002 world cup - among his finest in a germany jersey .
it would not be an exaggeration to say ballack won the quarter and semi-finals for his country on his own , not only through his deciding goals but through his overall commitment .
again , would this be enough ? if ballack does retire without any further major honors to his name and a season of workmanlike performances behind him , he will forever be known as a " good " german player .

ballack 's clever eye and languid style may have flourished faster and with more confidence in the slower italian league and the spanish game may have suited his creative flair .
who knows what he could have achieved if he had moved to either country from bayern munich in 2006 ? ballack 's collection of consolation trophies away from the domestic and european scene , ballack has also been building a legacy on the international level .
since making his germany debut in 1999 , ballack has won 77 caps and scored 35 goals .
he has played in two world cup semi-finals - missing out on the 2002 world cup final through suspension - and one confederations cup semi-final .
he has led his country as captain since 2004 . and yet , for all the celebrations and plaudits , germany have not won an international tournament since the 1996 european championships .
ballack has led the side in some great victories but as yet , none of these victories resulted in a trophy -lsb- other than a third-place consolation -rsb- being lifted by the captain . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : can ballack end his international career with glory ?
so what would ballack be leaving behind in terms of a record if he were to retire in a year 's time ?
well , he could spend his free time polishing a clutch of german domestic trophies , a couple of english cups and a handful of reminders of some international near-misses .
but would this be enough to warrant his own pedestal in germany 's hall of fame ? compared with franz beckenbauer 's one world cup , one european championship and three european cups , rummenigge 's one european championship and two european cups , and matthäus with his one world cup and one european championship , ballack would struggle to make the list in terms of significant titles . ballack 's performances rate highly - but high enough ? trophies aside , could any of ballack 's individual performances stand out in much the same way as the kaiser 's mercurial domination of the 1974 world cup final , or the way matthäus outshone maradona in the 1990 final in rome ? bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : ballack 's performances in the 2002 world cup made him a star the closest would be his performances during the 2002 world cup - among his finest in a germany jersey .
it would not be an exaggeration to say ballack won the quarter and semi-finals for his country on his own , not only through his deciding goals but through his overall commitment .
again , would this be enough ? if ballack does retire without any further major honors to his name and a season of workmanlike performances behind him , he will forever be known as a " good " german player .

michael ballack is the biggest german soccer star in years : success at home and abroad , captain of his country , immense wealth .
but has he done enough to be regarded as a legend should he retire at the tender age of 31 ? germans love their talismanic soccer players , especially those who can control games and lead with passion and by example .
germany 's soccer history is full of men who drove their nation towards greatness while sweeping all before them at club level .
most of them enjoyed hugely successful careers and finished their playing days having achieved everything , and in some cases more , than had been expected of them . michael ballack has always been expected to join the likes of beckenbauer , rummenigge , matthäus , et al. in the pantheon of german soccer greats .
ever since a young ballack first arrived on the professional soccer scene in 1995 , he has been spoken of in the most glowing of terms .
his destiny as a german legend has always been discussed in absolutes .
no one who has watched ballack 's rise has been anything other than convinced that he would become a german icon . so what , then , would all those observers make of news that ballack pack it in in a year 's time and end a career that has yet to reach the heights expected of it ? ballack hints at early retirement " what comes when my contract expires , we 'll just have to see , " british media have quoted him as saying .
" whether i stay another year , go somewhere else or hang up my boots - you never know in soccer . " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : ballack waxed lyrical about hanging up his boots in a year while the player himself has not actually confirmed that this statement , reported in his adopted homeland of the uk this week , is a sign of his impending retirement at the end of the 2008/2009 season , the mere fact that he has spoken of ending his career at the young age of 31 raises questions about ballack 's legacy . from those early days at fc chemnitzer , where his precocious , driving midfield performances led to a transfer to the bundesliga 's kaiserslautern and then leverkusen , through his trophy-laden days at bayern munich to his multi-million-euro move to chelsea , ballack has been reaching for the status and titles which would assure his place in germany 's history . trophy haul lacking international sparkle ballack has collected a fair haul of silverware in his time , picking up four bundesliga titles , three german cups and one league cup with bayern munich and an fa cup and league cup in england with chelsea .

a subsequent german review revealed the country 's weight demographics .
now a new study shows the extent of the problem . germany is facing more of a challenge in the battle of the bulge than first thought , according to a new study on eating habits in the country .
the survey showed that more than half of all germans were too fat , with two-thirds of all men and 51 percent of women officially overweight .
but in another shocking revelation , the national consumption study has shown that 10 percent of german girls under 17 years of age were underweight and were not eating enough to remain healthy .

the study 's figures were based on the body mass index -lrb- bmi -rrb- of an overweight person being between 25 and 30 .
this bmi is calculated by dividing an individual 's bodyweight by the square of their height .
the higher the bmi , the higher the risk that the person will develop an illness such as diabetes or heart disease .
a separate report in the stuttgarter zeitung newspaper stated that every fifth german had a bmi of over 30 .

the annual costs of treating nutrition-related illnesses amounted to 70 billion euros -lrb- $ 95.3 billion -rrb- , which was 30 percent of germany 's overall health costs recorded at the time .
the government survey followed on from a similar one done by the international association for the study of obesity , in 2007 .
it found that among eu countries , germany had the most overweight women and men .
among adults , the study found that 58.9 percent of german women were overweight ; 75.4 percent of men tipped the scales .

a subsequent german review revealed the country 's weight demographics .
now a new study shows the extent of the problem . germany is facing more of a challenge in the battle of the bulge than first thought , according to a new study on eating habits in the country .
the survey showed that more than half of all germans were too fat , with two-thirds of all men and 51 percent of women officially overweight .
but in another shocking revelation , the national consumption study has shown that 10 percent of german girls under 17 years of age were underweight and were not eating enough to remain healthy .
the study showed that the difference between the consumption of men and women was striking .
while almost one-third of 18- to 29-year-old men were overweight , every tenth young woman was too thin .

only 10 percent of the interviewees had any idea how many calories they needed each day or how many they consumed .
the study 's figures were based on the body mass index -lrb- bmi -rrb- of an overweight person being between 25 and 30 .
this bmi is calculated by dividing an individual 's bodyweight by the square of their height .
the higher the bmi , the higher the risk that the person will develop an illness such as diabetes or heart disease .
a separate report in the stuttgarter zeitung newspaper stated that every fifth german had a bmi of over 30 .

studies show extent of challenge facing germany the last government survey on obesity in germany , taken last may , stated that around 37 million adults and around 2 million children in germany were overweight .

afghan president karzai sees the proposed increase of troops in the country as unnecessary . a day after it was officially confirmed that nato had made a request to the german defense ministry to provide 250 combat troops to a quick reaction force in northern afghanistan , former nato chief of staff harald kujat warned that german soldiers were ill-equipped to deal with combat operations against the taliban and al qaeda insurgents . kujat , a former chairperson of nato 's military committee , deplored the lack of adequate hardware at the disposal of the german military and said on wednesday , jan .
30 , that bundeswehr troops " did not even have functioning devices , with which they could communicate with their allies in afghanistan . " nato submitted a formal request on tuesday for germany to provide a replacement for the 350-strong norwegian force that leaves in july after an initial inquiry had been made late last year . the german defense ministry confirmed earlier this month that it was considering whether to deploy the troops , responding to a media report that referred to a " new quality " in the german engagement in afghanistan . government officials have , however , in recent weeks denied that supplying a rapid reaction force would amount to sending men into combat .
they said the force was designed to provide emergency support to other troops in the north and that though its brief would include hunting " terrorists " and dealing with kidnappings this would not be its main task . inadequate equipment could cost lives bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : soldiers could be at risk from lack of equipment kujat called on german defense minister franz josef jung to prevent such a deployment as the inadequacy of german military equipment and lack of necessary supplies could lead to casualties , in addition to those which would come from engaging the enemy . he maintained that the soldiers themselves were well-trained and qualified to deal with the challenges of combat but the serious deficits in modern and efficient guidance systems and communication devices could negate their skills as soldiers . jung was in kabul for discussions with afghan president hamid karzai on tuesday , and made it clear that german soldiers were " ready to participate in operations against terrorists and cooperate with other international forces in any other part of the country . " reacting to the news that nato planned to send more troops to his country to counter the threat of a resurgent taliban back by supporters of al qaeda , karzai said training the afghan police and army was more important than sending more foreign troops to the country . karzai doubts wisdom of sending more troops bildunterschrift : president karzai advocated more investment in the afghan police and army " more than anything else , we need help to rebuild our human capital and our institutions , our army , our police force , our administrative structure , our judiciary and so on , " karzai told german newspaper die welt on wednesday . " although the situation has finally improved , the unintentional bombing of afghan civilians by nato and us troops is particularly painful , although it stems from a lack of ground troops , " he added .
" however , i am not sure that sending more troops is the right answer . " the western alliance already has around 37,000 troops deployed in the country .
nato commanders say they need some 7,500 extra troops to carry out their mission as they battle the taliban .
afghanistan 's army currently numbers 58,000 troops , with a target of 70,000 . karzai said he had the impression that the war " is not happening here , " but was being exported to afghanistan from other countries . " we should concentrate on the sanctuaries and the training camps , " he said .
" afghanistan is not a sanctuary .
it was one , but we have taken it back . " focus should shift to pakistan bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : taliban fighters are thought to be re-grouping in pakistan most concern focuses on the mountainous border area with pakistan , where afghan and western forces believe taliban extremists regroup to launch attacks in southern afghanistan . karzai said his recent meeting with pakistan 's under-pressure president pervez musharraf had been " very constructive . " " my hope is that pakistan will take harder and clearer measures in the future and thus becomes a region where extremism is no longer used as a political instrument , " he was quoted as saying .
" if pakistan takes a step in this direction , we in afghanistan will take many steps to support it . " dw staff -lrb- nda -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

8 and will present poland 's alternative route , which would be 20 percent shorter and cost only a fraction of the planned nord stream pipeline under the baltic , according to poland 's dziennik daily newspaper . the polish economics ministry confirmed that tusk would bring a new plan to moscow during his first visit since taking office in november but refused to confirm the newspaper 's speculation over the details . " we are preparing a report on the transport of gas via a land route , which is simpler , less expensive and more secure , " economics ministry spokesman piotr zbikowski said .
" the prime minister will take this report with him to moscow .

30 that the serbian province will declare its independence within days of this weekend 's serbian presidential elections , regardless of who wins the vote . " the developments in serbia do not have any influence on kosovo , " thaci , the leader of the ethnic albanian majority in the breakaway serbian province , told journalists after meeting with senior police officials .
" the independence of kosovo will happen in the next few days , regardless if tadic or nikolic wins . " reuters news agency reported wednesday , quoting unnamed sources , that kosovo would declare independence after the serbian presidential election on feb .
3 if the nationalist candidate tomislav nikolic wins . " if -lrb- tomislav -rrb- nikolic wins , it 's the 9th or 10th , " a senior political source said about the possible date of independence on condition of anonymity . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : tadic has the backing of the us and the european union a second source confirmed that if pro-western incumbent boris tadic wins the closely fought race , ethnic albanians in the breakaway province would be expected to wait at least another week , possibly declaring on feb .
17 . sunday 's presidential run-off pits hard-line serb nationalist nikolic against pro-western tadic .
analysts say the election , which could decide serbia 's attitude to the west after kosovo 's independence , will go all the way to the wire .
tadic 's two-point lead in recent polls is well within the statistical margin of error . independence backed by west , opposed by russia the plan by kosovo 's ethnic albanian leaders to make a unilateral declaration of independence is backed by the united states and most members of the european union .

" we are preparing a report on the transport of gas via a land route , which is simpler , less expensive and more secure , " economics ministry spokesman piotr zbikowski said .
" the prime minister will take this report with him to moscow . " dziennik reported that the new polish proposal had been " agreed with baltic and nordic states " and foresees the construction of a pipeline from russia to germany via estonia , latvia , lithuania and poland . polish proposal avoids seabed route the alternative route has been developed in an attempt by poland to avoid the seabed route planned by russian energy titan gazprom and germany 's eon and basf and which has been vehemently opposed by poland , estonia , latvia and lithuania .

a subsequent german review revealed the country 's weight demographics .
now a new study shows the extent of the problem . germany is facing more of a challenge in the battle of the bulge than first thought , according to a new study on eating habits in the country .
the survey showed that more than half of all germans were too fat , with two-thirds of all men and 51 percent of women officially overweight .
but in another shocking revelation , the national consumption study has shown that 10 percent of german girls under 17 years of age were underweight and were not eating enough to remain healthy .
the study showed that the difference between the consumption of men and women was striking .
while almost one-third of 18- to 29-year-old men were overweight , every tenth young woman was too thin .

only 10 percent of the interviewees had any idea how many calories they needed each day or how many they consumed .
the study 's figures were based on the body mass index -lrb- bmi -rrb- of an overweight person being between 25 and 30 .
this bmi is calculated by dividing an individual 's bodyweight by the square of their height .
the higher the bmi , the higher the risk that the person will develop an illness such as diabetes or heart disease .
a separate report in the stuttgarter zeitung newspaper stated that every fifth german had a bmi of over 30 .
over 20,000 germans between 14 and 80 took part in the national consumption study and divulged information on eating behavior , sporting activities , shopping practices and lifestyle .
studies show extent of challenge facing germany the last government survey on obesity in germany , taken last may , stated that around 37 million adults and around 2 million children in germany were overweight .
one-fourth of adult germans suffered from cardiovascular diseases , while there were around 4 million diabetics in the country .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : fat is no longer just a feminist issue one in five german women and one in seven men reportedly suffered from chronic back pain .
the annual costs of treating nutrition-related illnesses amounted to 70 billion euros -lrb- $ 95.3 billion -rrb- , which was 30 percent of germany 's overall health costs recorded at the time .
the government survey followed on from a similar one done by the international association for the study of obesity , in 2007 .
it found that among eu countries , germany had the most overweight women and men .
among adults , the study found that 58.9 percent of german women were overweight ; 75.4 percent of men tipped the scales .

afghan president karzai sees the proposed increase of troops in the country as unnecessary . a day after it was officially confirmed that nato had made a request to the german defense ministry to provide 250 combat troops to a quick reaction force in northern afghanistan , former nato chief of staff harald kujat warned that german soldiers were ill-equipped to deal with combat operations against the taliban and al qaeda insurgents . kujat , a former chairperson of nato 's military committee , deplored the lack of adequate hardware at the disposal of the german military and said on wednesday , jan .

" reacting to the news that nato planned to send more troops to his country to counter the threat of a resurgent taliban back by supporters of al qaeda , karzai said training the afghan police and army was more important than sending more foreign troops to the country . karzai doubts wisdom of sending more troops bildunterschrift : president karzai advocated more investment in the afghan police and army " more than anything else , we need help to rebuild our human capital and our institutions , our army , our police force , our administrative structure , our judiciary and so on , " karzai told german newspaper die welt on wednesday . " although the situation has finally improved , the unintentional bombing of afghan civilians by nato and us troops is particularly painful , although it stems from a lack of ground troops , " he added .
" however , i am not sure that sending more troops is the right answer . " the western alliance already has around 37,000 troops deployed in the country .
nato commanders say they need some 7,500 extra troops to carry out their mission as they battle the taliban .
afghanistan 's army currently numbers 58,000 troops , with a target of 70,000 . karzai said he had the impression that the war " is not happening here , " but was being exported to afghanistan from other countries . " we should concentrate on the sanctuaries and the training camps , " he said .

afghan president karzai sees the proposed increase of troops in the country as unnecessary . a day after it was officially confirmed that nato had made a request to the german defense ministry to provide 250 combat troops to a quick reaction force in northern afghanistan , former nato chief of staff harald kujat warned that german soldiers were ill-equipped to deal with combat operations against the taliban and al qaeda insurgents . kujat , a former chairperson of nato 's military committee , deplored the lack of adequate hardware at the disposal of the german military and said on wednesday , jan .
30 , that bundeswehr troops " did not even have functioning devices , with which they could communicate with their allies in afghanistan . " nato submitted a formal request on tuesday for germany to provide a replacement for the 350-strong norwegian force that leaves in july after an initial inquiry had been made late last year . the german defense ministry confirmed earlier this month that it was considering whether to deploy the troops , responding to a media report that referred to a " new quality " in the german engagement in afghanistan . government officials have , however , in recent weeks denied that supplying a rapid reaction force would amount to sending men into combat .
they said the force was designed to provide emergency support to other troops in the north and that though its brief would include hunting " terrorists " and dealing with kidnappings this would not be its main task . inadequate equipment could cost lives bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : soldiers could be at risk from lack of equipment kujat called on german defense minister franz josef jung to prevent such a deployment as the inadequacy of german military equipment and lack of necessary supplies could lead to casualties , in addition to those which would come from engaging the enemy . he maintained that the soldiers themselves were well-trained and qualified to deal with the challenges of combat but the serious deficits in modern and efficient guidance systems and communication devices could negate their skills as soldiers . jung was in kabul for discussions with afghan president hamid karzai on tuesday , and made it clear that german soldiers were " ready to participate in operations against terrorists and cooperate with other international forces in any other part of the country . " reacting to the news that nato planned to send more troops to his country to counter the threat of a resurgent taliban back by supporters of al qaeda , karzai said training the afghan police and army was more important than sending more foreign troops to the country . karzai doubts wisdom of sending more troops bildunterschrift : president karzai advocated more investment in the afghan police and army " more than anything else , we need help to rebuild our human capital and our institutions , our army , our police force , our administrative structure , our judiciary and so on , " karzai told german newspaper die welt on wednesday . " although the situation has finally improved , the unintentional bombing of afghan civilians by nato and us troops is particularly painful , although it stems from a lack of ground troops , " he added .
" however , i am not sure that sending more troops is the right answer . " the western alliance already has around 37,000 troops deployed in the country .
nato commanders say they need some 7,500 extra troops to carry out their mission as they battle the taliban .
afghanistan 's army currently numbers 58,000 troops , with a target of 70,000 . karzai said he had the impression that the war " is not happening here , " but was being exported to afghanistan from other countries . " we should concentrate on the sanctuaries and the training camps , " he said .
" afghanistan is not a sanctuary .
it was one , but we have taken it back . " focus should shift to pakistan bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : taliban fighters are thought to be re-grouping in pakistan most concern focuses on the mountainous border area with pakistan , where afghan and western forces believe taliban extremists regroup to launch attacks in southern afghanistan . karzai said his recent meeting with pakistan 's under-pressure president pervez musharraf had been " very constructive . " " my hope is that pakistan will take harder and clearer measures in the future and thus becomes a region where extremism is no longer used as a political instrument , " he was quoted as saying .
" if pakistan takes a step in this direction , we in afghanistan will take many steps to support it . " dw staff -lrb- nda -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

" we are preparing a report on the transport of gas via a land route , which is simpler , less expensive and more secure , " economics ministry spokesman piotr zbikowski said .

he owes his remarkable victory instead to support from hispanics , those over 65 and independents .
see how traditional republicans voted florida was the first big state to hold its primary .
with 10 million registered voters , it is more typical of the us electorate as a whole than iowa or new hampshire .
but it does have some unusual characteristics , including a large hispanic community based in miami , a large number of retired people , and an important group of military veterans .
and it was these groups who gave senator mccain with his margin of victory .
hispanics and the retired hispanic voters were only 12 % of the republican electorate , but they voted 54 % for mr mccain , with only 14 % for mr romney , and 24 % for former new york mayor rudy giuliani .
among white voters , who made up 84 % of voters , mr romney actually beat mr mccain narrowly by 34 % to 33 % .
fully one-third of republican voters in the primary election were over 65 - much above the national average - and they gave the arizona senator 41 % of the vote , compared with 31 % for mr romney .
among voters aged 18 to 65 , voters split evenly between mr mccain -lrb- 32 % -rrb- and mr romney -lrb- 31 % -rrb- .
mr mccain , a former navy flyer who was captured by the north vietnamese , also ran strongly among those who had served in the military , who made up one-quarter of the republican electorate .
they gave mr mccain 42 % of their votes , compared to 35 % for mr romney , with mr giuliani , despite running on his experience during 9/11 , doing particularly badly among this group .
losing traditional republicans in contrast , mr mccain was particularly weak among traditional republican voters .
the florida republican primary was closed , and only voters who had previously registered as republicans could vote .
nevertheless , nearly one in five voters told the exit poll that they were now independents , and this group went strongly for mr mccain .
he won 44 % of independents , but only managed to tie mr romney -lrb- at 33 % each -rrb- for support among still declared republican voters , who made up 80 % of the electorate .
similarly , mr mccain ran strongly among the minority of republicans who described their political views as liberal or moderate , while losing 29 % to 37 % to mr romney among conservatives -lrb- who made up 61 % of republican voters -rrb- .
and he lost among those republicans who thought president bush was doing a good job , while winning strongly among the minority of his party who are disillusioned with the current administration .
religious vote religion plays an important part in american politics , with many republican voters having strong religious belief .
mr mccain only finished third among evangelicals , getting just 28 % of their vote , with mr huckabee , a former baptist minister , and mr romney tied for first .
evangelicals made up one-third of republican voters in florida , and they are a group mr mccain will have to reach out to on super tuesday , when 24 states select delegates to the republican convention .
mr mccain ran much more strongly among catholics , where he won 40 % of the vote , while he lost the white protestant vote to mr romney by 31 % to 34 % .
mr mccain also ran strongly among those who do not attend church services regularly or who have no religious beliefs .
experience and issues mr mccain 's strongest appeal to voters was his character .
about half of voters said character was most important in deciding who to vote for , and they went strongly for mr mccain ; while those who said issues were more important tended to back mr romney .
voters who said the top quality they looked for in a candidate was either experience , or saying what he believed in , voted strongly for mr mccain .
those republican voters who wanted a candidate who shared their values tended to support mr romney .
the economy emerged as the most important issue for nearly half of all republican voters in florida , far ahead of immigration , terrorism , or iraq .
mr romney showed particular strength among voters who were worried about illegal immigration , an issue in which he disagrees sharply with mr mccain .
but only 40 % of republican voters supported his policy of deporting illegal immigrants in a state with a strong immigrant presence .
and the debate on the issue may have helped mobilise mr mccain 's hispanic supporters to turn out .
uphill task the results in florida demonstrate why mr mccain , with his appeal to the centre ground , is the strongest republican challenger to democratic candidates in the november election .
he is the only republican candidate who currently is running level with either barack obama or hillary clinton in national polls .
but only 5 % of florida republicans cited " electability " as their main reason for choosing a candidate .
these results show that he still has an uphill task in convincing more traditional republican voters to back him as we approach super tuesday , when 24 states vote next week .
this analysis is based on the florida exit poll of 1516 republican primary voters conducted by edison media research and mitofsky international in 40 precincts across florida on tuesday .
the samples include 235 republican voters who voted early or absentee and were surveyed in the past week by telephone , and has a sampling error of + / -4 % . return to top e-mail this to a friend search bbc news : news front page -pipe- africa -pipe- americas -pipe- asia-pacific -pipe- europe -pipe- middle east -pipe- south asia -pipe- uk -pipe- business -pipe- health -pipe- science & environment -pipe- technology -pipe- entertainment -pipe- also in the news -pipe- have your say -pipe- newswatch -pipe- notes -pipe- contact us -pipe- about bbc news -pipe- profiles -pipe- history ^ back to top -pipe- bbc sport home -pipe- bbc homepage -pipe- contact us -pipe- help -pipe- ©

nevertheless , nearly one in five voters told the exit poll that they were now independents , and this group went strongly for mr mccain .
he won 44 % of independents , but only managed to tie mr romney -lrb- at 33 % each -rrb- for support among still declared republican voters , who made up 80 % of the electorate .
similarly , mr mccain ran strongly among the minority of republicans who described their political views as liberal or moderate , while losing 29 % to 37 % to mr romney among conservatives -lrb- who made up 61 % of republican voters -rrb- .

evangelicals made up one-third of republican voters in florida , and they are a group mr mccain will have to reach out to on super tuesday , when 24 states select delegates to the republican convention .
mr mccain ran much more strongly among catholics , where he won 40 % of the vote , while he lost the white protestant vote to mr romney by 31 % to 34 % .
mr mccain also ran strongly among those who do not attend church services regularly or who have no religious beliefs .

voters who said the top quality they looked for in a candidate was either experience , or saying what he believed in , voted strongly for mr mccain .
those republican voters who wanted a candidate who shared their values tended to support mr romney .
the economy emerged as the most important issue for nearly half of all republican voters in florida , far ahead of immigration , terrorism , or iraq .
mr romney showed particular strength among voters who were worried about illegal immigration , an issue in which he disagrees sharply with mr mccain .

writing for the bbc scotland news website , justice secretary kenny macaskill explains how such a system could work . "
i believe it 's time for a radical approach to help tackle one of the biggest problems in our society - how to offer often damaged and damaging young men a path out of crime .
the turnaround project , in irvine , targets young male offenders who are failing in other community-based programmes or who have had multiple short-term jail sentences .
a similar formula has been successfully piloted in turning point scotland 's 218 women 's service in glasgow , where a holistic , person-centred and needs-led approach is taken to help service users face up to their offending , its causes , and the impact their behaviour has on victims and communities .
we are also looking at other innovative ways of delivering services to a difficult to reach group , ensuring that men with drug and alcohol addictions can be dealt with more effectively .
if we can begin to tackle the root causes of reoffending then we stand a better chance of cutting crime in our communities .
of course showing these young men who have seemingly opted out of life that there is a more rewarding alternative to a life of crime will not be easy , but a crucial aspect of changing criminal behaviour is improving their training and employment prospects , building a bit of self-esteem , and getting them fit for life and work .
revolving door this is something we are determined to address in our action plan to revitalise community penalties but are already progressing through our support for initiatives such as the turnaround project .
it 's clear we need to target the root causes of repeat offending and low level crime which blights communities up and down the country .
a more high-profile police presence and cracking down on the availability of cheap drink to teenagers will begin to address this .
but giving young men who have lost their way another chance is also crucial if we are to develop a real culture of responsibility in this country .
i 've said before that i believe community penalties can play an increasing part in our progressive penal policy .
there is strong evidence to suggest that re-offending levels are much lower for those who carry out community penalties as opposed to short prison sentences .
it 's obvious that young men who continue along the path of addiction and offending are likely to end up in the revolving door of short prison sentences - what we are trying to do is turn people 's lives around and give them and the communities in which they live a fresh start .
no one is under the illusion that community penalties are the perfect solution , but i am fully committed to a system whereby punishment should include reparation whenever possible , providing some form of positive payback to the community they have damaged .
we are working hard to make revamped community service orders available in all levels of criminal court in scotland , ensuring payback can be imposed in every case where it would be appropriate .
and for the first time community service will soon include an element of activity other than unpaid work such as debt awareness training and support to help move an offender into employment .
it 's widely accepted that short prison sentences often fail to demonstrate to the offender that there is a more rewarding alternative to a life of crime .
as well as benefiting the local community , effective community penalties can help an offender address underlying problems , improve employment prospects and build a sense of routine and self-esteem .
this can lead to a future which is free from offending - and that is what we all want .
bed and board i want our penal policy to include a range of appropriate punishments - prison for serious and dangerous criminals as well as tough community penalties for less serious offenders .
by making the range of community penalties available to the courts as robust as possible we can help ensure they are used with confidence in all appropriate cases .
of course our clear aim is to prevent and deter crimes .
but those who offend must face the consequences of their actions .
prison places should be for serious and dangerous offenders - with publicly-run new prisons the future norm .
we will make sure that those offenders are properly managed throughout their sentence to reduce their risk to the public and stop them reoffending .
we believe less serious offenders currently cluttering our jails should be paying back their debts to society - not adding to society 's bill for their bed and board .
tough community punishments will protect the public , help offenders turn their lives around , and involve some pay back to communities they have harmed .
as a government we are positive rather than fatalistic about offending in scotland .
we can get the country off this conveyer belt , and i believe we can turn lives around through prevention , early intervention , and true rehabilitation .
but we will not be a soft touch .
we expect violent , sexual , and serious and organised criminals to be punished and the public protected .
those who do offend will face the consequences of their actions - and prison will still be a major part of that . "

writing for the bbc scotland news website , justice secretary kenny macaskill explains how such a system could work .
i believe it 's time for a radical approach to help tackle one of the biggest problems in our society - how to offer often damaged and damaging young men a path out of crime .
the turnaround project , in irvine , targets young male offenders who are failing in other community-based programmes or who have had multiple short-term jail sentences .
a similar formula has been successfully piloted in turning point scotland 's 218 women 's service in glasgow , where a holistic , person-centred and needs-led approach is taken to help service users face up to their offending , its causes , and the impact their behaviour has on victims and communities .
we are also looking at other innovative ways of delivering services to a difficult to reach group , ensuring that men with drug and alcohol addictions can be dealt with more effectively .
if we can begin to tackle the root causes of reoffending then we stand a better chance of cutting crime in our communities .
of course showing these young men who have seemingly opted out of life that there is a more rewarding alternative to a life of crime will not be easy , but a crucial aspect of changing criminal behaviour is improving their training and employment prospects , building a bit of self-esteem , and getting them fit for life and work .
revolving door this is something we are determined to address in our action plan to revitalise community penalties but are already progressing through our support for initiatives such as the turnaround project .
it 's clear we need to target the root causes of repeat offending and low level crime which blights communities up and down the country .
a more high-profile police presence and cracking down on the availability of cheap drink to teenagers will begin to address this .
but giving young men who have lost their way another chance is also crucial if we are to develop a real culture of responsibility in this country .
i 've said before that i believe community penalties can play an increasing part in our progressive penal policy .
there is strong evidence to suggest that re-offending levels are much lower for those who carry out community penalties as opposed to short prison sentences .
it 's obvious that young men who continue along the path of addiction and offending are likely to end up in the revolving door of short prison sentences - what we are trying to do is turn people 's lives around and give them and the communities in which they live a fresh start .
scotland has a record number of people serving jail sentences no one is under the illusion that community penalties are the perfect solution , but i am fully committed to a system whereby punishment should include reparation whenever possible , providing some form of positive payback to the community they have damaged .
we are working hard to make revamped community service orders available in all levels of criminal court in scotland , ensuring payback can be imposed in every case where it would be appropriate .
and for the first time community service will soon include an element of activity other than unpaid work such as debt awareness training and support to help move an offender into employment .
it 's widely accepted that short prison sentences often fail to demonstrate to the offender that there is a more rewarding alternative to a life of crime .
as well as benefiting the local community , effective community penalties can help an offender address underlying problems , improve employment prospects and build a sense of routine and self-esteem .
this can lead to a future which is free from offending - and that is what we all want .
bed and board i want our penal policy to include a range of appropriate punishments - prison for serious and dangerous criminals as well as tough community penalties for less serious offenders .
by making the range of community penalties available to the courts as robust as possible we can help ensure they are used with confidence in all appropriate cases .
of course our clear aim is to prevent and deter crimes .
but those who offend must face the consequences of their actions .
prison places should be for serious and dangerous offenders - with publicly-run new prisons the future norm .
we will make sure that those offenders are properly managed throughout their sentence to reduce their risk to the public and stop them reoffending .
we believe less serious offenders currently cluttering our jails should be paying back their debts to society - not adding to society 's bill for their bed and board .
tough community punishments will protect the public , help offenders turn their lives around , and involve some pay back to communities they have harmed .
as a government we are positive rather than fatalistic about offending in scotland .
we can get the country off this conveyer belt , and i believe we can turn lives around through prevention , early intervention , and true rehabilitation .
but we will not be a soft touch .
we expect violent , sexual , and serious and organised criminals to be punished and the public protected .
those who do offend will face the consequences of their actions - and prison will still be a major part of that .

the islamist-rooted governing ak party and the nationalist mhp say it is an issue of human rights and freedoms .
the two parties have enough votes in parliament to overturn the constitutional ban on headscarves .
a strict headscarf ban has been in force in universities since 1997 .
it was ordered by the secularist military .
the issue is highly controversial in a mainly muslim country whose secular elite - including the powerful military - sees the headscarf as a symbol of political islam , the bbc 's sarah rainsford in istanbul says .
the move to ease the ban has been criticised by judges and university officials .
chadors , veils and burkas will not be allowed - no-one will be allowed to use headscarves as political statements against the state devlet bahceli , mhp leader " solving the headscarf issue would relax a large segment of the society , " mhp leader devlet bahceli was quoted as saying by the associated press news agency .
" it is a question of rights and freedoms , " he added .
the reforms are a compromise though , our correspondent says .
the proposed changes state that only traditional scarves will be permitted in universities , tied loosely under the chin .
headscarves that cover the neck , like those worn by many turkish girls , will still be banned , as will the all-covering burka , or chador .
power struggle prime minister recep tayyip erdogan has stressed that this reform will be restricted to universities .
it will not apply to women civil servants , including teachers , who are still banned from covering their heads .
a power struggle last year between secular forces and the governing ak party ended with the akp being comprehensively re-elected in july .
opinion polls suggest there is strong public support for lifting the ban .
and some women refuse to go to university because of it .

a team of doctors in canada stumbled upon the finding while attempting to treat a morbidly obese man through deep brain stimulation -lrb- dbs -rrb- .
the electrical stimulation caused the patient to experience vivid memories .
the findings , reported in the annals of neurology , potentially pave the way for electrical stimulation to treat disorders such as alzheimer 's disease .
we hope it might provide benefit to patients with memory disorders andres lozano toronto western hospital lead researcher professor andres lozano , of the toronto western hospital , said : " this is a single case that was totally unexpected .
" we knew immediately this was important .
we are sufficiently intrigued to see if this could help people with memory disorders . "
the team had been trying to help a 50-year-old obese man with type 2 diabetes and sleeping disorders who had failed to respond to diet , medications and psychological help .
he had refused gastric surgery , and doctors decided deep brain stimulation , although experimental , was his best option .
deep brain stimulation electrodes are implanted in the brain under local anaesthesia , with the patient awake so their responses can be monitored the electrodes are stimulated by a " pacemaker " stitched into the chest it has been used for more than a decade to treat tremor , and more recently to treat parkinson 's disease , chronic pain and depression side effects can include apathy , hallucinations , depression , and even compulsive gambling - but often they are temporary it has been found to have an impact on appetite in animal tests , but has not been widely tested as a treatment for obesity in humans .
however , it has been used to treat parkinson 's disease , chronic pain , severe cluster headaches and even depression with some success .
the technique involves implanting electrodes into the brain : in this case into an area in the limbic system called the hypothalamus , which is thought to control the appetite .
when the electrodes were stimulated by electrical impulses the patient began to experience feelings of deja vu .
he then had a sudden perception of being in a park with friends .
he felt younger , thought he was around 20-years-old , and his girlfriend of the time was there .
he was an observer , and saw the scene in colour .
as the intensity of the stimulation increased , details in the scene became more vivid .
memory tests following surgery , the patient recovered for two months .
but later when the electrodes were stimulated for a second time , he experienced a similar effect .
after three weeks of constant electrical stimulation the patient performed better in memory tests than he had previously done .
a year later he again performed well in memory tests when the electrodes were stimulated , but less well when they were switched off .
the results suggest it might be possible to use deep brain stimulation directly to boost memory .
" we hopefully have found a circuit in the brain which can be modulated by stimulation , and which might provide benefit to patients with memory disorders , " said professor lozano .
professor lozano is now leading a pilot study into whether deep brain stimulation can help people with early alzheimer 's disease .
they are initially testing six patients .
susanne sorensen , of the alzheimer 's society , said : " as it is difficult to experiment on the living human brain , big leaps in understanding have occasionally been made from unexpected results when treating something unrelated or observations from rare genetic diseases and unusual lesions .
" the observations of memories recovery made during this attempt to treat extreme obesity , could be just such a ' stroke of luck ' . "
rebecca wood , chief executive of the alzheimer 's research trust , welcomed the move but said further work was clearly needed .
she said : " it will be interesting to see whether this method offers any benefit to people with alzheimer 's .
" with the number of people with alzheimer 's forecast to double within a generation , we urgently need to find ways to tackle this awful disease , but research is hugely under-funded . "

a team of doctors in canada stumbled upon the finding while attempting to treat a morbidly obese man through deep brain stimulation -lrb- dbs -rrb- .
the electrical stimulation caused the patient to experience vivid memories .
the findings , reported in the annals of neurology , potentially pave the way for electrical stimulation to treat disorders such as alzheimer 's disease .
we hope it might provide benefit to patients with memory disorders andres lozano toronto western hospital lead researcher professor andres lozano , of the toronto western hospital , said : " this is a single case that was totally unexpected .
" we knew immediately this was important .
we are sufficiently intrigued to see if this could help people with memory disorders . "
the team had been trying to help a 50-year-old obese man with type 2 diabetes and sleeping disorders who had failed to respond to diet , medications and psychological help .
he had refused gastric surgery , and doctors decided deep brain stimulation , although experimental , was his best option .
deep brain stimulation electrodes are implanted in the brain under local anaesthesia , with the patient awake so their responses can be monitored the electrodes are stimulated by a " pacemaker " stitched into the chest it has been used for more than a decade to treat tremor , and more recently to treat parkinson 's disease , chronic pain and depression side effects can include apathy , hallucinations , depression , and even compulsive gambling - but often they are temporary it has been found to have an impact on appetite in animal tests , but has not been widely tested as a treatment for obesity in humans .
however , it has been used to treat parkinson 's disease , chronic pain , severe cluster headaches and even depression with some success .
the technique involves implanting electrodes into the brain : in this case into an area in the limbic system called the hypothalamus , which is thought to control the appetite .
when the electrodes were stimulated by electrical impulses the patient began to experience feelings of deja vu .
he then had a sudden perception of being in a park with friends .
he felt younger , thought he was around 20-years-old , and his girlfriend of the time was there .
he was an observer , and saw the scene in colour .
as the intensity of the stimulation increased , details in the scene became more vivid .
memory tests following surgery , the patient recovered for two months .
but later when the electrodes were stimulated for a second time , he experienced a similar effect .
after three weeks of constant electrical stimulation the patient performed better in memory tests than he had previously done .
a year later he again performed well in memory tests when the electrodes were stimulated , but less well when they were switched off .
the results suggest it might be possible to use deep brain stimulation directly to boost memory .
" we hopefully have found a circuit in the brain which can be modulated by stimulation , and which might provide benefit to patients with memory disorders , " said professor lozano .
professor lozano is now leading a pilot study into whether deep brain stimulation can help people with early alzheimer 's disease .
they are initially testing six patients .
susanne sorensen , of the alzheimer 's society , said : " as it is difficult to experiment on the living human brain , big leaps in understanding have occasionally been made from unexpected results when treating something unrelated or observations from rare genetic diseases and unusual lesions .
" the observations of memories recovery made during this attempt to treat extreme obesity , could be just such a ' stroke of luck ' . "
rebecca wood , chief executive of the alzheimer 's research trust , welcomed the move but said further work was clearly needed .
she said : " it will be interesting to see whether this method offers any benefit to people with alzheimer 's .

by geoff adams-spink age & disability correspondent , bbc news website with the number of people over 65 predicted to rise from just under 10m to almost 17m in the next 50 years , experts are predicting a crisis in social care .
to what extent can technology be used to bridge the gap ?
the burtons ' bed sensor makes all the difference most people are now familiar with predictions of an increasingly older population - and as age rises so too does the likelihood of having an impairment or long-term health condition .
to compound the situation , it is reckoned that fewer and fewer of these older people will be part of a close-knit family unit that would normally provide some or all of their care .
the " crisis " stems from the fact that there will not be sufficient fit , working-age people to provide the support .
part of the answer could be to use technology to monitor people 's health , check their whereabouts , ensure that they are not exposed to risk and help them to communicate using video phones .
the collective term for this home-based technology that is linked to monitoring centres is telecare .
cut hospital admissions used correctly - say its supporters - telecare can postpone or avoid altogether a move into costly residential care .
what is more , by keeping an eye on a person 's health and taking preventative action , hospital admissions can also be avoided .
wally and edna burton - a couple in their late 70s - employ the technology to enable edna to manage wally 's care .
he was diagnosed with parkinson 's disease while he was in his 50s and needs a lot of support to stay at home .
a sensor placed under his mattress provides an alert in case he rolls out of bed .
if edna is unable to help her husband , a call centre is on hand to summon further assistance .
without it , she thinks that residential care would be a distinct possibility which would mean the couple no longer being able to live together .
more sleep the burtons ' telecare solution has meant an end to sleepless nights and has encouraged mr burton to stay in bed .
" in fact i think the bed sensor has been a good thing , " mrs burton told the bbc .
telecare now includes video phones for people with learning difficulties " he knows that the alarm will go off and he does n't actually want to get out of bed . "
the equipment that was installed in the burtons ' house was thanks to a partnership between aragon housing association and bedfordshire county council .
local authorities in england have - for the past two years - been able to tap into an £ 80m grant from the department of health to encourage the take up of telecare .
a good deal of the equipment is supplied by a yorkshire-based company , tunstall .
the company 's technical director , steve sadler , says that telecare is increasingly being used to help social services to manage risk : " you might find someone with a chronic disease or a learning disability or simply the risks associated with ageing ; the care team - and the person themself - will identify a set of risks , " he said .
" the simple thing about telecare is that you can put together a set of sensors to detect those risks and hopefully manage them , link the event to a remote carer so they can intervene and manage the situation before it degrades still further . "
in some cases telecare has gone beyond risk management and has enabled and encouraged communication .
sharon carden - a woman in her 50s with learning difficulties - lives in her own flat in littlehampton .
she is supported by a charity called united response which has installed video phone technology into a number of homes to assist people with daily living - helping to compile shopping lists or advice on how to cook a basic meal .
the technology also has a social networking function : while ms carden has difficulty dialling telephone numbers she can easily point to a picture of her friend emma on the screen which will start a video call .
the two women used to live together and now stay in touch via their video screens .
savings fear some campaigners fear that local authorities will be seduced by the potential savings that telecare offers at the expense of older and disabled people .
" as there 's more and more pressure on community care budgets , social services are going to be looking for options that are much more cost effective , " according to wendy gross of the national centre for independent living -lrb- ncil -rrb- .
" what we 're going to have to do is make sure that these cost cutting exercises are not disempowering the individual to make sure that disabled people are being supported effectively and that they 're not being isolated because of budget cuts . "
ncil says it will be looking at the roll out of telecare to make sure that the technology does not increase people 's isolation .

by geoff adams-spink age & disability correspondent , bbc news website with the number of people over 65 predicted to rise from just under 10m to almost 17m in the next 50 years , experts are predicting a crisis in social care .
to what extent can technology be used to bridge the gap ?
the burtons ' bed sensor makes all the difference most people are now familiar with predictions of an increasingly older population - and as age rises so too does the likelihood of having an impairment or long-term health condition .
to compound the situation , it is reckoned that fewer and fewer of these older people will be part of a close-knit family unit that would normally provide some or all of their care .
the " crisis " stems from the fact that there will not be sufficient fit , working-age people to provide the support .
part of the answer could be to use technology to monitor people 's health , check their whereabouts , ensure that they are not exposed to risk and help them to communicate using video phones .
the collective term for this home-based technology that is linked to monitoring centres is telecare .
cut hospital admissions used correctly - say its supporters - telecare can postpone or avoid altogether a move into costly residential care .
what is more , by keeping an eye on a person 's health and taking preventative action , hospital admissions can also be avoided .
wally and edna burton - a couple in their late 70s - employ the technology to enable edna to manage wally 's care .
he was diagnosed with parkinson 's disease while he was in his 50s and needs a lot of support to stay at home .
a sensor placed under his mattress provides an alert in case he rolls out of bed .
if edna is unable to help her husband , a call centre is on hand to summon further assistance .
without it , she thinks that residential care would be a distinct possibility which would mean the couple no longer being able to live together .
more sleep the burtons ' telecare solution has meant an end to sleepless nights and has encouraged mr burton to stay in bed .
" in fact i think the bed sensor has been a good thing , " mrs burton told the bbc .
telecare now includes video phones for people with learning difficulties " he knows that the alarm will go off and he does n't actually want to get out of bed . "
the equipment that was installed in the burtons ' house was thanks to a partnership between aragon housing association and bedfordshire county council .
local authorities in england have - for the past two years - been able to tap into an £ 80m grant from the department of health to encourage the take up of telecare .
a good deal of the equipment is supplied by a yorkshire-based company , tunstall .
the company 's technical director , steve sadler , says that telecare is increasingly being used to help social services to manage risk : " you might find someone with a chronic disease or a learning disability or simply the risks associated with ageing ; the care team - and the person themself - will identify a set of risks , " he said .
" the simple thing about telecare is that you can put together a set of sensors to detect those risks and hopefully manage them , link the event to a remote carer so they can intervene and manage the situation before it degrades still further . "
in some cases telecare has gone beyond risk management and has enabled and encouraged communication .
sharon carden - a woman in her 50s with learning difficulties - lives in her own flat in littlehampton .
she is supported by a charity called united response which has installed video phone technology into a number of homes to assist people with daily living - helping to compile shopping lists or advice on how to cook a basic meal .
the technology also has a social networking function : while ms carden has difficulty dialling telephone numbers she can easily point to a picture of her friend emma on the screen which will start a video call .
the two women used to live together and now stay in touch via their video screens .
savings fear some campaigners fear that local authorities will be seduced by the potential savings that telecare offers at the expense of older and disabled people .
" as there 's more and more pressure on community care budgets , social services are going to be looking for options that are much more cost effective , " according to wendy gross of the national centre for independent living -lrb- ncil -rrb- .
" what we 're going to have to do is make sure that these cost cutting exercises are not disempowering the individual to make sure that disabled people are being supported effectively and that they 're not being isolated because of budget cuts . "
ncil says it will be looking at the roll out of telecare to make sure that the technology does not increase people 's isolation .
to hear more on telecare tune in to radio 4 's you and yours at 1204 on wednesday when geoff will be reporting on the growth of telecare as part of the bbc 's care in the uk season .

the insolvency service hopes the iva protocol , which has been agreed with industry , will make the process more transparent and predictable .
some providers have been criticised for misleading consumers about the suitability of ivas .
consumer groups have given the protocol a cautious welcome .
an iva is a formal and legally binding agreement made between a debtor and creditors in england or wales , under which the debts are frozen .
today 's protocol is a significant achievement for everyone involved government minister pat mcfadden in return , the debtor agrees to pay back a certain amount every month for a set period , usually five years , after which the remainder of the debt is written off .
ivas were originally designed to offer an alternative to bankruptcy for small businesses that got into financial difficulty , but they have proved increasingly popular with individuals .
there were more than 44,331 ivas taken out in 2006 , compared with fewer than 5,000 in 1998 .
the figures began to fall during 2007 , but are expected to rise again during 2008 .
concern at the same time , the number of firms offering to arrange ivas has also grown sharply .
many debt advisers , and even some of the major high street banks , have expressed concern about the aggressive way in which ivas have been marketed and about the scale of the fees they generate .
in january 2007 , the office of fair trading ordered a number of companies to change adverts which it felt were misleading .
the protocol is no panacea , but it is a vitally important first step malcolm hurlston , cccs but many consumer groups remained worried that the wrong people were being encouraged to take out ivas .
the new protocol is a voluntary code of conduct designed by a working group comprising iva providers , creditors , consumer representatives and the government 's insolvency service .
" the insolvency service has facilitated a process which has successfully produced a voluntary code for ivas to reflect the changing needs of the market , " said pat mcfadden , the government minister responsible for the insolvency service .
" it will provide greater transparency for creditors and debtors alike by using standard clauses and a consistent format .
" today 's protocol is a significant achievement for everyone involved , " he added .
' reassurance ' the british bankers ' association -lrb- bba -rrb- said the protocol should help restore consumer faith in ivas .
" people in debt and their creditors need to know that when an iva is proposed , it is the most appropriate solution , " said bba chief executive angela knight .
" the bba , the insolvency service and the participating iva providers are united in support for this agreement , which should provide customers with the reassurances they need in order to make the right choice for their financial futures , " she added .
the government said the protocol should ensure that : debtors will be asked to detail their income and outgoings in a standardised financial statement insolvency practitioners will carry out more stringent checks on income and mortgage repayments debtors will be encouraged to try to reach an informal agreement with their creditors before being recommended for an iva there will be an agreement as to when debtors will be deemed to have failed to meet the terms of the iva , should they get into arrears with monthly repayments. a lender who rejects an iva proposal will need to give a specific explanation for the rejection .
the government added that the operation of protocol would be closely monitored and reviewed by a standing committee .
' first step ' the consumer credit counselling service -lrb- cccs -rrb- - which launched its own iva for its advice clients in april 2007 - welcomed the announcement .
" the protocol is no panacea , but it is a vitally important first step in which the insolvency service has played a key role , " said cccs chairman malcolm hurlston .
" we shall track with interest whether lenders will now scrap the hurdle rates which have often held back ivas in other suitable cases .
" similarly , we shall want to see in practice the degree of transparency promised , " he added .
martin lewis , from moneysavingexpert.com , also gave muted support .
" the iva industry has grown quickly and been hugely profitable , some companies making £ 5,000 a pop per iva , " he said .
" hardcore promotion has brought in many unwary consumers falling for the sell of ' a loophole to wipe 75 % off your debts ' , yet the reality is that ivas are a cut down version of bankruptcy , suitable for only a few .
" a voluntary code seems a weak system to address this industry , but its better than nothing , " he added .

the insolvency service hopes the iva protocol , which has been agreed with industry , will make the process more transparent and predictable .
some providers have been criticised for misleading consumers about the suitability of ivas .
consumer groups have given the protocol a cautious welcome .
an iva is a formal and legally binding agreement made between a debtor and creditors in england or wales , under which the debts are frozen . "
today 's protocol is a significant achievement for everyone involved " government minister pat mcfadden in return , the debtor agrees to pay back a certain amount every month for a set period , usually five years , after which the remainder of the debt is written off .
ivas were originally designed to offer an alternative to bankruptcy for small businesses that got into financial difficulty , but they have proved increasingly popular with individuals .
there were more than 44,331 ivas taken out in 2006 , compared with fewer than 5,000 in 1998 .
the figures began to fall during 2007 , but are expected to rise again during 2008 .
concern at the same time , the number of firms offering to arrange ivas has also grown sharply .
many debt advisers , and even some of the major high street banks , have expressed concern about the aggressive way in which ivas have been marketed and about the scale of the fees they generate .
in january 2007 , the office of fair trading ordered a number of companies to change adverts which it felt were misleading . "
the protocol is no panacea , but it is a vitally important first step " malcolm hurlston , cccs but many consumer groups remained worried that the wrong people were being encouraged to take out ivas .
the new protocol is a voluntary code of conduct designed by a working group comprising iva providers , creditors , consumer representatives and the government 's insolvency service .
" the insolvency service has facilitated a process which has successfully produced a voluntary code for ivas to reflect the changing needs of the market , " said pat mcfadden , the government minister responsible for the insolvency service .
" it will provide greater transparency for creditors and debtors alike by using standard clauses and a consistent format .
" today 's protocol is a significant achievement for everyone involved , " he added .
' reassurance ' the british bankers ' association -lrb- bba -rrb- said the protocol should help restore consumer faith in ivas .
" people in debt and their creditors need to know that when an iva is proposed , it is the most appropriate solution , " said bba chief executive angela knight .
" the bba , the insolvency service and the participating iva providers are united in support for this agreement , which should provide customers with the reassurances they need in order to make the right choice for their financial futures , " she added .
the government said the protocol should ensure that : debtors will be asked to detail their income and outgoings in a standardised financial statement insolvency practitioners will carry out more stringent checks on income and mortgage repayments debtors will be encouraged to try to reach an informal agreement with their creditors before being recommended for an iva there will be an agreement as to when debtors will be deemed to have failed to meet the terms of the iva , should they get into arrears with monthly repayments. a lender who rejects an iva proposal will need to give a specific explanation for the rejection .

the arizona senator narrowly beat mitt romney in the primary election to gain the upper hand ahead of next week 's crucial polls in 24 states .
media reports suggest former new york mayor rudy giuliani - who based his campaign on winning in florida - may endorse mr mccain and drop out .
hillary clinton won a largely symbolic victory in the democratic vote .
no delegates are at stake for the democrats because the state 's democratic party has been penalised by the national party for breaking rules on when it could hold its primary .
' getting close ' the bbc 's kevin connolly in orlando says mr mccain 's win probably makes him a slight front-runner going into super tuesday - but the closeness of the margin may also encourage mr romney . "
i do n't back down from a principle fight , but there must always be a larger purpose " rudy giuliani giuliani 's lost gamble in quotes : reaction in pictures : florida primary observers can expect things to be equally tight on super tuesday , our correspondent adds .
with 99 % of the vote counted , mr mccain led mr romney by 36 % to 31 % .
the result means mr mccain will take all 57 delegates in what is a winner-takes-all primary - the biggest prize of the primary season so far .
the delegates will attend the party 's national convention later this year when the republican candidate is chosen .
speaking to cheering supporters at a rally in miami , mr mccain said : " our victory might not have reached landslide proportions , but it was sweet nonetheless . "
he said he believed he would win the republican nomination and would go on to win " against anyone the democratic party nominates " .
" tonight , my friends , we celebrate but tomorrow it 's back to work .
we have a ways to go but we are getting close . "
florida primary : results republicans john mccain : 36 % mitt romney : 31 % rudy giuliani : 15 % mike huckabee : 13 % ron paul : 3 % democrats hillary clinton : 50 % barack obama : 33 % john edwards : 14 % with 99 % of vote counted mccain 's non-traditional win election polltracker q & a : us primary elections mr mccain 's florida victory follows a win for the arizona senator in south carolina 10 days ago and another in new hampshire on 8 january .
in campaigning , mr mccain focused on national security and had the benefit of strong support among a large number of military servicemen and veterans in the state .
mr romney , speaking in st petersburg , florida , said he had telephoned mr mccain to offer his congratulations .
a former businessman and ex-governor of massachusetts , mr romney has presented himself as someone with the credentials to shore up the economy .
he said he would be appearing at the republican presidential debate in simi valley , california , on wednesday night .
giuliani 's future mr giuliani - who had put almost all his effort into campaigning in florida - was in third place with 15 % .
mike huckabee said his campaign was far from over speaking to his supporters , he congratulated his opponents on running a " hard-fought campaign " .
he was non-committal about his own future in the race but officials have been quoted as saying he intends to endorse mr mccain for the nomination on wednesday .
mr giuliani said : " i do n't back down from a principle fight , but there must always be a larger purpose .
" elections are about a lot more than just a candidate .
elections are about fighting for a cause larger than ourselves . "
mike huckabee , who won in iowa but needed a good result in florida to keep him in contention , was fourth with 13 % .
texas congressman ron paul was fifth with 3 % of the vote .
mr huckabee thanked his activists in florida and said of his campaign : " it 's not even close to being over .
we like to believe we are just getting started . "
democratic row none of the democratic candidates campaigned in florida after the party 's national committee penalised florida for holding its primary early .
but hillary clinton - who has said she wants the state 's delegates reinstated and seated at the national convention - held a victory rally in davie , florida , as the results came in .
mrs clinton held a victory rally - but the win brings no delegates senator clinton secured 50 % to chief rival barack obama 's 33 % , with john edwards in third with 14 % .
she told supporters : " i am thrilled to have had this vote of confidence that you have given me today and i promise you i will do everything i can to make sure not only are florida 's democratic delegates seated , but florida is in the winning column for the democrats in 2008 . "
mr obama told reporters he believed the decision on delegates " should be made after the nomination , not before " .
mr obama spent the day campaigning in kansas , another super tuesday state .
he also picked up the endorsement of kansas governor kathleen sebelius , who delivered the democratic response to president george w bush 's state of the union address on monday .

the advertising standards authority -lrb- asa -rrb- said the " irresponsible " image appeared to link teenage girls with sexually provocative behaviour .
the advert shows the model with a bare midriff in a short skirt , tie , shirt and knee-high socks in a classroom .
ryanair refused to withdraw the image , but asa dismissed this as " pr bluster " .
the advert has been removed and it will not run again , an asa spokesman told bbc news .
media space owners will not accept the advert again , the spokesman said .
ryanair , in turn , described the asa ruling as " censorship " .
' widespread offence ' the advert , which was printed in three newspapers reaching 3.5 million readers - the herald , daily mail and scottish daily mail - prompted 13 complaints to the asa from readers who found it offensive .
after an investigation , the watchdog ruled the advert breached the advertising code 's rules on social responsibility and decency .
" we considered that her appearance and pose , in conjunction with the heading ' hottest ' , appeared to link teenage girls with sexually provocative behaviour and was irresponsible and likely to cause serious or widespread offence , " the watchdog said .
the asa told ryanair to withdraw the advert and ensure its future promotions complied with the advertising code . "
this is n't advertising regulation , it is simply censorship " peter sherrard ryanair send us your comments however , the airline said the model 's clothing reflected what was currently fashionable among young women and that the number of complaints was insignificant compared to the three newspapers ' combined readership .
ryanair also said its advert was considerably less suggestive than some others appearing in the media .
" it is remarkable that a picture of a fully-clothed model is now claimed to cause ' serious or widespread offence ' , when many of the uk 's leading daily newspapers regularly run pictures of topless or partially-dressed females without causing any serious or widespread offence , " said peter sherrard , head of communications for the airline .
" this is n't advertising regulation , it is simply censorship .
this bunch of unelected self-appointed dimwits are clearly incapable of fairly and impartially ruling on advertising . "
mr sherrard added that ryanair believed the advert was not irresponsible nor offensive and would therefore " not be withdrawing this ad " and would " not provide the asa with any of the undertakings they seek " .
ryanair 's stance was dismissed by the asa spokesman as " public posturing " .
the herald , which received a complaint from a reader , said they were not prepared to run it again .
the daily mail and scottish daily mail had not received any complaints from readers but said they would not run the promotion again .

ryanair also said its advert was considerably less suggestive than some others appearing in the media .
" it is remarkable that a picture of a fully-clothed model is now claimed to cause ' serious or widespread offence ' , when many of the uk 's leading daily newspapers regularly run pictures of topless or partially-dressed females without causing any serious or widespread offence , " said peter sherrard , head of communications for the airline .
" this is n't advertising regulation , it is simply censorship .
this bunch of unelected self-appointed dimwits are clearly incapable of fairly and impartially ruling on advertising . "
mr sherrard added that ryanair believed the advert was not irresponsible nor offensive and would therefore " not be withdrawing this ad " and would " not provide the asa with any of the undertakings they seek " .
ryanair 's stance was dismissed by the asa spokesman as " public posturing " .
the herald , which received a complaint from a reader , said they were not prepared to run it again .
the daily mail and scottish daily mail had not received any complaints from readers but said they would not run the promotion again .

health workers have detected some 150 suspected cases of the mosquito-borne disease so far this year .
a senior paraguayan official said there was concern that neighbouring brazil had also seen a recent rise in dengue and some dozen cases of yellow fever .
last year , 17 people died from dengue fever in paraguay and the authorities were criticised for not acting sooner .
" dengue is defeated in the streets .
we can fight the mosquitoes , chiefly by getting rid of stagnant pools of water , " said paraguayan president nicanor duarte as the health alert was declared .
dengue fever transmitted by mosquitoes symptoms of the severe , flu-like illness include severe headaches , fever , rash , joint pains seldom deadly but has potentially lethal variants found in africa , south-east asia , china , indian sub-continent , middle east , south and central america , caribbean , australia source : who his government was accused of missing warning signs in january a year ago and failing to tackle the disease properly .
a total of some 27,000 cases were registered during 2007 , 17 of them fatal .
the paraguayan health minister , oscar martinez , said the latest suspected cases were being analysed .
" we have 11 confirmed cases after the initial tests , and so we will wait a fortnight to carry out a second test to confirm whether it is dengue , " he told the bbc .
" we 're asking people to support us and help us get rid of places where mosquitoes can breed , " he said .
officials say their concern is that people who were infected last year might be more susceptible to more serious forms of the disease .
there is a much greater risk of dengue haemorrhagic fever or dengue shock syndrome when a person has immunity to one of the other types of dengue virus as a result of previous infection .

the right reverend tim stevens wants the diocese to buy leicester grammar school , located next to the cathedral , which is moving to great glen .
he says the idea is to make the area accessible to the community .
proposals for the school site include a cathedral square , a christian outreach centre , as well as teaching and hospitality facilities .
bishop stevens said : " if you go to some of the great cathedrals of england they 're all set in open space which makes the cathedral stand out but we 've never really had that in leicester .
" we 're beginning to set out our vision and talk to a number of people about the scheme which will create a whole new feel to the part of the city around the cathedral . "
he said the proposals around the 900-year-old cathedral now need support from the diocese and a number of partners in the city and county .
the grammar school is scheduled to move to great glen in autumn 2008 .
