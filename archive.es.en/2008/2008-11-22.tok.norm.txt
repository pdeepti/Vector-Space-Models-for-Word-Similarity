while member states agreed on the matter in principle , there was some disagreement on where to get the money . eu budget ministers , meeting in brussels , reached the deal late friday , nov .

the money will be released in three phases up to 2010 with an installment of 270 million euros -lrb- $ 337.4 million -rrb- due this year . " there 's agreement - and germany supports this - to make available this money for food production in the poorest countries , " said german deputy finance minister joerg asmussen . the money is earmarked for seeds and fertilizers in africa , among other places .
eu commission president jose barroso had suggested the payment six months ago . after hefty complaints from some member states , including germany , and the european parliament , the money will not come from unused eu farming subsidies .
instead , funds from the external relations budget will be re-allocated , with some of the money also coming from funds set aside for unforeseen events . the eu 's overall budget in 2009 will be 116.1 billion euros , with germany shouldering 7.4 billion euros , making it the bloc 's largest financial contributor . dpa news agency -lrb- win -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

royal 's aides said she would dispute the vote . aides to royal said saturday , nov .
22 , that she would not accept the results of friday 's election that showed her losing the race to head the french socialist party by a handful of votes . french radio reported that former party spokesman julien dray said royal was disputing the result because of apparent irregularities in some regions . " for us , there are problems -lrb- with the results -rrb- , " dray was quoted as saying .
" some things do n't make sense ...
the only solution is to hold another vote . " final results of the vote announced early saturday morning showed aubry edging out royal by 42 votes of the 137,000 cast . if the results are confirmed , the 58-year-old aubry would replace francois hollande , royal 's former partner , who is stepping down after leading the party for 11 years .
both aubry and hollande rejected the calls to have the party 's 232,000 members vote again . council to resolve dispute bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : royal 's aides say the party election was tarnished by voting irregularities instead , hollande announced saturday that the socialists would convene their national council to resolve the dispute , which threatens to split france 's second-strongest political party into factions . friday 's election was the culmination of a bitter campaign that pitted royal , 55 , against the socialist old guard , such as former prime ministers laurent fabius and lionel jospin and paris mayor bertrand delanoe , all of whom supported aubry . the acrimony continued up to the last minute , with aides to aubry claiming victory well before half the votes were counted .
royal supporters then accused their opponents of trying to influence the vote in france 's overseas territories , where the voting ended much later because of the time difference .
at one point , evry mayor manuel valls , a royal advisor , told supporters : " we will not let this victory be stolen from us . " first woman to lead party whoever is finally declared the official winner , she will become the first woman to lead the socialist party .
she will also have the monumental task of healing the deep wounds and bad blood the campaign has caused . in addition , the party will have to dispel the suspicion of voter fraud to gain credibility among the electorate and mount a strong challenge to president nicolas sarkozy in the 2012 presidential election .
in 2007 , royal became the first frenchwoman to make it to the second round of the presidential election , but she was soundly beaten by sarkozy . dpa news agency -lrb- sms -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

researchers say exposing this horror is an important step for germany as it continues to delve into its nazi past . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : registers and memorials , like this tribute to holocaust victims in berlin , hold great importance for germany " firstly , it 's a dignified way to remember the deceased , secondly , it 's a service to the families left behind , thirdly it 's important for general historical research , and fourthly it will serve an educational purpose , " morsch explained . he also said the town of brandenburg was the location where the first mentally ill jews were killed .

royal 's aides said she would dispute the vote . aides to royal said saturday , nov .
22 , that she would not accept the results of friday 's election that showed her losing the race to head the french socialist party by a handful of votes . french radio reported that former party spokesman julien dray said royal was disputing the result because of apparent irregularities in some regions . " for us , there are problems -lrb- with the results -rrb- , " dray was quoted as saying .
" some things do n't make sense ...
the only solution is to hold another vote .

" financed by the german lottery , the university in berlin and the state of brandenburg 's memorial trust , which is located in the town of brandenburg , have decided to lead the one year project because they feel the issue of euthanasia during hitler 's reign has not received the proper attention it deserves . " we have wanted to do this for years , but the state archives and many of the necessary information sources only became available after german re-unification , " said guenter morsch , a researcher at the brandenburg memorial trust . revisiting the horror it is believed that more than 100,000 people , most of whom were previously unidentified , were euthanized under operation t4 during hitler 's reign .
researchers say exposing this horror is an important step for germany as it continues to delve into its nazi past . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : registers and memorials , like this tribute to holocaust victims in berlin , hold great importance for germany " firstly , it 's a dignified way to remember the deceased , secondly , it 's a service to the families left behind , thirdly it 's important for general historical research , and fourthly it will serve an educational purpose , " morsch explained . he also said the town of brandenburg was the location where the first mentally ill jews were killed .

no one was hurt in the explosion and indications of the attack 's background or possible motives remain unclear . the suspects were in kosovo " in a private capacity " and had no immunity from prosecution , police spokesman veton elshani told the german news agency dpa . none of the german trio were " diplomats , police , soldiers or experts with international identification , " kosovar investigators said on friday . the alleged spies said they were simply inspecting damage done by the bomb 's explosion and were not involved in the attack , according to the spiegel report . one of the men told kosovar authorities he was working for the bnd , the daily sueddeutsche zeitung reported . opposition wants details bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : parliamentarians want to know exactly what the germans were doing in pristina a german government spokesman declined to speculate about the possible involvement of berlin 's security services -lrb- bnd -rrb- in the case on friday and instead pointed to the ongoing investigations . german politicians in the opposition have called for the government to inform a parliamentary oversight committee . " the status has to be made clear , " max stadler , the free-market liberal fdp 's expert for interior affairs , told dpa on saturday , adding that lawmakers needed to be informed regardless of whether there was sufficient material to charge the germans . governments usually register their intelligence agents with foreign authorities to ensure they are covered by diplomatic immunity .

lawmakers are demanding details of the arrests . the three germans were arrested wednesday in kosovo are agents for the germany federal intelligence agency -lrb- bnd -rrb- , der spiegel newsmagazine and the daily sueddeutsche zeitung reported saturday . the germans were arrested by kosovar police in connection with an attack on the european union 's headquarters in pristina on nov .

no one was hurt in the explosion and indications of the attack 's background or possible motives remain unclear . the suspects were in kosovo " in a private capacity " and had no immunity from prosecution , police spokesman veton elshani told the german news agency dpa . none of the german trio were " diplomats , police , soldiers or experts with international identification , " kosovar investigators said on friday . the alleged spies said they were simply inspecting damage done by the bomb 's explosion and were not involved in the attack , according to the spiegel report . one of the men told kosovar authorities he was working for the bnd , the daily sueddeutsche zeitung reported . opposition wants details bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : parliamentarians want to know exactly what the germans were doing in pristina a german government spokesman declined to speculate about the possible involvement of berlin 's security services -lrb- bnd -rrb- in the case on friday and instead pointed to the ongoing investigations . german politicians in the opposition have called for the government to inform a parliamentary oversight committee . " the status has to be made clear , " max stadler , the free-market liberal fdp 's expert for interior affairs , told dpa on saturday , adding that lawmakers needed to be informed regardless of whether there was sufficient material to charge the germans . governments usually register their intelligence agents with foreign authorities to ensure they are covered by diplomatic immunity .
berlin failed to accredit the three agents , leaving their legal status in kosovo unclear , according to der spiegel . an eu mission is due to take over the oversight of law-enforcement in kosovo after more than eight years of a united nations protectorate . kosovo declared independence from serbia in february .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de society -pipe- 22.11.2008 german online game on homelessness draws fire großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : pennergame is attracting 10,000 new users a day a popular german online game , called pennergame , is coming under fire for inciting prejudice against homeless people .
its name is certainly hardly flattering .
" penner " is the german word for " bum " or " dosser . " one hamburg politician , ksenija bekeris , has accused the game of violating human dignity and would like to see it banned , saying it contravenes the german constitution .
but with millions of clicks a month and more than 880,000 registered users to date the game is proving extremely popular in germany .
farbflut , the company that makes the game , said that it is a caricature that is clearly not intended to depict reality .
the point of pennergame is to advance from being a homeless person on the streets of hamburg to owning a mansion in the northern german city 's wealthy blankenese district - by hook or by crook .
pennergame 's inventors , marius follert and niels wildung , are experiencing meteoric careers of their own .
follert gave up his screen designer training program and wildung dropped out of school to pursue their dream .
pr spokesman steffen peuckert attributes the game 's success to its ability to put a traditional rags-to-riches theme in a contemporary context . true to life ?
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : such sights are not uncommon even in prosperous germany so what do people who have been or still are homeless think about the internet game .
birgit mueller , editor-in-chief of the hamburg homeless newspaper hinz und kunzt , calls the game " tasteless . "
" i am shocked the inventors are still pretty young and they have wheeled out every cliche that there is , as well as adding a few of their own to the standard ones , " she said .
" its name is also pretty hardcore , " she added .
" ' penner ' is not a nice word and if you ask a homeless person if they get called that name , then everyone i asked said ' no one calls me that . '
it is clear that homeless people perceive that as a humiliation . "
players are told that they are untalented bums who hang out at hamburg 's main railway station and can neither read nor write .
peter knows what it is like to rough it at hamburg station and sleep on a park bench .
he has been working for hinz und kunzt for the last three years , earning a small amount by selling newspapers .
" you live through it again , " he said .
" i have slept by the -lrb- river -rrb- elbe , collected bottles , just like in the game . "
reinforcing cliches about the homeless bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : can a game like pennergame avoid seeming callous ?
the options for rising up the social ranks are highly restricted in pennergame .
players are told : " it 's your goal to become rich at last .
learn to read and write so that you can finally prop up signs in front of yourself to get more attention .
buy a dog to attract sympathy .
become a con artist and steal watches , wallets and jewels from other people . "
other money-spinning possibilities include breaking into a chewing gum machine -lrb- max .
5 euros , $ 6.24 -rrb- , stealing tips left for toilet cleaners -lrb- max .
10 euros -rrb- , raiding a launderette -lrb- max .
20 euros -rrb- or a kiosk -lrb- max .
25 euros -rrb- .
hinz und kuntz newspaper seller gerrit denies this aspect of the game bears any relation to his experiences .
" i have n't raided a sausage stand , and we also never formed any proper gangs , " said the 33-year-old .
tasteless criminal connection mueller is also not amused by the mention of homeless people carrying out armed raids .
she criticized pennergame for spreading negative and false images .
" it 's been a long time since homeless people have been brought into close association with criminal people , " she said .
" of course , homeless people are n't better than anyone else .
there are also homeless people who end up in prison , but mostly because of other crimes , like fare dodging or theft , but armed gangs ...
i have n't heard of anything like that . "
but she said she can understand the appeal the game has for young people .
" homelessness takes place in a kind of subculture and subcultures are always interesting because the conditions are chaotic , because different rules apply , " mueller said .
the ambitions of many homeless people are much more modest than owning a mansion .
" having a career means getting one 's life under control , having a flat , having some kind of long-term prospects , some kind of point to your life , that is the highest form of career , " mueller said .
" homeless people can make jokes about one another , but i do n't think it 's right for two young men look down their noses like that . "
increasing awareness ?
while pennergame has offended many sensibilities , it might not be having the purely negative effect that its critics fear .
farbflut press spokesman steffen peuckert says the game has also drawn many young people 's attention to the theme of homelessness .
" the users ' feedback has been completely positive in this respect , " he said .
" we have had e-mails from people saying that they have started noticing homeless people or people collecting bottles much more since they started playing the game .
they are becoming more conscious of the problem .
some of them have even asked where they can send their donations . " dw staff -lrb- jg -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

" i am shocked the inventors are still pretty young and they have wheeled out every cliche that there is , as well as adding a few of their own to the standard ones , " she said .
" its name is also pretty hardcore , " she added .
" ' penner ' is not a nice word and if you ask a homeless person if they get called that name , then everyone i asked said ' no one calls me that . '
it is clear that homeless people perceive that as a humiliation . "
players are told that they are untalented bums who hang out at hamburg 's main railway station and can neither read nor write .
peter knows what it is like to rough it at hamburg station and sleep on a park bench .
he has been working for hinz und kunzt for the last three years , earning a small amount by selling newspapers .
" you live through it again , " he said .
" i have slept by the -lrb- river -rrb- elbe , collected bottles , just like in the game . "
reinforcing cliches about the homeless bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : can a game like pennergame avoid seeming callous ?
the options for rising up the social ranks are highly restricted in pennergame .
players are told : " it 's your goal to become rich at last .
learn to read and write so that you can finally prop up signs in front of yourself to get more attention .
buy a dog to attract sympathy .
become a con artist and steal watches , wallets and jewels from other people . "
other money-spinning possibilities include breaking into a chewing gum machine -lrb- max .
5 euros , $ 6.24 -rrb- , stealing tips left for toilet cleaners -lrb- max .
10 euros -rrb- , raiding a launderette -lrb- max .
20 euros -rrb- or a kiosk -lrb- max .
25 euros -rrb- .
hinz und kuntz newspaper seller gerrit denies this aspect of the game bears any relation to his experiences .
" i have n't raided a sausage stand , and we also never formed any proper gangs , " said the 33-year-old .
tasteless criminal connection mueller is also not amused by the mention of homeless people carrying out armed raids .
she criticized pennergame for spreading negative and false images .
" it 's been a long time since homeless people have been brought into close association with criminal people , " she said .
" of course , homeless people are n't better than anyone else .
there are also homeless people who end up in prison , but mostly because of other crimes , like fare dodging or theft , but armed gangs ...
i have n't heard of anything like that . "
but she said she can understand the appeal the game has for young people .
" homelessness takes place in a kind of subculture and subcultures are always interesting because the conditions are chaotic , because different rules apply , " mueller said .
the ambitions of many homeless people are much more modest than owning a mansion .
" having a career means getting one 's life under control , having a flat , having some kind of long-term prospects , some kind of point to your life , that is the highest form of career , " mueller said .
" homeless people can make jokes about one another , but i do n't think it 's right for two young men look down their noses like that . "
increasing awareness ?
while pennergame has offended many sensibilities , it might not be having the purely negative effect that its critics fear .
farbflut press spokesman steffen peuckert says the game has also drawn many young people 's attention to the theme of homelessness .
" the users ' feedback has been completely positive in this respect , " he said .
" we have had e-mails from people saying that they have started noticing homeless people or people collecting bottles much more since they started playing the game .
they are becoming more conscious of the problem .
some of them have even asked where they can send their donations . " dw staff -lrb- jg -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

" some things do n't make sense ...
the only solution is to hold another vote . " final results of the vote announced early saturday morning showed aubry edging out royal by 42 votes of the 137,000 cast . if the results are confirmed , the 58-year-old aubry would replace francois hollande , royal 's former partner , who is stepping down after leading the party for 11 years .

royal supporters then accused their opponents of trying to influence the vote in france 's overseas territories , where the voting ended much later because of the time difference .
at one point , evry mayor manuel valls , a royal advisor , told supporters : " we will not let this victory be stolen from us . " first woman to lead party whoever is finally declared the official winner , she will become the first woman to lead the socialist party .
she will also have the monumental task of healing the deep wounds and bad blood the campaign has caused . in addition , the party will have to dispel the suspicion of voter fraud to gain credibility among the electorate and mount a strong challenge to president nicolas sarkozy in the 2012 presidential election .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de society -pipe- 22.11.2008 german online game on homelessness draws fire großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : pennergame is attracting 10,000 new users a day a popular german online game , called pennergame , is coming under fire for inciting prejudice against homeless people .
its name is certainly hardly flattering .
" penner " is the german word for " bum " or " dosser . " one hamburg politician , ksenija bekeris , has accused the game of violating human dignity and would like to see it banned , saying it contravenes the german constitution .
but with millions of clicks a month and more than 880,000 registered users to date the game is proving extremely popular in germany .
farbflut , the company that makes the game , said that it is a caricature that is clearly not intended to depict reality .
the point of pennergame is to advance from being a homeless person on the streets of hamburg to owning a mansion in the northern german city 's wealthy blankenese district - by hook or by crook .
pennergame 's inventors , marius follert and niels wildung , are experiencing meteoric careers of their own .
follert gave up his screen designer training program and wildung dropped out of school to pursue their dream .
pr spokesman steffen peuckert attributes the game 's success to its ability to put a traditional rags-to-riches theme in a contemporary context . true to life ?
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : such sights are not uncommon even in prosperous germany so what do people who have been or still are homeless think about the internet game .
birgit mueller , editor-in-chief of the hamburg homeless newspaper hinz und kunzt , calls the game " tasteless . "
" i am shocked the inventors are still pretty young and they have wheeled out every cliche that there is , as well as adding a few of their own to the standard ones , " she said .
" its name is also pretty hardcore , " she added .
" ' penner ' is not a nice word and if you ask a homeless person if they get called that name , then everyone i asked said ' no one calls me that . '
it is clear that homeless people perceive that as a humiliation . "
players are told that they are untalented bums who hang out at hamburg 's main railway station and can neither read nor write .
peter knows what it is like to rough it at hamburg station and sleep on a park bench .
he has been working for hinz und kunzt for the last three years , earning a small amount by selling newspapers .
" you live through it again , " he said .
" i have slept by the -lrb- river -rrb- elbe , collected bottles , just like in the game . "
reinforcing cliches about the homeless bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : can a game like pennergame avoid seeming callous ?
the options for rising up the social ranks are highly restricted in pennergame .
players are told : " it 's your goal to become rich at last .
learn to read and write so that you can finally prop up signs in front of yourself to get more attention .
buy a dog to attract sympathy .
become a con artist and steal watches , wallets and jewels from other people . "
other money-spinning possibilities include breaking into a chewing gum machine -lrb- max .
5 euros , $ 6.24 -rrb- , stealing tips left for toilet cleaners -lrb- max .
10 euros -rrb- , raiding a launderette -lrb- max .
20 euros -rrb- or a kiosk -lrb- max .
25 euros -rrb- .
hinz und kuntz newspaper seller gerrit denies this aspect of the game bears any relation to his experiences .
" i have n't raided a sausage stand , and we also never formed any proper gangs , " said the 33-year-old .
tasteless criminal connection mueller is also not amused by the mention of homeless people carrying out armed raids .
she criticized pennergame for spreading negative and false images .
" it 's been a long time since homeless people have been brought into close association with criminal people , " she said .
" of course , homeless people are n't better than anyone else .
there are also homeless people who end up in prison , but mostly because of other crimes , like fare dodging or theft , but armed gangs ...
i have n't heard of anything like that . "
but she said she can understand the appeal the game has for young people .
" homelessness takes place in a kind of subculture and subcultures are always interesting because the conditions are chaotic , because different rules apply , " mueller said .
the ambitions of many homeless people are much more modest than owning a mansion .
" having a career means getting one 's life under control , having a flat , having some kind of long-term prospects , some kind of point to your life , that is the highest form of career , " mueller said .
" homeless people can make jokes about one another , but i do n't think it 's right for two young men look down their noses like that . "
increasing awareness ?
while pennergame has offended many sensibilities , it might not be having the purely negative effect that its critics fear .
farbflut press spokesman steffen peuckert says the game has also drawn many young people 's attention to the theme of homelessness .
" the users ' feedback has been completely positive in this respect , " he said .
" we have had e-mails from people saying that they have started noticing homeless people or people collecting bottles much more since they started playing the game .
they are becoming more conscious of the problem .
some of them have even asked where they can send their donations . " dw staff -lrb- jg -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

berlin 's freie university and brandenburg 's memorial trust are leading the project . hitler first outlined his nazi euthanasia campaign , which would later be called operation t4 , in his book " mein kampf . "
believed to have claimed 70,000 victims between january 1940 and august 1941 alone , the idea behind operation t4 was disseminated through nazi propaganda films depicting the mentally or terminally ill as " useless mouths to feed . " financed by the german lottery , the university in berlin and the state of brandenburg 's memorial trust , which is located in the town of brandenburg , have decided to lead the one year project because they feel the issue of euthanasia during hitler 's reign has not received the proper attention it deserves . " we have wanted to do this for years , but the state archives and many of the necessary information sources only became available after german re-unification , " said guenter morsch , a researcher at the brandenburg memorial trust . revisiting the horror it is believed that more than 100,000 people , most of whom were previously unidentified , were euthanized under operation t4 during hitler 's reign .
researchers say exposing this horror is an important step for germany as it continues to delve into its nazi past . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : registers and memorials , like this tribute to holocaust victims in berlin , hold great importance for germany " firstly , it 's a dignified way to remember the deceased , secondly , it 's a service to the families left behind , thirdly it 's important for general historical research , and fourthly it will serve an educational purpose , " morsch explained . he also said the town of brandenburg was the location where the first mentally ill jews were killed .

berlin 's freie university and brandenburg 's memorial trust are leading the project . hitler first outlined his nazi euthanasia campaign , which would later be called operation t4 , in his book " mein kampf . "
believed to have claimed 70,000 victims between january 1940 and august 1941 alone , the idea behind operation t4 was disseminated through nazi propaganda films depicting the mentally or terminally ill as " useless mouths to feed . " financed by the german lottery , the university in berlin and the state of brandenburg 's memorial trust , which is located in the town of brandenburg , have decided to lead the one year project because they feel the issue of euthanasia during hitler 's reign has not received the proper attention it deserves . " we have wanted to do this for years , but the state archives and many of the necessary information sources only became available after german re-unification , " said guenter morsch , a researcher at the brandenburg memorial trust . revisiting the horror it is believed that more than 100,000 people , most of whom were previously unidentified , were euthanized under operation t4 during hitler 's reign .
researchers say exposing this horror is an important step for germany as it continues to delve into its nazi past . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : registers and memorials , like this tribute to holocaust victims in berlin , hold great importance for germany " firstly , it 's a dignified way to remember the deceased , secondly , it 's a service to the families left behind , thirdly it 's important for general historical research , and fourthly it will serve an educational purpose , " morsch explained . he also said the town of brandenburg was the location where the first mentally ill jews were killed .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de society -pipe- 22.11.2008 german online game on homelessness draws fire großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : pennergame is attracting 10,000 new users a day a popular german online game , called pennergame , is coming under fire for inciting prejudice against homeless people .
its name is certainly hardly flattering .
" penner " is the german word for " bum " or " dosser . " one hamburg politician , ksenija bekeris , has accused the game of violating human dignity and would like to see it banned , saying it contravenes the german constitution .
but with millions of clicks a month and more than 880,000 registered users to date the game is proving extremely popular in germany .
farbflut , the company that makes the game , said that it is a caricature that is clearly not intended to depict reality .
the point of pennergame is to advance from being a homeless person on the streets of hamburg to owning a mansion in the northern german city 's wealthy blankenese district - by hook or by crook .
pennergame 's inventors , marius follert and niels wildung , are experiencing meteoric careers of their own .
follert gave up his screen designer training program and wildung dropped out of school to pursue their dream .
pr spokesman steffen peuckert attributes the game 's success to its ability to put a traditional rags-to-riches theme in a contemporary context . true to life ?
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : such sights are not uncommon even in prosperous germany so what do people who have been or still are homeless think about the internet game .
birgit mueller , editor-in-chief of the hamburg homeless newspaper hinz und kunzt , calls the game " tasteless . "
" i am shocked the inventors are still pretty young and they have wheeled out every cliche that there is , as well as adding a few of their own to the standard ones , " she said .
" its name is also pretty hardcore , " she added .
" ' penner ' is not a nice word and if you ask a homeless person if they get called that name , then everyone i asked said ' no one calls me that . '
it is clear that homeless people perceive that as a humiliation . "
players are told that they are untalented bums who hang out at hamburg 's main railway station and can neither read nor write .
peter knows what it is like to rough it at hamburg station and sleep on a park bench .
he has been working for hinz und kunzt for the last three years , earning a small amount by selling newspapers .
" you live through it again , " he said .
" i have slept by the -lrb- river -rrb- elbe , collected bottles , just like in the game . "
reinforcing cliches about the homeless bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : can a game like pennergame avoid seeming callous ?
the options for rising up the social ranks are highly restricted in pennergame .
players are told : " it 's your goal to become rich at last .
learn to read and write so that you can finally prop up signs in front of yourself to get more attention .
buy a dog to attract sympathy .
become a con artist and steal watches , wallets and jewels from other people . "
other money-spinning possibilities include breaking into a chewing gum machine -lrb- max .
5 euros , $ 6.24 -rrb- , stealing tips left for toilet cleaners -lrb- max .
10 euros -rrb- , raiding a launderette -lrb- max .
20 euros -rrb- or a kiosk -lrb- max .
25 euros -rrb- .
hinz und kuntz newspaper seller gerrit denies this aspect of the game bears any relation to his experiences .
" i have n't raided a sausage stand , and we also never formed any proper gangs , " said the 33-year-old .
tasteless criminal connection mueller is also not amused by the mention of homeless people carrying out armed raids .
she criticized pennergame for spreading negative and false images .
" it 's been a long time since homeless people have been brought into close association with criminal people , " she said .
" of course , homeless people are n't better than anyone else .
there are also homeless people who end up in prison , but mostly because of other crimes , like fare dodging or theft , but armed gangs ...
i have n't heard of anything like that . "
but she said she can understand the appeal the game has for young people .
" homelessness takes place in a kind of subculture and subcultures are always interesting because the conditions are chaotic , because different rules apply , " mueller said .
the ambitions of many homeless people are much more modest than owning a mansion .
" having a career means getting one 's life under control , having a flat , having some kind of long-term prospects , some kind of point to your life , that is the highest form of career , " mueller said .
" homeless people can make jokes about one another , but i do n't think it 's right for two young men look down their noses like that . "
increasing awareness ?
while pennergame has offended many sensibilities , it might not be having the purely negative effect that its critics fear .
farbflut press spokesman steffen peuckert says the game has also drawn many young people 's attention to the theme of homelessness .
" the users ' feedback has been completely positive in this respect , " he said .
" we have had e-mails from people saying that they have started noticing homeless people or people collecting bottles much more since they started playing the game .
they are becoming more conscious of the problem .
some of them have even asked where they can send their donations . " dw staff -lrb- jg -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

" i have n't raided a sausage stand , and we also never formed any proper gangs , " said the 33-year-old .
tasteless criminal connection mueller is also not amused by the mention of homeless people carrying out armed raids .
she criticized pennergame for spreading negative and false images .
" it 's been a long time since homeless people have been brought into close association with criminal people , " she said .
" of course , homeless people are n't better than anyone else .
there are also homeless people who end up in prison , but mostly because of other crimes , like fare dodging or theft , but armed gangs ...
i have n't heard of anything like that . "
but she said she can understand the appeal the game has for young people .
" homelessness takes place in a kind of subculture and subcultures are always interesting because the conditions are chaotic , because different rules apply , " mueller said .
the ambitions of many homeless people are much more modest than owning a mansion .
" having a career means getting one 's life under control , having a flat , having some kind of long-term prospects , some kind of point to your life , that is the highest form of career , " mueller said .
" homeless people can make jokes about one another , but i do n't think it 's right for two young men look down their noses like that . "
increasing awareness ?
while pennergame has offended many sensibilities , it might not be having the purely negative effect that its critics fear .
farbflut press spokesman steffen peuckert says the game has also drawn many young people 's attention to the theme of homelessness .
" the users ' feedback has been completely positive in this respect , " he said .
" we have had e-mails from people saying that they have started noticing homeless people or people collecting bottles much more since they started playing the game .
they are becoming more conscious of the problem .
some of them have even asked where they can send their donations . " dw staff -lrb- jg -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de society -pipe- 22.11.2008 german online game on homelessness draws fire großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : pennergame is attracting 10,000 new users a day a popular german online game , called pennergame , is coming under fire for inciting prejudice against homeless people .
its name is certainly hardly flattering .
" penner " is the german word for " bum " or " dosser . " one hamburg politician , ksenija bekeris , has accused the game of violating human dignity and would like to see it banned , saying it contravenes the german constitution .
but with millions of clicks a month and more than 880,000 registered users to date the game is proving extremely popular in germany .
farbflut , the company that makes the game , said that it is a caricature that is clearly not intended to depict reality .
the point of pennergame is to advance from being a homeless person on the streets of hamburg to owning a mansion in the northern german city 's wealthy blankenese district - by hook or by crook .
pennergame 's inventors , marius follert and niels wildung , are experiencing meteoric careers of their own .
follert gave up his screen designer training program and wildung dropped out of school to pursue their dream .
pr spokesman steffen peuckert attributes the game 's success to its ability to put a traditional rags-to-riches theme in a contemporary context . true to life ?
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : such sights are not uncommon even in prosperous germany so what do people who have been or still are homeless think about the internet game .
birgit mueller , editor-in-chief of the hamburg homeless newspaper hinz und kunzt , calls the game " tasteless . "
" i am shocked the inventors are still pretty young and they have wheeled out every cliche that there is , as well as adding a few of their own to the standard ones , " she said .
" its name is also pretty hardcore , " she added .
" ' penner ' is not a nice word and if you ask a homeless person if they get called that name , then everyone i asked said ' no one calls me that . '
it is clear that homeless people perceive that as a humiliation . "
players are told that they are untalented bums who hang out at hamburg 's main railway station and can neither read nor write .
peter knows what it is like to rough it at hamburg station and sleep on a park bench .
he has been working for hinz und kunzt for the last three years , earning a small amount by selling newspapers .
" you live through it again , " he said .
" i have slept by the -lrb- river -rrb- elbe , collected bottles , just like in the game . "
reinforcing cliches about the homeless bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : can a game like pennergame avoid seeming callous ?
the options for rising up the social ranks are highly restricted in pennergame .
players are told : " it 's your goal to become rich at last .
learn to read and write so that you can finally prop up signs in front of yourself to get more attention .
buy a dog to attract sympathy .
become a con artist and steal watches , wallets and jewels from other people . "
other money-spinning possibilities include breaking into a chewing gum machine -lrb- max .
5 euros , $ 6.24 -rrb- , stealing tips left for toilet cleaners -lrb- max .
10 euros -rrb- , raiding a launderette -lrb- max .
20 euros -rrb- or a kiosk -lrb- max .
25 euros -rrb- .
hinz und kuntz newspaper seller gerrit denies this aspect of the game bears any relation to his experiences .
" i have n't raided a sausage stand , and we also never formed any proper gangs , " said the 33-year-old .
tasteless criminal connection mueller is also not amused by the mention of homeless people carrying out armed raids .
she criticized pennergame for spreading negative and false images .
" it 's been a long time since homeless people have been brought into close association with criminal people , " she said .
" of course , homeless people are n't better than anyone else .
there are also homeless people who end up in prison , but mostly because of other crimes , like fare dodging or theft , but armed gangs ...

" having a career means getting one 's life under control , having a flat , having some kind of long-term prospects , some kind of point to your life , that is the highest form of career , " mueller said .
" homeless people can make jokes about one another , but i do n't think it 's right for two young men look down their noses like that . "

royal 's aides said she would dispute the vote . aides to royal said saturday , nov .
22 , that she would not accept the results of friday 's election that showed her losing the race to head the french socialist party by a handful of votes . french radio reported that former party spokesman julien dray said royal was disputing the result because of apparent irregularities in some regions . " for us , there are problems -lrb- with the results -rrb- , " dray was quoted as saying .
" some things do n't make sense ...
the only solution is to hold another vote . " final results of the vote announced early saturday morning showed aubry edging out royal by 42 votes of the 137,000 cast . if the results are confirmed , the 58-year-old aubry would replace francois hollande , royal 's former partner , who is stepping down after leading the party for 11 years .
both aubry and hollande rejected the calls to have the party 's 232,000 members vote again . council to resolve dispute bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : royal 's aides say the party election was tarnished by voting irregularities instead , hollande announced saturday that the socialists would convene their national council to resolve the dispute , which threatens to split france 's second-strongest political party into factions . friday 's election was the culmination of a bitter campaign that pitted royal , 55 , against the socialist old guard , such as former prime ministers laurent fabius and lionel jospin and paris mayor bertrand delanoe , all of whom supported aubry . the acrimony continued up to the last minute , with aides to aubry claiming victory well before half the votes were counted .
royal supporters then accused their opponents of trying to influence the vote in france 's overseas territories , where the voting ended much later because of the time difference .
at one point , evry mayor manuel valls , a royal advisor , told supporters : " we will not let this victory be stolen from us . " first woman to lead party whoever is finally declared the official winner , she will become the first woman to lead the socialist party .
she will also have the monumental task of healing the deep wounds and bad blood the campaign has caused . in addition , the party will have to dispel the suspicion of voter fraud to gain credibility among the electorate and mount a strong challenge to president nicolas sarkozy in the 2012 presidential election .
in 2007 , royal became the first frenchwoman to make it to the second round of the presidential election , but she was soundly beaten by sarkozy . dpa news agency -lrb- sms -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de society -pipe- 22.11.2008 german online game on homelessness draws fire großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : pennergame is attracting 10,000 new users a day a popular german online game , called pennergame , is coming under fire for inciting prejudice against homeless people .
its name is certainly hardly flattering .
" penner " is the german word for " bum " or " dosser . " one hamburg politician , ksenija bekeris , has accused the game of violating human dignity and would like to see it banned , saying it contravenes the german constitution .
but with millions of clicks a month and more than 880,000 registered users to date the game is proving extremely popular in germany .
farbflut , the company that makes the game , said that it is a caricature that is clearly not intended to depict reality .
the point of pennergame is to advance from being a homeless person on the streets of hamburg to owning a mansion in the northern german city 's wealthy blankenese district - by hook or by crook .
pennergame 's inventors , marius follert and niels wildung , are experiencing meteoric careers of their own .
follert gave up his screen designer training program and wildung dropped out of school to pursue their dream .
pr spokesman steffen peuckert attributes the game 's success to its ability to put a traditional rags-to-riches theme in a contemporary context . true to life ?
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : such sights are not uncommon even in prosperous germany so what do people who have been or still are homeless think about the internet game .
birgit mueller , editor-in-chief of the hamburg homeless newspaper hinz und kunzt , calls the game " tasteless . "
" i am shocked the inventors are still pretty young and they have wheeled out every cliche that there is , as well as adding a few of their own to the standard ones , " she said .
" its name is also pretty hardcore , " she added .
" ' penner ' is not a nice word and if you ask a homeless person if they get called that name , then everyone i asked said ' no one calls me that . '
it is clear that homeless people perceive that as a humiliation . "
players are told that they are untalented bums who hang out at hamburg 's main railway station and can neither read nor write .
peter knows what it is like to rough it at hamburg station and sleep on a park bench .
he has been working for hinz und kunzt for the last three years , earning a small amount by selling newspapers .
" you live through it again , " he said .
" i have slept by the -lrb- river -rrb- elbe , collected bottles , just like in the game . "
reinforcing cliches about the homeless bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : can a game like pennergame avoid seeming callous ?
the options for rising up the social ranks are highly restricted in pennergame .
players are told : " it 's your goal to become rich at last .
learn to read and write so that you can finally prop up signs in front of yourself to get more attention .
buy a dog to attract sympathy .
become a con artist and steal watches , wallets and jewels from other people . "
other money-spinning possibilities include breaking into a chewing gum machine -lrb- max .
5 euros , $ 6.24 -rrb- , stealing tips left for toilet cleaners -lrb- max .
10 euros -rrb- , raiding a launderette -lrb- max .
20 euros -rrb- or a kiosk -lrb- max .
25 euros -rrb- .
hinz und kuntz newspaper seller gerrit denies this aspect of the game bears any relation to his experiences .
" i have n't raided a sausage stand , and we also never formed any proper gangs , " said the 33-year-old .
tasteless criminal connection mueller is also not amused by the mention of homeless people carrying out armed raids .
she criticized pennergame for spreading negative and false images .
" it 's been a long time since homeless people have been brought into close association with criminal people , " she said .
" of course , homeless people are n't better than anyone else .
there are also homeless people who end up in prison , but mostly because of other crimes , like fare dodging or theft , but armed gangs ...
i have n't heard of anything like that . "
but she said she can understand the appeal the game has for young people .
" homelessness takes place in a kind of subculture and subcultures are always interesting because the conditions are chaotic , because different rules apply , " mueller said .
the ambitions of many homeless people are much more modest than owning a mansion .
" having a career means getting one 's life under control , having a flat , having some kind of long-term prospects , some kind of point to your life , that is the highest form of career , " mueller said .
" homeless people can make jokes about one another , but i do n't think it 's right for two young men look down their noses like that . "
increasing awareness ?
while pennergame has offended many sensibilities , it might not be having the purely negative effect that its critics fear .
farbflut press spokesman steffen peuckert says the game has also drawn many young people 's attention to the theme of homelessness .
" the users ' feedback has been completely positive in this respect , " he said .
" we have had e-mails from people saying that they have started noticing homeless people or people collecting bottles much more since they started playing the game .
they are becoming more conscious of the problem .
some of them have even asked where they can send their donations . " dw staff -lrb- jg -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

its name is certainly hardly flattering .
" penner " is the german word for " bum " or " dosser . " one hamburg politician , ksenija bekeris , has accused the game of violating human dignity and would like to see it banned , saying it contravenes the german constitution .
but with millions of clicks a month and more than 880,000 registered users to date the game is proving extremely popular in germany .
farbflut , the company that makes the game , said that it is a caricature that is clearly not intended to depict reality .
the point of pennergame is to advance from being a homeless person on the streets of hamburg to owning a mansion in the northern german city 's wealthy blankenese district - by hook or by crook .
pennergame 's inventors , marius follert and niels wildung , are experiencing meteoric careers of their own .
follert gave up his screen designer training program and wildung dropped out of school to pursue their dream .
pr spokesman steffen peuckert attributes the game 's success to its ability to put a traditional rags-to-riches theme in a contemporary context . true to life ?
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : such sights are not uncommon even in prosperous germany so what do people who have been or still are homeless think about the internet game .
birgit mueller , editor-in-chief of the hamburg homeless newspaper hinz und kunzt , calls the game " tasteless . "
" i am shocked the inventors are still pretty young and they have wheeled out every cliche that there is , as well as adding a few of their own to the standard ones , " she said .
" its name is also pretty hardcore , " she added .
" ' penner ' is not a nice word and if you ask a homeless person if they get called that name , then everyone i asked said ' no one calls me that . '
it is clear that homeless people perceive that as a humiliation . "
players are told that they are untalented bums who hang out at hamburg 's main railway station and can neither read nor write .
peter knows what it is like to rough it at hamburg station and sleep on a park bench .
he has been working for hinz und kunzt for the last three years , earning a small amount by selling newspapers .
" you live through it again , " he said .
" i have slept by the -lrb- river -rrb- elbe , collected bottles , just like in the game . "
reinforcing cliches about the homeless bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : can a game like pennergame avoid seeming callous ?
the options for rising up the social ranks are highly restricted in pennergame .
players are told : " it 's your goal to become rich at last .
learn to read and write so that you can finally prop up signs in front of yourself to get more attention .
buy a dog to attract sympathy .
become a con artist and steal watches , wallets and jewels from other people . "
other money-spinning possibilities include breaking into a chewing gum machine -lrb- max .
5 euros , $ 6.24 -rrb- , stealing tips left for toilet cleaners -lrb- max .
10 euros -rrb- , raiding a launderette -lrb- max .
20 euros -rrb- or a kiosk -lrb- max .
25 euros -rrb- .
hinz und kuntz newspaper seller gerrit denies this aspect of the game bears any relation to his experiences .
" i have n't raided a sausage stand , and we also never formed any proper gangs , " said the 33-year-old .
tasteless criminal connection mueller is also not amused by the mention of homeless people carrying out armed raids .
she criticized pennergame for spreading negative and false images .
" it 's been a long time since homeless people have been brought into close association with criminal people , " she said .
" of course , homeless people are n't better than anyone else .
there are also homeless people who end up in prison , but mostly because of other crimes , like fare dodging or theft , but armed gangs ...
i have n't heard of anything like that . "
but she said she can understand the appeal the game has for young people .
" homelessness takes place in a kind of subculture and subcultures are always interesting because the conditions are chaotic , because different rules apply , " mueller said .
the ambitions of many homeless people are much more modest than owning a mansion .
" having a career means getting one 's life under control , having a flat , having some kind of long-term prospects , some kind of point to your life , that is the highest form of career , " mueller said .
" homeless people can make jokes about one another , but i do n't think it 's right for two young men look down their noses like that . "
increasing awareness ?
while pennergame has offended many sensibilities , it might not be having the purely negative effect that its critics fear .
farbflut press spokesman steffen peuckert says the game has also drawn many young people 's attention to the theme of homelessness .
" the users ' feedback has been completely positive in this respect , " he said .
" we have had e-mails from people saying that they have started noticing homeless people or people collecting bottles much more since they started playing the game .
they are becoming more conscious of the problem .
some of them have even asked where they can send their donations . " dw staff -lrb- jg -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de society -pipe- 22.11.2008 german online game on homelessness draws fire großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : pennergame is attracting 10,000 new users a day a popular german online game , called pennergame , is coming under fire for inciting prejudice against homeless people .
its name is certainly hardly flattering .
" penner " is the german word for " bum " or " dosser . " one hamburg politician , ksenija bekeris , has accused the game of violating human dignity and would like to see it banned , saying it contravenes the german constitution .
but with millions of clicks a month and more than 880,000 registered users to date the game is proving extremely popular in germany .
farbflut , the company that makes the game , said that it is a caricature that is clearly not intended to depict reality .
the point of pennergame is to advance from being a homeless person on the streets of hamburg to owning a mansion in the northern german city 's wealthy blankenese district - by hook or by crook .
pennergame 's inventors , marius follert and niels wildung , are experiencing meteoric careers of their own .
follert gave up his screen designer training program and wildung dropped out of school to pursue their dream .
pr spokesman steffen peuckert attributes the game 's success to its ability to put a traditional rags-to-riches theme in a contemporary context . true to life ?
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : such sights are not uncommon even in prosperous germany so what do people who have been or still are homeless think about the internet game .
birgit mueller , editor-in-chief of the hamburg homeless newspaper hinz und kunzt , calls the game " tasteless . "
" i am shocked the inventors are still pretty young and they have wheeled out every cliche that there is , as well as adding a few of their own to the standard ones , " she said .
" its name is also pretty hardcore , " she added .
" ' penner ' is not a nice word and if you ask a homeless person if they get called that name , then everyone i asked said ' no one calls me that . '
it is clear that homeless people perceive that as a humiliation . "
players are told that they are untalented bums who hang out at hamburg 's main railway station and can neither read nor write .
peter knows what it is like to rough it at hamburg station and sleep on a park bench .
he has been working for hinz und kunzt for the last three years , earning a small amount by selling newspapers .
" you live through it again , " he said .
" i have slept by the -lrb- river -rrb- elbe , collected bottles , just like in the game . "

berlin 's freie university and brandenburg 's memorial trust are leading the project . hitler first outlined his nazi euthanasia campaign , which would later be called operation t4 , in his book " mein kampf . "

there 's little chance for an economic recovery next year , she said in a newspaper interview . despite the government 's efforts to ease the effects of the global financial crisis on the german economy , merkel said next year would be a difficult one . " we have to expect that the coming year , at least in the initial months , will be a year of bad news , " she told the weekly newspaper welt am sonntag in an interview to be published sunday , nov .

" we have stabilized financial markets with the rescue package but trust still needs to return . " the government would focus its efforts on protecting german jobs , she adding that companies should not be tempted to lay off workers during the economic downturn . merkel : growth will return bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : berlin is trying to offer companies a port in the economic storm " we know that growth will return after the crisis and then skilled workers are going to be urgently needed , " merkel said saturday in her weekly video podcast . she added that the government would examine ways of helping companies bridging difficult economic times and maintain staff levels until " a time when growth is again possible around the world . " the world financial crisis has pushed the global economy into a tailspin , forcing berlin and other governments to unveil stimulus packages aimed at underpinning economic growth .
germany also announced a 500 billion euro rescue plan to help its financial sector weather the current upheaval . an additional 12 billion euros in aid that federal government hopes to provide businesses , but which has not yet been discussed by german lawmakers , would be spent " in such a way that germany 's future prospects and strength in innovation will be strengthened , " she said . eu funds to promote innovation bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the eu should help ensure broadband internet access is available across the bloc merkel also said european companies should make use of the eu 's package to support innovation . " we should use the current situation to make europe ready for the future , particularly in places that are not technologically up-to-date , " she told the welt am sonntag . the chancellor called for broadband internet access for all germans while speaking at a national it summit on thursday . data released last week showed the german economy tipping into recession , with growth shrinking by a bigger-than-forecast 0.5 percent during the third quarter , on top of a 0.4 percent contraction in the second quarter . a slew of major indicators and data to be published next week are forecast to confirm the economic deterioration is underway in germany with business confidence declining again and the long run of falling unemployment in the country coming to an end . on friday , the government said a decline in tax revenue as a result of the contraction in europe 's biggest economy had forced it to boost borrowings by 10.5 billion euros to meet plans for spurring growth . dw staff -lrb- sms -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

there 's little chance for an economic recovery next year , she said in a newspaper interview . despite the government 's efforts to ease the effects of the global financial crisis on the german economy , merkel said next year would be a difficult one . " we have to expect that the coming year , at least in the initial months , will be a year of bad news , " she told the weekly newspaper welt am sonntag in an interview to be published sunday , nov .
23 .
" we have stabilized financial markets with the rescue package but trust still needs to return . " the government would focus its efforts on protecting german jobs , she adding that companies should not be tempted to lay off workers during the economic downturn . merkel : growth will return bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : berlin is trying to offer companies a port in the economic storm " we know that growth will return after the crisis and then skilled workers are going to be urgently needed , " merkel said saturday in her weekly video podcast . she added that the government would examine ways of helping companies bridging difficult economic times and maintain staff levels until " a time when growth is again possible around the world . " the world financial crisis has pushed the global economy into a tailspin , forcing berlin and other governments to unveil stimulus packages aimed at underpinning economic growth .
germany also announced a 500 billion euro rescue plan to help its financial sector weather the current upheaval . an additional 12 billion euros in aid that federal government hopes to provide businesses , but which has not yet been discussed by german lawmakers , would be spent " in such a way that germany 's future prospects and strength in innovation will be strengthened , " she said . eu funds to promote innovation bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the eu should help ensure broadband internet access is available across the bloc merkel also said european companies should make use of the eu 's package to support innovation . " we should use the current situation to make europe ready for the future , particularly in places that are not technologically up-to-date , " she told the welt am sonntag . the chancellor called for broadband internet access for all germans while speaking at a national it summit on thursday . data released last week showed the german economy tipping into recession , with growth shrinking by a bigger-than-forecast 0.5 percent during the third quarter , on top of a 0.4 percent contraction in the second quarter . a slew of major indicators and data to be published next week are forecast to confirm the economic deterioration is underway in germany with business confidence declining again and the long run of falling unemployment in the country coming to an end . on friday , the government said a decline in tax revenue as a result of the contraction in europe 's biggest economy had forced it to boost borrowings by 10.5 billion euros to meet plans for spurring growth . dw staff -lrb- sms -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

there 's little chance for an economic recovery next year , she said in a newspaper interview . despite the government 's efforts to ease the effects of the global financial crisis on the german economy , merkel said next year would be a difficult one . " we have to expect that the coming year , at least in the initial months , will be a year of bad news , " she told the weekly newspaper welt am sonntag in an interview to be published sunday , nov .

" the world financial crisis has pushed the global economy into a tailspin , forcing berlin and other governments to unveil stimulus packages aimed at underpinning economic growth .
germany also announced a 500 billion euro rescue plan to help its financial sector weather the current upheaval . an additional 12 billion euros in aid that federal government hopes to provide businesses , but which has not yet been discussed by german lawmakers , would be spent " in such a way that germany 's future prospects and strength in innovation will be strengthened , " she said . eu funds to promote innovation bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the eu should help ensure broadband internet access is available across the bloc merkel also said european companies should make use of the eu 's package to support innovation .

royal 's aides said she would dispute the vote . aides to royal said saturday , nov .
22 , that she would not accept the results of friday 's election that showed her losing the race to head the french socialist party by a handful of votes . french radio reported that former party spokesman julien dray said royal was disputing the result because of apparent irregularities in some regions . " for us , there are problems -lrb- with the results -rrb- , " dray was quoted as saying .
" some things do n't make sense ...
the only solution is to hold another vote . " final results of the vote announced early saturday morning showed aubry edging out royal by 42 votes of the 137,000 cast . if the results are confirmed , the 58-year-old aubry would replace francois hollande , royal 's former partner , who is stepping down after leading the party for 11 years .
both aubry and hollande rejected the calls to have the party 's 232,000 members vote again . council to resolve dispute bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : royal 's aides say the party election was tarnished by voting irregularities instead , hollande announced saturday that the socialists would convene their national council to resolve the dispute , which threatens to split france 's second-strongest political party into factions . friday 's election was the culmination of a bitter campaign that pitted royal , 55 , against the socialist old guard , such as former prime ministers laurent fabius and lionel jospin and paris mayor bertrand delanoe , all of whom supported aubry . the acrimony continued up to the last minute , with aides to aubry claiming victory well before half the votes were counted .
royal supporters then accused their opponents of trying to influence the vote in france 's overseas territories , where the voting ended much later because of the time difference .
at one point , evry mayor manuel valls , a royal advisor , told supporters : " we will not let this victory be stolen from us . " first woman to lead party whoever is finally declared the official winner , she will become the first woman to lead the socialist party .
she will also have the monumental task of healing the deep wounds and bad blood the campaign has caused . in addition , the party will have to dispel the suspicion of voter fraud to gain credibility among the electorate and mount a strong challenge to president nicolas sarkozy in the 2012 presidential election .
in 2007 , royal became the first frenchwoman to make it to the second round of the presidential election , but she was soundly beaten by sarkozy . dpa news agency -lrb- sms -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de society -pipe- 22.11.2008 german online game on homelessness draws fire großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : pennergame is attracting 10,000 new users a day a popular german online game , called pennergame , is coming under fire for inciting prejudice against homeless people .
its name is certainly hardly flattering .
" penner " is the german word for " bum " or " dosser . " one hamburg politician , ksenija bekeris , has accused the game of violating human dignity and would like to see it banned , saying it contravenes the german constitution .
but with millions of clicks a month and more than 880,000 registered users to date the game is proving extremely popular in germany .
farbflut , the company that makes the game , said that it is a caricature that is clearly not intended to depict reality .
the point of pennergame is to advance from being a homeless person on the streets of hamburg to owning a mansion in the northern german city 's wealthy blankenese district - by hook or by crook .
pennergame 's inventors , marius follert and niels wildung , are experiencing meteoric careers of their own .
follert gave up his screen designer training program and wildung dropped out of school to pursue their dream .
pr spokesman steffen peuckert attributes the game 's success to its ability to put a traditional rags-to-riches theme in a contemporary context . true to life ?
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : such sights are not uncommon even in prosperous germany so what do people who have been or still are homeless think about the internet game .
birgit mueller , editor-in-chief of the hamburg homeless newspaper hinz und kunzt , calls the game " tasteless . "
" i am shocked the inventors are still pretty young and they have wheeled out every cliche that there is , as well as adding a few of their own to the standard ones , " she said .
" its name is also pretty hardcore , " she added .
" ' penner ' is not a nice word and if you ask a homeless person if they get called that name , then everyone i asked said ' no one calls me that . '
it is clear that homeless people perceive that as a humiliation . "
players are told that they are untalented bums who hang out at hamburg 's main railway station and can neither read nor write .
peter knows what it is like to rough it at hamburg station and sleep on a park bench .
he has been working for hinz und kunzt for the last three years , earning a small amount by selling newspapers .
" you live through it again , " he said .
" i have slept by the -lrb- river -rrb- elbe , collected bottles , just like in the game . "
reinforcing cliches about the homeless bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : can a game like pennergame avoid seeming callous ?
the options for rising up the social ranks are highly restricted in pennergame .
players are told : " it 's your goal to become rich at last .
learn to read and write so that you can finally prop up signs in front of yourself to get more attention .
buy a dog to attract sympathy .
become a con artist and steal watches , wallets and jewels from other people . "
other money-spinning possibilities include breaking into a chewing gum machine -lrb- max .
5 euros , $ 6.24 -rrb- , stealing tips left for toilet cleaners -lrb- max .
10 euros -rrb- , raiding a launderette -lrb- max .
20 euros -rrb- or a kiosk -lrb- max .
25 euros -rrb- .

birgit mueller , editor-in-chief of the hamburg homeless newspaper hinz und kunzt , calls the game " tasteless . "
" i am shocked the inventors are still pretty young and they have wheeled out every cliche that there is , as well as adding a few of their own to the standard ones , " she said .
" its name is also pretty hardcore , " she added .
" ' penner ' is not a nice word and if you ask a homeless person if they get called that name , then everyone i asked said ' no one calls me that . '
it is clear that homeless people perceive that as a humiliation . "
players are told that they are untalented bums who hang out at hamburg 's main railway station and can neither read nor write .
peter knows what it is like to rough it at hamburg station and sleep on a park bench .
he has been working for hinz und kunzt for the last three years , earning a small amount by selling newspapers .
" you live through it again , " he said .
" i have slept by the -lrb- river -rrb- elbe , collected bottles , just like in the game . "
reinforcing cliches about the homeless bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : can a game like pennergame avoid seeming callous ?
the options for rising up the social ranks are highly restricted in pennergame .
players are told : " it 's your goal to become rich at last .
learn to read and write so that you can finally prop up signs in front of yourself to get more attention .
buy a dog to attract sympathy .
become a con artist and steal watches , wallets and jewels from other people . "
other money-spinning possibilities include breaking into a chewing gum machine -lrb- max .
5 euros , $ 6.24 -rrb- , stealing tips left for toilet cleaners -lrb- max .
10 euros -rrb- , raiding a launderette -lrb- max .
20 euros -rrb- or a kiosk -lrb- max .
25 euros -rrb- .
hinz und kuntz newspaper seller gerrit denies this aspect of the game bears any relation to his experiences .
" i have n't raided a sausage stand , and we also never formed any proper gangs , " said the 33-year-old .
tasteless criminal connection mueller is also not amused by the mention of homeless people carrying out armed raids .
she criticized pennergame for spreading negative and false images .
" it 's been a long time since homeless people have been brought into close association with criminal people , " she said .
" of course , homeless people are n't better than anyone else .
there are also homeless people who end up in prison , but mostly because of other crimes , like fare dodging or theft , but armed gangs ...
i have n't heard of anything like that . "
but she said she can understand the appeal the game has for young people .
" homelessness takes place in a kind of subculture and subcultures are always interesting because the conditions are chaotic , because different rules apply , " mueller said .
the ambitions of many homeless people are much more modest than owning a mansion .
" having a career means getting one 's life under control , having a flat , having some kind of long-term prospects , some kind of point to your life , that is the highest form of career , " mueller said .
" homeless people can make jokes about one another , but i do n't think it 's right for two young men look down their noses like that . "
increasing awareness ?
while pennergame has offended many sensibilities , it might not be having the purely negative effect that its critics fear .
farbflut press spokesman steffen peuckert says the game has also drawn many young people 's attention to the theme of homelessness .
" the users ' feedback has been completely positive in this respect , " he said .
" we have had e-mails from people saying that they have started noticing homeless people or people collecting bottles much more since they started playing the game .
they are becoming more conscious of the problem .
some of them have even asked where they can send their donations . " dw staff -lrb- jg -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

while member states agreed on the matter in principle , there was some disagreement on where to get the money . eu budget ministers , meeting in brussels , reached the deal late friday , nov .
21 , according to diplomats cited by german news agency dpa .
the money will be released in three phases up to 2010 with an installment of 270 million euros -lrb- $ 337.4 million -rrb- due this year .

lawmakers are demanding details of the arrests . the three germans were arrested wednesday in kosovo are agents for the germany federal intelligence agency -lrb- bnd -rrb- , der spiegel newsmagazine and the daily sueddeutsche zeitung reported saturday . the germans were arrested by kosovar police in connection with an attack on the european union 's headquarters in pristina on nov .

no one was hurt in the explosion and indications of the attack 's background or possible motives remain unclear . the suspects were in kosovo " in a private capacity " and had no immunity from prosecution , police spokesman veton elshani told the german news agency dpa . none of the german trio were " diplomats , police , soldiers or experts with international identification , " kosovar investigators said on friday . the alleged spies said they were simply inspecting damage done by the bomb 's explosion and were not involved in the attack , according to the spiegel report . one of the men told kosovar authorities he was working for the bnd , the daily sueddeutsche zeitung reported . opposition wants details bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : parliamentarians want to know exactly what the germans were doing in pristina a german government spokesman declined to speculate about the possible involvement of berlin 's security services -lrb- bnd -rrb- in the case on friday and instead pointed to the ongoing investigations . german politicians in the opposition have called for the government to inform a parliamentary oversight committee . " the status has to be made clear , " max stadler , the free-market liberal fdp 's expert for interior affairs , told dpa on saturday , adding that lawmakers needed to be informed regardless of whether there was sufficient material to charge the germans . governments usually register their intelligence agents with foreign authorities to ensure they are covered by diplomatic immunity .
berlin failed to accredit the three agents , leaving their legal status in kosovo unclear , according to der spiegel . an eu mission is due to take over the oversight of law-enforcement in kosovo after more than eight years of a united nations protectorate . kosovo declared independence from serbia in february .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de society -pipe- 22.11.2008 german online game on homelessness draws fire großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : pennergame is attracting 10,000 new users a day a popular german online game , called pennergame , is coming under fire for inciting prejudice against homeless people .
its name is certainly hardly flattering .
" penner " is the german word for " bum " or " dosser . " one hamburg politician , ksenija bekeris , has accused the game of violating human dignity and would like to see it banned , saying it contravenes the german constitution .
but with millions of clicks a month and more than 880,000 registered users to date the game is proving extremely popular in germany .
farbflut , the company that makes the game , said that it is a caricature that is clearly not intended to depict reality .
the point of pennergame is to advance from being a homeless person on the streets of hamburg to owning a mansion in the northern german city 's wealthy blankenese district - by hook or by crook .
pennergame 's inventors , marius follert and niels wildung , are experiencing meteoric careers of their own .
follert gave up his screen designer training program and wildung dropped out of school to pursue their dream .
pr spokesman steffen peuckert attributes the game 's success to its ability to put a traditional rags-to-riches theme in a contemporary context . true to life ?
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : such sights are not uncommon even in prosperous germany so what do people who have been or still are homeless think about the internet game .
birgit mueller , editor-in-chief of the hamburg homeless newspaper hinz und kunzt , calls the game " tasteless . "
" i am shocked the inventors are still pretty young and they have wheeled out every cliche that there is , as well as adding a few of their own to the standard ones , " she said .
" its name is also pretty hardcore , " she added .
" ' penner ' is not a nice word and if you ask a homeless person if they get called that name , then everyone i asked said ' no one calls me that . '
it is clear that homeless people perceive that as a humiliation . "
players are told that they are untalented bums who hang out at hamburg 's main railway station and can neither read nor write .
peter knows what it is like to rough it at hamburg station and sleep on a park bench .
he has been working for hinz und kunzt for the last three years , earning a small amount by selling newspapers .
" you live through it again , " he said .
" i have slept by the -lrb- river -rrb- elbe , collected bottles , just like in the game . "
reinforcing cliches about the homeless bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : can a game like pennergame avoid seeming callous ?
the options for rising up the social ranks are highly restricted in pennergame .
players are told : " it 's your goal to become rich at last .
learn to read and write so that you can finally prop up signs in front of yourself to get more attention .
buy a dog to attract sympathy .
become a con artist and steal watches , wallets and jewels from other people . "
other money-spinning possibilities include breaking into a chewing gum machine -lrb- max .
5 euros , $ 6.24 -rrb- , stealing tips left for toilet cleaners -lrb- max .
10 euros -rrb- , raiding a launderette -lrb- max .
20 euros -rrb- or a kiosk -lrb- max .
25 euros -rrb- .
hinz und kuntz newspaper seller gerrit denies this aspect of the game bears any relation to his experiences .
" i have n't raided a sausage stand , and we also never formed any proper gangs , " said the 33-year-old .
tasteless criminal connection mueller is also not amused by the mention of homeless people carrying out armed raids .
she criticized pennergame for spreading negative and false images .
" it 's been a long time since homeless people have been brought into close association with criminal people , " she said .
" of course , homeless people are n't better than anyone else .
there are also homeless people who end up in prison , but mostly because of other crimes , like fare dodging or theft , but armed gangs ...
i have n't heard of anything like that . "
but she said she can understand the appeal the game has for young people .
" homelessness takes place in a kind of subculture and subcultures are always interesting because the conditions are chaotic , because different rules apply , " mueller said .
the ambitions of many homeless people are much more modest than owning a mansion .
" having a career means getting one 's life under control , having a flat , having some kind of long-term prospects , some kind of point to your life , that is the highest form of career , " mueller said .
" homeless people can make jokes about one another , but i do n't think it 's right for two young men look down their noses like that . "
increasing awareness ?
while pennergame has offended many sensibilities , it might not be having the purely negative effect that its critics fear .
farbflut press spokesman steffen peuckert says the game has also drawn many young people 's attention to the theme of homelessness .
" the users ' feedback has been completely positive in this respect , " he said .
" we have had e-mails from people saying that they have started noticing homeless people or people collecting bottles much more since they started playing the game .
they are becoming more conscious of the problem .
some of them have even asked where they can send their donations . " dw staff -lrb- jg -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

ms royal 's critics say she does not have the skills to lead the party ms royal has inspired both a devoted following , and trenchant opposition within the socialist party .
she is popular among grassroots supporters , and promised to give the party an " unshakeable future " .
but she still has many critics among the party grandees - the so-called elephants - who say she is too lightweight and would lead the party in the wrong direction .
damaging split ms royal had hoped to take over the party leadership from her former partner , francois hollande .
they were once known as the party 's " golden couple " , but split last year , around the time of the election itself , after spending nearly 30 years together and having four children .
while they have insisted they are still friends , mr hollande refused to support her politically .
mr hollande -lrb- r -rrb- initially backed mr delanoe -lrb- l -rrb- for the party presidency despite her overtures - publicly praising mr hollande and his record - he threw his weight behind bertrand delanoe , mayor of paris , for the party leadership .
the socialist party itself has wrestled with bitter infighting since 1995 , when france 's last socialist president , francois mitterrand , stepped down .
its annual convention in mid-november ended in disarray after failing to reach a consensus on the three candidates , despite ms royal winning a pre-convention ballot with 29 % .
ms royal has been increasingly leaning to the left , insisting that economic liberalism and socialism are incompatible , say correspondents .
at the annual conference , held in reims , ms royal pleaded for unity , saying the party would " have to forget all the unpleasant and at times violent words , erase them and one day forgive each other " .
young ambition born in 1953 in senegal , in what was then french west africa , ms royal grew up one of eight children of an authoritarian former artillery officer .
jacques royal brought his family back to france in the early 1960s , and life for the royal children near epinal in the vosges was largely unhappy .
segolene struggled to pursue further education , with her father believing women did not need it .
however , he was proud of his daughter 's accomplishments at school .
she gained admission to the elite paris institute of political studies -lrb- iep -rrb- , where she graduated in economics and went on to study at the influential ecole nationale d 'administration -lrb- ena -rrb- .
according to journalist daniel bernard 's biography , madame royal , the future politician was rebelling against her conservative milieu from the age of 12 , questioning why women should have fewer rights than men .
in 1972 , her rebellion took legal form when she sued her father for refusing , after his wife left him , to divorce her and provide for the family 's upkeep and the education of the children .
she did not win the case until 1981 , just a year before her estranged father 's death from cancer .
into politics at ena , the traditional " finishing school " for france 's senior officials , ms royal met francois hollande .
mr hollande led the socialists for 11 years and was himself seen last year as a presidential candidate .
ms royal graduated in 1980 and , along with mr hollande , became an adviser to socialist president francois mitterrand .
elected an mp for the deux-sevres constituency in western france in 1988 , she is currently president of the poitou-charentes regional council .
she served as minister for the environment from 1992-93 , and later served as junior minister for education -lrb- 1997-2000 -rrb- and junior minister for family and childhood -lrb- 2000-01 -rrb- .
when she declared her hand for the presidential nomination in 2007 , some of the most cutting remarks were made by her own party colleagues .
laurent fabius , who ran against her , publicly asked who would look after her children if she went for the presidency .
ms royal was blamed for a presidential campaign that was seen as lacklustre and gaffe-strewn .
however , she is a confident campaigner who can inspire genuine popularity , and few will deny she has proven herself as a fighter through her career .

ms royal 's critics say she does not have the skills to lead the party ms royal has inspired both a devoted following , and trenchant opposition within the socialist party .
she is popular among grassroots supporters , and promised to give the party an " unshakeable future " .
but she still has many critics among the party grandees - the so-called elephants - who say she is too lightweight and would lead the party in the wrong direction .
damaging split ms royal had hoped to take over the party leadership from her former partner , francois hollande .
they were once known as the party 's " golden couple " , but split last year , around the time of the election itself , after spending nearly 30 years together and having four children .
while they have insisted they are still friends , mr hollande refused to support her politically .
mr hollande -lrb- r -rrb- initially backed mr delanoe -lrb- l -rrb- for the party presidency despite her overtures - publicly praising mr hollande and his record - he threw his weight behind bertrand delanoe , mayor of paris , for the party leadership .
the socialist party itself has wrestled with bitter infighting since 1995 , when france 's last socialist president , francois mitterrand , stepped down .
its annual convention in mid-november ended in disarray after failing to reach a consensus on the three candidates , despite ms royal winning a pre-convention ballot with 29 % .
ms royal has been increasingly leaning to the left , insisting that economic liberalism and socialism are incompatible , say correspondents .
at the annual conference , held in reims , ms royal pleaded for unity , saying the party would " have to forget all the unpleasant and at times violent words , erase them and one day forgive each other " .
young ambition born in 1953 in senegal , in what was then french west africa , ms royal grew up one of eight children of an authoritarian former artillery officer .
jacques royal brought his family back to france in the early 1960s , and life for the royal children near epinal in the vosges was largely unhappy .
segolene struggled to pursue further education , with her father believing women did not need it .
however , he was proud of his daughter 's accomplishments at school .
she gained admission to the elite paris institute of political studies -lrb- iep -rrb- , where she graduated in economics and went on to study at the influential ecole nationale d 'administration -lrb- ena -rrb- .
according to journalist daniel bernard 's biography , madame royal , the future politician was rebelling against her conservative milieu from the age of 12 , questioning why women should have fewer rights than men .
in 1972 , her rebellion took legal form when she sued her father for refusing , after his wife left him , to divorce her and provide for the family 's upkeep and the education of the children .
she did not win the case until 1981 , just a year before her estranged father 's death from cancer .
into politics at ena , the traditional " finishing school " for france 's senior officials , ms royal met francois hollande .
mr hollande led the socialists for 11 years and was himself seen last year as a presidential candidate .
ms royal graduated in 1980 and , along with mr hollande , became an adviser to socialist president francois mitterrand .
elected an mp for the deux-sevres constituency in western france in 1988 , she is currently president of the poitou-charentes regional council .
she served as minister for the environment from 1992-93 , and later served as junior minister for education -lrb- 1997-2000 -rrb- and junior minister for family and childhood -lrb- 2000-01 -rrb- .
when she declared her hand for the presidential nomination in 2007 , some of the most cutting remarks were made by her own party colleagues .
laurent fabius , who ran against her , publicly asked who would look after her children if she went for the presidency .
ms royal was blamed for a presidential campaign that was seen as lacklustre and gaffe-strewn .
however , she is a confident campaigner who can inspire genuine popularity , and few will deny she has proven herself as a fighter through her career .

she campaigned on a platform that called for anchoring the party firmly to the left .
the mayor of lille since 2001 , ms aubry has carved out a reputation as one of ms royal 's fiercest rivals , opposing her both in style and substance during the battle for the party leadership .
she now faces an uphill battle to rebuild party unity after months of bitter campaigning exposed deep internal divisions .
ms aubry was widely regarded as one of the stars of prime minister lionel jospin 's socialist government before she left in 2000 to campaign for the post of the mayor of lille .
as employment minister , she was behind some of the government 's most distinctive policies .
they included the 35-hour working week - known in france as the " aubry law " - as well as an important youth employment scheme .
by the time she left , mrs aubry had taken credit for unemployment in france falling below 10 % for the first time in many years .
when she won the mayorship of lille in 2001 , it was seen as a possible springboard for a higher position - prime minister or even president .
famous father born in paris in 1950 , martine aubry is the daughter of former european commission president , jacques delors .
she joined the ps in 1974 , rising through the ranks until she was appointed minister of labour in 1991 by then prime minister edith cresson .
in 1997 lionel jospin made her minister of social affairs and employment and she became one of his most effective and popular ministers .
in a surprise result in the 2002 general election , she lost her seat in the national assembly to centre-right ump candidate sebastian huyghe , who then challenged mrs aubry as lille mayor .
however , she was comfortably re-elected as mayor in march 2008 .
mrs aubry has published several books on local government , human resources and current affairs .

she campaigned on a platform that called for anchoring the party firmly to the left .
the mayor of lille since 2001 , ms aubry has carved out a reputation as one of ms royal 's fiercest rivals , opposing her both in style and substance during the battle for the party leadership .
she now faces an uphill battle to rebuild party unity after months of bitter campaigning exposed deep internal divisions .
ms aubry was widely regarded as one of the stars of prime minister lionel jospin 's socialist government before she left in 2000 to campaign for the post of the mayor of lille .
as employment minister , she was behind some of the government 's most distinctive policies .
they included the 35-hour working week - known in france as the " aubry law " - as well as an important youth employment scheme .
by the time she left , mrs aubry had taken credit for unemployment in france falling below 10 % for the first time in many years .
when she won the mayorship of lille in 2001 , it was seen as a possible springboard for a higher position - prime minister or even president .
famous father born in paris in 1950 , martine aubry is the daughter of former european commission president , jacques delors .
she joined the ps in 1974 , rising through the ranks until she was appointed minister of labour in 1991 by then prime minister edith cresson .
in 1997 lionel jospin made her minister of social affairs and employment and she became one of his most effective and popular ministers .
in a surprise result in the 2002 general election , she lost her seat in the national assembly to centre-right ump candidate sebastian huyghe , who then challenged mrs aubry as lille mayor .
however , she was comfortably re-elected as mayor in march 2008 .
mrs aubry has published several books on local government , human resources and current affairs .

the federal communications commission said that the us circuit court of appeals incorrectly applied a rule to say that cbs were not responsible .
it now wants the us supreme court to force the tv network to pay the $ 550,000 -lrb- £ 371,296 -rrb- fine .
a philadelphia court ruled in july that cbs would not have pay the fine after the us circuit court of appeals ruled that cbs were not responsible for the incident .
the fcc said the court incorrectly applied a rule - which has since changed - regarding expletives that required a profanity be repeated before it is deemed indecent .
the fcc contends that the rule did not apply to images .
at the time , broadcasters did not employ a video delay for live events , a practice that changed within a week of the game .
the incident generated a record number of complaints - more than 500,000 - and cbs was quick to apologise .

sri lanka 's government says it is nearing victory in its 25-year conflict with the tamil tigers , but as roland buerk explains the war will leave a bitter legacy .
sri lanka 's government believes it is now winning the 25-year war the sri lanka air force helicopter flew fast and low out of anuradhapura , heading north .
the white domes of the ancient city 's buddhist temples stood high over the green canopy of the treetops .
flares thumped out of tubes on the helicopter 's side , bright red sparks trailed thick white smoke into the jungle just below , a defence against being shot down .
we were being flown to meet soldiers taking part in the military 's offensive against the tamil tigers .
not too close to the battlefields though : sri lanka 's government carefully controls access by journalists .
stronghold seized but it was still a chance to meet commanders on the ground .
lt col kns kotuwegoda said the fighting was like vietnam , bunkers and booby traps in the jungles .
only a day or so before , one of his men lost a leg when he stepped on a landmine .
but the lt col said morale was high and the troops were confident of inflicting a final crushing defeat on the tamil tigers , and soon .
for supporters of sri lanka 's ethnic majority sinhalese-led government these are the best of times .
they scent victory after a generation of bloodshed and loss .
the news from the battlefields of the north , or certainly the version given by the ministry of defence , has been relentlessly upbeat .
in recent months soldiers have driven the tigers , who want a separate state for the ethnic tamil minority , from the entire north-western coast .
they now seem poised to capture kilinochchi from which the separatist rebels have administered areas under their control .
the fall of the town would be a hugely symbolic moment , although it would not mean the end of the war , not yet .
guns glut the government has pursued victory against the tigers hard since fighting resumed in mid 2006 after a ceasefire failed .
perhaps too hard .
there are allegations of human rights abuses , abductions , killings and disappearances , especially in the east .
there are an awful lot of guns there for a province that was , to quote the government , " liberated " , from the tamil tigers last year .
as we drove down the main a15 road that runs parallel with the coast , but just inland , we were flagged down every few minutes by heavily armed soldiers and police officers at checkpoints .
they looked at our identity documents and sometimes poked around in the back of the van .
fighting resumed in 2006 after a ceasefire failed in sri lanka 's eastern province we passed police stations and small army camps that had been turned into mini fortresses with earth embankments , look out towers made of old railway sleepers and ammunition boxes , and roll after roll of razor wire .
and then there were the offices of the party now in power with the support of the government in colombo , the tmvp .
they were also heavily guarded .
abduction claims a breakaway faction of the tamil tigers , they still have guns too .
we could see the barrels of assault rifles poking over the top of their look out towers .
sometimes their men , wearing check shirts and rubber sandals , and a gun slung casually over the shoulder , would stand openly in the street .
one mother went to the local tmvp camp to ask for her son 's release , and saw him with his hands tied and bearing marks of a beating the tmvp 's defection weakened the tigers , who are themselves accused of serious human rights abuses , and helped government forces to drive the rebels from the east .
and even though they were still armed , the tmvp were allowed to run on a government ticket in provincial elections earlier this year .
they won , and a former tamil tiger child soldier is now chief minister of the east , but they have been accused of carrying out abductions and killings .
the woman we went to meet in her small bare concrete house outside the town of batticaloa did not care much about politics , she just wanted her son back .
' mothers of the disappeared ' as did the mothers of two boys who were taken with him , who we also met .
mangy stray dogs leapt up , barking , from their dozing places under the trees of the otherwise bare sandy garden as we approached , before the lady of the house saw them off with a few well aimed stones .
the tamil tigers were driven from the east , and are losing the north the women complained that a year ago their boys , in their late teens and early 20s , were taken away on suspicion of being involved with the tamil tigers .
one mother went to the local tmvp camp to ask for her son 's release , and saw him with his hands tied and bearing marks of a beating .
but she was sent away after being told the young men would be released in the morning .
however they were not and the women described going back fruitlessly again and again , as the days turned to weeks , then months , with no word on their fate .
human rights groups say there have been hundreds of such cases reported in sri lanka in recent years , blamed on paramilitaries and elements of the security forces .
the government insists almost all are fabrications intended to discredit it and its new found allies , that alleged victims did not disappear at all , but have gone abroad , or eloped .
so sri lanka 's war may be drawing slowly to a close but it seems bound at least to leave in its wake a legacy of fear and deep distrust .

sri lanka 's government says it is nearing victory in its 25-year conflict with the tamil tigers , but as roland buerk explains the war will leave a bitter legacy .
sri lanka 's government believes it is now winning the 25-year war the sri lanka air force helicopter flew fast and low out of anuradhapura , heading north .
the white domes of the ancient city 's buddhist temples stood high over the green canopy of the treetops .

stronghold seized but it was still a chance to meet commanders on the ground .
lt col kns kotuwegoda said the fighting was like vietnam , bunkers and booby traps in the jungles .

the news from the battlefields of the north , or certainly the version given by the ministry of defence , has been relentlessly upbeat .
in recent months soldiers have driven the tigers , who want a separate state for the ethnic tamil minority , from the entire north-western coast .
they now seem poised to capture kilinochchi from which the separatist rebels have administered areas under their control .
the fall of the town would be a hugely symbolic moment , although it would not mean the end of the war , not yet .
guns glut the government has pursued victory against the tigers hard since fighting resumed in mid 2006 after a ceasefire failed .
perhaps too hard .
there are allegations of human rights abuses , abductions , killings and disappearances , especially in the east .
