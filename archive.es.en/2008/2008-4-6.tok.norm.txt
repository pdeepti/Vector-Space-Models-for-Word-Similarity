" our fundamental attitudes to the american plan have not changed , " putin said in a press conference after his last tete-a-tete meeting with his us counterpart george w. bush . putin , however , acknowledged us efforts to " resolve the issues " and " offer a set of confidence-building measures . "
the united states and russia are also interested in creating a system against potential missile threats , the leaders said in a joint statement . " both sides expressed their interest in creating a system for responding to potential missile threats in which russia and the united states and europe will participate as equal partners , " the declaration said . beyond the us missile shield plans , negotiations touched on a range of disagreements that have built up during the two leaders ' eight years in power , including nato expansion and arms treaties . bush meets next russian president bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : medvedev said he 'd continue down the path putin has laid out bush also held his first talks with putin 's successor dmitry medvedev , highlighting both sides ' attention to managing relations during the transition period . medvedev has told president bush he hopes to follow in the footsteps of vladimir putin in attempting to strengthen relations with the us . medvedev said bush and putin " did a lot to advance u.s.-russian relations " over the last eight years .
he also said maintaining good russian-us relations was " a key factor in international security . " medvedev added , " i would like to do my part to keep up that work . " both bush and putin have underscored warm personal ties , deflecting from a growing number of testy security issues as they compete for influence in europe .
bush said he had grown to respect putin as a strong leader . " you 're not afraid to tell me what 's on your mind , " bush said to the kremlin leader .
" when all is said and done , we 'll shake hands . " week of disagreement bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : bush once said he saw into putin 's soul the sochi meeting comes on the heels of a face-off at this week 's nato summit where kremlin fears that nato 's eastward expansion threatens its security were seen to have trumped us desires to see georgia and ukraine join nato . but the united states won nato 's full backing for its plans to deploy a missile defense system in eastern europe , an eventuality the kremlin finds even more threatening .
the plans call for setting up a radar base in the czech republic and stationing interceptor missiles in poland . washington says the system is not aimed at russia , but needed to protect against " rogue states " such as iran . " we have a lot more work to do to convince our allies that the system is not aimed at russia , " bush told journalists after his one and half hour talks with the russian president . much work remains for successors " we 're going to have to do more work after sochi , " white house spokeswoman dana perino told reporters on the flight to sochi . " no one has said that everything would be finalized and everyone would be satisfied , " she added . rather , officials on both sides said the " strategic framework " agreement would constitute a broad roadmap to guide future us-russian relations . dw staff -lrb- sms -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

" there was no such deal , " diplomatic sources told the afp news agency . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the wallerts were taken hostage in 2000 a libyan mediator helped obtain the release of the german wallert family members , who were among a group of foreigners kidnapped at a diving school in jolo by the abu sayyaf rebel group on easter sunday 2000 . renate wallert was freed after 86 days in captivity , her husband werner after 127 days on aug .

their son , marc , was released nearly two weeks later as the final hostage in the group .
unconfirmed reports said libya paid around 21 million euros for the hostages ' release . foreign ministry denies involvement in apparent confirmation of a report released saturday by der spiegel newsmagazine , bild said the german embassy in tripoli was informally briefed on the training seminars conducted between 2005 and 2007 by around 30 members of an elite police unit and a soldier moonlighting for a private security firm . the foreign ministry on sunday , however , issued a statement denying any involvement in the training of libyan police authorities .
the issue has caused a stir in germany amid fears that secrets about police training methods might have been divulged to the libyans .
the bundestag , the lower house of german parliament , is due to discuss the issue on wednesday . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : as many as 30 germans are suspected of having a role in training libyans training was provided to gaddafi 's security forces by german bodyguards tasked with protecting the bundeswehr 's highest-ranking officer , inspector-general wolfgang schneiderhan , berlin daily tagesspiegel am sonntag reported . a sergeant serving with a crack unit of mountain troops has been suspended while an investigation into his alleged role in the operation is under way . eight policemen in the state of north rhine-westphalia are also facing disciplinary proceedings , including one who is subject to a criminal investigation relating to the inappropriate use of official documents . unacceptable behavior wolfgang bosbach , deputy parliamentary leader of chancellor angela merkel 's christian democratic union , said the bundestag would not have approved training for libyan forces . " there is no doubt that libya is run by an unfair regime , " he told german public broadcaster ard .
" had the officers requested permission for their work , it would have certainly been refused . " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : politicians called the officers ' behavior unacceptable german defense minister franz josef jung has condemned the officers ' behavior , saying , " this should under no circumstances be accepted . " germany 's foreign intelligence service bnd denied any involvement in the training program , which reportedly included instruction on how to storm buildings , abseil from helicopters and board ships . the germans were hired by a security firm called bdb protection founded by a former police commando .
the now insolvent company reportedly received 1.6 million euros -lrb- $ 2.4 million -rrb- from the libyans , paying each of the men around 15,000 euros for their services . they carried out the training without the knowledge of their superiors while on holiday or after taking unpaid leave , according to press reports . once a backer of terrorists , libya has taken a more pro-western course in recent years , although it still comes under fire from rights groups over its human rights record . dw staff -lrb- sms -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

they also vowed to stick to pledges to double aid to africa . the ministers agreed on sunday , april 6 , in tokyo to fulfill their commitments on overseas development aid made at gleneagles , especially to double aid for african nations by 2010 . underlining the growing role of developing economies in global aid efforts , brazil , china , and india and other emerging donors were invited to talks here that aim to lay the groundwork for the g8 summit in july . the g8 agreed on the need for " concrete cooperation with emerging donors , " japanese foreign minister masahiko komura told a news conference wrapping up the two days of talks . china has made major diplomatic and economic inroads in mostly resource-rich nations in africa and latin america by giving aid without imposing any conditions .
the united states and european union , meanwhile , often use aid promises as leverage to improve human rights or to promote other policy goals . time of hope and difficulty bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : wieczorek-zeul said cutting poverty by 50 percent remained the g8 's goal " this new aid is at the same time a hope and a difficulty , " said alain joyandet , france 's junior cooperation minister , according to the afp news agency . the aim of negotiations with emerging donors " is to have a common understanding about the question of standards for investment and regulations , " said german development minister heidemarie wieczorek-zeul . " the goal always has to remain that everybody is devoted to the millennium goals , " she said , referring to a 2000 un agreement on poverty reduction . a report by the organization for economic cooperation and development released friday showed total development aid among the world 's 22 major aid donors fell 8.4 percent in real terms in 2007 . germany second-largest aid donor bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : most western countries are falling behind on aid promises , an oecd study said for 2007 , the biggest donors were the united states , germany , france , britain and japan while the only countries to exceed the un 0.7 percent of gni target were denmark , luxembourg , the netherlands , norway and sweden . germany 's official development assistance for 2007 amounted to $ 12.26 billion , an increase of 5.9 percent from 2006 when germany was in fifth place on this list of aid donors .
germany spent 0.37 percent of its gross domestic product on development , well below the government 's target of increasing aid to 0.51 percent of gdp by 2010 . g8 members - britain , canada , france , germany , italy , japan , russia and the united states - expressed concern at the decline and vowed to strive to fulfil their pledge made in 2005 to double aid for africa by 2010 . " each g8 country is determined to strengthen development aid , " said komura .
" so as to improve the situation in the fields of poverty , health care , education and water in impoverished countries , the g8 needs to continue strengthening development aid both in quality and quantity . " the full g8 meeting is scheduled for july 7-9 on the northern japanese island of hokkaido . dw staff -lrb- sms -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

" our fundamental attitudes to the american plan have not changed , " putin said in a press conference after his last tete-a-tete meeting with his us counterpart george w. bush . putin , however , acknowledged us efforts to " resolve the issues " and " offer a set of confidence-building measures . "
the united states and russia are also interested in creating a system against potential missile threats , the leaders said in a joint statement . " both sides expressed their interest in creating a system for responding to potential missile threats in which russia and the united states and europe will participate as equal partners , " the declaration said . beyond the us missile shield plans , negotiations touched on a range of disagreements that have built up during the two leaders ' eight years in power , including nato expansion and arms treaties . bush meets next russian president bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : medvedev said he 'd continue down the path putin has laid out bush also held his first talks with putin 's successor dmitry medvedev , highlighting both sides ' attention to managing relations during the transition period . medvedev has told president bush he hopes to follow in the footsteps of vladimir putin in attempting to strengthen relations with the us . medvedev said bush and putin " did a lot to advance u.s.-russian relations " over the last eight years .
he also said maintaining good russian-us relations was " a key factor in international security . " medvedev added , " i would like to do my part to keep up that work . " both bush and putin have underscored warm personal ties , deflecting from a growing number of testy security issues as they compete for influence in europe .
bush said he had grown to respect putin as a strong leader . " you 're not afraid to tell me what 's on your mind , " bush said to the kremlin leader .
" when all is said and done , we 'll shake hands .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de development aid -pipe- 06.04.2008 g8 members vow to meet development aid targets großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : development aid from the eu and us often comes with political strings attached development ministers from the group of eight nations reaffirmed their commitment to boost development assistance through partnership with emerging nations .
they also vowed to stick to pledges to double aid to africa . the ministers agreed on sunday , april 6 , in tokyo to fulfill their commitments on overseas development aid made at gleneagles , especially to double aid for african nations by 2010 . underlining the growing role of developing economies in global aid efforts , brazil , china , and india and other emerging donors were invited to talks here that aim to lay the groundwork for the g8 summit in july . the g8 agreed on the need for " concrete cooperation with emerging donors , " japanese foreign minister masahiko komura told a news conference wrapping up the two days of talks . china has made major diplomatic and economic inroads in mostly resource-rich nations in africa and latin america by giving aid without imposing any conditions .
the united states and european union , meanwhile , often use aid promises as leverage to improve human rights or to promote other policy goals . time of hope and difficulty bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : wieczorek-zeul said cutting poverty by 50 percent remained the g8 's goal " this new aid is at the same time a hope and a difficulty , " said alain joyandet , france 's junior cooperation minister , according to the afp news agency . the aim of negotiations with emerging donors " is to have a common understanding about the question of standards for investment and regulations , " said german development minister heidemarie wieczorek-zeul . " the goal always has to remain that everybody is devoted to the millennium goals , " she said , referring to a 2000 un agreement on poverty reduction . a report by the organization for economic cooperation and development released friday showed total development aid among the world 's 22 major aid donors fell 8.4 percent in real terms in 2007 . germany second-largest aid donor bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : most western countries are falling behind on aid promises , an oecd study said for 2007 , the biggest donors were the united states , germany , france , britain and japan while the only countries to exceed the un 0.7 percent of gni target were denmark , luxembourg , the netherlands , norway and sweden . germany 's official development assistance for 2007 amounted to $ 12.26 billion , an increase of 5.9 percent from 2006 when germany was in fifth place on this list of aid donors .
germany spent 0.37 percent of its gross domestic product on development , well below the government 's target of increasing aid to 0.51 percent of gdp by 2010 . g8 members - britain , canada , france , germany , italy , japan , russia and the united states - expressed concern at the decline and vowed to strive to fulfil their pledge made in 2005 to double aid for africa by 2010 .

" there was no such deal , " diplomatic sources told the afp news agency . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the wallerts were taken hostage in 2000 a libyan mediator helped obtain the release of the german wallert family members , who were among a group of foreigners kidnapped at a diving school in jolo by the abu sayyaf rebel group on easter sunday 2000 . renate wallert was freed after 86 days in captivity , her husband werner after 127 days on aug .
27 .
their son , marc , was released nearly two weeks later as the final hostage in the group .
unconfirmed reports said libya paid around 21 million euros for the hostages ' release . foreign ministry denies involvement in apparent confirmation of a report released saturday by der spiegel newsmagazine , bild said the german embassy in tripoli was informally briefed on the training seminars conducted between 2005 and 2007 by around 30 members of an elite police unit and a soldier moonlighting for a private security firm . the foreign ministry on sunday , however , issued a statement denying any involvement in the training of libyan police authorities .
the issue has caused a stir in germany amid fears that secrets about police training methods might have been divulged to the libyans .
the bundestag , the lower house of german parliament , is due to discuss the issue on wednesday . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : as many as 30 germans are suspected of having a role in training libyans training was provided to gaddafi 's security forces by german bodyguards tasked with protecting the bundeswehr 's highest-ranking officer , inspector-general wolfgang schneiderhan , berlin daily tagesspiegel am sonntag reported . a sergeant serving with a crack unit of mountain troops has been suspended while an investigation into his alleged role in the operation is under way . eight policemen in the state of north rhine-westphalia are also facing disciplinary proceedings , including one who is subject to a criminal investigation relating to the inappropriate use of official documents . unacceptable behavior wolfgang bosbach , deputy parliamentary leader of chancellor angela merkel 's christian democratic union , said the bundestag would not have approved training for libyan forces . " there is no doubt that libya is run by an unfair regime , " he told german public broadcaster ard .
" had the officers requested permission for their work , it would have certainly been refused . " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : politicians called the officers ' behavior unacceptable german defense minister franz josef jung has condemned the officers ' behavior , saying , " this should under no circumstances be accepted . " germany 's foreign intelligence service bnd denied any involvement in the training program , which reportedly included instruction on how to storm buildings , abseil from helicopters and board ships . the germans were hired by a security firm called bdb protection founded by a former police commando .
the now insolvent company reportedly received 1.6 million euros -lrb- $ 2.4 million -rrb- from the libyans , paying each of the men around 15,000 euros for their services . they carried out the training without the knowledge of their superiors while on holiday or after taking unpaid leave , according to press reports . once a backer of terrorists , libya has taken a more pro-western course in recent years , although it still comes under fire from rights groups over its human rights record . dw staff -lrb- sms -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

" there was no such deal , " diplomatic sources told the afp news agency . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the wallerts were taken hostage in 2000 a libyan mediator helped obtain the release of the german wallert family members , who were among a group of foreigners kidnapped at a diving school in jolo by the abu sayyaf rebel group on easter sunday 2000 . renate wallert was freed after 86 days in captivity , her husband werner after 127 days on aug .
27 .
their son , marc , was released nearly two weeks later as the final hostage in the group .
unconfirmed reports said libya paid around 21 million euros for the hostages ' release . foreign ministry denies involvement in apparent confirmation of a report released saturday by der spiegel newsmagazine , bild said the german embassy in tripoli was informally briefed on the training seminars conducted between 2005 and 2007 by around 30 members of an elite police unit and a soldier moonlighting for a private security firm . the foreign ministry on sunday , however , issued a statement denying any involvement in the training of libyan police authorities .
the issue has caused a stir in germany amid fears that secrets about police training methods might have been divulged to the libyans .
the bundestag , the lower house of german parliament , is due to discuss the issue on wednesday . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : as many as 30 germans are suspected of having a role in training libyans training was provided to gaddafi 's security forces by german bodyguards tasked with protecting the bundeswehr 's highest-ranking officer , inspector-general wolfgang schneiderhan , berlin daily tagesspiegel am sonntag reported . a sergeant serving with a crack unit of mountain troops has been suspended while an investigation into his alleged role in the operation is under way . eight policemen in the state of north rhine-westphalia are also facing disciplinary proceedings , including one who is subject to a criminal investigation relating to the inappropriate use of official documents . unacceptable behavior wolfgang bosbach , deputy parliamentary leader of chancellor angela merkel 's christian democratic union , said the bundestag would not have approved training for libyan forces . " there is no doubt that libya is run by an unfair regime , " he told german public broadcaster ard .
" had the officers requested permission for their work , it would have certainly been refused . " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : politicians called the officers ' behavior unacceptable german defense minister franz josef jung has condemned the officers ' behavior , saying , " this should under no circumstances be accepted . " germany 's foreign intelligence service bnd denied any involvement in the training program , which reportedly included instruction on how to storm buildings , abseil from helicopters and board ships . the germans were hired by a security firm called bdb protection founded by a former police commando .
the now insolvent company reportedly received 1.6 million euros -lrb- $ 2.4 million -rrb- from the libyans , paying each of the men around 15,000 euros for their services . they carried out the training without the knowledge of their superiors while on holiday or after taking unpaid leave , according to press reports . once a backer of terrorists , libya has taken a more pro-western course in recent years , although it still comes under fire from rights groups over its human rights record . dw staff -lrb- sms -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

" our fundamental attitudes to the american plan have not changed , " putin said in a press conference after his last tete-a-tete meeting with his us counterpart george w. bush . putin , however , acknowledged us efforts to " resolve the issues " and " offer a set of confidence-building measures . "
the united states and russia are also interested in creating a system against potential missile threats , the leaders said in a joint statement . " both sides expressed their interest in creating a system for responding to potential missile threats in which russia and the united states and europe will participate as equal partners , " the declaration said . beyond the us missile shield plans , negotiations touched on a range of disagreements that have built up during the two leaders ' eight years in power , including nato expansion and arms treaties . bush meets next russian president bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : medvedev said he 'd continue down the path putin has laid out bush also held his first talks with putin 's successor dmitry medvedev , highlighting both sides ' attention to managing relations during the transition period . medvedev has told president bush he hopes to follow in the footsteps of vladimir putin in attempting to strengthen relations with the us . medvedev said bush and putin " did a lot to advance u.s.-russian relations " over the last eight years .

" both bush and putin have underscored warm personal ties , deflecting from a growing number of testy security issues as they compete for influence in europe .
bush said he had grown to respect putin as a strong leader . " you 're not afraid to tell me what 's on your mind , " bush said to the kremlin leader .
" when all is said and done , we 'll shake hands . " week of disagreement bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : bush once said he saw into putin 's soul the sochi meeting comes on the heels of a face-off at this week 's nato summit where kremlin fears that nato 's eastward expansion threatens its security were seen to have trumped us desires to see georgia and ukraine join nato . but the united states won nato 's full backing for its plans to deploy a missile defense system in eastern europe , an eventuality the kremlin finds even more threatening .
the plans call for setting up a radar base in the czech republic and stationing interceptor missiles in poland . washington says the system is not aimed at russia , but needed to protect against " rogue states " such as iran . " we have a lot more work to do to convince our allies that the system is not aimed at russia , " bush told journalists after his one and half hour talks with the russian president . much work remains for successors " we 're going to have to do more work after sochi , " white house spokeswoman dana perino told reporters on the flight to sochi .

the now insolvent company reportedly received 1.6 million euros -lrb- $ 2.4 million -rrb- from the libyans , paying each of the men around 15,000 euros for their services . they carried out the training without the knowledge of their superiors while on holiday or after taking unpaid leave , according to press reports . once a backer of terrorists , libya has taken a more pro-western course in recent years , although it still comes under fire from rights groups over its human rights record . dw staff -lrb- sms -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

they also vowed to stick to pledges to double aid to africa . the ministers agreed on sunday , april 6 , in tokyo to fulfill their commitments on overseas development aid made at gleneagles , especially to double aid for african nations by 2010 . underlining the growing role of developing economies in global aid efforts , brazil , china , and india and other emerging donors were invited to talks here that aim to lay the groundwork for the g8 summit in july . the g8 agreed on the need for " concrete cooperation with emerging donors , " japanese foreign minister masahiko komura told a news conference wrapping up the two days of talks . china has made major diplomatic and economic inroads in mostly resource-rich nations in africa and latin america by giving aid without imposing any conditions .
the united states and european union , meanwhile , often use aid promises as leverage to improve human rights or to promote other policy goals . time of hope and difficulty bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : wieczorek-zeul said cutting poverty by 50 percent remained the g8 's goal " this new aid is at the same time a hope and a difficulty , " said alain joyandet , france 's junior cooperation minister , according to the afp news agency . the aim of negotiations with emerging donors " is to have a common understanding about the question of standards for investment and regulations , " said german development minister heidemarie wieczorek-zeul . " the goal always has to remain that everybody is devoted to the millennium goals , " she said , referring to a 2000 un agreement on poverty reduction . a report by the organization for economic cooperation and development released friday showed total development aid among the world 's 22 major aid donors fell 8.4 percent in real terms in 2007 . germany second-largest aid donor bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : most western countries are falling behind on aid promises , an oecd study said for 2007 , the biggest donors were the united states , germany , france , britain and japan while the only countries to exceed the un 0.7 percent of gni target were denmark , luxembourg , the netherlands , norway and sweden . germany 's official development assistance for 2007 amounted to $ 12.26 billion , an increase of 5.9 percent from 2006 when germany was in fifth place on this list of aid donors .
germany spent 0.37 percent of its gross domestic product on development , well below the government 's target of increasing aid to 0.51 percent of gdp by 2010 . g8 members - britain , canada , france , germany , italy , japan , russia and the united states - expressed concern at the decline and vowed to strive to fulfil their pledge made in 2005 to double aid for africa by 2010 . " each g8 country is determined to strengthen development aid , " said komura .
" so as to improve the situation in the fields of poverty , health care , education and water in impoverished countries , the g8 needs to continue strengthening development aid both in quality and quantity . " the full g8 meeting is scheduled for july 7-9 on the northern japanese island of hokkaido . dw staff -lrb- sms -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

while the industry is booming , the potential dangers to humans remain unknown . nanotechnology has been heralded as the key technology of the 21st century which could produce mind-boggling new inventions .
everything that is smaller than 100 nanometers -lrb- one nanometer is a measurement that is one billionth of a meter -rrb- is considered part of nanotechnology . nanotechnology encompasses various disciplines including information technology , medicine , environmental technology and optics .
dresden , the capital of the german state of saxony , has become a global center for nanotechnology research .
researchers and industry leaders recently traveled to dresden to exchange ideas at a nano trade fair . nanotechnology has huge market potential .
it already forms the foundation for developments such as high-capacity hard drives , bright , iridescent car paint and a scratch-proof coating for eyeglasses .
almost every day a new product gets added to the list of nanotechnology marvels .
the nanofair showcased the latest research that is on the cusp of becoming reality . cancer tracker bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : new uses for nanotechnology are constantly being discovered " nanodiamonds are a very interesting material , " jörg opitz from the the fraunhofer institute for non-destructive testing -lrb- izfp -rrb- told dw-world.de , referring to tiny carbon crystals .
" we hope that they can be inserted into cells and used as biological sensors which could possibly at some point diagnose cancer . " nanodiamonds can fluoresce or emit their own light .
since nanodiamonds are much smaller than a human cell , they can be designed to specifically target cancer cells .
the cells would then fluoresce , which would allow a doctor to locate the exact location and extent of a tumor . nanodiamonds could revolutionize cancer care by offering a diagnosis that is quicker and more precise .
but nanodiamonds ' potential extends beyond cancer treatment . " at the moment we are looking at airplanes and detecting corrosion while simultaneously measuring how far it has progressed , " opitz said . for that project , his institute is collaborating with european plane manufacturer airbus . a genuine marvel bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : it 's not always easy to visualize the " nano-world " governments meanwhile are continuously looking for ways to make the paper money they produce more difficult to counterfeit .
nanoparticles being studied by claus feldmann from the university of karlsruhe could revolutionize anti-counterfeiting measures . the tiny compounds he has under study are invisible when seen under normal light .
but when they are stimulated , they light up , he said .
for example , a uv light would turn imprints from these luminescent nanoparticles green or red . unlike current security features on european money , they ca n't be bleached away , making them much more secure , feldmann said . safety concerns no one disputes nanotechnology 's potential .
but is it safe for humans and the environment ?
that question remains intensely debated by researchers such as andreas leson from the fraunhofer insitute iws in dresden . the german government has established a " nano-dialogue " that includes scientists , companies and also nature conservation groups , leson said .
the german government has given scientists multi-million euro grants to study nanotechnology 's safety . the eu has also gotten involved in funding projects with names such as nanoderm , nanotox and impart .
researchers are still performing tests to discover which nanoparticles are dangerous and still lack reliable data on whether particles could cause damage to humans . although the debate over risk remains very preliminary , potentially dangerous aspects are already beginning to emerge . the nanoparticles are so small that they can override the blood-brain-barrier , which in humans protects the brain from harmful chemicals in the blood .
animal tests have shown this to be potentially very dangerous . the tiny particles also have the potential to damage the lungs , much as asbestos does . dw staff -lrb- th -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

while the industry is booming , the potential dangers to humans remain unknown . nanotechnology has been heralded as the key technology of the 21st century which could produce mind-boggling new inventions .
everything that is smaller than 100 nanometers -lrb- one nanometer is a measurement that is one billionth of a meter -rrb- is considered part of nanotechnology . nanotechnology encompasses various disciplines including information technology , medicine , environmental technology and optics .
dresden , the capital of the german state of saxony , has become a global center for nanotechnology research .
researchers and industry leaders recently traveled to dresden to exchange ideas at a nano trade fair . nanotechnology has huge market potential .
it already forms the foundation for developments such as high-capacity hard drives , bright , iridescent car paint and a scratch-proof coating for eyeglasses .
almost every day a new product gets added to the list of nanotechnology marvels .

they also vowed to stick to pledges to double aid to africa . the ministers agreed on sunday , april 6 , in tokyo to fulfill their commitments on overseas development aid made at gleneagles , especially to double aid for african nations by 2010 . underlining the growing role of developing economies in global aid efforts , brazil , china , and india and other emerging donors were invited to talks here that aim to lay the groundwork for the g8 summit in july . the g8 agreed on the need for " concrete cooperation with emerging donors , " japanese foreign minister masahiko komura told a news conference wrapping up the two days of talks . china has made major diplomatic and economic inroads in mostly resource-rich nations in africa and latin america by giving aid without imposing any conditions .
the united states and european union , meanwhile , often use aid promises as leverage to improve human rights or to promote other policy goals . time of hope and difficulty bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : wieczorek-zeul said cutting poverty by 50 percent remained the g8 's goal " this new aid is at the same time a hope and a difficulty , " said alain joyandet , france 's junior cooperation minister , according to the afp news agency . the aim of negotiations with emerging donors " is to have a common understanding about the question of standards for investment and regulations , " said german development minister heidemarie wieczorek-zeul . " the goal always has to remain that everybody is devoted to the millennium goals , " she said , referring to a 2000 un agreement on poverty reduction . a report by the organization for economic cooperation and development released friday showed total development aid among the world 's 22 major aid donors fell 8.4 percent in real terms in 2007 . germany second-largest aid donor bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : most western countries are falling behind on aid promises , an oecd study said for 2007 , the biggest donors were the united states , germany , france , britain and japan while the only countries to exceed the un 0.7 percent of gni target were denmark , luxembourg , the netherlands , norway and sweden . germany 's official development assistance for 2007 amounted to $ 12.26 billion , an increase of 5.9 percent from 2006 when germany was in fifth place on this list of aid donors .
germany spent 0.37 percent of its gross domestic product on development , well below the government 's target of increasing aid to 0.51 percent of gdp by 2010 . g8 members - britain , canada , france , germany , italy , japan , russia and the united states - expressed concern at the decline and vowed to strive to fulfil their pledge made in 2005 to double aid for africa by 2010 . " each g8 country is determined to strengthen development aid , " said komura .
" so as to improve the situation in the fields of poverty , health care , education and water in impoverished countries , the g8 needs to continue strengthening development aid both in quality and quantity .

they also vowed to stick to pledges to double aid to africa . the ministers agreed on sunday , april 6 , in tokyo to fulfill their commitments on overseas development aid made at gleneagles , especially to double aid for african nations by 2010 . underlining the growing role of developing economies in global aid efforts , brazil , china , and india and other emerging donors were invited to talks here that aim to lay the groundwork for the g8 summit in july . the g8 agreed on the need for " concrete cooperation with emerging donors , " japanese foreign minister masahiko komura told a news conference wrapping up the two days of talks . china has made major diplomatic and economic inroads in mostly resource-rich nations in africa and latin america by giving aid without imposing any conditions .
the united states and european union , meanwhile , often use aid promises as leverage to improve human rights or to promote other policy goals . time of hope and difficulty bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : wieczorek-zeul said cutting poverty by 50 percent remained the g8 's goal " this new aid is at the same time a hope and a difficulty , " said alain joyandet , france 's junior cooperation minister , according to the afp news agency . the aim of negotiations with emerging donors " is to have a common understanding about the question of standards for investment and regulations , " said german development minister heidemarie wieczorek-zeul . " the goal always has to remain that everybody is devoted to the millennium goals , " she said , referring to a 2000 un agreement on poverty reduction . a report by the organization for economic cooperation and development released friday showed total development aid among the world 's 22 major aid donors fell 8.4 percent in real terms in 2007 . germany second-largest aid donor bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : most western countries are falling behind on aid promises , an oecd study said for 2007 , the biggest donors were the united states , germany , france , britain and japan while the only countries to exceed the un 0.7 percent of gni target were denmark , luxembourg , the netherlands , norway and sweden . germany 's official development assistance for 2007 amounted to $ 12.26 billion , an increase of 5.9 percent from 2006 when germany was in fifth place on this list of aid donors .
germany spent 0.37 percent of its gross domestic product on development , well below the government 's target of increasing aid to 0.51 percent of gdp by 2010 . g8 members - britain , canada , france , germany , italy , japan , russia and the united states - expressed concern at the decline and vowed to strive to fulfil their pledge made in 2005 to double aid for africa by 2010 . " each g8 country is determined to strengthen development aid , " said komura .
" so as to improve the situation in the fields of poverty , health care , education and water in impoverished countries , the g8 needs to continue strengthening development aid both in quality and quantity . " the full g8 meeting is scheduled for july 7-9 on the northern japanese island of hokkaido . dw staff -lrb- sms -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

" we hope that they can be inserted into cells and used as biological sensors which could possibly at some point diagnose cancer . " nanodiamonds can fluoresce or emit their own light .
since nanodiamonds are much smaller than a human cell , they can be designed to specifically target cancer cells .

nanoparticles being studied by claus feldmann from the university of karlsruhe could revolutionize anti-counterfeiting measures . the tiny compounds he has under study are invisible when seen under normal light .
but when they are stimulated , they light up , he said .
for example , a uv light would turn imprints from these luminescent nanoparticles green or red . unlike current security features on european money , they ca n't be bleached away , making them much more secure , feldmann said . safety concerns no one disputes nanotechnology 's potential .
but is it safe for humans and the environment ?
that question remains intensely debated by researchers such as andreas leson from the fraunhofer insitute iws in dresden . the german government has established a " nano-dialogue " that includes scientists , companies and also nature conservation groups , leson said .
the german government has given scientists multi-million euro grants to study nanotechnology 's safety . the eu has also gotten involved in funding projects with names such as nanoderm , nanotox and impart .
researchers are still performing tests to discover which nanoparticles are dangerous and still lack reliable data on whether particles could cause damage to humans . although the debate over risk remains very preliminary , potentially dangerous aspects are already beginning to emerge . the nanoparticles are so small that they can override the blood-brain-barrier , which in humans protects the brain from harmful chemicals in the blood .
animal tests have shown this to be potentially very dangerous . the tiny particles also have the potential to damage the lungs , much as asbestos does . dw staff -lrb- th -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de science -pipe- 06.04.2008 nanotechnology possesses dazzling , dangerous potential großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : research is underway to assess nanotechnology 's environmental impacts nanotechnology seeks to create new products by harnessing incredibly small substances .
while the industry is booming , the potential dangers to humans remain unknown . nanotechnology has been heralded as the key technology of the 21st century which could produce mind-boggling new inventions .
everything that is smaller than 100 nanometers -lrb- one nanometer is a measurement that is one billionth of a meter -rrb- is considered part of nanotechnology . nanotechnology encompasses various disciplines including information technology , medicine , environmental technology and optics .
dresden , the capital of the german state of saxony , has become a global center for nanotechnology research .
researchers and industry leaders recently traveled to dresden to exchange ideas at a nano trade fair . nanotechnology has huge market potential .
it already forms the foundation for developments such as high-capacity hard drives , bright , iridescent car paint and a scratch-proof coating for eyeglasses .
almost every day a new product gets added to the list of nanotechnology marvels .
the nanofair showcased the latest research that is on the cusp of becoming reality . cancer tracker bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : new uses for nanotechnology are constantly being discovered " nanodiamonds are a very interesting material , " jörg opitz from the the fraunhofer institute for non-destructive testing -lrb- izfp -rrb- told dw-world.de , referring to tiny carbon crystals .
" we hope that they can be inserted into cells and used as biological sensors which could possibly at some point diagnose cancer . " nanodiamonds can fluoresce or emit their own light .
since nanodiamonds are much smaller than a human cell , they can be designed to specifically target cancer cells .
the cells would then fluoresce , which would allow a doctor to locate the exact location and extent of a tumor . nanodiamonds could revolutionize cancer care by offering a diagnosis that is quicker and more precise .
but nanodiamonds ' potential extends beyond cancer treatment . " at the moment we are looking at airplanes and detecting corrosion while simultaneously measuring how far it has progressed , " opitz said . for that project , his institute is collaborating with european plane manufacturer airbus . a genuine marvel bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : it 's not always easy to visualize the " nano-world " governments meanwhile are continuously looking for ways to make the paper money they produce more difficult to counterfeit .
nanoparticles being studied by claus feldmann from the university of karlsruhe could revolutionize anti-counterfeiting measures . the tiny compounds he has under study are invisible when seen under normal light .
but when they are stimulated , they light up , he said .
for example , a uv light would turn imprints from these luminescent nanoparticles green or red . unlike current security features on european money , they ca n't be bleached away , making them much more secure , feldmann said . safety concerns no one disputes nanotechnology 's potential .
but is it safe for humans and the environment ?
that question remains intensely debated by researchers such as andreas leson from the fraunhofer insitute iws in dresden . the german government has established a " nano-dialogue " that includes scientists , companies and also nature conservation groups , leson said .
the german government has given scientists multi-million euro grants to study nanotechnology 's safety . the eu has also gotten involved in funding projects with names such as nanoderm , nanotox and impart .
researchers are still performing tests to discover which nanoparticles are dangerous and still lack reliable data on whether particles could cause damage to humans . although the debate over risk remains very preliminary , potentially dangerous aspects are already beginning to emerge . the nanoparticles are so small that they can override the blood-brain-barrier , which in humans protects the brain from harmful chemicals in the blood .
animal tests have shown this to be potentially very dangerous . the tiny particles also have the potential to damage the lungs , much as asbestos does . dw staff -lrb- th -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

everything that is smaller than 100 nanometers -lrb- one nanometer is a measurement that is one billionth of a meter -rrb- is considered part of nanotechnology . nanotechnology encompasses various disciplines including information technology , medicine , environmental technology and optics .
dresden , the capital of the german state of saxony , has become a global center for nanotechnology research .
researchers and industry leaders recently traveled to dresden to exchange ideas at a nano trade fair . nanotechnology has huge market potential .
it already forms the foundation for developments such as high-capacity hard drives , bright , iridescent car paint and a scratch-proof coating for eyeglasses .
almost every day a new product gets added to the list of nanotechnology marvels .
the nanofair showcased the latest research that is on the cusp of becoming reality . cancer tracker bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : new uses for nanotechnology are constantly being discovered " nanodiamonds are a very interesting material , " jörg opitz from the the fraunhofer institute for non-destructive testing -lrb- izfp -rrb- told dw-world.de , referring to tiny carbon crystals .
" we hope that they can be inserted into cells and used as biological sensors which could possibly at some point diagnose cancer . " nanodiamonds can fluoresce or emit their own light .
since nanodiamonds are much smaller than a human cell , they can be designed to specifically target cancer cells .
the cells would then fluoresce , which would allow a doctor to locate the exact location and extent of a tumor . nanodiamonds could revolutionize cancer care by offering a diagnosis that is quicker and more precise .

nanoparticles being studied by claus feldmann from the university of karlsruhe could revolutionize anti-counterfeiting measures . the tiny compounds he has under study are invisible when seen under normal light .
but when they are stimulated , they light up , he said .
for example , a uv light would turn imprints from these luminescent nanoparticles green or red . unlike current security features on european money , they ca n't be bleached away , making them much more secure , feldmann said . safety concerns no one disputes nanotechnology 's potential .
but is it safe for humans and the environment ?
that question remains intensely debated by researchers such as andreas leson from the fraunhofer insitute iws in dresden . the german government has established a " nano-dialogue " that includes scientists , companies and also nature conservation groups , leson said .
the german government has given scientists multi-million euro grants to study nanotechnology 's safety . the eu has also gotten involved in funding projects with names such as nanoderm , nanotox and impart .
researchers are still performing tests to discover which nanoparticles are dangerous and still lack reliable data on whether particles could cause damage to humans . although the debate over risk remains very preliminary , potentially dangerous aspects are already beginning to emerge . the nanoparticles are so small that they can override the blood-brain-barrier , which in humans protects the brain from harmful chemicals in the blood .
animal tests have shown this to be potentially very dangerous . the tiny particles also have the potential to damage the lungs , much as asbestos does . dw staff -lrb- th -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de science -pipe- 06.04.2008 nanotechnology possesses dazzling , dangerous potential großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : research is underway to assess nanotechnology 's environmental impacts nanotechnology seeks to create new products by harnessing incredibly small substances .
while the industry is booming , the potential dangers to humans remain unknown . nanotechnology has been heralded as the key technology of the 21st century which could produce mind-boggling new inventions .
everything that is smaller than 100 nanometers -lrb- one nanometer is a measurement that is one billionth of a meter -rrb- is considered part of nanotechnology . nanotechnology encompasses various disciplines including information technology , medicine , environmental technology and optics .
dresden , the capital of the german state of saxony , has become a global center for nanotechnology research .
researchers and industry leaders recently traveled to dresden to exchange ideas at a nano trade fair . nanotechnology has huge market potential .
it already forms the foundation for developments such as high-capacity hard drives , bright , iridescent car paint and a scratch-proof coating for eyeglasses .
almost every day a new product gets added to the list of nanotechnology marvels .
the nanofair showcased the latest research that is on the cusp of becoming reality . cancer tracker bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : new uses for nanotechnology are constantly being discovered " nanodiamonds are a very interesting material , " jörg opitz from the the fraunhofer institute for non-destructive testing -lrb- izfp -rrb- told dw-world.de , referring to tiny carbon crystals .
" we hope that they can be inserted into cells and used as biological sensors which could possibly at some point diagnose cancer . " nanodiamonds can fluoresce or emit their own light .
since nanodiamonds are much smaller than a human cell , they can be designed to specifically target cancer cells .
the cells would then fluoresce , which would allow a doctor to locate the exact location and extent of a tumor . nanodiamonds could revolutionize cancer care by offering a diagnosis that is quicker and more precise .
but nanodiamonds ' potential extends beyond cancer treatment . " at the moment we are looking at airplanes and detecting corrosion while simultaneously measuring how far it has progressed , " opitz said . for that project , his institute is collaborating with european plane manufacturer airbus . a genuine marvel bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : it 's not always easy to visualize the " nano-world " governments meanwhile are continuously looking for ways to make the paper money they produce more difficult to counterfeit .
nanoparticles being studied by claus feldmann from the university of karlsruhe could revolutionize anti-counterfeiting measures . the tiny compounds he has under study are invisible when seen under normal light .
but when they are stimulated , they light up , he said .
for example , a uv light would turn imprints from these luminescent nanoparticles green or red . unlike current security features on european money , they ca n't be bleached away , making them much more secure , feldmann said . safety concerns no one disputes nanotechnology 's potential .
but is it safe for humans and the environment ?
that question remains intensely debated by researchers such as andreas leson from the fraunhofer insitute iws in dresden . the german government has established a " nano-dialogue " that includes scientists , companies and also nature conservation groups , leson said .
the german government has given scientists multi-million euro grants to study nanotechnology 's safety . the eu has also gotten involved in funding projects with names such as nanoderm , nanotox and impart .

while the industry is booming , the potential dangers to humans remain unknown . nanotechnology has been heralded as the key technology of the 21st century which could produce mind-boggling new inventions .
everything that is smaller than 100 nanometers -lrb- one nanometer is a measurement that is one billionth of a meter -rrb- is considered part of nanotechnology . nanotechnology encompasses various disciplines including information technology , medicine , environmental technology and optics .
dresden , the capital of the german state of saxony , has become a global center for nanotechnology research .
researchers and industry leaders recently traveled to dresden to exchange ideas at a nano trade fair . nanotechnology has huge market potential .
it already forms the foundation for developments such as high-capacity hard drives , bright , iridescent car paint and a scratch-proof coating for eyeglasses .
almost every day a new product gets added to the list of nanotechnology marvels .
the nanofair showcased the latest research that is on the cusp of becoming reality . cancer tracker bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : new uses for nanotechnology are constantly being discovered " nanodiamonds are a very interesting material , " jörg opitz from the the fraunhofer institute for non-destructive testing -lrb- izfp -rrb- told dw-world.de , referring to tiny carbon crystals .
" we hope that they can be inserted into cells and used as biological sensors which could possibly at some point diagnose cancer . " nanodiamonds can fluoresce or emit their own light .
since nanodiamonds are much smaller than a human cell , they can be designed to specifically target cancer cells .
the cells would then fluoresce , which would allow a doctor to locate the exact location and extent of a tumor . nanodiamonds could revolutionize cancer care by offering a diagnosis that is quicker and more precise .
but nanodiamonds ' potential extends beyond cancer treatment . " at the moment we are looking at airplanes and detecting corrosion while simultaneously measuring how far it has progressed , " opitz said . for that project , his institute is collaborating with european plane manufacturer airbus . a genuine marvel bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : it 's not always easy to visualize the " nano-world " governments meanwhile are continuously looking for ways to make the paper money they produce more difficult to counterfeit .

while the industry is booming , the potential dangers to humans remain unknown . nanotechnology has been heralded as the key technology of the 21st century which could produce mind-boggling new inventions .
everything that is smaller than 100 nanometers -lrb- one nanometer is a measurement that is one billionth of a meter -rrb- is considered part of nanotechnology . nanotechnology encompasses various disciplines including information technology , medicine , environmental technology and optics .
dresden , the capital of the german state of saxony , has become a global center for nanotechnology research .
researchers and industry leaders recently traveled to dresden to exchange ideas at a nano trade fair . nanotechnology has huge market potential .
it already forms the foundation for developments such as high-capacity hard drives , bright , iridescent car paint and a scratch-proof coating for eyeglasses .
almost every day a new product gets added to the list of nanotechnology marvels .
the nanofair showcased the latest research that is on the cusp of becoming reality . cancer tracker bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : new uses for nanotechnology are constantly being discovered " nanodiamonds are a very interesting material , " jörg opitz from the the fraunhofer institute for non-destructive testing -lrb- izfp -rrb- told dw-world.de , referring to tiny carbon crystals .
" we hope that they can be inserted into cells and used as biological sensors which could possibly at some point diagnose cancer . " nanodiamonds can fluoresce or emit their own light .
since nanodiamonds are much smaller than a human cell , they can be designed to specifically target cancer cells .
the cells would then fluoresce , which would allow a doctor to locate the exact location and extent of a tumor . nanodiamonds could revolutionize cancer care by offering a diagnosis that is quicker and more precise .
but nanodiamonds ' potential extends beyond cancer treatment . " at the moment we are looking at airplanes and detecting corrosion while simultaneously measuring how far it has progressed , " opitz said . for that project , his institute is collaborating with european plane manufacturer airbus . a genuine marvel bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : it 's not always easy to visualize the " nano-world " governments meanwhile are continuously looking for ways to make the paper money they produce more difficult to counterfeit .
nanoparticles being studied by claus feldmann from the university of karlsruhe could revolutionize anti-counterfeiting measures . the tiny compounds he has under study are invisible when seen under normal light .
but when they are stimulated , they light up , he said .
for example , a uv light would turn imprints from these luminescent nanoparticles green or red . unlike current security features on european money , they ca n't be bleached away , making them much more secure , feldmann said . safety concerns no one disputes nanotechnology 's potential .
but is it safe for humans and the environment ?
that question remains intensely debated by researchers such as andreas leson from the fraunhofer insitute iws in dresden . the german government has established a " nano-dialogue " that includes scientists , companies and also nature conservation groups , leson said .
the german government has given scientists multi-million euro grants to study nanotechnology 's safety . the eu has also gotten involved in funding projects with names such as nanoderm , nanotox and impart .
researchers are still performing tests to discover which nanoparticles are dangerous and still lack reliable data on whether particles could cause damage to humans . although the debate over risk remains very preliminary , potentially dangerous aspects are already beginning to emerge . the nanoparticles are so small that they can override the blood-brain-barrier , which in humans protects the brain from harmful chemicals in the blood .
animal tests have shown this to be potentially very dangerous . the tiny particles also have the potential to damage the lungs , much as asbestos does . dw staff -lrb- th -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de science -pipe- 06.04.2008 nanotechnology possesses dazzling , dangerous potential großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : research is underway to assess nanotechnology 's environmental impacts nanotechnology seeks to create new products by harnessing incredibly small substances .
while the industry is booming , the potential dangers to humans remain unknown . nanotechnology has been heralded as the key technology of the 21st century which could produce mind-boggling new inventions .
everything that is smaller than 100 nanometers -lrb- one nanometer is a measurement that is one billionth of a meter -rrb- is considered part of nanotechnology . nanotechnology encompasses various disciplines including information technology , medicine , environmental technology and optics .
dresden , the capital of the german state of saxony , has become a global center for nanotechnology research .
researchers and industry leaders recently traveled to dresden to exchange ideas at a nano trade fair . nanotechnology has huge market potential .
it already forms the foundation for developments such as high-capacity hard drives , bright , iridescent car paint and a scratch-proof coating for eyeglasses .
almost every day a new product gets added to the list of nanotechnology marvels .
the nanofair showcased the latest research that is on the cusp of becoming reality . cancer tracker bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : new uses for nanotechnology are constantly being discovered " nanodiamonds are a very interesting material , " jörg opitz from the the fraunhofer institute for non-destructive testing -lrb- izfp -rrb- told dw-world.de , referring to tiny carbon crystals .
" we hope that they can be inserted into cells and used as biological sensors which could possibly at some point diagnose cancer . " nanodiamonds can fluoresce or emit their own light .
since nanodiamonds are much smaller than a human cell , they can be designed to specifically target cancer cells .
the cells would then fluoresce , which would allow a doctor to locate the exact location and extent of a tumor . nanodiamonds could revolutionize cancer care by offering a diagnosis that is quicker and more precise .
but nanodiamonds ' potential extends beyond cancer treatment . " at the moment we are looking at airplanes and detecting corrosion while simultaneously measuring how far it has progressed , " opitz said . for that project , his institute is collaborating with european plane manufacturer airbus . a genuine marvel bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : it 's not always easy to visualize the " nano-world " governments meanwhile are continuously looking for ways to make the paper money they produce more difficult to counterfeit .
nanoparticles being studied by claus feldmann from the university of karlsruhe could revolutionize anti-counterfeiting measures . the tiny compounds he has under study are invisible when seen under normal light .
but when they are stimulated , they light up , he said .
for example , a uv light would turn imprints from these luminescent nanoparticles green or red . unlike current security features on european money , they ca n't be bleached away , making them much more secure , feldmann said . safety concerns no one disputes nanotechnology 's potential .
but is it safe for humans and the environment ?
that question remains intensely debated by researchers such as andreas leson from the fraunhofer insitute iws in dresden . the german government has established a " nano-dialogue " that includes scientists , companies and also nature conservation groups , leson said .
the german government has given scientists multi-million euro grants to study nanotechnology 's safety . the eu has also gotten involved in funding projects with names such as nanoderm , nanotox and impart .
researchers are still performing tests to discover which nanoparticles are dangerous and still lack reliable data on whether particles could cause damage to humans . although the debate over risk remains very preliminary , potentially dangerous aspects are already beginning to emerge . the nanoparticles are so small that they can override the blood-brain-barrier , which in humans protects the brain from harmful chemicals in the blood .
animal tests have shown this to be potentially very dangerous . the tiny particles also have the potential to damage the lungs , much as asbestos does . dw staff -lrb- th -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

us musician moby said the famed german " love parade " has made germans sexy in the eyes of americans .
surprise , surprise : grooving , bare-breasted women at the festival are appealing , he said . " we saw photos of bare-breasted women bouncing around to techno music , " american electronic music star moby said in an interview with the leben magazine supplement of die zeit weekly . he was talking about americans seeing images of germany 's wild love parade , known the world over .
moby said the techno bash has helped germany polish its image . " it was a bit disorienting , " moby said .
" we had to reconcile the image of the dancing women with the image of screaming men in ss uniforms . " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : moby said drugs are great , but mess up his brain moby missed out on the eye candy at the event last year in essen , though , saying he had missed his flight from new york , the dpa news service reported . ecstasy was the " perfect " drug the 42-year-old also gave a little insight into his early penchant for drugs .
at 10 , he took " anything he got his hands on , " including pills , hash and alcohol .
at 13 , he stopped , he told the german newspaper . moby said he would still take pills , which he called the perfect drug , if it were n't for the fact that they ruin his brain . dw staff -lrb- als -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

while the industry is booming , the potential dangers to humans remain unknown . nanotechnology has been heralded as the key technology of the 21st century which could produce mind-boggling new inventions .
everything that is smaller than 100 nanometers -lrb- one nanometer is a measurement that is one billionth of a meter -rrb- is considered part of nanotechnology . nanotechnology encompasses various disciplines including information technology , medicine , environmental technology and optics .
dresden , the capital of the german state of saxony , has become a global center for nanotechnology research .
researchers and industry leaders recently traveled to dresden to exchange ideas at a nano trade fair . nanotechnology has huge market potential .
it already forms the foundation for developments such as high-capacity hard drives , bright , iridescent car paint and a scratch-proof coating for eyeglasses .
almost every day a new product gets added to the list of nanotechnology marvels .
the nanofair showcased the latest research that is on the cusp of becoming reality . cancer tracker bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : new uses for nanotechnology are constantly being discovered " nanodiamonds are a very interesting material , " jörg opitz from the the fraunhofer institute for non-destructive testing -lrb- izfp -rrb- told dw-world.de , referring to tiny carbon crystals .
" we hope that they can be inserted into cells and used as biological sensors which could possibly at some point diagnose cancer . " nanodiamonds can fluoresce or emit their own light .
since nanodiamonds are much smaller than a human cell , they can be designed to specifically target cancer cells .
the cells would then fluoresce , which would allow a doctor to locate the exact location and extent of a tumor . nanodiamonds could revolutionize cancer care by offering a diagnosis that is quicker and more precise .
but nanodiamonds ' potential extends beyond cancer treatment . " at the moment we are looking at airplanes and detecting corrosion while simultaneously measuring how far it has progressed , " opitz said . for that project , his institute is collaborating with european plane manufacturer airbus . a genuine marvel bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : it 's not always easy to visualize the " nano-world " governments meanwhile are continuously looking for ways to make the paper money they produce more difficult to counterfeit .
nanoparticles being studied by claus feldmann from the university of karlsruhe could revolutionize anti-counterfeiting measures . the tiny compounds he has under study are invisible when seen under normal light .
but when they are stimulated , they light up , he said .
for example , a uv light would turn imprints from these luminescent nanoparticles green or red . unlike current security features on european money , they ca n't be bleached away , making them much more secure , feldmann said . safety concerns no one disputes nanotechnology 's potential .
but is it safe for humans and the environment ?
that question remains intensely debated by researchers such as andreas leson from the fraunhofer insitute iws in dresden . the german government has established a " nano-dialogue " that includes scientists , companies and also nature conservation groups , leson said .
the german government has given scientists multi-million euro grants to study nanotechnology 's safety . the eu has also gotten involved in funding projects with names such as nanoderm , nanotox and impart .
researchers are still performing tests to discover which nanoparticles are dangerous and still lack reliable data on whether particles could cause damage to humans . although the debate over risk remains very preliminary , potentially dangerous aspects are already beginning to emerge . the nanoparticles are so small that they can override the blood-brain-barrier , which in humans protects the brain from harmful chemicals in the blood .
animal tests have shown this to be potentially very dangerous . the tiny particles also have the potential to damage the lungs , much as asbestos does . dw staff -lrb- th -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

while the industry is booming , the potential dangers to humans remain unknown . nanotechnology has been heralded as the key technology of the 21st century which could produce mind-boggling new inventions .
everything that is smaller than 100 nanometers -lrb- one nanometer is a measurement that is one billionth of a meter -rrb- is considered part of nanotechnology . nanotechnology encompasses various disciplines including information technology , medicine , environmental technology and optics .
dresden , the capital of the german state of saxony , has become a global center for nanotechnology research .
researchers and industry leaders recently traveled to dresden to exchange ideas at a nano trade fair . nanotechnology has huge market potential .
it already forms the foundation for developments such as high-capacity hard drives , bright , iridescent car paint and a scratch-proof coating for eyeglasses .
almost every day a new product gets added to the list of nanotechnology marvels .
the nanofair showcased the latest research that is on the cusp of becoming reality . cancer tracker bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : new uses for nanotechnology are constantly being discovered " nanodiamonds are a very interesting material , " jörg opitz from the the fraunhofer institute for non-destructive testing -lrb- izfp -rrb- told dw-world.de , referring to tiny carbon crystals .
" we hope that they can be inserted into cells and used as biological sensors which could possibly at some point diagnose cancer . " nanodiamonds can fluoresce or emit their own light .
since nanodiamonds are much smaller than a human cell , they can be designed to specifically target cancer cells .
the cells would then fluoresce , which would allow a doctor to locate the exact location and extent of a tumor . nanodiamonds could revolutionize cancer care by offering a diagnosis that is quicker and more precise .
but nanodiamonds ' potential extends beyond cancer treatment . " at the moment we are looking at airplanes and detecting corrosion while simultaneously measuring how far it has progressed , " opitz said . for that project , his institute is collaborating with european plane manufacturer airbus . a genuine marvel bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : it 's not always easy to visualize the " nano-world " governments meanwhile are continuously looking for ways to make the paper money they produce more difficult to counterfeit .
nanoparticles being studied by claus feldmann from the university of karlsruhe could revolutionize anti-counterfeiting measures . the tiny compounds he has under study are invisible when seen under normal light .
but when they are stimulated , they light up , he said .
for example , a uv light would turn imprints from these luminescent nanoparticles green or red . unlike current security features on european money , they ca n't be bleached away , making them much more secure , feldmann said . safety concerns no one disputes nanotechnology 's potential .
but is it safe for humans and the environment ?
that question remains intensely debated by researchers such as andreas leson from the fraunhofer insitute iws in dresden . the german government has established a " nano-dialogue " that includes scientists , companies and also nature conservation groups , leson said .
the german government has given scientists multi-million euro grants to study nanotechnology 's safety . the eu has also gotten involved in funding projects with names such as nanoderm , nanotox and impart .
researchers are still performing tests to discover which nanoparticles are dangerous and still lack reliable data on whether particles could cause damage to humans . although the debate over risk remains very preliminary , potentially dangerous aspects are already beginning to emerge . the nanoparticles are so small that they can override the blood-brain-barrier , which in humans protects the brain from harmful chemicals in the blood .
animal tests have shown this to be potentially very dangerous . the tiny particles also have the potential to damage the lungs , much as asbestos does . dw staff -lrb- th -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de science -pipe- 06.04.2008 nanotechnology possesses dazzling , dangerous potential großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : research is underway to assess nanotechnology 's environmental impacts nanotechnology seeks to create new products by harnessing incredibly small substances .
while the industry is booming , the potential dangers to humans remain unknown . nanotechnology has been heralded as the key technology of the 21st century which could produce mind-boggling new inventions .
everything that is smaller than 100 nanometers -lrb- one nanometer is a measurement that is one billionth of a meter -rrb- is considered part of nanotechnology . nanotechnology encompasses various disciplines including information technology , medicine , environmental technology and optics .
dresden , the capital of the german state of saxony , has become a global center for nanotechnology research .
researchers and industry leaders recently traveled to dresden to exchange ideas at a nano trade fair . nanotechnology has huge market potential .
it already forms the foundation for developments such as high-capacity hard drives , bright , iridescent car paint and a scratch-proof coating for eyeglasses .
almost every day a new product gets added to the list of nanotechnology marvels .
the nanofair showcased the latest research that is on the cusp of becoming reality . cancer tracker bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : new uses for nanotechnology are constantly being discovered " nanodiamonds are a very interesting material , " jörg opitz from the the fraunhofer institute for non-destructive testing -lrb- izfp -rrb- told dw-world.de , referring to tiny carbon crystals .
" we hope that they can be inserted into cells and used as biological sensors which could possibly at some point diagnose cancer . " nanodiamonds can fluoresce or emit their own light .
since nanodiamonds are much smaller than a human cell , they can be designed to specifically target cancer cells .
the cells would then fluoresce , which would allow a doctor to locate the exact location and extent of a tumor . nanodiamonds could revolutionize cancer care by offering a diagnosis that is quicker and more precise .
but nanodiamonds ' potential extends beyond cancer treatment . " at the moment we are looking at airplanes and detecting corrosion while simultaneously measuring how far it has progressed , " opitz said . for that project , his institute is collaborating with european plane manufacturer airbus . a genuine marvel bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : it 's not always easy to visualize the " nano-world " governments meanwhile are continuously looking for ways to make the paper money they produce more difficult to counterfeit .
nanoparticles being studied by claus feldmann from the university of karlsruhe could revolutionize anti-counterfeiting measures . the tiny compounds he has under study are invisible when seen under normal light .
but when they are stimulated , they light up , he said .
for example , a uv light would turn imprints from these luminescent nanoparticles green or red . unlike current security features on european money , they ca n't be bleached away , making them much more secure , feldmann said . safety concerns no one disputes nanotechnology 's potential .
but is it safe for humans and the environment ?
that question remains intensely debated by researchers such as andreas leson from the fraunhofer insitute iws in dresden . the german government has established a " nano-dialogue " that includes scientists , companies and also nature conservation groups , leson said .
the german government has given scientists multi-million euro grants to study nanotechnology 's safety . the eu has also gotten involved in funding projects with names such as nanoderm , nanotox and impart .
researchers are still performing tests to discover which nanoparticles are dangerous and still lack reliable data on whether particles could cause damage to humans . although the debate over risk remains very preliminary , potentially dangerous aspects are already beginning to emerge . the nanoparticles are so small that they can override the blood-brain-barrier , which in humans protects the brain from harmful chemicals in the blood .

" our fundamental attitudes to the american plan have not changed , " putin said in a press conference after his last tete-a-tete meeting with his us counterpart george w. bush . putin , however , acknowledged us efforts to " resolve the issues " and " offer a set of confidence-building measures .

" both sides expressed their interest in creating a system for responding to potential missile threats in which russia and the united states and europe will participate as equal partners , " the declaration said . beyond the us missile shield plans , negotiations touched on a range of disagreements that have built up during the two leaders ' eight years in power , including nato expansion and arms treaties . bush meets next russian president bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : medvedev said he 'd continue down the path putin has laid out bush also held his first talks with putin 's successor dmitry medvedev , highlighting both sides ' attention to managing relations during the transition period . medvedev has told president bush he hopes to follow in the footsteps of vladimir putin in attempting to strengthen relations with the us . medvedev said bush and putin " did a lot to advance u.s.-russian relations " over the last eight years .
he also said maintaining good russian-us relations was " a key factor in international security . " medvedev added , " i would like to do my part to keep up that work . " both bush and putin have underscored warm personal ties , deflecting from a growing number of testy security issues as they compete for influence in europe .

" when all is said and done , we 'll shake hands .

the plans call for setting up a radar base in the czech republic and stationing interceptor missiles in poland . washington says the system is not aimed at russia , but needed to protect against " rogue states " such as iran . " we have a lot more work to do to convince our allies that the system is not aimed at russia , " bush told journalists after his one and half hour talks with the russian president . much work remains for successors " we 're going to have to do more work after sochi , " white house spokeswoman dana perino told reporters on the flight to sochi . " no one has said that everything would be finalized and everyone would be satisfied , " she added . rather , officials on both sides said the " strategic framework " agreement would constitute a broad roadmap to guide future us-russian relations . dw staff -lrb- sms -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

" there was no such deal , " diplomatic sources told the afp news agency . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the wallerts were taken hostage in 2000 a libyan mediator helped obtain the release of the german wallert family members , who were among a group of foreigners kidnapped at a diving school in jolo by the abu sayyaf rebel group on easter sunday 2000 . renate wallert was freed after 86 days in captivity , her husband werner after 127 days on aug .
27 .
their son , marc , was released nearly two weeks later as the final hostage in the group .
unconfirmed reports said libya paid around 21 million euros for the hostages ' release . foreign ministry denies involvement in apparent confirmation of a report released saturday by der spiegel newsmagazine , bild said the german embassy in tripoli was informally briefed on the training seminars conducted between 2005 and 2007 by around 30 members of an elite police unit and a soldier moonlighting for a private security firm . the foreign ministry on sunday , however , issued a statement denying any involvement in the training of libyan police authorities .
the issue has caused a stir in germany amid fears that secrets about police training methods might have been divulged to the libyans .
the bundestag , the lower house of german parliament , is due to discuss the issue on wednesday . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : as many as 30 germans are suspected of having a role in training libyans training was provided to gaddafi 's security forces by german bodyguards tasked with protecting the bundeswehr 's highest-ranking officer , inspector-general wolfgang schneiderhan , berlin daily tagesspiegel am sonntag reported . a sergeant serving with a crack unit of mountain troops has been suspended while an investigation into his alleged role in the operation is under way . eight policemen in the state of north rhine-westphalia are also facing disciplinary proceedings , including one who is subject to a criminal investigation relating to the inappropriate use of official documents . unacceptable behavior wolfgang bosbach , deputy parliamentary leader of chancellor angela merkel 's christian democratic union , said the bundestag would not have approved training for libyan forces . " there is no doubt that libya is run by an unfair regime , " he told german public broadcaster ard .
" had the officers requested permission for their work , it would have certainly been refused . " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : politicians called the officers ' behavior unacceptable german defense minister franz josef jung has condemned the officers ' behavior , saying , " this should under no circumstances be accepted . " germany 's foreign intelligence service bnd denied any involvement in the training program , which reportedly included instruction on how to storm buildings , abseil from helicopters and board ships . the germans were hired by a security firm called bdb protection founded by a former police commando .
the now insolvent company reportedly received 1.6 million euros -lrb- $ 2.4 million -rrb- from the libyans , paying each of the men around 15,000 euros for their services . they carried out the training without the knowledge of their superiors while on holiday or after taking unpaid leave , according to press reports . once a backer of terrorists , libya has taken a more pro-western course in recent years , although it still comes under fire from rights groups over its human rights record . dw staff -lrb- sms -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

but many questions are still unanswered .
just off one of tashkent 's leafy boulevards , deep in the basement of a concrete soviet-era building , hides a small theatre called ilkhom , which in uzbek means inspiration .
a fragile glass door is all that separates it from the harsh reality of one of central asia 's most repressive states .
but inside the spacious lobby and amid the dark corridors of its backstage none of the outside rules seem to apply .
for more than 30 years , ilkhom , which was the soviet union 's first independent theatre , produced a countless number of thought-provoking and controversial plays which forced people to question the reality that reigned beyond the theatre 's door .
but last september its founder and director , mark weil , was killed while returning home from a rehearsal .
" this country has lost the best ambassador of good things in uzbekistan , " says peter burkhard , the swiss ambassador in tashkent who - like many - believes that clues to mark weil 's unsolved murder lie in his plays .
" ilkhom theatre is the only place in tashkent where some thinking is going on .
the rest of the country is just affirming , stating , showing off , but there is no reflection . "
a small act of defiance in the predominantly muslim uzbekistan there are no opposition parties and no free media .
foreign journalists are not welcome and different opinion is rarely tolerated .
the very existence of mark weil 's theatre was a small act of defiance .
" several years ago , for some reason , police banned christmas trees from all theatres and everyone obeyed .
but here we just hung it upside down from the ceiling , " laughs maxim tumenev , one of ilkhom 's actors .
maxim , like most in ilkhom 's 30 strong troupe , is a graduate of mark weil 's drama school .
set up in the 1990s , its rigorously competitive three year programme quickly began drawing students from far away .
" the school of mark weil is not just a school for actors .
it was a school for life .
here , he was developing very intelligent , very sensitive , very open individuals , " says tyler polumsky , an american from seattle , who initially came to uzbekistan for a three month course at ilkhom .
five years later he is still at the theatre , acting and coaching a new generation of students .
" mark taught us we could not be afraid , we could not watch our backs , that everything that came to our minds had legitimacy and deserved to be tried out , " adds marina turpisheva , who has been with the troupe for almost all of its 30 years .
changing world in the 1970s , when she first started rehearsing at ilkhom , tashkent - the soviet union 's fourth largest city - was home to dozens of nationalities .
being far away from moscow 's watchful eye gave mark weil a little more freedom to experiment and , although money was scarce and problems with the authorities were endless , ilkhom survived and grew . "
this is art and we reflect the reality around us " maxim tumenev , actor independence sent ilkhom travelling around the world .
but it failed to bring freedom to uzbekistan .
islam karimov , the country 's soviet-era boss , became its president .
the economy crumbled , political opponents were exiled or jailed , and thousands of people left the capital stripping tashkent of its best and brightest .
mark weil watched as the cosmopolitan , vibrant place he loved shrank .
as the city changed , so did his repertoire .
he started to focus more on uzbek culture .
in his plays he talked about islam and homosexuality .
he challenged convention and mocked the ridiculousness of those in power .
" this is art and we reflect the reality around us , " says maxim tumenev .
" it was never mark 's goal to be political or to oppose anyone .
he simply reflected the reality around us . "
mark weil 's murder is surrounded by mystery .
according to sources in tashkent , shortly before his death mark weil was threatened by the security services and told to soften the content of one of his plays .
he refused .
his murder coincided with the re-election of president islam karimov , who ran for office despite the fact that his last constitutional term had already expired .
across the country security was on high alert and ready to prevent any sort of outburst of public discontent ahead of the vote .
the investigation into mark 's killing focused heavily on his personal life but the perpetrators of his murder have never been found .
except for a short obituary , his death received no coverage in the state controlled media .
the uzbek embassy in london did not reply to the bbc 's request for comment .
the show goes on at ilkhom they are now learning to live without their director .
a core group of actors are running the theatre , looking for money and guest directors from overseas to stage new plays .
the shows are going on , as are lessons , rehearsals and tours . "
no matter what happens we are opening the season tomorrow " mark weil , director but as busy and upbeat as they try to sound , the future looks neither bright nor certain .
mark weil 's last production was his biggest project .
the oresteia - a trilogy of greek plays by aeschylus - was a tale of death and blood in which a hugely creative fusion of verse , rock music , stunning costumes , and video art put across an unmistakable message .
blood can only generate more blood .
as they finished the last rehearsal of the oresteia mark weil , tired and frustrated , told his actors " no matter what happens , we are opening the season tomorrow . "
that was 6 september and later that night he was stabbed to death outside his house .
on 7 september his defiant troupe opened the new season .
" i do n't know how we played that night .
and i do n't have words to describe it " says marina turpisheva " all throughout the rehearsals mark kept telling us that we did not feel the depth of the tragedy of the oresteia .
well , on the 7th , we felt the depth of the tragedy " .

but many questions are still unanswered .
just off one of tashkent 's leafy boulevards , deep in the basement of a concrete soviet-era building , hides a small theatre called ilkhom , which in uzbek means inspiration .
a fragile glass door is all that separates it from the harsh reality of one of central asia 's most repressive states .
mark weil was stabbed to death in september 2007 but inside the spacious lobby and amid the dark corridors of its backstage none of the outside rules seem to apply .
for more than 30 years , ilkhom , which was the soviet union 's first independent theatre , produced a countless number of thought-provoking and controversial plays which forced people to question the reality that reigned beyond the theatre 's door .
but last september its founder and director , mark weil , was killed while returning home from a rehearsal .
" this country has lost the best ambassador of good things in uzbekistan , " says peter burkhard , the swiss ambassador in tashkent who - like many - believes that clues to mark weil 's unsolved murder lie in his plays .
" ilkhom theatre is the only place in tashkent where some thinking is going on .
the rest of the country is just affirming , stating , showing off , but there is no reflection . "
a small act of defiance in the predominantly muslim uzbekistan there are no opposition parties and no free media .
foreign journalists are not welcome and different opinion is rarely tolerated .
the very existence of mark weil 's theatre was a small act of defiance .
" several years ago , for some reason , police banned christmas trees from all theatres and everyone obeyed .
but here we just hung it upside down from the ceiling , " laughs maxim tumenev , one of ilkhom 's actors .
maxim , like most in ilkhom 's 30 strong troupe , is a graduate of mark weil 's drama school .
set up in the 1990s , its rigorously competitive three year programme quickly began drawing students from far away .
" the school of mark weil is not just a school for actors .
it was a school for life .
here , he was developing very intelligent , very sensitive , very open individuals , " says tyler polumsky , an american from seattle , who initially came to uzbekistan for a three month course at ilkhom .
five years later he is still at the theatre , acting and coaching a new generation of students .
" mark taught us we could not be afraid , we could not watch our backs , that everything that came to our minds had legitimacy and deserved to be tried out , " adds marina turpisheva , who has been with the troupe for almost all of its 30 years .
changing world in the 1970s , when she first started rehearsing at ilkhom , tashkent - the soviet union 's fourth largest city - was home to dozens of nationalities .
being far away from moscow 's watchful eye gave mark weil a little more freedom to experiment and , although money was scarce and problems with the authorities were endless , ilkhom survived and grew .
this is art and we reflect the reality around us maxim tumenev , actor independence sent ilkhom travelling around the world .
but it failed to bring freedom to uzbekistan .
islam karimov , the country 's soviet-era boss , became its president .
the economy crumbled , political opponents were exiled or jailed , and thousands of people left the capital stripping tashkent of its best and brightest .
mark weil watched as the cosmopolitan , vibrant place he loved shrank .
as the city changed , so did his repertoire .
he started to focus more on uzbek culture .
in his plays he talked about islam and homosexuality .
he challenged convention and mocked the ridiculousness of those in power .
" this is art and we reflect the reality around us , " says maxim tumenev .
mark weil 's later productions started to focus on uzbek society " it was never mark 's goal to be political or to oppose anyone .
he simply reflected the reality around us . "
mark weil 's murder is surrounded by mystery .
according to sources in tashkent , shortly before his death mark weil was threatened by the security services and told to soften the content of one of his plays .
he refused .
his murder coincided with the re-election of president islam karimov , who ran for office despite the fact that his last constitutional term had already expired .
across the country security was on high alert and ready to prevent any sort of outburst of public discontent ahead of the vote .
the investigation into mark 's killing focused heavily on his personal life but the perpetrators of his murder have never been found .
except for a short obituary , his death received no coverage in the state controlled media .
the uzbek embassy in london did not reply to the bbc 's request for comment .
the show goes on at ilkhom they are now learning to live without their director .
a core group of actors are running the theatre , looking for money and guest directors from overseas to stage new plays .
the shows are going on , as are lessons , rehearsals and tours .
no matter what happens we are opening the season tomorrow mark weil , director but as busy and upbeat as they try to sound , the future looks neither bright nor certain .
mark weil 's last production was his biggest project .
the oresteia - a trilogy of greek plays by aeschylus - was a tale of death and blood in which a hugely creative fusion of verse , rock music , stunning costumes , and video art put across an unmistakable message .
blood can only generate more blood .
as they finished the last rehearsal of the oresteia mark weil , tired and frustrated , told his actors " no matter what happens , we are opening the season tomorrow . "
that was 6 september and later that night he was stabbed to death outside his house .
on 7 september his defiant troupe opened the new season .
" i do n't know how we played that night .
and i do n't have words to describe it " says marina turpisheva " all throughout the rehearsals mark kept telling us that we did not feel the depth of the tragedy of the oresteia .
well , on the 7th , we felt the depth of the tragedy " .

but many questions are still unanswered .
just off one of tashkent 's leafy boulevards , deep in the basement of a concrete soviet-era building , hides a small theatre called ilkhom , which in uzbek means inspiration .
a fragile glass door is all that separates it from the harsh reality of one of central asia 's most repressive states .
mark weil was stabbed to death in september 2007 but inside the spacious lobby and amid the dark corridors of its backstage none of the outside rules seem to apply .
for more than 30 years , ilkhom , which was the soviet union 's first independent theatre , produced a countless number of thought-provoking and controversial plays which forced people to question the reality that reigned beyond the theatre 's door .
but last september its founder and director , mark weil , was killed while returning home from a rehearsal .
" this country has lost the best ambassador of good things in uzbekistan , " says peter burkhard , the swiss ambassador in tashkent who - like many - believes that clues to mark weil 's unsolved murder lie in his plays .
" ilkhom theatre is the only place in tashkent where some thinking is going on .
the rest of the country is just affirming , stating , showing off , but there is no reflection . "
a small act of defiance in the predominantly muslim uzbekistan there are no opposition parties and no free media .
foreign journalists are not welcome and different opinion is rarely tolerated .
the very existence of mark weil 's theatre was a small act of defiance .
" several years ago , for some reason , police banned christmas trees from all theatres and everyone obeyed .
but here we just hung it upside down from the ceiling , " laughs maxim tumenev , one of ilkhom 's actors .
maxim , like most in ilkhom 's 30 strong troupe , is a graduate of mark weil 's drama school .
set up in the 1990s , its rigorously competitive three year programme quickly began drawing students from far away .
" the school of mark weil is not just a school for actors .
it was a school for life .
here , he was developing very intelligent , very sensitive , very open individuals , " says tyler polumsky , an american from seattle , who initially came to uzbekistan for a three month course at ilkhom .
five years later he is still at the theatre , acting and coaching a new generation of students .
" mark taught us we could not be afraid , we could not watch our backs , that everything that came to our minds had legitimacy and deserved to be tried out , " adds marina turpisheva , who has been with the troupe for almost all of its 30 years .
changing world in the 1970s , when she first started rehearsing at ilkhom , tashkent - the soviet union 's fourth largest city - was home to dozens of nationalities .
being far away from moscow 's watchful eye gave mark weil a little more freedom to experiment and , although money was scarce and problems with the authorities were endless , ilkhom survived and grew .
this is art and we reflect the reality around us maxim tumenev , actor independence sent ilkhom travelling around the world .
but it failed to bring freedom to uzbekistan .
islam karimov , the country 's soviet-era boss , became its president .
the economy crumbled , political opponents were exiled or jailed , and thousands of people left the capital stripping tashkent of its best and brightest .
mark weil watched as the cosmopolitan , vibrant place he loved shrank .
as the city changed , so did his repertoire .
he started to focus more on uzbek culture .
in his plays he talked about islam and homosexuality .
he challenged convention and mocked the ridiculousness of those in power .
" this is art and we reflect the reality around us , " says maxim tumenev .
mark weil 's later productions started to focus on uzbek society " it was never mark 's goal to be political or to oppose anyone .
he simply reflected the reality around us . "
mark weil 's murder is surrounded by mystery .
according to sources in tashkent , shortly before his death mark weil was threatened by the security services and told to soften the content of one of his plays .
he refused .
his murder coincided with the re-election of president islam karimov , who ran for office despite the fact that his last constitutional term had already expired .
across the country security was on high alert and ready to prevent any sort of outburst of public discontent ahead of the vote .
the investigation into mark 's killing focused heavily on his personal life but the perpetrators of his murder have never been found .
except for a short obituary , his death received no coverage in the state controlled media .
the uzbek embassy in london did not reply to the bbc 's request for comment .
the show goes on at ilkhom they are now learning to live without their director .
a core group of actors are running the theatre , looking for money and guest directors from overseas to stage new plays .
the shows are going on , as are lessons , rehearsals and tours .
no matter what happens we are opening the season tomorrow mark weil , director but as busy and upbeat as they try to sound , the future looks neither bright nor certain .
mark weil 's last production was his biggest project .
the oresteia - a trilogy of greek plays by aeschylus - was a tale of death and blood in which a hugely creative fusion of verse , rock music , stunning costumes , and video art put across an unmistakable message .
blood can only generate more blood .
as they finished the last rehearsal of the oresteia mark weil , tired and frustrated , told his actors " no matter what happens , we are opening the season tomorrow . "
that was 6 september and later that night he was stabbed to death outside his house .
on 7 september his defiant troupe opened the new season .
" i do n't know how we played that night .
and i do n't have words to describe it " says marina turpisheva " all throughout the rehearsals mark kept telling us that we did not feel the depth of the tragedy of the oresteia .
well , on the 7th , we felt the depth of the tragedy " .
crossing continents reports on ilkhom on bbc radio 4 on thursday 3 april at 1100 bst , repeated monday 7 april at 2030 bst .

police officers first raided the ranch after reports that a 16-year-old girl was physically and sexually abused .
detectives are looking for evidence of a marriage between the girl and a 50-year-old man .
she is thought to have had a child when she was 15 .
the sect is led by polygamist warren jeffs , jailed as an accomplice to rape .
under texan law , girls younger than 16 can not marry , even with parental approval .
search continues texas child protective services have now removed 137 children and 46 women , who are being questioned .
spokeswoman marleigh meisner said they were doing fine and that officials remained at the ranch looking for more children .
it was not clear whether the girl who sparked the search was still at the compound or was among those removed and had not been identified .
officials have also been authorised to remove computer hard drives , cds , dvds and photos .
ms meisner was unable to say whether the women and children had left voluntarily .
local news reports said shelters had been set up for them .
the authorities said that none of the 52 women and girls picked up in initial raids would be returning to the ranch .
eighteen of them were at risk of further abuse and would remain in state custody , they said .

based in a former church in cardiff bay , the point , was served with a notice asking for noise to be kept to a minimum by cardiff council in november .
the point is appealing against the notice , prompted by a local resident 's complaint , in court next month .
if rejected the point may be fined £ 20,000 prompting fears it would close .
the venue , housed in a gothic-style church which is 108-years-old , is situated in mount stuart square and is surrounded mainly by offices and several new flats have been developed in buildings nearby .
the point says it is doing everything it can to resolve the issue and has appealed for support from music lovers in the city .
an online petition has been set up which so far has collected more than 600 signatures . "
it is not uncommon for acts arriving at the point to be over awed by the building and its magnificent stain glassed windows " music promoter john rostron one of the signatories james wise said the point was one of the reasons he moved to cardiff bay .
" i live opposite the venue and the music is never too loud .
there 's never any trouble either , " he said .
another , rhys davies argued the loss of the point " would seriously impact live music and culture in general in cardiff " .
since becoming a live music venue in 2003 , the point has staged concerts by up and coming musicians as well as well-established acts like manic street preachers , cerys matthews , super furry animals , candi staton and athlete .
john rostron , whose company plugtwo promotes the venue , said a city like cardiff needed a network of live venues to develop acts .
he added that losing the point after the recent closure of two other live music venues - the toucan club and the coal exchange - would destroy the capacity for live music in cardiff and would have a knock on effect for other smaller venues which had benefited from the point 's success .
" if live agents know there is a mid sized venue like the point to send their bands on their way up to play the much larger students union and maybe one day the cardiff international arena , then many more bands get shows in cardiff at smaller venues , " he said .
" in the uk you just do n't get venues that are as beautiful as the point .
" it is not uncommon for acts arriving at the point to be over-awed by the building and its magnificent stain glassed windows . "
the point 's owner richard jones did not want to comment because of the pending legal proceedings .
a cardiff council spokeswoman said : " we are continuing to monitor compliance of the abatement notice and are unable to comment any further at this point in time . "

based in a former church in cardiff bay , the point , was served with a notice asking for noise to be kept to a minimum by cardiff council in november .
the point is appealing against the notice , prompted by a local resident 's complaint , in court next month .
if rejected the point may be fined £ 20,000 prompting fears it would close .
the venue , housed in a gothic-style church which is 108-years-old , is situated in mount stuart square and is surrounded mainly by offices and several new flats have been developed in buildings nearby .
the point says it is doing everything it can to resolve the issue and has appealed for support from music lovers in the city .
an online petition has been set up which so far has collected more than 600 signatures .
it is not uncommon for acts arriving at the point to be over awed by the building and its magnificent stain glassed windows music promoter john rostron one of the signatories james wise said the point was one of the reasons he moved to cardiff bay .
" i live opposite the venue and the music is never too loud .
there 's never any trouble either , " he said .
another , rhys davies argued the loss of the point " would seriously impact live music and culture in general in cardiff " .
since becoming a live music venue in 2003 , the point has staged concerts by up and coming musicians as well as well-established acts like manic street preachers , cerys matthews , super furry animals , candi staton and athlete .
john rostron , whose company plugtwo promotes the venue , said a city like cardiff needed a network of live venues to develop acts .
super furry animals have played at the venue he added that losing the point after the recent closure of two other live music venues - the toucan club and the coal exchange - would destroy the capacity for live music in cardiff and would have a knock on effect for other smaller venues which had benefited from the point 's success .
" if live agents know there is a mid sized venue like the point to send their bands on their way up to play the much larger students union and maybe one day the cardiff international arena , then many more bands get shows in cardiff at smaller venues , " he said .
" in the uk you just do n't get venues that are as beautiful as the point .
" it is not uncommon for acts arriving at the point to be over-awed by the building and its magnificent stain glassed windows . "
the point 's owner richard jones did not want to comment because of the pending legal proceedings .
a cardiff council spokeswoman said : " we are continuing to monitor compliance of the abatement notice and are unable to comment any further at this point in time . "

according to the health and safety executive -lrb- hse -rrb- 24 workers were killed and 2,702 people were seriously injured at their workplace in the year 2006/7 .
new corporate homicide legislation is introduced on sunday but the scottish trades union congress -lrb- stuc -rrb- already has concerns .
it said workers have been let down by holyrood and westminster .
the new act aims to tackle organisations in which standards have fallen far below what could have been reasonably expected .

this legislation will not allow for prosecution of individuals but only of the company " grahame smith stuc an organisation found guilty of the new offence will be liable to an unlimited fine , possibly up to 10 % of annual turnover averaged over the previous three years .
stuc general secretary grahame smith said : " trade unions have fought and campaigned for over a decade for laws to be brought in that deliver justice for families who needlessly lose loved ones as a result of negligent decisions and poor working practices taken and implemented by company directors and senior management .
" while this legislation is being peddled as the machinery to deliver that justice for bereaved families , it is clear that the governments in both westminster and in holyrood have let down the families of workers killed by their employers .
" this legislation will not allow for prosecution of individuals but only of the company .
even then , only if the failures of a senior manager can be identified " .
mr smith said that for the stuc , and the victim 's families , this was a fudge of the " controlling mind " test that had made the prosecution of companies so difficult in the past " .
figures for scotland also reveal that seven self employed people died in work place accidents in 2006/7 and 73 were seriously injured .

new corporate homicide legislation is introduced on sunday but the scottish trades union congress -lrb- stuc -rrb- already has concerns .
it said workers have been let down by holyrood and westminster .
the new act aims to tackle organisations in which standards have fallen far below what could have been reasonably expected .
although individuals will not be liable under the new law , prosecutions for corporate homicide will look into management systems and practices across the organisation in question .
this legislation will not allow for prosecution of individuals but only of the company grahame smith stuc an organisation found guilty of the new offence will be liable to an unlimited fine , possibly up to 10 % of annual turnover averaged over the previous three years .
stuc general secretary grahame smith said : " trade unions have fought and campaigned for over a decade for laws to be brought in that deliver justice for families who needlessly lose loved ones as a result of negligent decisions and poor working practices taken and implemented by company directors and senior management .
" while this legislation is being peddled as the machinery to deliver that justice for bereaved families , it is clear that the governments in both westminster and in holyrood have let down the families of workers killed by their employers .
" this legislation will not allow for prosecution of individuals but only of the company .
even then , only if the failures of a senior manager can be identified " .
mr smith said that for the stuc , and the victim 's families , this was a fudge of the " controlling mind " test that had made the prosecution of companies so difficult in the past " .
figures for scotland also reveal that seven self employed people died in work place accidents in 2006/7 and 73 were seriously injured .
