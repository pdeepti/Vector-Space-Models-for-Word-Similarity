he managed the company 's us operations from 2002 to 2003 and became ceo in 2005 .
he resigned in 2007 over siemens ' slush fund affair despite having no personal responsibility for the scandal .
in october 2007 , he became chief operating officer at us company alcoa , the world 's second largest producer of aluminum . dw : how are the commodity markets shaping up in light of the current stock and financial market crisis ? bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : klaus kleinfeld klaus kleinfeld : commodity markets are very strongly driven by china 's and asia 's industrialization .
raw materials are needed there because these countries have relatively little of them .
population growth and industrialization are driving forces and that 's going to continue to be the case . the big question is how strong growth will be .
i 'm convinced that this will depend on chances for growth in the developed countries .
but it will still be stronger and better despite of it all .
that 's why the scarcity of raw materials will continue since they 'll continue to be in high demand .
that 's positive news for alcoa . why ?
because prices will remain on a high level with continuing strong demand ? it 's a growth business and i 'm saying that prices will develop in a positive , stable way . which markets are up and coming ?
what role does africa play ? bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : africa remains mainly interesting because of its raw materials africa is definitely an issue .
africa continues to be more of an issue in terms of delivering raw materials rather than using them .
i sincerely hope that africa , which has long been called a forgotten continent , will strongly profit from this and experience a stronger industrialization .
this can already be very much seen in south africa and in some northern african countries . here in davos , people are talking intensively behind the scenes about continuing talks on global free trade .
at the same time , there 's currently a global trend - also in europe and germany - to protect markets .
do you think that 's a good thing ? no , i think it 's missing the point .
i believe that there 's nothing that has contributed and led to global wealth over the past 20 years more than the opening of markets .
germany especially profited from this as an export-oriented country - probably more than most others .
that 's why people would hurt themselves with this .
one can only hope that these trends wo n't take over . what can be done to overcome the current economic crisis ? i think the recipe is always the same .
competitiveness has to be fostered , including an increased flexibility and people have to be careful to stay on a course of innovation .
that 's always been - and will hopefully always be - one of the greatest strengths of the german economy .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de economy -pipe- 25.01.2008 former siemens ceo : open markets bring global wealth großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : germany should open , rather than close , its doors to the global economy in an interview with deutsche welle on the sidelines of the world economic forum in davos , former siemens ceo klaus kleinfeld talked about a global hunger for raw materials and ways out of the current market crisis . klaus kleinfeld began his career at the swiss company ciba-geigy before joining german technology giant siemens in 1987 .
he managed the company 's us operations from 2002 to 2003 and became ceo in 2005 .
he resigned in 2007 over siemens ' slush fund affair despite having no personal responsibility for the scandal .
in october 2007 , he became chief operating officer at us company alcoa , the world 's second largest producer of aluminum . dw : how are the commodity markets shaping up in light of the current stock and financial market crisis ? bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : klaus kleinfeld klaus kleinfeld : commodity markets are very strongly driven by china 's and asia 's industrialization .
raw materials are needed there because these countries have relatively little of them .
population growth and industrialization are driving forces and that 's going to continue to be the case . the big question is how strong growth will be .
i 'm convinced that this will depend on chances for growth in the developed countries .
but it will still be stronger and better despite of it all .
that 's why the scarcity of raw materials will continue since they 'll continue to be in high demand .
that 's positive news for alcoa . why ?
because prices will remain on a high level with continuing strong demand ? it 's a growth business and i 'm saying that prices will develop in a positive , stable way . which markets are up and coming ?
what role does africa play ? bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : africa remains mainly interesting because of its raw materials africa is definitely an issue .
africa continues to be more of an issue in terms of delivering raw materials rather than using them .
i sincerely hope that africa , which has long been called a forgotten continent , will strongly profit from this and experience a stronger industrialization .
this can already be very much seen in south africa and in some northern african countries . here in davos , people are talking intensively behind the scenes about continuing talks on global free trade .
at the same time , there 's currently a global trend - also in europe and germany - to protect markets .
do you think that 's a good thing ? no , i think it 's missing the point .
i believe that there 's nothing that has contributed and led to global wealth over the past 20 years more than the opening of markets .
germany especially profited from this as an export-oriented country - probably more than most others .
that 's why people would hurt themselves with this .
one can only hope that these trends wo n't take over . what can be done to overcome the current economic crisis ? i think the recipe is always the same .
competitiveness has to be fostered , including an increased flexibility and people have to be careful to stay on a course of innovation .
that 's always been - and will hopefully always be - one of the greatest strengths of the german economy .
but needless to say , you ca n't completely separate that from costs and the challenges that come with it . interview : marco vollmar -lrb- win -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

he managed the company 's us operations from 2002 to 2003 and became ceo in 2005 .
he resigned in 2007 over siemens ' slush fund affair despite having no personal responsibility for the scandal .
in october 2007 , he became chief operating officer at us company alcoa , the world 's second largest producer of aluminum . dw : how are the commodity markets shaping up in light of the current stock and financial market crisis ? bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : klaus kleinfeld klaus kleinfeld : commodity markets are very strongly driven by china 's and asia 's industrialization .
raw materials are needed there because these countries have relatively little of them .
population growth and industrialization are driving forces and that 's going to continue to be the case . the big question is how strong growth will be .
i 'm convinced that this will depend on chances for growth in the developed countries .
but it will still be stronger and better despite of it all .
that 's why the scarcity of raw materials will continue since they 'll continue to be in high demand .
that 's positive news for alcoa . why ?
because prices will remain on a high level with continuing strong demand ? it 's a growth business and i 'm saying that prices will develop in a positive , stable way . which markets are up and coming ?
what role does africa play ? bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : africa remains mainly interesting because of its raw materials africa is definitely an issue .
africa continues to be more of an issue in terms of delivering raw materials rather than using them .
i sincerely hope that africa , which has long been called a forgotten continent , will strongly profit from this and experience a stronger industrialization .
this can already be very much seen in south africa and in some northern african countries . here in davos , people are talking intensively behind the scenes about continuing talks on global free trade .
at the same time , there 's currently a global trend - also in europe and germany - to protect markets .
do you think that 's a good thing ? no , i think it 's missing the point .
i believe that there 's nothing that has contributed and led to global wealth over the past 20 years more than the opening of markets .
germany especially profited from this as an export-oriented country - probably more than most others .
that 's why people would hurt themselves with this .
one can only hope that these trends wo n't take over . what can be done to overcome the current economic crisis ? i think the recipe is always the same .
competitiveness has to be fostered , including an increased flexibility and people have to be careful to stay on a course of innovation .
that 's always been - and will hopefully always be - one of the greatest strengths of the german economy .
but needless to say , you ca n't completely separate that from costs and the challenges that come with it . interview : marco vollmar -lrb- win -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

25 , to pass a gene technology law , while last week saw the introduction of a new non-gm label .
consumers are under the impression that gm food has become an unavoidable fact of life . just how many of the products on germany supermarket shelves are genetically modified ?
both skeptics and supporters of gene technology like to make out that gm crops are everywhere .
to the former , this would be an argument for introducing stricter regulations , for the latter , proof that gene technology is safe , increases production and lowers the cost of food . in fact , even though a not inconsiderable amount of agricultural land is earmarked for gm crops , the critics ' prediction that they would take over the world is greatly exaggerated .
just 6 percent - 102 million hectares - of agricultural land around the world produces gm crops . germany had just 2,700 hectares given over to gm crops in 2007 , which amounts to less than 0.1 percent of its entire agricultural land . european reservations bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : some argue that gene technology promises higher yields it 's a different story in the us , which devotes 55 million hectares of farmland to gm crops .
canada , argentina , brazil , china and india are also enthusiastic advocates of genetic modification . europe is less keen .
this stems partly from legal restrictions but also has to do with agricultural structures . " use of genetically modified seed is only worth it in regions where the fields are very large , because it is so expensive , " said heike moldenhauer from friends of the earth germany .
in these cases , the fact that gm crops are highly resistant to pests and damage reduces the chances of a failed harvest .
with smaller fields , these advantages are less crucial . the same principle applies in germany .
gm crops are grown almost exclusively in the former east germany , where fields are larger than they are in the western part of the country .
according to statistics compiled by the german office for consumer protection and food safety , the highest proportion of gm crops care to be found in brandenburg , saxony and mecklenburg-western pommerania . germany permits the import of gm crops , but only monsanto 's modified corn seed mon 810 may be grown in the european union .
other gm seed is used all over the world , including corn , rapeseed , cotton and soybean . allying consumer fears bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : consumers want to make informed choices nonetheless , 80 percent of the genetically modified products cultivated by the world 's farmers rarely end up directly in the consumers ' kitchens .
the bulk of it is used for animal feed after brussels banned use of processed animal protein in animal feed and european farmers largely switched to low-cost gm soybean . ultimately , consumers determined to avoid gm food should steer clear of animal products such as milk , meat and eggs .
but they can rest assured that the remaining 20 percent of gm crops being grown are destined for t-shirts and jeans .
for the time being , there are still plenty of alternatives to genetically modified tomatoes and potatoes in germany 's supermarkets . leila knüppel -lrb- jp -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

he managed the company 's us operations from 2002 to 2003 and became ceo in 2005 .
he resigned in 2007 over siemens ' slush fund affair despite having no personal responsibility for the scandal .
in october 2007 , he became chief operating officer at us company alcoa , the world 's second largest producer of aluminum . dw : how are the commodity markets shaping up in light of the current stock and financial market crisis ? bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : klaus kleinfeld klaus kleinfeld : commodity markets are very strongly driven by china 's and asia 's industrialization .
raw materials are needed there because these countries have relatively little of them .
population growth and industrialization are driving forces and that 's going to continue to be the case . the big question is how strong growth will be .
i 'm convinced that this will depend on chances for growth in the developed countries .
but it will still be stronger and better despite of it all .
that 's why the scarcity of raw materials will continue since they 'll continue to be in high demand .
that 's positive news for alcoa . why ?
because prices will remain on a high level with continuing strong demand ? it 's a growth business and i 'm saying that prices will develop in a positive , stable way . which markets are up and coming ?
what role does africa play ? bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : africa remains mainly interesting because of its raw materials africa is definitely an issue .
africa continues to be more of an issue in terms of delivering raw materials rather than using them .
i sincerely hope that africa , which has long been called a forgotten continent , will strongly profit from this and experience a stronger industrialization .
this can already be very much seen in south africa and in some northern african countries . here in davos , people are talking intensively behind the scenes about continuing talks on global free trade .
at the same time , there 's currently a global trend - also in europe and germany - to protect markets .
do you think that 's a good thing ? no , i think it 's missing the point .
i believe that there 's nothing that has contributed and led to global wealth over the past 20 years more than the opening of markets .
germany especially profited from this as an export-oriented country - probably more than most others .
that 's why people would hurt themselves with this .
one can only hope that these trends wo n't take over . what can be done to overcome the current economic crisis ? i think the recipe is always the same .
competitiveness has to be fostered , including an increased flexibility and people have to be careful to stay on a course of innovation .
that 's always been - and will hopefully always be - one of the greatest strengths of the german economy .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de agriculture -pipe- 25.01.2008 consumers concerned by new gene technology law großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : consumers have a choice between gm and conventional products the bundestag is set friday , jan .
25 , to pass a gene technology law , while last week saw the introduction of a new non-gm label .
consumers are under the impression that gm food has become an unavoidable fact of life . just how many of the products on germany supermarket shelves are genetically modified ?
both skeptics and supporters of gene technology like to make out that gm crops are everywhere .
to the former , this would be an argument for introducing stricter regulations , for the latter , proof that gene technology is safe , increases production and lowers the cost of food . in fact , even though a not inconsiderable amount of agricultural land is earmarked for gm crops , the critics ' prediction that they would take over the world is greatly exaggerated .
just 6 percent - 102 million hectares - of agricultural land around the world produces gm crops . germany had just 2,700 hectares given over to gm crops in 2007 , which amounts to less than 0.1 percent of its entire agricultural land . european reservations bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : some argue that gene technology promises higher yields it 's a different story in the us , which devotes 55 million hectares of farmland to gm crops .
canada , argentina , brazil , china and india are also enthusiastic advocates of genetic modification . europe is less keen .
this stems partly from legal restrictions but also has to do with agricultural structures . " use of genetically modified seed is only worth it in regions where the fields are very large , because it is so expensive , " said heike moldenhauer from friends of the earth germany .
in these cases , the fact that gm crops are highly resistant to pests and damage reduces the chances of a failed harvest .
with smaller fields , these advantages are less crucial . the same principle applies in germany .
gm crops are grown almost exclusively in the former east germany , where fields are larger than they are in the western part of the country .
according to statistics compiled by the german office for consumer protection and food safety , the highest proportion of gm crops care to be found in brandenburg , saxony and mecklenburg-western pommerania . germany permits the import of gm crops , but only monsanto 's modified corn seed mon 810 may be grown in the european union .
other gm seed is used all over the world , including corn , rapeseed , cotton and soybean . allying consumer fears bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : consumers want to make informed choices nonetheless , 80 percent of the genetically modified products cultivated by the world 's farmers rarely end up directly in the consumers ' kitchens .
the bulk of it is used for animal feed after brussels banned use of processed animal protein in animal feed and european farmers largely switched to low-cost gm soybean . ultimately , consumers determined to avoid gm food should steer clear of animal products such as milk , meat and eggs .
but they can rest assured that the remaining 20 percent of gm crops being grown are destined for t-shirts and jeans .
for the time being , there are still plenty of alternatives to genetically modified tomatoes and potatoes in germany 's supermarkets . leila knüppel -lrb- jp -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?
dw-world.de berlin agrees on new gm labeling law - but how strict is it ?

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de society -pipe- 25.01.2008 former chancellor helmut schmidt sets bad example by smoking großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : helmut and loki - even their doctors tell them not to stop nothing , it seems , can induce former chancellor helmut schmidt to quit smoking .
not even the new german law banning tobacco in public buildings .
anti-smoking advocates are not amused and are pressing charges . " anyone who does n't read is an idiot , " said former chancellor helmut schmidt in an interview for die zeit 's weekly magazine leben on thursday , jan .
24 . but however many books the very learned schmidt might have read , he certainly does n't seem to be good at reading germany 's new and very visible no smoking signs . his remark was issued the same week that prosecutors in hamburg began investigating him for lighting up in the lobby of the komödie winterhuder fährhaus theater just hours after the controversial smoking ban came into force on january 1 . yet another controversy bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : schmidt in the days when everyone smoked hailing from a time when cigarettes were easily the least pernicious of politicans ' preferred poisons , schmidt would never have predicted the impact a quick smoke could have in this health-conscious age . but then the indomitable elder statesman of german politics was snapped by the mass circulation bild newspaper blithely puffing away at a reception with his wife , childhood sweetheart loki . and before he knew it , he was at the heart of a controversy at least as divisive as his policies on the soviet invasion of afghanistan back in the late 1970s . bodily harm ? bild has reported that the schmidts might even face bodily harm charges .
according to the german criminal code , " anyone who physically abuses someone else or damages their health can be given a suspended sentence of up to five years or be punished with a financial penalty . " in fact , helmut schmidt 's recalcitrance is hardly a surprise .
a dedicated smoker throughout his career , schmidt is still seldom photographed without a cigarette even as he approaches his 90s .
interviews are generally conducted amid a thick cloud of smoke and changing public attitudes have done nothing to curb his enthusiasm . nicknamed schmidt-schnauze -lrb- sassy schmidt -rrb- for his sharp tongue and ready wit , the former politician famed for never following the crowd is the last person likely to give up a lifetime 's habit simply because it has fallen out of fashion . during his years in office between 1974 and 1982 , schmidt weathered political turbulence ranging from the international oil crisis to the terrorism of the baader-meinhof era .
cigarette smoking never seemed to get in the way of his political duties . dismissal likely rüdiger bagger , a prosecutions spokesman in hamburg , confirmed the complaint had been received , but said the docket would be most likely be dismissed . " smoking is definitely damaging to the health , but there 's no evidence mr and mrs schmidt committed assault , " he said . hamburg has already announced that its bylaws department will not start imposing misdemeanour fines on smokers till march , so the complaint seems unlikely to have any legal consequences . unpopular motion germany implemented the ban on smoking in bars and restaurants across most of the country on jan .
1 . the new law has not gone down well in a nation long considered a smoker 's haven .
it has been suggested that the move has met with more resistance here than in other cigarette-loving nations such as france and italy because of the long shadow cast by the country 's past .
one of germany 's most fervent anti-smokers was hitler , who cracked down on the habit during the third reich . in fact , the ban in germany is more lenient than those imposed in other western european nations in recent years as restaurants in the country will be allowed to provide separate smoking rooms . bad example bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : still ignored by many the case against the rebellious schmidts was brought by anti-smoking activists in the western city of wiesbaden . " they were recklessly smoking in public and someone like mr schmidt should know better - he is setting a very bad example , so we launched legal proceedings , " activist horst keiser told reuters . " how can children and young people be expected to grasp that laws must be respected when even a statesman like helmut schmidt ignores them ? " keiser said he wanted the schmidts to be fined a few thousand euros and for the money to be donated to a children 's charity .
he also wanted them to stop smoking in public . " a lot of people think , look at him , he 's 89 and still going strong , how bad can smoking be , " he added .
" but no one realizes that in fact he 's had four bypasses and has a pacemaker . " according to the hamburger morgenpost , however , loki schmidt says that she and her husband have no intention of quitting . " even our doctors have advised us against it , " she maintains .
" they say it would be too stressful for our bodies . " dw staff -lrb- jp -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de society -pipe- 25.01.2008 former chancellor helmut schmidt sets bad example by smoking großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : helmut and loki - even their doctors tell them not to stop nothing , it seems , can induce former chancellor helmut schmidt to quit smoking .
not even the new german law banning tobacco in public buildings .
anti-smoking advocates are not amused and are pressing charges . " anyone who does n't read is an idiot , " said former chancellor helmut schmidt in an interview for die zeit 's weekly magazine leben on thursday , jan .
24 . but however many books the very learned schmidt might have read , he certainly does n't seem to be good at reading germany 's new and very visible no smoking signs . his remark was issued the same week that prosecutors in hamburg began investigating him for lighting up in the lobby of the komödie winterhuder fährhaus theater just hours after the controversial smoking ban came into force on january 1 . yet another controversy bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : schmidt in the days when everyone smoked hailing from a time when cigarettes were easily the least pernicious of politicans ' preferred poisons , schmidt would never have predicted the impact a quick smoke could have in this health-conscious age . but then the indomitable elder statesman of german politics was snapped by the mass circulation bild newspaper blithely puffing away at a reception with his wife , childhood sweetheart loki . and before he knew it , he was at the heart of a controversy at least as divisive as his policies on the soviet invasion of afghanistan back in the late 1970s . bodily harm ? bild has reported that the schmidts might even face bodily harm charges .
according to the german criminal code , " anyone who physically abuses someone else or damages their health can be given a suspended sentence of up to five years or be punished with a financial penalty . " in fact , helmut schmidt 's recalcitrance is hardly a surprise .
a dedicated smoker throughout his career , schmidt is still seldom photographed without a cigarette even as he approaches his 90s .
interviews are generally conducted amid a thick cloud of smoke and changing public attitudes have done nothing to curb his enthusiasm . nicknamed schmidt-schnauze -lrb- sassy schmidt -rrb- for his sharp tongue and ready wit , the former politician famed for never following the crowd is the last person likely to give up a lifetime 's habit simply because it has fallen out of fashion . during his years in office between 1974 and 1982 , schmidt weathered political turbulence ranging from the international oil crisis to the terrorism of the baader-meinhof era .
cigarette smoking never seemed to get in the way of his political duties . dismissal likely rüdiger bagger , a prosecutions spokesman in hamburg , confirmed the complaint had been received , but said the docket would be most likely be dismissed . " smoking is definitely damaging to the health , but there 's no evidence mr and mrs schmidt committed assault , " he said . hamburg has already announced that its bylaws department will not start imposing misdemeanour fines on smokers till march , so the complaint seems unlikely to have any legal consequences . unpopular motion germany implemented the ban on smoking in bars and restaurants across most of the country on jan .
1 . the new law has not gone down well in a nation long considered a smoker 's haven .

pleased with the state of things after opening borders in the european union 's eastern region , officials are considering an electronic entry and exit register designed to track down illegal immigrants . eu justice commissioner franco frattini said on friday , jan .
25 , that the register would be similar to the electronic scanning of fingerprints and eyes at us ports of entry .
he added that it would be part of a series of eu initiatives seeking to use modern technology to target overstayers - third-country nationals who enter the eu legally but then become illegal immigrants by extending their stay beyond their visa expiry date . frattini also wants to improve the bloc 's fight against illegal immigrants by replacing its current visa system with an electronic travel authorization -lrb- eta -rrb- . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : in the us , every visitor already gets fingerprinted and photographed the electronic visa , similar to one already in place in australia , would also include a traveler 's biometric data , such as electronic photos and fingerprints . " i will present in february a package of measures aimed at improving the capacity of the eu to protect its external borders , " frattini said at an informal meeting of eu justice and interior ministers in slovenia , the current holder of the bloc 's presidency . the package , which european commission sources said would be submitted to the eu executive on feb.13 , aimed to make a " better use of existing technology " , frattini said . hundreds of thousands of illegal immigrants live in the eu 's 27 member states . " one of the main problems we face now is overstayers - people who enter the eu legally and then disappear because they stay over the allowed period , " frattini said .
" this can not be tolerated .
overstayers are the factor number one of illegal immigration . " upbeat about schengen expansion managing overstayers has become an increasingly difficult task , particularly since december , when the eu expanded its borderless area to include nine new countries , most of them from eastern europe . the countries joined the so-called schengen agreement amid concerns that its expansion would make it easier for criminals and illegal immigrants to enter the bloc . such concerns have been felt particularly in germany , where there have been widespread reports about scores of chechen refugees with asylum status in poland crossing its eastern border . " none of the fears has come true , " said peter altmaier , state secretary at the german interior ministry .
" as far as we know , schengen is a big success . " eu justice commissioner franco frattini hailed the successes of the enlarged schengen area , noting that the program 's shared database on criminals had since lead to the arrest of " some 100 suspects " in the new member states . frattini added that the influx of chechen refugees into germany and austria showed that there was a pressing need for a common eu policy on asylum , another issue due to be debated by ministers in brdo , near the slovenian capital ljubljana . success or failure ? bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : german federal police now control people in a wide strip along the border slovenian interior minister dragutin mate , whose country currently holds the rotating eu presidency , also said that things looked very good .
he said that slovenian border patrol alone had confiscated 140 stolen vehicles and prevented 1,700 people on eu blacklists from entering the bloc . germany 's police union meanwhile on wednesday said that border patrols had stopped 564 foreigners without visa along germany 's borders with poland and the czech republic since border controls fell on dec .
21 , an increase of 150 percent when compared to the year before . altmaier conceded that more chechens had come to germany in the first two weeks after the border fell , but added that they had been returned to poland , the eu country they had first entered .
according to eu rules , asylum seekers are dealt with in the country they first enter . " these are normal procedures , " he said . debate on passenger data sharing bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : should the eu share passenger data ?
european union justice and interior ministers were also expected to discuss plans to share airline passengers ' data in a bid to prevent terrorists from entering the 27-member bloc . the so-called european passenger name record -lrb- pnr -rrb- would be modeled according to a similar system introduced by the united states in the aftermath of the sept .
11 , 2001 attacks . " terrorism remains the number one threat , " frattini said . frattini , who first floated the idea over the summer , said a european pnr was " absolutely necessary " and should therefore be adopted " as soon as possible . " but his plans have been met with resistance from civil liberties ' advocates , who fear that collecting details about a person 's travel arrangements in and out of the eu would violate their privacy . details about a traveler 's airline ticket , including how it was paid for , would be shared among all eu member states , as well as with third countries such as the us .
the eu insists it will not divulge sensitive information about a traveler 's ethnic origins or political and religious beliefs . dw staff -lrb- win -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

pleased with the state of things after opening borders in the european union 's eastern region , officials are considering an electronic entry and exit register designed to track down illegal immigrants . eu justice commissioner franco frattini said on friday , jan .
25 , that the register would be similar to the electronic scanning of fingerprints and eyes at us ports of entry .
he added that it would be part of a series of eu initiatives seeking to use modern technology to target overstayers - third-country nationals who enter the eu legally but then become illegal immigrants by extending their stay beyond their visa expiry date . frattini also wants to improve the bloc 's fight against illegal immigrants by replacing its current visa system with an electronic travel authorization -lrb- eta -rrb- . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : in the us , every visitor already gets fingerprinted and photographed the electronic visa , similar to one already in place in australia , would also include a traveler 's biometric data , such as electronic photos and fingerprints . " i will present in february a package of measures aimed at improving the capacity of the eu to protect its external borders , " frattini said at an informal meeting of eu justice and interior ministers in slovenia , the current holder of the bloc 's presidency . the package , which european commission sources said would be submitted to the eu executive on feb.13 , aimed to make a " better use of existing technology " , frattini said . hundreds of thousands of illegal immigrants live in the eu 's 27 member states . " one of the main problems we face now is overstayers - people who enter the eu legally and then disappear because they stay over the allowed period , " frattini said .
" this can not be tolerated .
overstayers are the factor number one of illegal immigration . " upbeat about schengen expansion managing overstayers has become an increasingly difficult task , particularly since december , when the eu expanded its borderless area to include nine new countries , most of them from eastern europe . the countries joined the so-called schengen agreement amid concerns that its expansion would make it easier for criminals and illegal immigrants to enter the bloc . such concerns have been felt particularly in germany , where there have been widespread reports about scores of chechen refugees with asylum status in poland crossing its eastern border . " none of the fears has come true , " said peter altmaier , state secretary at the german interior ministry .
" as far as we know , schengen is a big success . " eu justice commissioner franco frattini hailed the successes of the enlarged schengen area , noting that the program 's shared database on criminals had since lead to the arrest of " some 100 suspects " in the new member states . frattini added that the influx of chechen refugees into germany and austria showed that there was a pressing need for a common eu policy on asylum , another issue due to be debated by ministers in brdo , near the slovenian capital ljubljana . success or failure ? bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : german federal police now control people in a wide strip along the border slovenian interior minister dragutin mate , whose country currently holds the rotating eu presidency , also said that things looked very good .
he said that slovenian border patrol alone had confiscated 140 stolen vehicles and prevented 1,700 people on eu blacklists from entering the bloc . germany 's police union meanwhile on wednesday said that border patrols had stopped 564 foreigners without visa along germany 's borders with poland and the czech republic since border controls fell on dec .

not even the new german law banning tobacco in public buildings .
anti-smoking advocates are not amused and are pressing charges . " anyone who does n't read is an idiot , " said former chancellor helmut schmidt in an interview for die zeit 's weekly magazine leben on thursday , jan .
24 . but however many books the very learned schmidt might have read , he certainly does n't seem to be good at reading germany 's new and very visible no smoking signs . his remark was issued the same week that prosecutors in hamburg began investigating him for lighting up in the lobby of the komödie winterhuder fährhaus theater just hours after the controversial smoking ban came into force on january 1 . yet another controversy bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : schmidt in the days when everyone smoked hailing from a time when cigarettes were easily the least pernicious of politicans ' preferred poisons , schmidt would never have predicted the impact a quick smoke could have in this health-conscious age . but then the indomitable elder statesman of german politics was snapped by the mass circulation bild newspaper blithely puffing away at a reception with his wife , childhood sweetheart loki . and before he knew it , he was at the heart of a controversy at least as divisive as his policies on the soviet invasion of afghanistan back in the late 1970s . bodily harm ? bild has reported that the schmidts might even face bodily harm charges .
according to the german criminal code , " anyone who physically abuses someone else or damages their health can be given a suspended sentence of up to five years or be punished with a financial penalty . " in fact , helmut schmidt 's recalcitrance is hardly a surprise .
a dedicated smoker throughout his career , schmidt is still seldom photographed without a cigarette even as he approaches his 90s .

pleased with the state of things after opening borders in the european union 's eastern region , officials are considering an electronic entry and exit register designed to track down illegal immigrants . eu justice commissioner franco frattini said on friday , jan .
25 , that the register would be similar to the electronic scanning of fingerprints and eyes at us ports of entry .
he added that it would be part of a series of eu initiatives seeking to use modern technology to target overstayers - third-country nationals who enter the eu legally but then become illegal immigrants by extending their stay beyond their visa expiry date . frattini also wants to improve the bloc 's fight against illegal immigrants by replacing its current visa system with an electronic travel authorization -lrb- eta -rrb- . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : in the us , every visitor already gets fingerprinted and photographed the electronic visa , similar to one already in place in australia , would also include a traveler 's biometric data , such as electronic photos and fingerprints . " i will present in february a package of measures aimed at improving the capacity of the eu to protect its external borders , " frattini said at an informal meeting of eu justice and interior ministers in slovenia , the current holder of the bloc 's presidency . the package , which european commission sources said would be submitted to the eu executive on feb.13 , aimed to make a " better use of existing technology " , frattini said . hundreds of thousands of illegal immigrants live in the eu 's 27 member states . " one of the main problems we face now is overstayers - people who enter the eu legally and then disappear because they stay over the allowed period , " frattini said .
" this can not be tolerated .
overstayers are the factor number one of illegal immigration . " upbeat about schengen expansion managing overstayers has become an increasingly difficult task , particularly since december , when the eu expanded its borderless area to include nine new countries , most of them from eastern europe . the countries joined the so-called schengen agreement amid concerns that its expansion would make it easier for criminals and illegal immigrants to enter the bloc . such concerns have been felt particularly in germany , where there have been widespread reports about scores of chechen refugees with asylum status in poland crossing its eastern border . " none of the fears has come true , " said peter altmaier , state secretary at the german interior ministry .
" as far as we know , schengen is a big success . " eu justice commissioner franco frattini hailed the successes of the enlarged schengen area , noting that the program 's shared database on criminals had since lead to the arrest of " some 100 suspects " in the new member states . frattini added that the influx of chechen refugees into germany and austria showed that there was a pressing need for a common eu policy on asylum , another issue due to be debated by ministers in brdo , near the slovenian capital ljubljana . success or failure ? bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : german federal police now control people in a wide strip along the border slovenian interior minister dragutin mate , whose country currently holds the rotating eu presidency , also said that things looked very good .
he said that slovenian border patrol alone had confiscated 140 stolen vehicles and prevented 1,700 people on eu blacklists from entering the bloc . germany 's police union meanwhile on wednesday said that border patrols had stopped 564 foreigners without visa along germany 's borders with poland and the czech republic since border controls fell on dec .
21 , an increase of 150 percent when compared to the year before . altmaier conceded that more chechens had come to germany in the first two weeks after the border fell , but added that they had been returned to poland , the eu country they had first entered .
according to eu rules , asylum seekers are dealt with in the country they first enter . " these are normal procedures , " he said . debate on passenger data sharing bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : should the eu share passenger data ?
european union justice and interior ministers were also expected to discuss plans to share airline passengers ' data in a bid to prevent terrorists from entering the 27-member bloc . the so-called european passenger name record -lrb- pnr -rrb- would be modeled according to a similar system introduced by the united states in the aftermath of the sept .
11 , 2001 attacks . " terrorism remains the number one threat , " frattini said . frattini , who first floated the idea over the summer , said a european pnr was " absolutely necessary " and should therefore be adopted " as soon as possible . " but his plans have been met with resistance from civil liberties ' advocates , who fear that collecting details about a person 's travel arrangements in and out of the eu would violate their privacy . details about a traveler 's airline ticket , including how it was paid for , would be shared among all eu member states , as well as with third countries such as the us .
the eu insists it will not divulge sensitive information about a traveler 's ethnic origins or political and religious beliefs . dw staff -lrb- win -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de politics -pipe- 25.01.2008 expert : italy must reform its electoral system großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : fewer parties would help italy avoid political crises italy was thrown into crisis on thursday , jan .
24 , when prime minister prodi resigned after losing a senate confidence vote .
dw-world.de spoke to an italian expert about the need to reform the country 's electoral system . professor giovanni guzzetta is a lawyer and lectures in public law at rome 's tor vergata university .
he has been involved in organizing electoral referendums in italy since 1991 and is currently the president of the italian electoral referendum organizing committee . dw-world.de : how do the current italian electoral laws work ? giovanni guzzetta : the electoral laws are based on proportional representation whereby the parties that are politically similar form a coalition .
the coalition that obtains the most votes wins a majority in the parliament . the problem with the current electoral law is that the threshold is very low and so even very small parties can obtain seats and become determining forces in the life of the majority .
this , in turn , can result in a large amount of fragmentation . for example , the political parties today number more than 20 and this produces instability because all governments are forced to negotiate with the various smaller parties . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : prodi won the confidence vote in the chamber of deputies , but not in the senate -lrb- upper house -rrb- what are the two different electoral reforms currently on the agenda ? the first is the one that they are discussing in the parliament .
it aims to raise the threshold to between four to five percent .
this is somewhat inspired by the german system . the other proposal is the subject of a referendum and is supported by 800,000 citizens , as is required by the italian constitution .
it aims to reduce much more drastically the number of parties by eliminating coalitions altogether .
it foresees that each party runs alone and the party that wins is the one that has the majority of votes .
this way , all of the instability of coalition governments would be avoided . you are the president of the italian electoral referendum organizing committee .
will the referendum to change the electoral laws go ahead ? we collected the signatures and we obtained the approval of the constitutional court less than a week ago .

24 , when prime minister prodi resigned after losing a senate confidence vote .
dw-world.de spoke to an italian expert about the need to reform the country 's electoral system . professor giovanni guzzetta is a lawyer and lectures in public law at rome 's tor vergata university .
he has been involved in organizing electoral referendums in italy since 1991 and is currently the president of the italian electoral referendum organizing committee . dw-world.de : how do the current italian electoral laws work ? giovanni guzzetta : the electoral laws are based on proportional representation whereby the parties that are politically similar form a coalition .
the coalition that obtains the most votes wins a majority in the parliament . the problem with the current electoral law is that the threshold is very low and so even very small parties can obtain seats and become determining forces in the life of the majority .
this , in turn , can result in a large amount of fragmentation . for example , the political parties today number more than 20 and this produces instability because all governments are forced to negotiate with the various smaller parties . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : prodi won the confidence vote in the chamber of deputies , but not in the senate -lrb- upper house -rrb- what are the two different electoral reforms currently on the agenda ? the first is the one that they are discussing in the parliament .
it aims to raise the threshold to between four to five percent .
this is somewhat inspired by the german system . the other proposal is the subject of a referendum and is supported by 800,000 citizens , as is required by the italian constitution .
it aims to reduce much more drastically the number of parties by eliminating coalitions altogether .
it foresees that each party runs alone and the party that wins is the one that has the majority of votes .
this way , all of the instability of coalition governments would be avoided . you are the president of the italian electoral referendum organizing committee .
will the referendum to change the electoral laws go ahead ? we collected the signatures and we obtained the approval of the constitutional court less than a week ago .
but italian law requires that if early elections are called then a referendum must be delayed for a year .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de politics -pipe- 25.01.2008 expert : italy must reform its electoral system großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : fewer parties would help italy avoid political crises italy was thrown into crisis on thursday , jan .
24 , when prime minister prodi resigned after losing a senate confidence vote .
dw-world.de spoke to an italian expert about the need to reform the country 's electoral system . professor giovanni guzzetta is a lawyer and lectures in public law at rome 's tor vergata university .
he has been involved in organizing electoral referendums in italy since 1991 and is currently the president of the italian electoral referendum organizing committee . dw-world.de : how do the current italian electoral laws work ? giovanni guzzetta : the electoral laws are based on proportional representation whereby the parties that are politically similar form a coalition .
the coalition that obtains the most votes wins a majority in the parliament . the problem with the current electoral law is that the threshold is very low and so even very small parties can obtain seats and become determining forces in the life of the majority .
this , in turn , can result in a large amount of fragmentation . for example , the political parties today number more than 20 and this produces instability because all governments are forced to negotiate with the various smaller parties . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : prodi won the confidence vote in the chamber of deputies , but not in the senate -lrb- upper house -rrb- what are the two different electoral reforms currently on the agenda ? the first is the one that they are discussing in the parliament .
it aims to raise the threshold to between four to five percent .
this is somewhat inspired by the german system . the other proposal is the subject of a referendum and is supported by 800,000 citizens , as is required by the italian constitution .
it aims to reduce much more drastically the number of parties by eliminating coalitions altogether .
it foresees that each party runs alone and the party that wins is the one that has the majority of votes .
this way , all of the instability of coalition governments would be avoided . you are the president of the italian electoral referendum organizing committee .
will the referendum to change the electoral laws go ahead ? we collected the signatures and we obtained the approval of the constitutional court less than a week ago .
but italian law requires that if early elections are called then a referendum must be delayed for a year .
once a new government is formed , the referendum will go ahead as long as that new government does n't propose its own electoral reform . the current government crisis brings back memories of 1993 when the amato government fell and carlo ciampi -lrb- the former head of the bank of italy who later went on to serve as president of italy and who is currently a senator for life -rrb- was appointed head of a technocratic government with the sole task of changing the electoral laws .
how has the political climate changed since then ? the truth is that the current politicians are very much divided over the electoral law so it will be very difficult to reach a strong enough agreement to make a final decision over the electoral laws .
the most probable outcome will be either early elections or a government that serves only to carry out the referendum . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : prodi failed to keep his center-left coalition from collapsing .
italy has had 61 governments since the end of world war ii .
are italians fed up with these constantly changing governments or do they like politics to be this way ? i believe that a majority of italians are fed up .
a majority of italians realize that italy is destined to a miserable decline if it does n't change its institutions .
for my generation - i 'm 41 years old - italy has been our destiny .
for the next generation , the generation of my children , italy will be a choice between many other possibilities : my children can choose to live in italy , germany or spain , for example . if italy does n't have the equipment to be a country that is upward-moving , well-governed , with services that function and with stable institutions , it risks losing ground with respect to other countries . what must happen in italy to ensure stable governments in the future ? you need big changes within the political class .
the political class was shaped culturally in the era of the cold war , but things need to change .
the institutions need to become more competitive and more stable .
you need changes that strengthen the power of citizens and give more responsibility and stability to governments . so not only electoral reform is needed but also changes to the political parties ? the renewal of the parties would also mean changing the constitution , but in the meantime the electoral reform is a really important step . interview : stephanie raison send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

the evidence against him was based on a telephone conversation in which he was heard to offer his services as a suicide bomber . the complainant argued that the intelligence services ' tapping of his telephones in october and november 2001 was illegal , with his lawyer arguing that indications of planned international terrorist activity was inadequate grounds for supervision .

the evidence against him was based on a telephone conversation in which he was heard to offer his services as a suicide bomber . the complainant argued that the intelligence services ' tapping of his telephones in october and november 2001 was illegal , with his lawyer arguing that indications of planned international terrorist activity was inadequate grounds for supervision . " this is absurd , " said a representative from the bnd .
" in this era of international terrorism , investigators can not be restricted by national borders . " internet evidence also on thursday , a court in schleswig-holstein sentenced a german of moroccan origin to jail for setting up an al-qaeda cell in sudan , africa , with people he met on the internet . redouane e.h. , a 38-year-old mobile-phone and internet shop manager based in kiel , will serve five years and nine months for smuggling fighters into iraq and funding al-qaeda . most of the evidence in the case against e.h. came from internet chat logs .
the judge said it was the first time evidence had been obtained from phone calls via the internet and used to convict someone in a german court . extra-territorial laws bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the internet facilitates the spread of terrorist networks e.h. has been on trial since july , accused of uploading to the internet messages of support for osama bin laden and details on how to construct bombs .
he also raised 5,000 euros -lrb- $ 7,400 -rrb- to support a jihad or holy war , before his arrest in july 2006 . he took part in a training camp in algeria in december 2005 before embarking on the iraqi smuggling operation and finally the move into sudan to aid al qaeda of mesopotamia . the man originally came to the university of kiel to study philosophy , and said that he became a radical muslim after the death of his brother in 2003 . " from today 's perspective , i realize it was bizarre lunacy , " he told the court as the trial drew to a close .
" i just do n't understand how i ever got involved in it .

he managed the company 's us operations from 2002 to 2003 and became ceo in 2005 .
he resigned in 2007 over siemens ' slush fund affair despite having no personal responsibility for the scandal .
in october 2007 , he became chief operating officer at us company alcoa , the world 's second largest producer of aluminum . dw : how are the commodity markets shaping up in light of the current stock and financial market crisis ? bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : klaus kleinfeld klaus kleinfeld : commodity markets are very strongly driven by china 's and asia 's industrialization .
raw materials are needed there because these countries have relatively little of them .
population growth and industrialization are driving forces and that 's going to continue to be the case . the big question is how strong growth will be .
i 'm convinced that this will depend on chances for growth in the developed countries .
but it will still be stronger and better despite of it all .
that 's why the scarcity of raw materials will continue since they 'll continue to be in high demand .
that 's positive news for alcoa . why ?
because prices will remain on a high level with continuing strong demand ? it 's a growth business and i 'm saying that prices will develop in a positive , stable way . which markets are up and coming ?
what role does africa play ? bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : africa remains mainly interesting because of its raw materials africa is definitely an issue .
africa continues to be more of an issue in terms of delivering raw materials rather than using them .
i sincerely hope that africa , which has long been called a forgotten continent , will strongly profit from this and experience a stronger industrialization .
this can already be very much seen in south africa and in some northern african countries . here in davos , people are talking intensively behind the scenes about continuing talks on global free trade .
at the same time , there 's currently a global trend - also in europe and germany - to protect markets .
do you think that 's a good thing ? no , i think it 's missing the point .
i believe that there 's nothing that has contributed and led to global wealth over the past 20 years more than the opening of markets .
germany especially profited from this as an export-oriented country - probably more than most others .
that 's why people would hurt themselves with this .
one can only hope that these trends wo n't take over . what can be done to overcome the current economic crisis ? i think the recipe is always the same .
competitiveness has to be fostered , including an increased flexibility and people have to be careful to stay on a course of innovation .
that 's always been - and will hopefully always be - one of the greatest strengths of the german economy .
but needless to say , you ca n't completely separate that from costs and the challenges that come with it . interview : marco vollmar -lrb- win -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de agriculture -pipe- 25.01.2008 consumers concerned by new gene technology law großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : consumers have a choice between gm and conventional products the bundestag is set friday , jan .
25 , to pass a gene technology law , while last week saw the introduction of a new non-gm label .
consumers are under the impression that gm food has become an unavoidable fact of life . just how many of the products on germany supermarket shelves are genetically modified ?
both skeptics and supporters of gene technology like to make out that gm crops are everywhere .
to the former , this would be an argument for introducing stricter regulations , for the latter , proof that gene technology is safe , increases production and lowers the cost of food . in fact , even though a not inconsiderable amount of agricultural land is earmarked for gm crops , the critics ' prediction that they would take over the world is greatly exaggerated .
just 6 percent - 102 million hectares - of agricultural land around the world produces gm crops . germany had just 2,700 hectares given over to gm crops in 2007 , which amounts to less than 0.1 percent of its entire agricultural land . european reservations bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : some argue that gene technology promises higher yields it 's a different story in the us , which devotes 55 million hectares of farmland to gm crops .
canada , argentina , brazil , china and india are also enthusiastic advocates of genetic modification . europe is less keen .
this stems partly from legal restrictions but also has to do with agricultural structures . " use of genetically modified seed is only worth it in regions where the fields are very large , because it is so expensive , " said heike moldenhauer from friends of the earth germany .
in these cases , the fact that gm crops are highly resistant to pests and damage reduces the chances of a failed harvest .
with smaller fields , these advantages are less crucial . the same principle applies in germany .
gm crops are grown almost exclusively in the former east germany , where fields are larger than they are in the western part of the country .
according to statistics compiled by the german office for consumer protection and food safety , the highest proportion of gm crops care to be found in brandenburg , saxony and mecklenburg-western pommerania . germany permits the import of gm crops , but only monsanto 's modified corn seed mon 810 may be grown in the european union .
other gm seed is used all over the world , including corn , rapeseed , cotton and soybean . allying consumer fears bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : consumers want to make informed choices nonetheless , 80 percent of the genetically modified products cultivated by the world 's farmers rarely end up directly in the consumers ' kitchens .
the bulk of it is used for animal feed after brussels banned use of processed animal protein in animal feed and european farmers largely switched to low-cost gm soybean . ultimately , consumers determined to avoid gm food should steer clear of animal products such as milk , meat and eggs .
but they can rest assured that the remaining 20 percent of gm crops being grown are destined for t-shirts and jeans .
for the time being , there are still plenty of alternatives to genetically modified tomatoes and potatoes in germany 's supermarkets . leila knüppel -lrb- jp -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?
dw-world.de berlin agrees on new gm labeling law - but how strict is it ?

not even the new german law banning tobacco in public buildings .
anti-smoking advocates are not amused and are pressing charges . " anyone who does n't read is an idiot , " said former chancellor helmut schmidt in an interview for die zeit 's weekly magazine leben on thursday , jan .
24 . but however many books the very learned schmidt might have read , he certainly does n't seem to be good at reading germany 's new and very visible no smoking signs . his remark was issued the same week that prosecutors in hamburg began investigating him for lighting up in the lobby of the komödie winterhuder fährhaus theater just hours after the controversial smoking ban came into force on january 1 . yet another controversy bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : schmidt in the days when everyone smoked hailing from a time when cigarettes were easily the least pernicious of politicans ' preferred poisons , schmidt would never have predicted the impact a quick smoke could have in this health-conscious age . but then the indomitable elder statesman of german politics was snapped by the mass circulation bild newspaper blithely puffing away at a reception with his wife , childhood sweetheart loki . and before he knew it , he was at the heart of a controversy at least as divisive as his policies on the soviet invasion of afghanistan back in the late 1970s . bodily harm ? bild has reported that the schmidts might even face bodily harm charges .
according to the german criminal code , " anyone who physically abuses someone else or damages their health can be given a suspended sentence of up to five years or be punished with a financial penalty . " in fact , helmut schmidt 's recalcitrance is hardly a surprise .
a dedicated smoker throughout his career , schmidt is still seldom photographed without a cigarette even as he approaches his 90s .
interviews are generally conducted amid a thick cloud of smoke and changing public attitudes have done nothing to curb his enthusiasm . nicknamed schmidt-schnauze -lrb- sassy schmidt -rrb- for his sharp tongue and ready wit , the former politician famed for never following the crowd is the last person likely to give up a lifetime 's habit simply because it has fallen out of fashion . during his years in office between 1974 and 1982 , schmidt weathered political turbulence ranging from the international oil crisis to the terrorism of the baader-meinhof era .
cigarette smoking never seemed to get in the way of his political duties . dismissal likely rüdiger bagger , a prosecutions spokesman in hamburg , confirmed the complaint had been received , but said the docket would be most likely be dismissed . " smoking is definitely damaging to the health , but there 's no evidence mr and mrs schmidt committed assault , " he said . hamburg has already announced that its bylaws department will not start imposing misdemeanour fines on smokers till march , so the complaint seems unlikely to have any legal consequences . unpopular motion germany implemented the ban on smoking in bars and restaurants across most of the country on jan .
1 . the new law has not gone down well in a nation long considered a smoker 's haven .
it has been suggested that the move has met with more resistance here than in other cigarette-loving nations such as france and italy because of the long shadow cast by the country 's past .
one of germany 's most fervent anti-smokers was hitler , who cracked down on the habit during the third reich . in fact , the ban in germany is more lenient than those imposed in other western european nations in recent years as restaurants in the country will be allowed to provide separate smoking rooms . bad example bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : still ignored by many the case against the rebellious schmidts was brought by anti-smoking activists in the western city of wiesbaden . " they were recklessly smoking in public and someone like mr schmidt should know better - he is setting a very bad example , so we launched legal proceedings , " activist horst keiser told reuters . " how can children and young people be expected to grasp that laws must be respected when even a statesman like helmut schmidt ignores them ? " keiser said he wanted the schmidts to be fined a few thousand euros and for the money to be donated to a children 's charity .
he also wanted them to stop smoking in public . " a lot of people think , look at him , he 's 89 and still going strong , how bad can smoking be , " he added .
" but no one realizes that in fact he 's had four bypasses and has a pacemaker . " according to the hamburger morgenpost , however , loki schmidt says that she and her husband have no intention of quitting . " even our doctors have advised us against it , " she maintains .
" they say it would be too stressful for our bodies . " dw staff -lrb- jp -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

he managed the company 's us operations from 2002 to 2003 and became ceo in 2005 .
he resigned in 2007 over siemens ' slush fund affair despite having no personal responsibility for the scandal .
in october 2007 , he became chief operating officer at us company alcoa , the world 's second largest producer of aluminum . dw : how are the commodity markets shaping up in light of the current stock and financial market crisis ? bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : klaus kleinfeld klaus kleinfeld : commodity markets are very strongly driven by china 's and asia 's industrialization .
raw materials are needed there because these countries have relatively little of them .
population growth and industrialization are driving forces and that 's going to continue to be the case . the big question is how strong growth will be .
i 'm convinced that this will depend on chances for growth in the developed countries .
but it will still be stronger and better despite of it all .
that 's why the scarcity of raw materials will continue since they 'll continue to be in high demand .
that 's positive news for alcoa . why ?
because prices will remain on a high level with continuing strong demand ? it 's a growth business and i 'm saying that prices will develop in a positive , stable way . which markets are up and coming ?
what role does africa play ? bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : africa remains mainly interesting because of its raw materials africa is definitely an issue .
africa continues to be more of an issue in terms of delivering raw materials rather than using them .
i sincerely hope that africa , which has long been called a forgotten continent , will strongly profit from this and experience a stronger industrialization .
this can already be very much seen in south africa and in some northern african countries . here in davos , people are talking intensively behind the scenes about continuing talks on global free trade .
at the same time , there 's currently a global trend - also in europe and germany - to protect markets .
do you think that 's a good thing ? no , i think it 's missing the point .
i believe that there 's nothing that has contributed and led to global wealth over the past 20 years more than the opening of markets .
germany especially profited from this as an export-oriented country - probably more than most others .
that 's why people would hurt themselves with this .
one can only hope that these trends wo n't take over . what can be done to overcome the current economic crisis ? i think the recipe is always the same .
competitiveness has to be fostered , including an increased flexibility and people have to be careful to stay on a course of innovation .
that 's always been - and will hopefully always be - one of the greatest strengths of the german economy .
but needless to say , you ca n't completely separate that from costs and the challenges that come with it . interview : marco vollmar -lrb- win -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de agriculture -pipe- 25.01.2008 consumers concerned by new gene technology law großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : consumers have a choice between gm and conventional products the bundestag is set friday , jan .
25 , to pass a gene technology law , while last week saw the introduction of a new non-gm label .
consumers are under the impression that gm food has become an unavoidable fact of life . just how many of the products on germany supermarket shelves are genetically modified ?
both skeptics and supporters of gene technology like to make out that gm crops are everywhere .
to the former , this would be an argument for introducing stricter regulations , for the latter , proof that gene technology is safe , increases production and lowers the cost of food . in fact , even though a not inconsiderable amount of agricultural land is earmarked for gm crops , the critics ' prediction that they would take over the world is greatly exaggerated .
just 6 percent - 102 million hectares - of agricultural land around the world produces gm crops . germany had just 2,700 hectares given over to gm crops in 2007 , which amounts to less than 0.1 percent of its entire agricultural land . european reservations bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : some argue that gene technology promises higher yields it 's a different story in the us , which devotes 55 million hectares of farmland to gm crops .
canada , argentina , brazil , china and india are also enthusiastic advocates of genetic modification . europe is less keen .
this stems partly from legal restrictions but also has to do with agricultural structures . " use of genetically modified seed is only worth it in regions where the fields are very large , because it is so expensive , " said heike moldenhauer from friends of the earth germany .

pleased with the state of things after opening borders in the european union 's eastern region , officials are considering an electronic entry and exit register designed to track down illegal immigrants . eu justice commissioner franco frattini said on friday , jan .
25 , that the register would be similar to the electronic scanning of fingerprints and eyes at us ports of entry .
he added that it would be part of a series of eu initiatives seeking to use modern technology to target overstayers - third-country nationals who enter the eu legally but then become illegal immigrants by extending their stay beyond their visa expiry date . frattini also wants to improve the bloc 's fight against illegal immigrants by replacing its current visa system with an electronic travel authorization -lrb- eta -rrb- . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : in the us , every visitor already gets fingerprinted and photographed the electronic visa , similar to one already in place in australia , would also include a traveler 's biometric data , such as electronic photos and fingerprints . " i will present in february a package of measures aimed at improving the capacity of the eu to protect its external borders , " frattini said at an informal meeting of eu justice and interior ministers in slovenia , the current holder of the bloc 's presidency . the package , which european commission sources said would be submitted to the eu executive on feb.13 , aimed to make a " better use of existing technology " , frattini said . hundreds of thousands of illegal immigrants live in the eu 's 27 member states . " one of the main problems we face now is overstayers - people who enter the eu legally and then disappear because they stay over the allowed period , " frattini said .
" this can not be tolerated .
overstayers are the factor number one of illegal immigration . " upbeat about schengen expansion managing overstayers has become an increasingly difficult task , particularly since december , when the eu expanded its borderless area to include nine new countries , most of them from eastern europe . the countries joined the so-called schengen agreement amid concerns that its expansion would make it easier for criminals and illegal immigrants to enter the bloc . such concerns have been felt particularly in germany , where there have been widespread reports about scores of chechen refugees with asylum status in poland crossing its eastern border . " none of the fears has come true , " said peter altmaier , state secretary at the german interior ministry .
" as far as we know , schengen is a big success . " eu justice commissioner franco frattini hailed the successes of the enlarged schengen area , noting that the program 's shared database on criminals had since lead to the arrest of " some 100 suspects " in the new member states . frattini added that the influx of chechen refugees into germany and austria showed that there was a pressing need for a common eu policy on asylum , another issue due to be debated by ministers in brdo , near the slovenian capital ljubljana . success or failure ? bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : german federal police now control people in a wide strip along the border slovenian interior minister dragutin mate , whose country currently holds the rotating eu presidency , also said that things looked very good .
he said that slovenian border patrol alone had confiscated 140 stolen vehicles and prevented 1,700 people on eu blacklists from entering the bloc . germany 's police union meanwhile on wednesday said that border patrols had stopped 564 foreigners without visa along germany 's borders with poland and the czech republic since border controls fell on dec .
21 , an increase of 150 percent when compared to the year before . altmaier conceded that more chechens had come to germany in the first two weeks after the border fell , but added that they had been returned to poland , the eu country they had first entered .
according to eu rules , asylum seekers are dealt with in the country they first enter . " these are normal procedures , " he said . debate on passenger data sharing bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : should the eu share passenger data ?
european union justice and interior ministers were also expected to discuss plans to share airline passengers ' data in a bid to prevent terrorists from entering the 27-member bloc . the so-called european passenger name record -lrb- pnr -rrb- would be modeled according to a similar system introduced by the united states in the aftermath of the sept .
11 , 2001 attacks . " terrorism remains the number one threat , " frattini said . frattini , who first floated the idea over the summer , said a european pnr was " absolutely necessary " and should therefore be adopted " as soon as possible . " but his plans have been met with resistance from civil liberties ' advocates , who fear that collecting details about a person 's travel arrangements in and out of the eu would violate their privacy . details about a traveler 's airline ticket , including how it was paid for , would be shared among all eu member states , as well as with third countries such as the us .
the eu insists it will not divulge sensitive information about a traveler 's ethnic origins or political and religious beliefs . dw staff -lrb- win -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

pleased with the state of things after opening borders in the european union 's eastern region , officials are considering an electronic entry and exit register designed to track down illegal immigrants . eu justice commissioner franco frattini said on friday , jan .
25 , that the register would be similar to the electronic scanning of fingerprints and eyes at us ports of entry .
he added that it would be part of a series of eu initiatives seeking to use modern technology to target overstayers - third-country nationals who enter the eu legally but then become illegal immigrants by extending their stay beyond their visa expiry date . frattini also wants to improve the bloc 's fight against illegal immigrants by replacing its current visa system with an electronic travel authorization -lrb- eta -rrb- . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : in the us , every visitor already gets fingerprinted and photographed the electronic visa , similar to one already in place in australia , would also include a traveler 's biometric data , such as electronic photos and fingerprints . " i will present in february a package of measures aimed at improving the capacity of the eu to protect its external borders , " frattini said at an informal meeting of eu justice and interior ministers in slovenia , the current holder of the bloc 's presidency . the package , which european commission sources said would be submitted to the eu executive on feb.13 , aimed to make a " better use of existing technology " , frattini said . hundreds of thousands of illegal immigrants live in the eu 's 27 member states . " one of the main problems we face now is overstayers - people who enter the eu legally and then disappear because they stay over the allowed period , " frattini said .
" this can not be tolerated .
overstayers are the factor number one of illegal immigration . " upbeat about schengen expansion managing overstayers has become an increasingly difficult task , particularly since december , when the eu expanded its borderless area to include nine new countries , most of them from eastern europe . the countries joined the so-called schengen agreement amid concerns that its expansion would make it easier for criminals and illegal immigrants to enter the bloc . such concerns have been felt particularly in germany , where there have been widespread reports about scores of chechen refugees with asylum status in poland crossing its eastern border . " none of the fears has come true , " said peter altmaier , state secretary at the german interior ministry .

he managed the company 's us operations from 2002 to 2003 and became ceo in 2005 .

raw materials are needed there because these countries have relatively little of them .

africa continues to be more of an issue in terms of delivering raw materials rather than using them .

24 , when prime minister prodi resigned after losing a senate confidence vote .
dw-world.de spoke to an italian expert about the need to reform the country 's electoral system . professor giovanni guzzetta is a lawyer and lectures in public law at rome 's tor vergata university .
he has been involved in organizing electoral referendums in italy since 1991 and is currently the president of the italian electoral referendum organizing committee . dw-world.de : how do the current italian electoral laws work ? giovanni guzzetta : the electoral laws are based on proportional representation whereby the parties that are politically similar form a coalition .
the coalition that obtains the most votes wins a majority in the parliament . the problem with the current electoral law is that the threshold is very low and so even very small parties can obtain seats and become determining forces in the life of the majority .
this , in turn , can result in a large amount of fragmentation . for example , the political parties today number more than 20 and this produces instability because all governments are forced to negotiate with the various smaller parties . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : prodi won the confidence vote in the chamber of deputies , but not in the senate -lrb- upper house -rrb- what are the two different electoral reforms currently on the agenda ? the first is the one that they are discussing in the parliament .
it aims to raise the threshold to between four to five percent .
this is somewhat inspired by the german system . the other proposal is the subject of a referendum and is supported by 800,000 citizens , as is required by the italian constitution .
it aims to reduce much more drastically the number of parties by eliminating coalitions altogether .
it foresees that each party runs alone and the party that wins is the one that has the majority of votes .
this way , all of the instability of coalition governments would be avoided . you are the president of the italian electoral referendum organizing committee .
will the referendum to change the electoral laws go ahead ? we collected the signatures and we obtained the approval of the constitutional court less than a week ago .
but italian law requires that if early elections are called then a referendum must be delayed for a year .
once a new government is formed , the referendum will go ahead as long as that new government does n't propose its own electoral reform . the current government crisis brings back memories of 1993 when the amato government fell and carlo ciampi -lrb- the former head of the bank of italy who later went on to serve as president of italy and who is currently a senator for life -rrb- was appointed head of a technocratic government with the sole task of changing the electoral laws .
how has the political climate changed since then ? the truth is that the current politicians are very much divided over the electoral law so it will be very difficult to reach a strong enough agreement to make a final decision over the electoral laws .
the most probable outcome will be either early elections or a government that serves only to carry out the referendum . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : prodi failed to keep his center-left coalition from collapsing .
italy has had 61 governments since the end of world war ii .
are italians fed up with these constantly changing governments or do they like politics to be this way ? i believe that a majority of italians are fed up .
a majority of italians realize that italy is destined to a miserable decline if it does n't change its institutions .
for my generation - i 'm 41 years old - italy has been our destiny .
for the next generation , the generation of my children , italy will be a choice between many other possibilities : my children can choose to live in italy , germany or spain , for example . if italy does n't have the equipment to be a country that is upward-moving , well-governed , with services that function and with stable institutions , it risks losing ground with respect to other countries . what must happen in italy to ensure stable governments in the future ? you need big changes within the political class .
the political class was shaped culturally in the era of the cold war , but things need to change .
the institutions need to become more competitive and more stable .
you need changes that strengthen the power of citizens and give more responsibility and stability to governments . so not only electoral reform is needed but also changes to the political parties ? the renewal of the parties would also mean changing the constitution , but in the meantime the electoral reform is a really important step . interview : stephanie raison send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

he has been involved in organizing electoral referendums in italy since 1991 and is currently the president of the italian electoral referendum organizing committee . dw-world.de : how do the current italian electoral laws work ? giovanni guzzetta : the electoral laws are based on proportional representation whereby the parties that are politically similar form a coalition .
the coalition that obtains the most votes wins a majority in the parliament . the problem with the current electoral law is that the threshold is very low and so even very small parties can obtain seats and become determining forces in the life of the majority .
this , in turn , can result in a large amount of fragmentation . for example , the political parties today number more than 20 and this produces instability because all governments are forced to negotiate with the various smaller parties . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : prodi won the confidence vote in the chamber of deputies , but not in the senate -lrb- upper house -rrb- what are the two different electoral reforms currently on the agenda ? the first is the one that they are discussing in the parliament .
it aims to raise the threshold to between four to five percent .
this is somewhat inspired by the german system . the other proposal is the subject of a referendum and is supported by 800,000 citizens , as is required by the italian constitution .
it aims to reduce much more drastically the number of parties by eliminating coalitions altogether .
it foresees that each party runs alone and the party that wins is the one that has the majority of votes .
this way , all of the instability of coalition governments would be avoided . you are the president of the italian electoral referendum organizing committee .
will the referendum to change the electoral laws go ahead ? we collected the signatures and we obtained the approval of the constitutional court less than a week ago .
but italian law requires that if early elections are called then a referendum must be delayed for a year .
once a new government is formed , the referendum will go ahead as long as that new government does n't propose its own electoral reform . the current government crisis brings back memories of 1993 when the amato government fell and carlo ciampi -lrb- the former head of the bank of italy who later went on to serve as president of italy and who is currently a senator for life -rrb- was appointed head of a technocratic government with the sole task of changing the electoral laws .
how has the political climate changed since then ? the truth is that the current politicians are very much divided over the electoral law so it will be very difficult to reach a strong enough agreement to make a final decision over the electoral laws .
the most probable outcome will be either early elections or a government that serves only to carry out the referendum . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : prodi failed to keep his center-left coalition from collapsing .
italy has had 61 governments since the end of world war ii .
are italians fed up with these constantly changing governments or do they like politics to be this way ? i believe that a majority of italians are fed up .
a majority of italians realize that italy is destined to a miserable decline if it does n't change its institutions .
for my generation - i 'm 41 years old - italy has been our destiny .
for the next generation , the generation of my children , italy will be a choice between many other possibilities : my children can choose to live in italy , germany or spain , for example . if italy does n't have the equipment to be a country that is upward-moving , well-governed , with services that function and with stable institutions , it risks losing ground with respect to other countries . what must happen in italy to ensure stable governments in the future ? you need big changes within the political class .
the political class was shaped culturally in the era of the cold war , but things need to change .
the institutions need to become more competitive and more stable .
you need changes that strengthen the power of citizens and give more responsibility and stability to governments . so not only electoral reform is needed but also changes to the political parties ? the renewal of the parties would also mean changing the constitution , but in the meantime the electoral reform is a really important step . interview : stephanie raison send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de agriculture -pipe- 25.01.2008 consumers concerned by new gene technology law großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : consumers have a choice between gm and conventional products the bundestag is set friday , jan .
25 , to pass a gene technology law , while last week saw the introduction of a new non-gm label .
consumers are under the impression that gm food has become an unavoidable fact of life . just how many of the products on germany supermarket shelves are genetically modified ?
both skeptics and supporters of gene technology like to make out that gm crops are everywhere .
to the former , this would be an argument for introducing stricter regulations , for the latter , proof that gene technology is safe , increases production and lowers the cost of food . in fact , even though a not inconsiderable amount of agricultural land is earmarked for gm crops , the critics ' prediction that they would take over the world is greatly exaggerated .
just 6 percent - 102 million hectares - of agricultural land around the world produces gm crops . germany had just 2,700 hectares given over to gm crops in 2007 , which amounts to less than 0.1 percent of its entire agricultural land . european reservations bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : some argue that gene technology promises higher yields it 's a different story in the us , which devotes 55 million hectares of farmland to gm crops .
canada , argentina , brazil , china and india are also enthusiastic advocates of genetic modification . europe is less keen .
this stems partly from legal restrictions but also has to do with agricultural structures . " use of genetically modified seed is only worth it in regions where the fields are very large , because it is so expensive , " said heike moldenhauer from friends of the earth germany .
in these cases , the fact that gm crops are highly resistant to pests and damage reduces the chances of a failed harvest .
with smaller fields , these advantages are less crucial . the same principle applies in germany .

while the eu keeps trying to find a way to back serbia 's moderate president in a runoff election overshadowed by the kosovo question , serbia moved closer to russia by signing a major energy deal with moscow . serbia 's pro-western president boris tadic in moscow on friday , jan .

according to pipeline plans , the gas is to be pumped in the future from the black sea region through bulgaria and serbia in the direction of the european union . the planned pipeline , it was said , was a russian reaction to the competing project by the eu , which is planning the nabucco pipeline to transport gas to the west through the caspian sea to limit the bloc 's dependence on russian energy deliveries . selling out for kosovo ? serbian economics minister mladjan dinkic has criticized the sale of nis as a dissipation of state assets , adding that gazprom should have paid at least 1.5 billion euros for the company . western diplomats in serbia have speculated that the sale of nis was a token of gratitude to russia for its support in the kosovo conflict .

" this would risk provoking serious damage to the whole of the international legal system and would have negative consequences both for the balkans and the world , " putin said . kosovo 's prime minister , hashin thaci , on thursday said that a unilateral declaration of independence was just a matter of days . can tadic survive ? tadic was visiting moscow almost a week before the serbian runoff elections on feb .
3 .
tadic , who is backed by the united states and the european union , is running against nationalist challenger tomislav nikolic . russian media considered the meeting in moscow as support for tadic in the election , with the daily izvestiya on friday postulating that russia would profit more from a moderate serbian president such as tadic than the extremist nikolic . nikolic is to visit russia 's parliament on monday , according to news reports . eu looks for incentive bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : " never eu " reads this graffiti in the serbian capital , belgrade european union officials meanwhile were also keen to ensure serbia 's pro-eu orientation . on thursday , the current holder of the eu presidency , slovenia , said the bloc hoped to sign a stabilization and association agreement -lrb- saa -rrb- with serbia on closer integration " in the coming days .

a threat of terrorism anywhere in the world suffices , ruled a leipzig court . the federal administrative court in leipzig ruled thursday , jan .
24 , that the german intelligence agency -lrb- bnd -rrb- can bug the telephones of suspected terrorists even when there is no immediate threat to germany .
the possibility that " sleepers " in germany are involved in plans for international attacks is sufficient grounds for strategic monitoring , the court decided . according to the parliamentary control committee -lrb- pkg -rrb- , the bnd employed strategic monitoring tactics some 24,400 times , with 21 cases considered relevant to the intelligence services . no national restraints bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : intelligence can tap phone lines when an international terrorist threat is looming the case had been brought by a man currently serving time in a cologne jail for terrorist activities .
in october 2005 , a düsseldorf court sentenced him to eight years behind bars for his involvement in the al-tawhid organization .
the evidence against him was based on a telephone conversation in which he was heard to offer his services as a suicide bomber . the complainant argued that the intelligence services ' tapping of his telephones in october and november 2001 was illegal , with his lawyer arguing that indications of planned international terrorist activity was inadequate grounds for supervision . " this is absurd , " said a representative from the bnd .
" in this era of international terrorism , investigators can not be restricted by national borders . " internet evidence also on thursday , a court in schleswig-holstein sentenced a german of moroccan origin to jail for setting up an al-qaeda cell in sudan , africa , with people he met on the internet . redouane e.h. , a 38-year-old mobile-phone and internet shop manager based in kiel , will serve five years and nine months for smuggling fighters into iraq and funding al-qaeda . most of the evidence in the case against e.h. came from internet chat logs .
the judge said it was the first time evidence had been obtained from phone calls via the internet and used to convict someone in a german court . extra-territorial laws bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the internet facilitates the spread of terrorist networks e.h. has been on trial since july , accused of uploading to the internet messages of support for osama bin laden and details on how to construct bombs .
he also raised 5,000 euros -lrb- $ 7,400 -rrb- to support a jihad or holy war , before his arrest in july 2006 . he took part in a training camp in algeria in december 2005 before embarking on the iraqi smuggling operation and finally the move into sudan to aid al qaeda of mesopotamia . the man originally came to the university of kiel to study philosophy , and said that he became a radical muslim after the death of his brother in 2003 . " from today 's perspective , i realize it was bizarre lunacy , " he told the court as the trial drew to a close .
" i just do n't understand how i ever got involved in it . " e.h. was convicted under an extra-territorial law that makes it a crime for someone in germany to establish or belong to a terrorist organization anywhere in the world . dw staff -lrb- jp -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

24 , when prime minister prodi resigned after losing a senate confidence vote .
dw-world.de spoke to an italian expert about the need to reform the country 's electoral system . professor giovanni guzzetta is a lawyer and lectures in public law at rome 's tor vergata university .
he has been involved in organizing electoral referendums in italy since 1991 and is currently the president of the italian electoral referendum organizing committee . dw-world.de : how do the current italian electoral laws work ? giovanni guzzetta : the electoral laws are based on proportional representation whereby the parties that are politically similar form a coalition .
the coalition that obtains the most votes wins a majority in the parliament . the problem with the current electoral law is that the threshold is very low and so even very small parties can obtain seats and become determining forces in the life of the majority .
this , in turn , can result in a large amount of fragmentation . for example , the political parties today number more than 20 and this produces instability because all governments are forced to negotiate with the various smaller parties . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : prodi won the confidence vote in the chamber of deputies , but not in the senate -lrb- upper house -rrb- what are the two different electoral reforms currently on the agenda ? the first is the one that they are discussing in the parliament .
it aims to raise the threshold to between four to five percent .
this is somewhat inspired by the german system . the other proposal is the subject of a referendum and is supported by 800,000 citizens , as is required by the italian constitution .
it aims to reduce much more drastically the number of parties by eliminating coalitions altogether .
it foresees that each party runs alone and the party that wins is the one that has the majority of votes .
this way , all of the instability of coalition governments would be avoided . you are the president of the italian electoral referendum organizing committee .
will the referendum to change the electoral laws go ahead ? we collected the signatures and we obtained the approval of the constitutional court less than a week ago .
but italian law requires that if early elections are called then a referendum must be delayed for a year .
once a new government is formed , the referendum will go ahead as long as that new government does n't propose its own electoral reform . the current government crisis brings back memories of 1993 when the amato government fell and carlo ciampi -lrb- the former head of the bank of italy who later went on to serve as president of italy and who is currently a senator for life -rrb- was appointed head of a technocratic government with the sole task of changing the electoral laws .
how has the political climate changed since then ? the truth is that the current politicians are very much divided over the electoral law so it will be very difficult to reach a strong enough agreement to make a final decision over the electoral laws .
the most probable outcome will be either early elections or a government that serves only to carry out the referendum . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : prodi failed to keep his center-left coalition from collapsing .
italy has had 61 governments since the end of world war ii .
are italians fed up with these constantly changing governments or do they like politics to be this way ? i believe that a majority of italians are fed up .
a majority of italians realize that italy is destined to a miserable decline if it does n't change its institutions .
for my generation - i 'm 41 years old - italy has been our destiny .
for the next generation , the generation of my children , italy will be a choice between many other possibilities : my children can choose to live in italy , germany or spain , for example . if italy does n't have the equipment to be a country that is upward-moving , well-governed , with services that function and with stable institutions , it risks losing ground with respect to other countries . what must happen in italy to ensure stable governments in the future ? you need big changes within the political class .
the political class was shaped culturally in the era of the cold war , but things need to change .
the institutions need to become more competitive and more stable .
you need changes that strengthen the power of citizens and give more responsibility and stability to governments . so not only electoral reform is needed but also changes to the political parties ? the renewal of the parties would also mean changing the constitution , but in the meantime the electoral reform is a really important step . interview : stephanie raison send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

this is somewhat inspired by the german system . the other proposal is the subject of a referendum and is supported by 800,000 citizens , as is required by the italian constitution .
it aims to reduce much more drastically the number of parties by eliminating coalitions altogether .
it foresees that each party runs alone and the party that wins is the one that has the majority of votes .
this way , all of the instability of coalition governments would be avoided . you are the president of the italian electoral referendum organizing committee .
will the referendum to change the electoral laws go ahead ? we collected the signatures and we obtained the approval of the constitutional court less than a week ago .
but italian law requires that if early elections are called then a referendum must be delayed for a year .
once a new government is formed , the referendum will go ahead as long as that new government does n't propose its own electoral reform . the current government crisis brings back memories of 1993 when the amato government fell and carlo ciampi -lrb- the former head of the bank of italy who later went on to serve as president of italy and who is currently a senator for life -rrb- was appointed head of a technocratic government with the sole task of changing the electoral laws .
how has the political climate changed since then ? the truth is that the current politicians are very much divided over the electoral law so it will be very difficult to reach a strong enough agreement to make a final decision over the electoral laws .
the most probable outcome will be either early elections or a government that serves only to carry out the referendum . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : prodi failed to keep his center-left coalition from collapsing .
italy has had 61 governments since the end of world war ii .
are italians fed up with these constantly changing governments or do they like politics to be this way ? i believe that a majority of italians are fed up .
a majority of italians realize that italy is destined to a miserable decline if it does n't change its institutions .
for my generation - i 'm 41 years old - italy has been our destiny .
for the next generation , the generation of my children , italy will be a choice between many other possibilities : my children can choose to live in italy , germany or spain , for example . if italy does n't have the equipment to be a country that is upward-moving , well-governed , with services that function and with stable institutions , it risks losing ground with respect to other countries . what must happen in italy to ensure stable governments in the future ? you need big changes within the political class .
the political class was shaped culturally in the era of the cold war , but things need to change .
the institutions need to become more competitive and more stable .
you need changes that strengthen the power of citizens and give more responsibility and stability to governments . so not only electoral reform is needed but also changes to the political parties ? the renewal of the parties would also mean changing the constitution , but in the meantime the electoral reform is a really important step . interview : stephanie raison send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

raw materials are needed there because these countries have relatively little of them .
population growth and industrialization are driving forces and that 's going to continue to be the case . the big question is how strong growth will be .
i 'm convinced that this will depend on chances for growth in the developed countries .

he managed the company 's us operations from 2002 to 2003 and became ceo in 2005 .
he resigned in 2007 over siemens ' slush fund affair despite having no personal responsibility for the scandal .
in october 2007 , he became chief operating officer at us company alcoa , the world 's second largest producer of aluminum . dw : how are the commodity markets shaping up in light of the current stock and financial market crisis ? bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : klaus kleinfeld klaus kleinfeld : commodity markets are very strongly driven by china 's and asia 's industrialization .
raw materials are needed there because these countries have relatively little of them .
population growth and industrialization are driving forces and that 's going to continue to be the case . the big question is how strong growth will be .
i 'm convinced that this will depend on chances for growth in the developed countries .
but it will still be stronger and better despite of it all .
that 's why the scarcity of raw materials will continue since they 'll continue to be in high demand .
that 's positive news for alcoa . why ?
because prices will remain on a high level with continuing strong demand ? it 's a growth business and i 'm saying that prices will develop in a positive , stable way . which markets are up and coming ?
what role does africa play ? bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : africa remains mainly interesting because of its raw materials africa is definitely an issue .
africa continues to be more of an issue in terms of delivering raw materials rather than using them .
i sincerely hope that africa , which has long been called a forgotten continent , will strongly profit from this and experience a stronger industrialization .
this can already be very much seen in south africa and in some northern african countries . here in davos , people are talking intensively behind the scenes about continuing talks on global free trade .
at the same time , there 's currently a global trend - also in europe and germany - to protect markets .
do you think that 's a good thing ? no , i think it 's missing the point .
i believe that there 's nothing that has contributed and led to global wealth over the past 20 years more than the opening of markets .
germany especially profited from this as an export-oriented country - probably more than most others .
that 's why people would hurt themselves with this .
one can only hope that these trends wo n't take over . what can be done to overcome the current economic crisis ? i think the recipe is always the same .
competitiveness has to be fostered , including an increased flexibility and people have to be careful to stay on a course of innovation .
that 's always been - and will hopefully always be - one of the greatest strengths of the german economy .

pleased with the state of things after opening borders in the european union 's eastern region , officials are considering an electronic entry and exit register designed to track down illegal immigrants . eu justice commissioner franco frattini said on friday , jan .
25 , that the register would be similar to the electronic scanning of fingerprints and eyes at us ports of entry .
he added that it would be part of a series of eu initiatives seeking to use modern technology to target overstayers - third-country nationals who enter the eu legally but then become illegal immigrants by extending their stay beyond their visa expiry date . frattini also wants to improve the bloc 's fight against illegal immigrants by replacing its current visa system with an electronic travel authorization -lrb- eta -rrb- . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : in the us , every visitor already gets fingerprinted and photographed the electronic visa , similar to one already in place in australia , would also include a traveler 's biometric data , such as electronic photos and fingerprints . " i will present in february a package of measures aimed at improving the capacity of the eu to protect its external borders , " frattini said at an informal meeting of eu justice and interior ministers in slovenia , the current holder of the bloc 's presidency . the package , which european commission sources said would be submitted to the eu executive on feb.13 , aimed to make a " better use of existing technology " , frattini said . hundreds of thousands of illegal immigrants live in the eu 's 27 member states . " one of the main problems we face now is overstayers - people who enter the eu legally and then disappear because they stay over the allowed period , " frattini said .
" this can not be tolerated .
overstayers are the factor number one of illegal immigration . " upbeat about schengen expansion managing overstayers has become an increasingly difficult task , particularly since december , when the eu expanded its borderless area to include nine new countries , most of them from eastern europe . the countries joined the so-called schengen agreement amid concerns that its expansion would make it easier for criminals and illegal immigrants to enter the bloc . such concerns have been felt particularly in germany , where there have been widespread reports about scores of chechen refugees with asylum status in poland crossing its eastern border . " none of the fears has come true , " said peter altmaier , state secretary at the german interior ministry .
" as far as we know , schengen is a big success . " eu justice commissioner franco frattini hailed the successes of the enlarged schengen area , noting that the program 's shared database on criminals had since lead to the arrest of " some 100 suspects " in the new member states . frattini added that the influx of chechen refugees into germany and austria showed that there was a pressing need for a common eu policy on asylum , another issue due to be debated by ministers in brdo , near the slovenian capital ljubljana . success or failure ? bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : german federal police now control people in a wide strip along the border slovenian interior minister dragutin mate , whose country currently holds the rotating eu presidency , also said that things looked very good .
he said that slovenian border patrol alone had confiscated 140 stolen vehicles and prevented 1,700 people on eu blacklists from entering the bloc . germany 's police union meanwhile on wednesday said that border patrols had stopped 564 foreigners without visa along germany 's borders with poland and the czech republic since border controls fell on dec .
21 , an increase of 150 percent when compared to the year before . altmaier conceded that more chechens had come to germany in the first two weeks after the border fell , but added that they had been returned to poland , the eu country they had first entered .
according to eu rules , asylum seekers are dealt with in the country they first enter . " these are normal procedures , " he said . debate on passenger data sharing bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : should the eu share passenger data ?
european union justice and interior ministers were also expected to discuss plans to share airline passengers ' data in a bid to prevent terrorists from entering the 27-member bloc . the so-called european passenger name record -lrb- pnr -rrb- would be modeled according to a similar system introduced by the united states in the aftermath of the sept .
11 , 2001 attacks . " terrorism remains the number one threat , " frattini said . frattini , who first floated the idea over the summer , said a european pnr was " absolutely necessary " and should therefore be adopted " as soon as possible .

pleased with the state of things after opening borders in the european union 's eastern region , officials are considering an electronic entry and exit register designed to track down illegal immigrants . eu justice commissioner franco frattini said on friday , jan .
25 , that the register would be similar to the electronic scanning of fingerprints and eyes at us ports of entry .
he added that it would be part of a series of eu initiatives seeking to use modern technology to target overstayers - third-country nationals who enter the eu legally but then become illegal immigrants by extending their stay beyond their visa expiry date . frattini also wants to improve the bloc 's fight against illegal immigrants by replacing its current visa system with an electronic travel authorization -lrb- eta -rrb- . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : in the us , every visitor already gets fingerprinted and photographed the electronic visa , similar to one already in place in australia , would also include a traveler 's biometric data , such as electronic photos and fingerprints . " i will present in february a package of measures aimed at improving the capacity of the eu to protect its external borders , " frattini said at an informal meeting of eu justice and interior ministers in slovenia , the current holder of the bloc 's presidency . the package , which european commission sources said would be submitted to the eu executive on feb.13 , aimed to make a " better use of existing technology " , frattini said . hundreds of thousands of illegal immigrants live in the eu 's 27 member states . " one of the main problems we face now is overstayers - people who enter the eu legally and then disappear because they stay over the allowed period , " frattini said .

overstayers are the factor number one of illegal immigration . " upbeat about schengen expansion managing overstayers has become an increasingly difficult task , particularly since december , when the eu expanded its borderless area to include nine new countries , most of them from eastern europe . the countries joined the so-called schengen agreement amid concerns that its expansion would make it easier for criminals and illegal immigrants to enter the bloc . such concerns have been felt particularly in germany , where there have been widespread reports about scores of chechen refugees with asylum status in poland crossing its eastern border . " none of the fears has come true , " said peter altmaier , state secretary at the german interior ministry .
" as far as we know , schengen is a big success . " eu justice commissioner franco frattini hailed the successes of the enlarged schengen area , noting that the program 's shared database on criminals had since lead to the arrest of " some 100 suspects " in the new member states . frattini added that the influx of chechen refugees into germany and austria showed that there was a pressing need for a common eu policy on asylum , another issue due to be debated by ministers in brdo , near the slovenian capital ljubljana . success or failure ? bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : german federal police now control people in a wide strip along the border slovenian interior minister dragutin mate , whose country currently holds the rotating eu presidency , also said that things looked very good .

24 , that the creation of what he called a " european sports police " would help curb hooligans on both a continental level and a national level and work in conjunction with the legal authorities .
he also said it could help deal with issues such as money laundering and ground closures due to hooliganism and proposed discussing the idea with french interior minister michele alliot-marie before france takes over the rotating eu presidency on july 1 .
ahead of this summer 's european soccer championships in austria and switzerland , platini 's main priority is to police known hooligans from different countries at the continental level .
eu-wide standards police cooperation between the different countries in fact already exists .
in november 2007 , the european commission agreed to part finance a project that would see a specialized police force trained specifically to combat soccer-related violence .
" there is already quite close cooperation between the different police authorities from each country , and that is going to improve as the euro 2008 approaches , " european justice commissioner franco frattini said .
an initial 10 million euros -lrb- $ 14.6 million -rrb- was set aside from the eu budget next year for the training plan , he said .
frattini also presented plans being worked on by eu experts to set up common europe-wide standards on safety and security for sporting events .
the measures include travel bans on blacklisted hooligans , joint eu police teams working at stadiums , coaching fans to prevent violence and new financial aid from the eu for training police .

but he fears that negative influences have infiltrated the world of soccer .
" society has passed other scourges on to the world of sport : money-laundering , match-fixing , illegal betting , racism and xenophobia , doping , child trafficking , " he lamented . dw staff -lrb- jp -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

the evidence against him was based on a telephone conversation in which he was heard to offer his services as a suicide bomber . the complainant argued that the intelligence services ' tapping of his telephones in october and november 2001 was illegal , with his lawyer arguing that indications of planned international terrorist activity was inadequate grounds for supervision .

he managed the company 's us operations from 2002 to 2003 and became ceo in 2005 .
he resigned in 2007 over siemens ' slush fund affair despite having no personal responsibility for the scandal .
in october 2007 , he became chief operating officer at us company alcoa , the world 's second largest producer of aluminum . dw : how are the commodity markets shaping up in light of the current stock and financial market crisis ? bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : klaus kleinfeld klaus kleinfeld : commodity markets are very strongly driven by china 's and asia 's industrialization .
raw materials are needed there because these countries have relatively little of them .
population growth and industrialization are driving forces and that 's going to continue to be the case . the big question is how strong growth will be .
i 'm convinced that this will depend on chances for growth in the developed countries .
but it will still be stronger and better despite of it all .

not even the new german law banning tobacco in public buildings .
anti-smoking advocates are not amused and are pressing charges . " anyone who does n't read is an idiot , " said former chancellor helmut schmidt in an interview for die zeit 's weekly magazine leben on thursday , jan .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de politics -pipe- 25.01.2008 expert : italy must reform its electoral system großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : fewer parties would help italy avoid political crises italy was thrown into crisis on thursday , jan .
24 , when prime minister prodi resigned after losing a senate confidence vote .
dw-world.de spoke to an italian expert about the need to reform the country 's electoral system . professor giovanni guzzetta is a lawyer and lectures in public law at rome 's tor vergata university .
he has been involved in organizing electoral referendums in italy since 1991 and is currently the president of the italian electoral referendum organizing committee . dw-world.de : how do the current italian electoral laws work ? giovanni guzzetta : the electoral laws are based on proportional representation whereby the parties that are politically similar form a coalition .
the coalition that obtains the most votes wins a majority in the parliament . the problem with the current electoral law is that the threshold is very low and so even very small parties can obtain seats and become determining forces in the life of the majority .
this , in turn , can result in a large amount of fragmentation . for example , the political parties today number more than 20 and this produces instability because all governments are forced to negotiate with the various smaller parties . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : prodi won the confidence vote in the chamber of deputies , but not in the senate -lrb- upper house -rrb- what are the two different electoral reforms currently on the agenda ? the first is the one that they are discussing in the parliament .
it aims to raise the threshold to between four to five percent .
this is somewhat inspired by the german system . the other proposal is the subject of a referendum and is supported by 800,000 citizens , as is required by the italian constitution .
it aims to reduce much more drastically the number of parties by eliminating coalitions altogether .
it foresees that each party runs alone and the party that wins is the one that has the majority of votes .
this way , all of the instability of coalition governments would be avoided . you are the president of the italian electoral referendum organizing committee .
will the referendum to change the electoral laws go ahead ? we collected the signatures and we obtained the approval of the constitutional court less than a week ago .
but italian law requires that if early elections are called then a referendum must be delayed for a year .
once a new government is formed , the referendum will go ahead as long as that new government does n't propose its own electoral reform . the current government crisis brings back memories of 1993 when the amato government fell and carlo ciampi -lrb- the former head of the bank of italy who later went on to serve as president of italy and who is currently a senator for life -rrb- was appointed head of a technocratic government with the sole task of changing the electoral laws .
how has the political climate changed since then ? the truth is that the current politicians are very much divided over the electoral law so it will be very difficult to reach a strong enough agreement to make a final decision over the electoral laws .
the most probable outcome will be either early elections or a government that serves only to carry out the referendum . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : prodi failed to keep his center-left coalition from collapsing .
italy has had 61 governments since the end of world war ii .
are italians fed up with these constantly changing governments or do they like politics to be this way ? i believe that a majority of italians are fed up .
a majority of italians realize that italy is destined to a miserable decline if it does n't change its institutions .
for my generation - i 'm 41 years old - italy has been our destiny .
for the next generation , the generation of my children , italy will be a choice between many other possibilities : my children can choose to live in italy , germany or spain , for example . if italy does n't have the equipment to be a country that is upward-moving , well-governed , with services that function and with stable institutions , it risks losing ground with respect to other countries . what must happen in italy to ensure stable governments in the future ? you need big changes within the political class .
the political class was shaped culturally in the era of the cold war , but things need to change .
the institutions need to become more competitive and more stable .
you need changes that strengthen the power of citizens and give more responsibility and stability to governments . so not only electoral reform is needed but also changes to the political parties ? the renewal of the parties would also mean changing the constitution , but in the meantime the electoral reform is a really important step . interview : stephanie raison send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

24 , when prime minister prodi resigned after losing a senate confidence vote .
dw-world.de spoke to an italian expert about the need to reform the country 's electoral system . professor giovanni guzzetta is a lawyer and lectures in public law at rome 's tor vergata university .
he has been involved in organizing electoral referendums in italy since 1991 and is currently the president of the italian electoral referendum organizing committee . dw-world.de : how do the current italian electoral laws work ? giovanni guzzetta : the electoral laws are based on proportional representation whereby the parties that are politically similar form a coalition .
the coalition that obtains the most votes wins a majority in the parliament . the problem with the current electoral law is that the threshold is very low and so even very small parties can obtain seats and become determining forces in the life of the majority .
this , in turn , can result in a large amount of fragmentation . for example , the political parties today number more than 20 and this produces instability because all governments are forced to negotiate with the various smaller parties . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : prodi won the confidence vote in the chamber of deputies , but not in the senate -lrb- upper house -rrb- what are the two different electoral reforms currently on the agenda ? the first is the one that they are discussing in the parliament .
it aims to raise the threshold to between four to five percent .
this is somewhat inspired by the german system . the other proposal is the subject of a referendum and is supported by 800,000 citizens , as is required by the italian constitution .
it aims to reduce much more drastically the number of parties by eliminating coalitions altogether .
it foresees that each party runs alone and the party that wins is the one that has the majority of votes .
this way , all of the instability of coalition governments would be avoided . you are the president of the italian electoral referendum organizing committee .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de politics -pipe- 25.01.2008 expert : italy must reform its electoral system großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : fewer parties would help italy avoid political crises italy was thrown into crisis on thursday , jan .
24 , when prime minister prodi resigned after losing a senate confidence vote .
dw-world.de spoke to an italian expert about the need to reform the country 's electoral system . professor giovanni guzzetta is a lawyer and lectures in public law at rome 's tor vergata university .
he has been involved in organizing electoral referendums in italy since 1991 and is currently the president of the italian electoral referendum organizing committee . dw-world.de : how do the current italian electoral laws work ? giovanni guzzetta : the electoral laws are based on proportional representation whereby the parties that are politically similar form a coalition .
the coalition that obtains the most votes wins a majority in the parliament . the problem with the current electoral law is that the threshold is very low and so even very small parties can obtain seats and become determining forces in the life of the majority .
this , in turn , can result in a large amount of fragmentation . for example , the political parties today number more than 20 and this produces instability because all governments are forced to negotiate with the various smaller parties . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : prodi won the confidence vote in the chamber of deputies , but not in the senate -lrb- upper house -rrb- what are the two different electoral reforms currently on the agenda ? the first is the one that they are discussing in the parliament .
it aims to raise the threshold to between four to five percent .
this is somewhat inspired by the german system . the other proposal is the subject of a referendum and is supported by 800,000 citizens , as is required by the italian constitution .
it aims to reduce much more drastically the number of parties by eliminating coalitions altogether .
it foresees that each party runs alone and the party that wins is the one that has the majority of votes .
this way , all of the instability of coalition governments would be avoided . you are the president of the italian electoral referendum organizing committee .
will the referendum to change the electoral laws go ahead ? we collected the signatures and we obtained the approval of the constitutional court less than a week ago .
but italian law requires that if early elections are called then a referendum must be delayed for a year .
once a new government is formed , the referendum will go ahead as long as that new government does n't propose its own electoral reform . the current government crisis brings back memories of 1993 when the amato government fell and carlo ciampi -lrb- the former head of the bank of italy who later went on to serve as president of italy and who is currently a senator for life -rrb- was appointed head of a technocratic government with the sole task of changing the electoral laws .
how has the political climate changed since then ? the truth is that the current politicians are very much divided over the electoral law so it will be very difficult to reach a strong enough agreement to make a final decision over the electoral laws .
the most probable outcome will be either early elections or a government that serves only to carry out the referendum . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : prodi failed to keep his center-left coalition from collapsing .
italy has had 61 governments since the end of world war ii .
are italians fed up with these constantly changing governments or do they like politics to be this way ? i believe that a majority of italians are fed up .
a majority of italians realize that italy is destined to a miserable decline if it does n't change its institutions .
for my generation - i 'm 41 years old - italy has been our destiny .
for the next generation , the generation of my children , italy will be a choice between many other possibilities : my children can choose to live in italy , germany or spain , for example . if italy does n't have the equipment to be a country that is upward-moving , well-governed , with services that function and with stable institutions , it risks losing ground with respect to other countries . what must happen in italy to ensure stable governments in the future ? you need big changes within the political class .
the political class was shaped culturally in the era of the cold war , but things need to change .
the institutions need to become more competitive and more stable .
you need changes that strengthen the power of citizens and give more responsibility and stability to governments . so not only electoral reform is needed but also changes to the political parties ? the renewal of the parties would also mean changing the constitution , but in the meantime the electoral reform is a really important step . interview : stephanie raison send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

24 , that the german intelligence agency -lrb- bnd -rrb- can bug the telephones of suspected terrorists even when there is no immediate threat to germany .
the possibility that " sleepers " in germany are involved in plans for international attacks is sufficient grounds for strategic monitoring , the court decided . according to the parliamentary control committee -lrb- pkg -rrb- , the bnd employed strategic monitoring tactics some 24,400 times , with 21 cases considered relevant to the intelligence services . no national restraints bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : intelligence can tap phone lines when an international terrorist threat is looming the case had been brought by a man currently serving time in a cologne jail for terrorist activities .
in october 2005 , a düsseldorf court sentenced him to eight years behind bars for his involvement in the al-tawhid organization .
the evidence against him was based on a telephone conversation in which he was heard to offer his services as a suicide bomber . the complainant argued that the intelligence services ' tapping of his telephones in october and november 2001 was illegal , with his lawyer arguing that indications of planned international terrorist activity was inadequate grounds for supervision .

" from today 's perspective , i realize it was bizarre lunacy , " he told the court as the trial drew to a close .

pleased with the state of things after opening borders in the european union 's eastern region , officials are considering an electronic entry and exit register designed to track down illegal immigrants . eu justice commissioner franco frattini said on friday , jan .
25 , that the register would be similar to the electronic scanning of fingerprints and eyes at us ports of entry .
he added that it would be part of a series of eu initiatives seeking to use modern technology to target overstayers - third-country nationals who enter the eu legally but then become illegal immigrants by extending their stay beyond their visa expiry date . frattini also wants to improve the bloc 's fight against illegal immigrants by replacing its current visa system with an electronic travel authorization -lrb- eta -rrb- . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : in the us , every visitor already gets fingerprinted and photographed the electronic visa , similar to one already in place in australia , would also include a traveler 's biometric data , such as electronic photos and fingerprints . " i will present in february a package of measures aimed at improving the capacity of the eu to protect its external borders , " frattini said at an informal meeting of eu justice and interior ministers in slovenia , the current holder of the bloc 's presidency . the package , which european commission sources said would be submitted to the eu executive on feb.13 , aimed to make a " better use of existing technology " , frattini said . hundreds of thousands of illegal immigrants live in the eu 's 27 member states . " one of the main problems we face now is overstayers - people who enter the eu legally and then disappear because they stay over the allowed period , " frattini said .
" this can not be tolerated .
overstayers are the factor number one of illegal immigration . " upbeat about schengen expansion managing overstayers has become an increasingly difficult task , particularly since december , when the eu expanded its borderless area to include nine new countries , most of them from eastern europe . the countries joined the so-called schengen agreement amid concerns that its expansion would make it easier for criminals and illegal immigrants to enter the bloc . such concerns have been felt particularly in germany , where there have been widespread reports about scores of chechen refugees with asylum status in poland crossing its eastern border . " none of the fears has come true , " said peter altmaier , state secretary at the german interior ministry .
" as far as we know , schengen is a big success . " eu justice commissioner franco frattini hailed the successes of the enlarged schengen area , noting that the program 's shared database on criminals had since lead to the arrest of " some 100 suspects " in the new member states . frattini added that the influx of chechen refugees into germany and austria showed that there was a pressing need for a common eu policy on asylum , another issue due to be debated by ministers in brdo , near the slovenian capital ljubljana . success or failure ? bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : german federal police now control people in a wide strip along the border slovenian interior minister dragutin mate , whose country currently holds the rotating eu presidency , also said that things looked very good .
he said that slovenian border patrol alone had confiscated 140 stolen vehicles and prevented 1,700 people on eu blacklists from entering the bloc . germany 's police union meanwhile on wednesday said that border patrols had stopped 564 foreigners without visa along germany 's borders with poland and the czech republic since border controls fell on dec .
21 , an increase of 150 percent when compared to the year before . altmaier conceded that more chechens had come to germany in the first two weeks after the border fell , but added that they had been returned to poland , the eu country they had first entered .
according to eu rules , asylum seekers are dealt with in the country they first enter . " these are normal procedures , " he said . debate on passenger data sharing bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : should the eu share passenger data ?
european union justice and interior ministers were also expected to discuss plans to share airline passengers ' data in a bid to prevent terrorists from entering the 27-member bloc . the so-called european passenger name record -lrb- pnr -rrb- would be modeled according to a similar system introduced by the united states in the aftermath of the sept .
11 , 2001 attacks . " terrorism remains the number one threat , " frattini said . frattini , who first floated the idea over the summer , said a european pnr was " absolutely necessary " and should therefore be adopted " as soon as possible . " but his plans have been met with resistance from civil liberties ' advocates , who fear that collecting details about a person 's travel arrangements in and out of the eu would violate their privacy . details about a traveler 's airline ticket , including how it was paid for , would be shared among all eu member states , as well as with third countries such as the us .
the eu insists it will not divulge sensitive information about a traveler 's ethnic origins or political and religious beliefs . dw staff -lrb- win -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

pleased with the state of things after opening borders in the european union 's eastern region , officials are considering an electronic entry and exit register designed to track down illegal immigrants . eu justice commissioner franco frattini said on friday , jan .
25 , that the register would be similar to the electronic scanning of fingerprints and eyes at us ports of entry .
he added that it would be part of a series of eu initiatives seeking to use modern technology to target overstayers - third-country nationals who enter the eu legally but then become illegal immigrants by extending their stay beyond their visa expiry date . frattini also wants to improve the bloc 's fight against illegal immigrants by replacing its current visa system with an electronic travel authorization -lrb- eta -rrb- . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : in the us , every visitor already gets fingerprinted and photographed the electronic visa , similar to one already in place in australia , would also include a traveler 's biometric data , such as electronic photos and fingerprints . " i will present in february a package of measures aimed at improving the capacity of the eu to protect its external borders , " frattini said at an informal meeting of eu justice and interior ministers in slovenia , the current holder of the bloc 's presidency . the package , which european commission sources said would be submitted to the eu executive on feb.13 , aimed to make a " better use of existing technology " , frattini said . hundreds of thousands of illegal immigrants live in the eu 's 27 member states . " one of the main problems we face now is overstayers - people who enter the eu legally and then disappear because they stay over the allowed period , " frattini said .
" this can not be tolerated .
overstayers are the factor number one of illegal immigration . " upbeat about schengen expansion managing overstayers has become an increasingly difficult task , particularly since december , when the eu expanded its borderless area to include nine new countries , most of them from eastern europe . the countries joined the so-called schengen agreement amid concerns that its expansion would make it easier for criminals and illegal immigrants to enter the bloc . such concerns have been felt particularly in germany , where there have been widespread reports about scores of chechen refugees with asylum status in poland crossing its eastern border . " none of the fears has come true , " said peter altmaier , state secretary at the german interior ministry .
" as far as we know , schengen is a big success . " eu justice commissioner franco frattini hailed the successes of the enlarged schengen area , noting that the program 's shared database on criminals had since lead to the arrest of " some 100 suspects " in the new member states . frattini added that the influx of chechen refugees into germany and austria showed that there was a pressing need for a common eu policy on asylum , another issue due to be debated by ministers in brdo , near the slovenian capital ljubljana . success or failure ? bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : german federal police now control people in a wide strip along the border slovenian interior minister dragutin mate , whose country currently holds the rotating eu presidency , also said that things looked very good .
he said that slovenian border patrol alone had confiscated 140 stolen vehicles and prevented 1,700 people on eu blacklists from entering the bloc . germany 's police union meanwhile on wednesday said that border patrols had stopped 564 foreigners without visa along germany 's borders with poland and the czech republic since border controls fell on dec .
21 , an increase of 150 percent when compared to the year before . altmaier conceded that more chechens had come to germany in the first two weeks after the border fell , but added that they had been returned to poland , the eu country they had first entered .
according to eu rules , asylum seekers are dealt with in the country they first enter . " these are normal procedures , " he said . debate on passenger data sharing bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : should the eu share passenger data ?
european union justice and interior ministers were also expected to discuss plans to share airline passengers ' data in a bid to prevent terrorists from entering the 27-member bloc . the so-called european passenger name record -lrb- pnr -rrb- would be modeled according to a similar system introduced by the united states in the aftermath of the sept .
11 , 2001 attacks . " terrorism remains the number one threat , " frattini said . frattini , who first floated the idea over the summer , said a european pnr was " absolutely necessary " and should therefore be adopted " as soon as possible . " but his plans have been met with resistance from civil liberties ' advocates , who fear that collecting details about a person 's travel arrangements in and out of the eu would violate their privacy . details about a traveler 's airline ticket , including how it was paid for , would be shared among all eu member states , as well as with third countries such as the us .
the eu insists it will not divulge sensitive information about a traveler 's ethnic origins or political and religious beliefs . dw staff -lrb- win -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

" the backroom boy turned ' vanilla ' futures trader who lost 4.9 billion euros -lrb- $ 7.2 billion -rrb- for socgen shows just how easy it is to dupe " sophisticated systems of checks and balances , wrote london 's financial times on thursday , jan .
24 , in its online edition .
" at one level the abuse at socgen is another example of a european bank trying to emulate wall street 's finest , but coming unstuck because of a failure in risk control . " but it is also true that as long as human nature remains what it is - and dealers are rewarded for making profits and fired for failure - then deception will always be a risk , " continued the paper . the case could " yet prove terminal " for societe generale , concluded the financial times and " a take-over attempt by one or more of its rivals must be a possibility . " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : one french paper saw italy 's unicredit as a potential buyer french financial publication les echos on thursday agreed that a buy-out was likely .
" it 's become booty in a banking landscape that has been shaken up by the unfortunate american mortgage crisis and put back in order , " the paper commented .
" if its long-time competitor bnp paribas does n't snap at the chance , another large european bank could - like unicredit in italy , for example . " in the us , a bank would have to replace its president in a similar situation , opined the paper , but the consequence for societe generale is likely to be a " loss of independence . " writing from munich on thursday , the süddeutsche zeitung predicted that the french bank would survive the crisis , as " the government wo n't allow it to collapse . " apparently investors attribute the losses to the criminal behavior of an individual and do n't see a connection to the credit crisis , " wrote the german paper .
nevertheless , " the case has further undermined trust in the financial branch , without which it can not fulfill its important role in the economy . " although fraud can not be rule out , banks and controllers should be responsible for " keeping the risks as small as possible , " concluded the paper . paris ' le figaro in its thursday edition agreed that " bankers are urgently called upon to stringently and uncompromisingly build up their control systems for risky businesses " and that the " stock exchange supervisory should adjust their tools to meet the requirements of the modern financial world . " this unbelievable affair adds to the mistrust that has ruined the reputation of the financial world since the beginning of the us mortgage crisis , " the french paper concluded . dw staff -lrb- kjb -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

he managed the company 's us operations from 2002 to 2003 and became ceo in 2005 .
he resigned in 2007 over siemens ' slush fund affair despite having no personal responsibility for the scandal .
in october 2007 , he became chief operating officer at us company alcoa , the world 's second largest producer of aluminum . dw : how are the commodity markets shaping up in light of the current stock and financial market crisis ? bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : klaus kleinfeld klaus kleinfeld : commodity markets are very strongly driven by china 's and asia 's industrialization .
raw materials are needed there because these countries have relatively little of them .
population growth and industrialization are driving forces and that 's going to continue to be the case . the big question is how strong growth will be .
i 'm convinced that this will depend on chances for growth in the developed countries .
but it will still be stronger and better despite of it all .
that 's why the scarcity of raw materials will continue since they 'll continue to be in high demand .
that 's positive news for alcoa . why ?
because prices will remain on a high level with continuing strong demand ? it 's a growth business and i 'm saying that prices will develop in a positive , stable way . which markets are up and coming ?
what role does africa play ? bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : africa remains mainly interesting because of its raw materials africa is definitely an issue .
africa continues to be more of an issue in terms of delivering raw materials rather than using them .
i sincerely hope that africa , which has long been called a forgotten continent , will strongly profit from this and experience a stronger industrialization .
this can already be very much seen in south africa and in some northern african countries . here in davos , people are talking intensively behind the scenes about continuing talks on global free trade .
at the same time , there 's currently a global trend - also in europe and germany - to protect markets .
do you think that 's a good thing ? no , i think it 's missing the point .
i believe that there 's nothing that has contributed and led to global wealth over the past 20 years more than the opening of markets .
germany especially profited from this as an export-oriented country - probably more than most others .
that 's why people would hurt themselves with this .
one can only hope that these trends wo n't take over . what can be done to overcome the current economic crisis ? i think the recipe is always the same .
competitiveness has to be fostered , including an increased flexibility and people have to be careful to stay on a course of innovation .
that 's always been - and will hopefully always be - one of the greatest strengths of the german economy .
but needless to say , you ca n't completely separate that from costs and the challenges that come with it . interview : marco vollmar -lrb- win -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

pleased with the state of things after opening borders in the european union 's eastern region , officials are considering an electronic entry and exit register designed to track down illegal immigrants . eu justice commissioner franco frattini said on friday , jan .
25 , that the register would be similar to the electronic scanning of fingerprints and eyes at us ports of entry .
he added that it would be part of a series of eu initiatives seeking to use modern technology to target overstayers - third-country nationals who enter the eu legally but then become illegal immigrants by extending their stay beyond their visa expiry date . frattini also wants to improve the bloc 's fight against illegal immigrants by replacing its current visa system with an electronic travel authorization -lrb- eta -rrb- . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : in the us , every visitor already gets fingerprinted and photographed the electronic visa , similar to one already in place in australia , would also include a traveler 's biometric data , such as electronic photos and fingerprints . " i will present in february a package of measures aimed at improving the capacity of the eu to protect its external borders , " frattini said at an informal meeting of eu justice and interior ministers in slovenia , the current holder of the bloc 's presidency . the package , which european commission sources said would be submitted to the eu executive on feb.13 , aimed to make a " better use of existing technology " , frattini said . hundreds of thousands of illegal immigrants live in the eu 's 27 member states . " one of the main problems we face now is overstayers - people who enter the eu legally and then disappear because they stay over the allowed period , " frattini said .
" this can not be tolerated .
overstayers are the factor number one of illegal immigration . " upbeat about schengen expansion managing overstayers has become an increasingly difficult task , particularly since december , when the eu expanded its borderless area to include nine new countries , most of them from eastern europe . the countries joined the so-called schengen agreement amid concerns that its expansion would make it easier for criminals and illegal immigrants to enter the bloc . such concerns have been felt particularly in germany , where there have been widespread reports about scores of chechen refugees with asylum status in poland crossing its eastern border . " none of the fears has come true , " said peter altmaier , state secretary at the german interior ministry .
" as far as we know , schengen is a big success . " eu justice commissioner franco frattini hailed the successes of the enlarged schengen area , noting that the program 's shared database on criminals had since lead to the arrest of " some 100 suspects " in the new member states . frattini added that the influx of chechen refugees into germany and austria showed that there was a pressing need for a common eu policy on asylum , another issue due to be debated by ministers in brdo , near the slovenian capital ljubljana . success or failure ? bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : german federal police now control people in a wide strip along the border slovenian interior minister dragutin mate , whose country currently holds the rotating eu presidency , also said that things looked very good .
he said that slovenian border patrol alone had confiscated 140 stolen vehicles and prevented 1,700 people on eu blacklists from entering the bloc . germany 's police union meanwhile on wednesday said that border patrols had stopped 564 foreigners without visa along germany 's borders with poland and the czech republic since border controls fell on dec .
21 , an increase of 150 percent when compared to the year before . altmaier conceded that more chechens had come to germany in the first two weeks after the border fell , but added that they had been returned to poland , the eu country they had first entered .
according to eu rules , asylum seekers are dealt with in the country they first enter . " these are normal procedures , " he said . debate on passenger data sharing bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : should the eu share passenger data ?
european union justice and interior ministers were also expected to discuss plans to share airline passengers ' data in a bid to prevent terrorists from entering the 27-member bloc . the so-called european passenger name record -lrb- pnr -rrb- would be modeled according to a similar system introduced by the united states in the aftermath of the sept .
11 , 2001 attacks . " terrorism remains the number one threat , " frattini said . frattini , who first floated the idea over the summer , said a european pnr was " absolutely necessary " and should therefore be adopted " as soon as possible .

" the backroom boy turned ' vanilla ' futures trader who lost 4.9 billion euros -lrb- $ 7.2 billion -rrb- for socgen shows just how easy it is to dupe " sophisticated systems of checks and balances , wrote london 's financial times on thursday , jan .
24 , in its online edition .
" at one level the abuse at socgen is another example of a european bank trying to emulate wall street 's finest , but coming unstuck because of a failure in risk control . " but it is also true that as long as human nature remains what it is - and dealers are rewarded for making profits and fired for failure - then deception will always be a risk , " continued the paper . the case could " yet prove terminal " for societe generale , concluded the financial times and " a take-over attempt by one or more of its rivals must be a possibility . " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : one french paper saw italy 's unicredit as a potential buyer french financial publication les echos on thursday agreed that a buy-out was likely .
" it 's become booty in a banking landscape that has been shaken up by the unfortunate american mortgage crisis and put back in order , " the paper commented .
" if its long-time competitor bnp paribas does n't snap at the chance , another large european bank could - like unicredit in italy , for example . " in the us , a bank would have to replace its president in a similar situation , opined the paper , but the consequence for societe generale is likely to be a " loss of independence . " writing from munich on thursday , the süddeutsche zeitung predicted that the french bank would survive the crisis , as " the government wo n't allow it to collapse . " apparently investors attribute the losses to the criminal behavior of an individual and do n't see a connection to the credit crisis , " wrote the german paper .
nevertheless , " the case has further undermined trust in the financial branch , without which it can not fulfill its important role in the economy . " although fraud can not be rule out , banks and controllers should be responsible for " keeping the risks as small as possible , " concluded the paper . paris ' le figaro in its thursday edition agreed that " bankers are urgently called upon to stringently and uncompromisingly build up their control systems for risky businesses " and that the " stock exchange supervisory should adjust their tools to meet the requirements of the modern financial world . " this unbelievable affair adds to the mistrust that has ruined the reputation of the financial world since the beginning of the us mortgage crisis , " the french paper concluded . dw staff -lrb- kjb -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de agriculture -pipe- 25.01.2008 consumers concerned by new gene technology law großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : consumers have a choice between gm and conventional products the bundestag is set friday , jan .
25 , to pass a gene technology law , while last week saw the introduction of a new non-gm label .
consumers are under the impression that gm food has become an unavoidable fact of life . just how many of the products on germany supermarket shelves are genetically modified ?
both skeptics and supporters of gene technology like to make out that gm crops are everywhere .
to the former , this would be an argument for introducing stricter regulations , for the latter , proof that gene technology is safe , increases production and lowers the cost of food . in fact , even though a not inconsiderable amount of agricultural land is earmarked for gm crops , the critics ' prediction that they would take over the world is greatly exaggerated .
just 6 percent - 102 million hectares - of agricultural land around the world produces gm crops . germany had just 2,700 hectares given over to gm crops in 2007 , which amounts to less than 0.1 percent of its entire agricultural land . european reservations bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : some argue that gene technology promises higher yields it 's a different story in the us , which devotes 55 million hectares of farmland to gm crops .
canada , argentina , brazil , china and india are also enthusiastic advocates of genetic modification . europe is less keen .
this stems partly from legal restrictions but also has to do with agricultural structures . " use of genetically modified seed is only worth it in regions where the fields are very large , because it is so expensive , " said heike moldenhauer from friends of the earth germany .
in these cases , the fact that gm crops are highly resistant to pests and damage reduces the chances of a failed harvest .
with smaller fields , these advantages are less crucial . the same principle applies in germany .
gm crops are grown almost exclusively in the former east germany , where fields are larger than they are in the western part of the country .
according to statistics compiled by the german office for consumer protection and food safety , the highest proportion of gm crops care to be found in brandenburg , saxony and mecklenburg-western pommerania . germany permits the import of gm crops , but only monsanto 's modified corn seed mon 810 may be grown in the european union .
other gm seed is used all over the world , including corn , rapeseed , cotton and soybean . allying consumer fears bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : consumers want to make informed choices nonetheless , 80 percent of the genetically modified products cultivated by the world 's farmers rarely end up directly in the consumers ' kitchens .
the bulk of it is used for animal feed after brussels banned use of processed animal protein in animal feed and european farmers largely switched to low-cost gm soybean . ultimately , consumers determined to avoid gm food should steer clear of animal products such as milk , meat and eggs .
but they can rest assured that the remaining 20 percent of gm crops being grown are destined for t-shirts and jeans .
for the time being , there are still plenty of alternatives to genetically modified tomatoes and potatoes in germany 's supermarkets . leila knüppel -lrb- jp -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?
dw-world.de berlin agrees on new gm labeling law - but how strict is it ?

24 , that the creation of what he called a " european sports police " would help curb hooligans on both a continental level and a national level and work in conjunction with the legal authorities .
he also said it could help deal with issues such as money laundering and ground closures due to hooliganism and proposed discussing the idea with french interior minister michele alliot-marie before france takes over the rotating eu presidency on july 1 .
ahead of this summer 's european soccer championships in austria and switzerland , platini 's main priority is to police known hooligans from different countries at the continental level .
eu-wide standards police cooperation between the different countries in fact already exists .
in november 2007 , the european commission agreed to part finance a project that would see a specialized police force trained specifically to combat soccer-related violence .
" there is already quite close cooperation between the different police authorities from each country , and that is going to improve as the euro 2008 approaches , " european justice commissioner franco frattini said .
an initial 10 million euros -lrb- $ 14.6 million -rrb- was set aside from the eu budget next year for the training plan , he said .
frattini also presented plans being worked on by eu experts to set up common europe-wide standards on safety and security for sporting events .
the measures include travel bans on blacklisted hooligans , joint eu police teams working at stadiums , coaching fans to prevent violence and new financial aid from the eu for training police .

he managed the company 's us operations from 2002 to 2003 and became ceo in 2005 .
he resigned in 2007 over siemens ' slush fund affair despite having no personal responsibility for the scandal .
in october 2007 , he became chief operating officer at us company alcoa , the world 's second largest producer of aluminum . dw : how are the commodity markets shaping up in light of the current stock and financial market crisis ? bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : klaus kleinfeld klaus kleinfeld : commodity markets are very strongly driven by china 's and asia 's industrialization .
raw materials are needed there because these countries have relatively little of them .
population growth and industrialization are driving forces and that 's going to continue to be the case . the big question is how strong growth will be .
i 'm convinced that this will depend on chances for growth in the developed countries .
but it will still be stronger and better despite of it all .
that 's why the scarcity of raw materials will continue since they 'll continue to be in high demand .
that 's positive news for alcoa . why ?
because prices will remain on a high level with continuing strong demand ? it 's a growth business and i 'm saying that prices will develop in a positive , stable way . which markets are up and coming ?
what role does africa play ? bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : africa remains mainly interesting because of its raw materials africa is definitely an issue .
africa continues to be more of an issue in terms of delivering raw materials rather than using them .
i sincerely hope that africa , which has long been called a forgotten continent , will strongly profit from this and experience a stronger industrialization .
this can already be very much seen in south africa and in some northern african countries . here in davos , people are talking intensively behind the scenes about continuing talks on global free trade .
at the same time , there 's currently a global trend - also in europe and germany - to protect markets .
do you think that 's a good thing ? no , i think it 's missing the point .
i believe that there 's nothing that has contributed and led to global wealth over the past 20 years more than the opening of markets .
germany especially profited from this as an export-oriented country - probably more than most others .
that 's why people would hurt themselves with this .
one can only hope that these trends wo n't take over . what can be done to overcome the current economic crisis ? i think the recipe is always the same .
competitiveness has to be fostered , including an increased flexibility and people have to be careful to stay on a course of innovation .
that 's always been - and will hopefully always be - one of the greatest strengths of the german economy .
but needless to say , you ca n't completely separate that from costs and the challenges that come with it . interview : marco vollmar -lrb- win -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

i 'm convinced that this will depend on chances for growth in the developed countries .
but it will still be stronger and better despite of it all .
that 's why the scarcity of raw materials will continue since they 'll continue to be in high demand .
that 's positive news for alcoa . why ?
because prices will remain on a high level with continuing strong demand ? it 's a growth business and i 'm saying that prices will develop in a positive , stable way . which markets are up and coming ?
what role does africa play ? bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : africa remains mainly interesting because of its raw materials africa is definitely an issue .
africa continues to be more of an issue in terms of delivering raw materials rather than using them .
i sincerely hope that africa , which has long been called a forgotten continent , will strongly profit from this and experience a stronger industrialization .
this can already be very much seen in south africa and in some northern african countries . here in davos , people are talking intensively behind the scenes about continuing talks on global free trade .
at the same time , there 's currently a global trend - also in europe and germany - to protect markets .
do you think that 's a good thing ? no , i think it 's missing the point .
i believe that there 's nothing that has contributed and led to global wealth over the past 20 years more than the opening of markets .
germany especially profited from this as an export-oriented country - probably more than most others .
that 's why people would hurt themselves with this .
one can only hope that these trends wo n't take over . what can be done to overcome the current economic crisis ? i think the recipe is always the same .
competitiveness has to be fostered , including an increased flexibility and people have to be careful to stay on a course of innovation .

" the backroom boy turned ' vanilla ' futures trader who lost 4.9 billion euros -lrb- $ 7.2 billion -rrb- for socgen shows just how easy it is to dupe " sophisticated systems of checks and balances , wrote london 's financial times on thursday , jan .
24 , in its online edition .
" at one level the abuse at socgen is another example of a european bank trying to emulate wall street 's finest , but coming unstuck because of a failure in risk control . " but it is also true that as long as human nature remains what it is - and dealers are rewarded for making profits and fired for failure - then deception will always be a risk , " continued the paper . the case could " yet prove terminal " for societe generale , concluded the financial times and " a take-over attempt by one or more of its rivals must be a possibility . " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : one french paper saw italy 's unicredit as a potential buyer french financial publication les echos on thursday agreed that a buy-out was likely .
" it 's become booty in a banking landscape that has been shaken up by the unfortunate american mortgage crisis and put back in order , " the paper commented .
" if its long-time competitor bnp paribas does n't snap at the chance , another large european bank could - like unicredit in italy , for example . " in the us , a bank would have to replace its president in a similar situation , opined the paper , but the consequence for societe generale is likely to be a " loss of independence . " writing from munich on thursday , the süddeutsche zeitung predicted that the french bank would survive the crisis , as " the government wo n't allow it to collapse . " apparently investors attribute the losses to the criminal behavior of an individual and do n't see a connection to the credit crisis , " wrote the german paper .
nevertheless , " the case has further undermined trust in the financial branch , without which it can not fulfill its important role in the economy . " although fraud can not be rule out , banks and controllers should be responsible for " keeping the risks as small as possible , " concluded the paper . paris ' le figaro in its thursday edition agreed that " bankers are urgently called upon to stringently and uncompromisingly build up their control systems for risky businesses " and that the " stock exchange supervisory should adjust their tools to meet the requirements of the modern financial world .

the evidence against him was based on a telephone conversation in which he was heard to offer his services as a suicide bomber . the complainant argued that the intelligence services ' tapping of his telephones in october and november 2001 was illegal , with his lawyer arguing that indications of planned international terrorist activity was inadequate grounds for supervision .

" from today 's perspective , i realize it was bizarre lunacy , " he told the court as the trial drew to a close .
" i just do n't understand how i ever got involved in it .

24 , when prime minister prodi resigned after losing a senate confidence vote .
dw-world.de spoke to an italian expert about the need to reform the country 's electoral system . professor giovanni guzzetta is a lawyer and lectures in public law at rome 's tor vergata university .
he has been involved in organizing electoral referendums in italy since 1991 and is currently the president of the italian electoral referendum organizing committee . dw-world.de : how do the current italian electoral laws work ? giovanni guzzetta : the electoral laws are based on proportional representation whereby the parties that are politically similar form a coalition .
the coalition that obtains the most votes wins a majority in the parliament . the problem with the current electoral law is that the threshold is very low and so even very small parties can obtain seats and become determining forces in the life of the majority .
this , in turn , can result in a large amount of fragmentation . for example , the political parties today number more than 20 and this produces instability because all governments are forced to negotiate with the various smaller parties . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : prodi won the confidence vote in the chamber of deputies , but not in the senate -lrb- upper house -rrb- what are the two different electoral reforms currently on the agenda ? the first is the one that they are discussing in the parliament .
it aims to raise the threshold to between four to five percent .
this is somewhat inspired by the german system . the other proposal is the subject of a referendum and is supported by 800,000 citizens , as is required by the italian constitution .
it aims to reduce much more drastically the number of parties by eliminating coalitions altogether .
it foresees that each party runs alone and the party that wins is the one that has the majority of votes .
this way , all of the instability of coalition governments would be avoided . you are the president of the italian electoral referendum organizing committee .
will the referendum to change the electoral laws go ahead ? we collected the signatures and we obtained the approval of the constitutional court less than a week ago .
but italian law requires that if early elections are called then a referendum must be delayed for a year .
once a new government is formed , the referendum will go ahead as long as that new government does n't propose its own electoral reform . the current government crisis brings back memories of 1993 when the amato government fell and carlo ciampi -lrb- the former head of the bank of italy who later went on to serve as president of italy and who is currently a senator for life -rrb- was appointed head of a technocratic government with the sole task of changing the electoral laws .
how has the political climate changed since then ? the truth is that the current politicians are very much divided over the electoral law so it will be very difficult to reach a strong enough agreement to make a final decision over the electoral laws .
the most probable outcome will be either early elections or a government that serves only to carry out the referendum . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : prodi failed to keep his center-left coalition from collapsing .
italy has had 61 governments since the end of world war ii .
are italians fed up with these constantly changing governments or do they like politics to be this way ? i believe that a majority of italians are fed up .
a majority of italians realize that italy is destined to a miserable decline if it does n't change its institutions .
for my generation - i 'm 41 years old - italy has been our destiny .
for the next generation , the generation of my children , italy will be a choice between many other possibilities : my children can choose to live in italy , germany or spain , for example . if italy does n't have the equipment to be a country that is upward-moving , well-governed , with services that function and with stable institutions , it risks losing ground with respect to other countries . what must happen in italy to ensure stable governments in the future ? you need big changes within the political class .
the political class was shaped culturally in the era of the cold war , but things need to change .
the institutions need to become more competitive and more stable .
you need changes that strengthen the power of citizens and give more responsibility and stability to governments . so not only electoral reform is needed but also changes to the political parties ? the renewal of the parties would also mean changing the constitution , but in the meantime the electoral reform is a really important step . interview : stephanie raison send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

24 , that the creation of what he called a " european sports police " would help curb hooligans on both a continental level and a national level and work in conjunction with the legal authorities .
he also said it could help deal with issues such as money laundering and ground closures due to hooliganism and proposed discussing the idea with french interior minister michele alliot-marie before france takes over the rotating eu presidency on july 1 .
ahead of this summer 's european soccer championships in austria and switzerland , platini 's main priority is to police known hooligans from different countries at the continental level .
eu-wide standards police cooperation between the different countries in fact already exists .
in november 2007 , the european commission agreed to part finance a project that would see a specialized police force trained specifically to combat soccer-related violence .
" there is already quite close cooperation between the different police authorities from each country , and that is going to improve as the euro 2008 approaches , " european justice commissioner franco frattini said .
an initial 10 million euros -lrb- $ 14.6 million -rrb- was set aside from the eu budget next year for the training plan , he said .
frattini also presented plans being worked on by eu experts to set up common europe-wide standards on safety and security for sporting events .
the measures include travel bans on blacklisted hooligans , joint eu police teams working at stadiums , coaching fans to prevent violence and new financial aid from the eu for training police .
powerful catalyst bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : soccer is dogged by the hooligan problem speaking at the council of europe 's winter parliamentary assembly in strasbourg on thursday , platini expressed fears that soccer 's core social and cultural values were being eroded .
" european sport has always been a powerful catalyst for social and cultural integration , " he said .
but he fears that negative influences have infiltrated the world of soccer .
" society has passed other scourges on to the world of sport : money-laundering , match-fixing , illegal betting , racism and xenophobia , doping , child trafficking , " he lamented . dw staff -lrb- jp -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

he added that it would be part of a series of eu initiatives seeking to use modern technology to target overstayers - third-country nationals who enter the eu legally but then become illegal immigrants by extending their stay beyond their visa expiry date . frattini also wants to improve the bloc 's fight against illegal immigrants by replacing its current visa system with an electronic travel authorization -lrb- eta -rrb- . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : in the us , every visitor already gets fingerprinted and photographed the electronic visa , similar to one already in place in australia , would also include a traveler 's biometric data , such as electronic photos and fingerprints . " i will present in february a package of measures aimed at improving the capacity of the eu to protect its external borders , " frattini said at an informal meeting of eu justice and interior ministers in slovenia , the current holder of the bloc 's presidency . the package , which european commission sources said would be submitted to the eu executive on feb.13 , aimed to make a " better use of existing technology " , frattini said . hundreds of thousands of illegal immigrants live in the eu 's 27 member states . " one of the main problems we face now is overstayers - people who enter the eu legally and then disappear because they stay over the allowed period , " frattini said .
" this can not be tolerated .
overstayers are the factor number one of illegal immigration . " upbeat about schengen expansion managing overstayers has become an increasingly difficult task , particularly since december , when the eu expanded its borderless area to include nine new countries , most of them from eastern europe . the countries joined the so-called schengen agreement amid concerns that its expansion would make it easier for criminals and illegal immigrants to enter the bloc . such concerns have been felt particularly in germany , where there have been widespread reports about scores of chechen refugees with asylum status in poland crossing its eastern border . " none of the fears has come true , " said peter altmaier , state secretary at the german interior ministry .
" as far as we know , schengen is a big success . " eu justice commissioner franco frattini hailed the successes of the enlarged schengen area , noting that the program 's shared database on criminals had since lead to the arrest of " some 100 suspects " in the new member states . frattini added that the influx of chechen refugees into germany and austria showed that there was a pressing need for a common eu policy on asylum , another issue due to be debated by ministers in brdo , near the slovenian capital ljubljana . success or failure ? bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : german federal police now control people in a wide strip along the border slovenian interior minister dragutin mate , whose country currently holds the rotating eu presidency , also said that things looked very good .
he said that slovenian border patrol alone had confiscated 140 stolen vehicles and prevented 1,700 people on eu blacklists from entering the bloc . germany 's police union meanwhile on wednesday said that border patrols had stopped 564 foreigners without visa along germany 's borders with poland and the czech republic since border controls fell on dec .
21 , an increase of 150 percent when compared to the year before . altmaier conceded that more chechens had come to germany in the first two weeks after the border fell , but added that they had been returned to poland , the eu country they had first entered .
according to eu rules , asylum seekers are dealt with in the country they first enter . " these are normal procedures , " he said . debate on passenger data sharing bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : should the eu share passenger data ?
european union justice and interior ministers were also expected to discuss plans to share airline passengers ' data in a bid to prevent terrorists from entering the 27-member bloc . the so-called european passenger name record -lrb- pnr -rrb- would be modeled according to a similar system introduced by the united states in the aftermath of the sept .
11 , 2001 attacks . " terrorism remains the number one threat , " frattini said . frattini , who first floated the idea over the summer , said a european pnr was " absolutely necessary " and should therefore be adopted " as soon as possible . " but his plans have been met with resistance from civil liberties ' advocates , who fear that collecting details about a person 's travel arrangements in and out of the eu would violate their privacy . details about a traveler 's airline ticket , including how it was paid for , would be shared among all eu member states , as well as with third countries such as the us .
the eu insists it will not divulge sensitive information about a traveler 's ethnic origins or political and religious beliefs . dw staff -lrb- win -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

he managed the company 's us operations from 2002 to 2003 and became ceo in 2005 .
he resigned in 2007 over siemens ' slush fund affair despite having no personal responsibility for the scandal .

raw materials are needed there because these countries have relatively little of them .
population growth and industrialization are driving forces and that 's going to continue to be the case . the big question is how strong growth will be .
i 'm convinced that this will depend on chances for growth in the developed countries .
but it will still be stronger and better despite of it all .
that 's why the scarcity of raw materials will continue since they 'll continue to be in high demand .
that 's positive news for alcoa . why ?
because prices will remain on a high level with continuing strong demand ? it 's a growth business and i 'm saying that prices will develop in a positive , stable way . which markets are up and coming ?
what role does africa play ? bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : africa remains mainly interesting because of its raw materials africa is definitely an issue .
africa continues to be more of an issue in terms of delivering raw materials rather than using them .
i sincerely hope that africa , which has long been called a forgotten continent , will strongly profit from this and experience a stronger industrialization .
this can already be very much seen in south africa and in some northern african countries . here in davos , people are talking intensively behind the scenes about continuing talks on global free trade .
at the same time , there 's currently a global trend - also in europe and germany - to protect markets .
do you think that 's a good thing ? no , i think it 's missing the point .
i believe that there 's nothing that has contributed and led to global wealth over the past 20 years more than the opening of markets .
germany especially profited from this as an export-oriented country - probably more than most others .
that 's why people would hurt themselves with this .
one can only hope that these trends wo n't take over . what can be done to overcome the current economic crisis ? i think the recipe is always the same .
competitiveness has to be fostered , including an increased flexibility and people have to be careful to stay on a course of innovation .
that 's always been - and will hopefully always be - one of the greatest strengths of the german economy .

he managed the company 's us operations from 2002 to 2003 and became ceo in 2005 .
he resigned in 2007 over siemens ' slush fund affair despite having no personal responsibility for the scandal .
in october 2007 , he became chief operating officer at us company alcoa , the world 's second largest producer of aluminum . dw : how are the commodity markets shaping up in light of the current stock and financial market crisis ? bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : klaus kleinfeld klaus kleinfeld : commodity markets are very strongly driven by china 's and asia 's industrialization .
raw materials are needed there because these countries have relatively little of them .
population growth and industrialization are driving forces and that 's going to continue to be the case . the big question is how strong growth will be .
i 'm convinced that this will depend on chances for growth in the developed countries .
but it will still be stronger and better despite of it all .
that 's why the scarcity of raw materials will continue since they 'll continue to be in high demand .
that 's positive news for alcoa . why ?
because prices will remain on a high level with continuing strong demand ? it 's a growth business and i 'm saying that prices will develop in a positive , stable way . which markets are up and coming ?
what role does africa play ? bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : africa remains mainly interesting because of its raw materials africa is definitely an issue .
africa continues to be more of an issue in terms of delivering raw materials rather than using them .
i sincerely hope that africa , which has long been called a forgotten continent , will strongly profit from this and experience a stronger industrialization .
this can already be very much seen in south africa and in some northern african countries . here in davos , people are talking intensively behind the scenes about continuing talks on global free trade .
at the same time , there 's currently a global trend - also in europe and germany - to protect markets .
do you think that 's a good thing ? no , i think it 's missing the point .
i believe that there 's nothing that has contributed and led to global wealth over the past 20 years more than the opening of markets .
germany especially profited from this as an export-oriented country - probably more than most others .
that 's why people would hurt themselves with this .
one can only hope that these trends wo n't take over . what can be done to overcome the current economic crisis ? i think the recipe is always the same .
competitiveness has to be fostered , including an increased flexibility and people have to be careful to stay on a course of innovation .
that 's always been - and will hopefully always be - one of the greatest strengths of the german economy .

he managed the company 's us operations from 2002 to 2003 and became ceo in 2005 .
he resigned in 2007 over siemens ' slush fund affair despite having no personal responsibility for the scandal .
in october 2007 , he became chief operating officer at us company alcoa , the world 's second largest producer of aluminum . dw : how are the commodity markets shaping up in light of the current stock and financial market crisis ? bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : klaus kleinfeld klaus kleinfeld : commodity markets are very strongly driven by china 's and asia 's industrialization .
raw materials are needed there because these countries have relatively little of them .
population growth and industrialization are driving forces and that 's going to continue to be the case . the big question is how strong growth will be .
i 'm convinced that this will depend on chances for growth in the developed countries .
but it will still be stronger and better despite of it all .
that 's why the scarcity of raw materials will continue since they 'll continue to be in high demand .
that 's positive news for alcoa . why ?
because prices will remain on a high level with continuing strong demand ? it 's a growth business and i 'm saying that prices will develop in a positive , stable way . which markets are up and coming ?
what role does africa play ? bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : africa remains mainly interesting because of its raw materials africa is definitely an issue .
africa continues to be more of an issue in terms of delivering raw materials rather than using them .
i sincerely hope that africa , which has long been called a forgotten continent , will strongly profit from this and experience a stronger industrialization .
this can already be very much seen in south africa and in some northern african countries . here in davos , people are talking intensively behind the scenes about continuing talks on global free trade .
at the same time , there 's currently a global trend - also in europe and germany - to protect markets .
do you think that 's a good thing ? no , i think it 's missing the point .
i believe that there 's nothing that has contributed and led to global wealth over the past 20 years more than the opening of markets .
germany especially profited from this as an export-oriented country - probably more than most others .
that 's why people would hurt themselves with this .
one can only hope that these trends wo n't take over . what can be done to overcome the current economic crisis ? i think the recipe is always the same .
competitiveness has to be fostered , including an increased flexibility and people have to be careful to stay on a course of innovation .
that 's always been - and will hopefully always be - one of the greatest strengths of the german economy .
but needless to say , you ca n't completely separate that from costs and the challenges that come with it . interview : marco vollmar -lrb- win -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de politics -pipe- 25.01.2008 expert : italy must reform its electoral system großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : fewer parties would help italy avoid political crises italy was thrown into crisis on thursday , jan .
24 , when prime minister prodi resigned after losing a senate confidence vote .
dw-world.de spoke to an italian expert about the need to reform the country 's electoral system . professor giovanni guzzetta is a lawyer and lectures in public law at rome 's tor vergata university .
he has been involved in organizing electoral referendums in italy since 1991 and is currently the president of the italian electoral referendum organizing committee . dw-world.de : how do the current italian electoral laws work ? giovanni guzzetta : the electoral laws are based on proportional representation whereby the parties that are politically similar form a coalition .
the coalition that obtains the most votes wins a majority in the parliament . the problem with the current electoral law is that the threshold is very low and so even very small parties can obtain seats and become determining forces in the life of the majority .
this , in turn , can result in a large amount of fragmentation . for example , the political parties today number more than 20 and this produces instability because all governments are forced to negotiate with the various smaller parties . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : prodi won the confidence vote in the chamber of deputies , but not in the senate -lrb- upper house -rrb- what are the two different electoral reforms currently on the agenda ? the first is the one that they are discussing in the parliament .
it aims to raise the threshold to between four to five percent .
this is somewhat inspired by the german system . the other proposal is the subject of a referendum and is supported by 800,000 citizens , as is required by the italian constitution .
it aims to reduce much more drastically the number of parties by eliminating coalitions altogether .
it foresees that each party runs alone and the party that wins is the one that has the majority of votes .
this way , all of the instability of coalition governments would be avoided . you are the president of the italian electoral referendum organizing committee .
will the referendum to change the electoral laws go ahead ? we collected the signatures and we obtained the approval of the constitutional court less than a week ago .
but italian law requires that if early elections are called then a referendum must be delayed for a year .
once a new government is formed , the referendum will go ahead as long as that new government does n't propose its own electoral reform . the current government crisis brings back memories of 1993 when the amato government fell and carlo ciampi -lrb- the former head of the bank of italy who later went on to serve as president of italy and who is currently a senator for life -rrb- was appointed head of a technocratic government with the sole task of changing the electoral laws .
how has the political climate changed since then ? the truth is that the current politicians are very much divided over the electoral law so it will be very difficult to reach a strong enough agreement to make a final decision over the electoral laws .
the most probable outcome will be either early elections or a government that serves only to carry out the referendum . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : prodi failed to keep his center-left coalition from collapsing .
italy has had 61 governments since the end of world war ii .
are italians fed up with these constantly changing governments or do they like politics to be this way ? i believe that a majority of italians are fed up .
a majority of italians realize that italy is destined to a miserable decline if it does n't change its institutions .
for my generation - i 'm 41 years old - italy has been our destiny .
for the next generation , the generation of my children , italy will be a choice between many other possibilities : my children can choose to live in italy , germany or spain , for example . if italy does n't have the equipment to be a country that is upward-moving , well-governed , with services that function and with stable institutions , it risks losing ground with respect to other countries . what must happen in italy to ensure stable governments in the future ? you need big changes within the political class .
the political class was shaped culturally in the era of the cold war , but things need to change .
the institutions need to become more competitive and more stable .
you need changes that strengthen the power of citizens and give more responsibility and stability to governments . so not only electoral reform is needed but also changes to the political parties ? the renewal of the parties would also mean changing the constitution , but in the meantime the electoral reform is a really important step . interview : stephanie raison send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

while the eu keeps trying to find a way to back serbia 's moderate president in a runoff election overshadowed by the kosovo question , serbia moved closer to russia by signing a major energy deal with moscow . serbia 's pro-western president boris tadic in moscow on friday , jan .
25 , thanked the russian leadership for its support of serbia in the kosovo conflict , as the two countries agreed to grant russia a major stake in serbia 's oil and gas industry . in the presence of tadic and russian president vladimir putin , russia 's state-controlled oil concern gazprom and serbia 's nis signed an agreement granting gazprom control of 51 percent of the serbian company for 400 million euros -lrb- $ 586 million -rrb- . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : tadic -lrb- left -rrb- and putin applauded the deal on friday in addition , the two sides agreed to build a south stream gas pipeline through serbia to supply southern europe in partnership with italian energy supplier eni . the two slavic countries also agreed to build a large gas storage facility in serbia .
according to pipeline plans , the gas is to be pumped in the future from the black sea region through bulgaria and serbia in the direction of the european union . the planned pipeline , it was said , was a russian reaction to the competing project by the eu , which is planning the nabucco pipeline to transport gas to the west through the caspian sea to limit the bloc 's dependence on russian energy deliveries . selling out for kosovo ? serbian economics minister mladjan dinkic has criticized the sale of nis as a dissipation of state assets , adding that gazprom should have paid at least 1.5 billion euros for the company . western diplomats in serbia have speculated that the sale of nis was a token of gratitude to russia for its support in the kosovo conflict . " without russia 's position , it would be very difficult for serbia to protect its interests in kosovo , " the interfax news agency reported tadic as saying at the start of his meeting with putin at the kremlin . putin rejects independence bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : can kosovo 's leaders rely on eu backing ?
un security council veto power russia has rejected independence for the southern serbia province of kosovo against belgrade 's will . " i am very happy that our political contacts are developing positively , " putin said about relations between the two countries , adding that he " categorically " opposed a unilateral declaration of independence by kosovo . " this would risk provoking serious damage to the whole of the international legal system and would have negative consequences both for the balkans and the world , " putin said . kosovo 's prime minister , hashin thaci , on thursday said that a unilateral declaration of independence was just a matter of days . can tadic survive ? tadic was visiting moscow almost a week before the serbian runoff elections on feb .
3 .
tadic , who is backed by the united states and the european union , is running against nationalist challenger tomislav nikolic . russian media considered the meeting in moscow as support for tadic in the election , with the daily izvestiya on friday postulating that russia would profit more from a moderate serbian president such as tadic than the extremist nikolic . nikolic is to visit russia 's parliament on monday , according to news reports . eu looks for incentive bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : " never eu " reads this graffiti in the serbian capital , belgrade european union officials meanwhile were also keen to ensure serbia 's pro-eu orientation . on thursday , the current holder of the eu presidency , slovenia , said the bloc hoped to sign a stabilization and association agreement -lrb- saa -rrb- with serbia on closer integration " in the coming days . " but an saa could be delayed as the netherlands and belgium are blocking such a step until alleged serbian war criminal ratko mladic is handed over to the international war crimes tribunal in the hague . in order to send a positive signal to serbia ahead of the feb .

" the idea is that the european commission could be given the green light by foreign ministers next monday to sign the interim agreement to give the serbs some positive gesture , " a senior eu diplomat told reuters on condition of anonymity . this move would , however , also require unanimous backing by all 27 eu members . dw staff -lrb- win -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

25 , to pass a gene technology law , while last week saw the introduction of a new non-gm label .
consumers are under the impression that gm food has become an unavoidable fact of life . just how many of the products on germany supermarket shelves are genetically modified ?
both skeptics and supporters of gene technology like to make out that gm crops are everywhere .
to the former , this would be an argument for introducing stricter regulations , for the latter , proof that gene technology is safe , increases production and lowers the cost of food . in fact , even though a not inconsiderable amount of agricultural land is earmarked for gm crops , the critics ' prediction that they would take over the world is greatly exaggerated .
just 6 percent - 102 million hectares - of agricultural land around the world produces gm crops . germany had just 2,700 hectares given over to gm crops in 2007 , which amounts to less than 0.1 percent of its entire agricultural land . european reservations bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : some argue that gene technology promises higher yields it 's a different story in the us , which devotes 55 million hectares of farmland to gm crops .
canada , argentina , brazil , china and india are also enthusiastic advocates of genetic modification . europe is less keen .
this stems partly from legal restrictions but also has to do with agricultural structures . " use of genetically modified seed is only worth it in regions where the fields are very large , because it is so expensive , " said heike moldenhauer from friends of the earth germany .
in these cases , the fact that gm crops are highly resistant to pests and damage reduces the chances of a failed harvest .
with smaller fields , these advantages are less crucial . the same principle applies in germany .
gm crops are grown almost exclusively in the former east germany , where fields are larger than they are in the western part of the country .
according to statistics compiled by the german office for consumer protection and food safety , the highest proportion of gm crops care to be found in brandenburg , saxony and mecklenburg-western pommerania . germany permits the import of gm crops , but only monsanto 's modified corn seed mon 810 may be grown in the european union .
other gm seed is used all over the world , including corn , rapeseed , cotton and soybean . allying consumer fears bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : consumers want to make informed choices nonetheless , 80 percent of the genetically modified products cultivated by the world 's farmers rarely end up directly in the consumers ' kitchens .
the bulk of it is used for animal feed after brussels banned use of processed animal protein in animal feed and european farmers largely switched to low-cost gm soybean . ultimately , consumers determined to avoid gm food should steer clear of animal products such as milk , meat and eggs .
but they can rest assured that the remaining 20 percent of gm crops being grown are destined for t-shirts and jeans .

while the eu keeps trying to find a way to back serbia 's moderate president in a runoff election overshadowed by the kosovo question , serbia moved closer to russia by signing a major energy deal with moscow . serbia 's pro-western president boris tadic in moscow on friday , jan .
25 , thanked the russian leadership for its support of serbia in the kosovo conflict , as the two countries agreed to grant russia a major stake in serbia 's oil and gas industry . in the presence of tadic and russian president vladimir putin , russia 's state-controlled oil concern gazprom and serbia 's nis signed an agreement granting gazprom control of 51 percent of the serbian company for 400 million euros -lrb- $ 586 million -rrb- . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : tadic -lrb- left -rrb- and putin applauded the deal on friday in addition , the two sides agreed to build a south stream gas pipeline through serbia to supply southern europe in partnership with italian energy supplier eni . the two slavic countries also agreed to build a large gas storage facility in serbia .
according to pipeline plans , the gas is to be pumped in the future from the black sea region through bulgaria and serbia in the direction of the european union . the planned pipeline , it was said , was a russian reaction to the competing project by the eu , which is planning the nabucco pipeline to transport gas to the west through the caspian sea to limit the bloc 's dependence on russian energy deliveries . selling out for kosovo ? serbian economics minister mladjan dinkic has criticized the sale of nis as a dissipation of state assets , adding that gazprom should have paid at least 1.5 billion euros for the company . western diplomats in serbia have speculated that the sale of nis was a token of gratitude to russia for its support in the kosovo conflict . " without russia 's position , it would be very difficult for serbia to protect its interests in kosovo , " the interfax news agency reported tadic as saying at the start of his meeting with putin at the kremlin . putin rejects independence bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : can kosovo 's leaders rely on eu backing ?
un security council veto power russia has rejected independence for the southern serbia province of kosovo against belgrade 's will . " i am very happy that our political contacts are developing positively , " putin said about relations between the two countries , adding that he " categorically " opposed a unilateral declaration of independence by kosovo . " this would risk provoking serious damage to the whole of the international legal system and would have negative consequences both for the balkans and the world , " putin said . kosovo 's prime minister , hashin thaci , on thursday said that a unilateral declaration of independence was just a matter of days . can tadic survive ? tadic was visiting moscow almost a week before the serbian runoff elections on feb .
3 .
tadic , who is backed by the united states and the european union , is running against nationalist challenger tomislav nikolic . russian media considered the meeting in moscow as support for tadic in the election , with the daily izvestiya on friday postulating that russia would profit more from a moderate serbian president such as tadic than the extremist nikolic . nikolic is to visit russia 's parliament on monday , according to news reports . eu looks for incentive bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : " never eu " reads this graffiti in the serbian capital , belgrade european union officials meanwhile were also keen to ensure serbia 's pro-eu orientation . on thursday , the current holder of the eu presidency , slovenia , said the bloc hoped to sign a stabilization and association agreement -lrb- saa -rrb- with serbia on closer integration " in the coming days .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de politics -pipe- 25.01.2008 expert : italy must reform its electoral system großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : fewer parties would help italy avoid political crises italy was thrown into crisis on thursday , jan .
24 , when prime minister prodi resigned after losing a senate confidence vote .
dw-world.de spoke to an italian expert about the need to reform the country 's electoral system . professor giovanni guzzetta is a lawyer and lectures in public law at rome 's tor vergata university .
he has been involved in organizing electoral referendums in italy since 1991 and is currently the president of the italian electoral referendum organizing committee . dw-world.de : how do the current italian electoral laws work ? giovanni guzzetta : the electoral laws are based on proportional representation whereby the parties that are politically similar form a coalition .
the coalition that obtains the most votes wins a majority in the parliament . the problem with the current electoral law is that the threshold is very low and so even very small parties can obtain seats and become determining forces in the life of the majority .
this , in turn , can result in a large amount of fragmentation . for example , the political parties today number more than 20 and this produces instability because all governments are forced to negotiate with the various smaller parties . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : prodi won the confidence vote in the chamber of deputies , but not in the senate -lrb- upper house -rrb- what are the two different electoral reforms currently on the agenda ? the first is the one that they are discussing in the parliament .
it aims to raise the threshold to between four to five percent .
this is somewhat inspired by the german system . the other proposal is the subject of a referendum and is supported by 800,000 citizens , as is required by the italian constitution .
it aims to reduce much more drastically the number of parties by eliminating coalitions altogether .
it foresees that each party runs alone and the party that wins is the one that has the majority of votes .
this way , all of the instability of coalition governments would be avoided . you are the president of the italian electoral referendum organizing committee .
will the referendum to change the electoral laws go ahead ? we collected the signatures and we obtained the approval of the constitutional court less than a week ago .
but italian law requires that if early elections are called then a referendum must be delayed for a year .
once a new government is formed , the referendum will go ahead as long as that new government does n't propose its own electoral reform . the current government crisis brings back memories of 1993 when the amato government fell and carlo ciampi -lrb- the former head of the bank of italy who later went on to serve as president of italy and who is currently a senator for life -rrb- was appointed head of a technocratic government with the sole task of changing the electoral laws .
how has the political climate changed since then ? the truth is that the current politicians are very much divided over the electoral law so it will be very difficult to reach a strong enough agreement to make a final decision over the electoral laws .
the most probable outcome will be either early elections or a government that serves only to carry out the referendum . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : prodi failed to keep his center-left coalition from collapsing .
italy has had 61 governments since the end of world war ii .
are italians fed up with these constantly changing governments or do they like politics to be this way ? i believe that a majority of italians are fed up .
a majority of italians realize that italy is destined to a miserable decline if it does n't change its institutions .
for my generation - i 'm 41 years old - italy has been our destiny .
for the next generation , the generation of my children , italy will be a choice between many other possibilities : my children can choose to live in italy , germany or spain , for example . if italy does n't have the equipment to be a country that is upward-moving , well-governed , with services that function and with stable institutions , it risks losing ground with respect to other countries . what must happen in italy to ensure stable governments in the future ? you need big changes within the political class .
the political class was shaped culturally in the era of the cold war , but things need to change .
the institutions need to become more competitive and more stable .
you need changes that strengthen the power of citizens and give more responsibility and stability to governments . so not only electoral reform is needed but also changes to the political parties ? the renewal of the parties would also mean changing the constitution , but in the meantime the electoral reform is a really important step . interview : stephanie raison send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

24 , when prime minister prodi resigned after losing a senate confidence vote .
dw-world.de spoke to an italian expert about the need to reform the country 's electoral system . professor giovanni guzzetta is a lawyer and lectures in public law at rome 's tor vergata university .
he has been involved in organizing electoral referendums in italy since 1991 and is currently the president of the italian electoral referendum organizing committee . dw-world.de : how do the current italian electoral laws work ? giovanni guzzetta : the electoral laws are based on proportional representation whereby the parties that are politically similar form a coalition .
the coalition that obtains the most votes wins a majority in the parliament . the problem with the current electoral law is that the threshold is very low and so even very small parties can obtain seats and become determining forces in the life of the majority .
this , in turn , can result in a large amount of fragmentation . for example , the political parties today number more than 20 and this produces instability because all governments are forced to negotiate with the various smaller parties . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : prodi won the confidence vote in the chamber of deputies , but not in the senate -lrb- upper house -rrb- what are the two different electoral reforms currently on the agenda ? the first is the one that they are discussing in the parliament .
it aims to raise the threshold to between four to five percent .
this is somewhat inspired by the german system . the other proposal is the subject of a referendum and is supported by 800,000 citizens , as is required by the italian constitution .
it aims to reduce much more drastically the number of parties by eliminating coalitions altogether .
it foresees that each party runs alone and the party that wins is the one that has the majority of votes .
this way , all of the instability of coalition governments would be avoided . you are the president of the italian electoral referendum organizing committee .
will the referendum to change the electoral laws go ahead ? we collected the signatures and we obtained the approval of the constitutional court less than a week ago .
but italian law requires that if early elections are called then a referendum must be delayed for a year .

not even the new german law banning tobacco in public buildings .
anti-smoking advocates are not amused and are pressing charges . " anyone who does n't read is an idiot , " said former chancellor helmut schmidt in an interview for die zeit 's weekly magazine leben on thursday , jan .
24 . but however many books the very learned schmidt might have read , he certainly does n't seem to be good at reading germany 's new and very visible no smoking signs . his remark was issued the same week that prosecutors in hamburg began investigating him for lighting up in the lobby of the komödie winterhuder fährhaus theater just hours after the controversial smoking ban came into force on january 1 . yet another controversy bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : schmidt in the days when everyone smoked hailing from a time when cigarettes were easily the least pernicious of politicans ' preferred poisons , schmidt would never have predicted the impact a quick smoke could have in this health-conscious age . but then the indomitable elder statesman of german politics was snapped by the mass circulation bild newspaper blithely puffing away at a reception with his wife , childhood sweetheart loki . and before he knew it , he was at the heart of a controversy at least as divisive as his policies on the soviet invasion of afghanistan back in the late 1970s . bodily harm ? bild has reported that the schmidts might even face bodily harm charges .
according to the german criminal code , " anyone who physically abuses someone else or damages their health can be given a suspended sentence of up to five years or be punished with a financial penalty . " in fact , helmut schmidt 's recalcitrance is hardly a surprise .
a dedicated smoker throughout his career , schmidt is still seldom photographed without a cigarette even as he approaches his 90s .
interviews are generally conducted amid a thick cloud of smoke and changing public attitudes have done nothing to curb his enthusiasm . nicknamed schmidt-schnauze -lrb- sassy schmidt -rrb- for his sharp tongue and ready wit , the former politician famed for never following the crowd is the last person likely to give up a lifetime 's habit simply because it has fallen out of fashion . during his years in office between 1974 and 1982 , schmidt weathered political turbulence ranging from the international oil crisis to the terrorism of the baader-meinhof era .
cigarette smoking never seemed to get in the way of his political duties . dismissal likely rüdiger bagger , a prosecutions spokesman in hamburg , confirmed the complaint had been received , but said the docket would be most likely be dismissed . " smoking is definitely damaging to the health , but there 's no evidence mr and mrs schmidt committed assault , " he said . hamburg has already announced that its bylaws department will not start imposing misdemeanour fines on smokers till march , so the complaint seems unlikely to have any legal consequences . unpopular motion germany implemented the ban on smoking in bars and restaurants across most of the country on jan .
1 . the new law has not gone down well in a nation long considered a smoker 's haven .
it has been suggested that the move has met with more resistance here than in other cigarette-loving nations such as france and italy because of the long shadow cast by the country 's past .
one of germany 's most fervent anti-smokers was hitler , who cracked down on the habit during the third reich . in fact , the ban in germany is more lenient than those imposed in other western european nations in recent years as restaurants in the country will be allowed to provide separate smoking rooms . bad example bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : still ignored by many the case against the rebellious schmidts was brought by anti-smoking activists in the western city of wiesbaden . " they were recklessly smoking in public and someone like mr schmidt should know better - he is setting a very bad example , so we launched legal proceedings , " activist horst keiser told reuters . " how can children and young people be expected to grasp that laws must be respected when even a statesman like helmut schmidt ignores them ? " keiser said he wanted the schmidts to be fined a few thousand euros and for the money to be donated to a children 's charity .
he also wanted them to stop smoking in public . " a lot of people think , look at him , he 's 89 and still going strong , how bad can smoking be , " he added .
" but no one realizes that in fact he 's had four bypasses and has a pacemaker . " according to the hamburger morgenpost , however , loki schmidt says that she and her husband have no intention of quitting . " even our doctors have advised us against it , " she maintains .
" they say it would be too stressful for our bodies . " dw staff -lrb- jp -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

24 , that the creation of what he called a " european sports police " would help curb hooligans on both a continental level and a national level and work in conjunction with the legal authorities .
he also said it could help deal with issues such as money laundering and ground closures due to hooliganism and proposed discussing the idea with french interior minister michele alliot-marie before france takes over the rotating eu presidency on july 1 .
ahead of this summer 's european soccer championships in austria and switzerland , platini 's main priority is to police known hooligans from different countries at the continental level .
eu-wide standards police cooperation between the different countries in fact already exists .
in november 2007 , the european commission agreed to part finance a project that would see a specialized police force trained specifically to combat soccer-related violence .
" there is already quite close cooperation between the different police authorities from each country , and that is going to improve as the euro 2008 approaches , " european justice commissioner franco frattini said .
an initial 10 million euros -lrb- $ 14.6 million -rrb- was set aside from the eu budget next year for the training plan , he said .
frattini also presented plans being worked on by eu experts to set up common europe-wide standards on safety and security for sporting events .
the measures include travel bans on blacklisted hooligans , joint eu police teams working at stadiums , coaching fans to prevent violence and new financial aid from the eu for training police .

" european sport has always been a powerful catalyst for social and cultural integration , " he said .
but he fears that negative influences have infiltrated the world of soccer .
" society has passed other scourges on to the world of sport : money-laundering , match-fixing , illegal betting , racism and xenophobia , doping , child trafficking , " he lamented . dw staff -lrb- jp -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

24 , when prime minister prodi resigned after losing a senate confidence vote .
dw-world.de spoke to an italian expert about the need to reform the country 's electoral system . professor giovanni guzzetta is a lawyer and lectures in public law at rome 's tor vergata university .
he has been involved in organizing electoral referendums in italy since 1991 and is currently the president of the italian electoral referendum organizing committee . dw-world.de : how do the current italian electoral laws work ? giovanni guzzetta : the electoral laws are based on proportional representation whereby the parties that are politically similar form a coalition .
the coalition that obtains the most votes wins a majority in the parliament . the problem with the current electoral law is that the threshold is very low and so even very small parties can obtain seats and become determining forces in the life of the majority .
this , in turn , can result in a large amount of fragmentation . for example , the political parties today number more than 20 and this produces instability because all governments are forced to negotiate with the various smaller parties . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : prodi won the confidence vote in the chamber of deputies , but not in the senate -lrb- upper house -rrb- what are the two different electoral reforms currently on the agenda ? the first is the one that they are discussing in the parliament .
it aims to raise the threshold to between four to five percent .
this is somewhat inspired by the german system . the other proposal is the subject of a referendum and is supported by 800,000 citizens , as is required by the italian constitution .
it aims to reduce much more drastically the number of parties by eliminating coalitions altogether .
it foresees that each party runs alone and the party that wins is the one that has the majority of votes .
this way , all of the instability of coalition governments would be avoided . you are the president of the italian electoral referendum organizing committee .
will the referendum to change the electoral laws go ahead ? we collected the signatures and we obtained the approval of the constitutional court less than a week ago .
but italian law requires that if early elections are called then a referendum must be delayed for a year .
once a new government is formed , the referendum will go ahead as long as that new government does n't propose its own electoral reform . the current government crisis brings back memories of 1993 when the amato government fell and carlo ciampi -lrb- the former head of the bank of italy who later went on to serve as president of italy and who is currently a senator for life -rrb- was appointed head of a technocratic government with the sole task of changing the electoral laws .
how has the political climate changed since then ? the truth is that the current politicians are very much divided over the electoral law so it will be very difficult to reach a strong enough agreement to make a final decision over the electoral laws .
the most probable outcome will be either early elections or a government that serves only to carry out the referendum . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : prodi failed to keep his center-left coalition from collapsing .
italy has had 61 governments since the end of world war ii .
are italians fed up with these constantly changing governments or do they like politics to be this way ? i believe that a majority of italians are fed up .
a majority of italians realize that italy is destined to a miserable decline if it does n't change its institutions .
for my generation - i 'm 41 years old - italy has been our destiny .
for the next generation , the generation of my children , italy will be a choice between many other possibilities : my children can choose to live in italy , germany or spain , for example . if italy does n't have the equipment to be a country that is upward-moving , well-governed , with services that function and with stable institutions , it risks losing ground with respect to other countries . what must happen in italy to ensure stable governments in the future ? you need big changes within the political class .
the political class was shaped culturally in the era of the cold war , but things need to change .
the institutions need to become more competitive and more stable .
you need changes that strengthen the power of citizens and give more responsibility and stability to governments . so not only electoral reform is needed but also changes to the political parties ? the renewal of the parties would also mean changing the constitution , but in the meantime the electoral reform is a really important step . interview : stephanie raison send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

while the eu keeps trying to find a way to back serbia 's moderate president in a runoff election overshadowed by the kosovo question , serbia moved closer to russia by signing a major energy deal with moscow . serbia 's pro-western president boris tadic in moscow on friday , jan .
25 , thanked the russian leadership for its support of serbia in the kosovo conflict , as the two countries agreed to grant russia a major stake in serbia 's oil and gas industry . in the presence of tadic and russian president vladimir putin , russia 's state-controlled oil concern gazprom and serbia 's nis signed an agreement granting gazprom control of 51 percent of the serbian company for 400 million euros -lrb- $ 586 million -rrb- . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : tadic -lrb- left -rrb- and putin applauded the deal on friday in addition , the two sides agreed to build a south stream gas pipeline through serbia to supply southern europe in partnership with italian energy supplier eni . the two slavic countries also agreed to build a large gas storage facility in serbia .
according to pipeline plans , the gas is to be pumped in the future from the black sea region through bulgaria and serbia in the direction of the european union . the planned pipeline , it was said , was a russian reaction to the competing project by the eu , which is planning the nabucco pipeline to transport gas to the west through the caspian sea to limit the bloc 's dependence on russian energy deliveries . selling out for kosovo ? serbian economics minister mladjan dinkic has criticized the sale of nis as a dissipation of state assets , adding that gazprom should have paid at least 1.5 billion euros for the company . western diplomats in serbia have speculated that the sale of nis was a token of gratitude to russia for its support in the kosovo conflict . " without russia 's position , it would be very difficult for serbia to protect its interests in kosovo , " the interfax news agency reported tadic as saying at the start of his meeting with putin at the kremlin . putin rejects independence bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : can kosovo 's leaders rely on eu backing ?
un security council veto power russia has rejected independence for the southern serbia province of kosovo against belgrade 's will .

not even the new german law banning tobacco in public buildings .
anti-smoking advocates are not amused and are pressing charges . " anyone who does n't read is an idiot , " said former chancellor helmut schmidt in an interview for die zeit 's weekly magazine leben on thursday , jan .
24 . but however many books the very learned schmidt might have read , he certainly does n't seem to be good at reading germany 's new and very visible no smoking signs . his remark was issued the same week that prosecutors in hamburg began investigating him for lighting up in the lobby of the komödie winterhuder fährhaus theater just hours after the controversial smoking ban came into force on january 1 . yet another controversy bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : schmidt in the days when everyone smoked hailing from a time when cigarettes were easily the least pernicious of politicans ' preferred poisons , schmidt would never have predicted the impact a quick smoke could have in this health-conscious age . but then the indomitable elder statesman of german politics was snapped by the mass circulation bild newspaper blithely puffing away at a reception with his wife , childhood sweetheart loki . and before he knew it , he was at the heart of a controversy at least as divisive as his policies on the soviet invasion of afghanistan back in the late 1970s . bodily harm ? bild has reported that the schmidts might even face bodily harm charges .
according to the german criminal code , " anyone who physically abuses someone else or damages their health can be given a suspended sentence of up to five years or be punished with a financial penalty . " in fact , helmut schmidt 's recalcitrance is hardly a surprise .
a dedicated smoker throughout his career , schmidt is still seldom photographed without a cigarette even as he approaches his 90s .
interviews are generally conducted amid a thick cloud of smoke and changing public attitudes have done nothing to curb his enthusiasm . nicknamed schmidt-schnauze -lrb- sassy schmidt -rrb- for his sharp tongue and ready wit , the former politician famed for never following the crowd is the last person likely to give up a lifetime 's habit simply because it has fallen out of fashion . during his years in office between 1974 and 1982 , schmidt weathered political turbulence ranging from the international oil crisis to the terrorism of the baader-meinhof era .
cigarette smoking never seemed to get in the way of his political duties . dismissal likely rüdiger bagger , a prosecutions spokesman in hamburg , confirmed the complaint had been received , but said the docket would be most likely be dismissed . " smoking is definitely damaging to the health , but there 's no evidence mr and mrs schmidt committed assault , " he said . hamburg has already announced that its bylaws department will not start imposing misdemeanour fines on smokers till march , so the complaint seems unlikely to have any legal consequences . unpopular motion germany implemented the ban on smoking in bars and restaurants across most of the country on jan .
1 . the new law has not gone down well in a nation long considered a smoker 's haven .
it has been suggested that the move has met with more resistance here than in other cigarette-loving nations such as france and italy because of the long shadow cast by the country 's past .
one of germany 's most fervent anti-smokers was hitler , who cracked down on the habit during the third reich . in fact , the ban in germany is more lenient than those imposed in other western european nations in recent years as restaurants in the country will be allowed to provide separate smoking rooms . bad example bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : still ignored by many the case against the rebellious schmidts was brought by anti-smoking activists in the western city of wiesbaden . " they were recklessly smoking in public and someone like mr schmidt should know better - he is setting a very bad example , so we launched legal proceedings , " activist horst keiser told reuters . " how can children and young people be expected to grasp that laws must be respected when even a statesman like helmut schmidt ignores them ? " keiser said he wanted the schmidts to be fined a few thousand euros and for the money to be donated to a children 's charity .
he also wanted them to stop smoking in public . " a lot of people think , look at him , he 's 89 and still going strong , how bad can smoking be , " he added .
" but no one realizes that in fact he 's had four bypasses and has a pacemaker . " according to the hamburger morgenpost , however , loki schmidt says that she and her husband have no intention of quitting . " even our doctors have advised us against it , " she maintains .
" they say it would be too stressful for our bodies . " dw staff -lrb- jp -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

not even the new german law banning tobacco in public buildings .
anti-smoking advocates are not amused and are pressing charges . " anyone who does n't read is an idiot , " said former chancellor helmut schmidt in an interview for die zeit 's weekly magazine leben on thursday , jan .
24 . but however many books the very learned schmidt might have read , he certainly does n't seem to be good at reading germany 's new and very visible no smoking signs . his remark was issued the same week that prosecutors in hamburg began investigating him for lighting up in the lobby of the komödie winterhuder fährhaus theater just hours after the controversial smoking ban came into force on january 1 . yet another controversy bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : schmidt in the days when everyone smoked hailing from a time when cigarettes were easily the least pernicious of politicans ' preferred poisons , schmidt would never have predicted the impact a quick smoke could have in this health-conscious age . but then the indomitable elder statesman of german politics was snapped by the mass circulation bild newspaper blithely puffing away at a reception with his wife , childhood sweetheart loki . and before he knew it , he was at the heart of a controversy at least as divisive as his policies on the soviet invasion of afghanistan back in the late 1970s . bodily harm ? bild has reported that the schmidts might even face bodily harm charges .
according to the german criminal code , " anyone who physically abuses someone else or damages their health can be given a suspended sentence of up to five years or be punished with a financial penalty . " in fact , helmut schmidt 's recalcitrance is hardly a surprise .
a dedicated smoker throughout his career , schmidt is still seldom photographed without a cigarette even as he approaches his 90s .
interviews are generally conducted amid a thick cloud of smoke and changing public attitudes have done nothing to curb his enthusiasm . nicknamed schmidt-schnauze -lrb- sassy schmidt -rrb- for his sharp tongue and ready wit , the former politician famed for never following the crowd is the last person likely to give up a lifetime 's habit simply because it has fallen out of fashion . during his years in office between 1974 and 1982 , schmidt weathered political turbulence ranging from the international oil crisis to the terrorism of the baader-meinhof era .
cigarette smoking never seemed to get in the way of his political duties . dismissal likely rüdiger bagger , a prosecutions spokesman in hamburg , confirmed the complaint had been received , but said the docket would be most likely be dismissed . " smoking is definitely damaging to the health , but there 's no evidence mr and mrs schmidt committed assault , " he said . hamburg has already announced that its bylaws department will not start imposing misdemeanour fines on smokers till march , so the complaint seems unlikely to have any legal consequences . unpopular motion germany implemented the ban on smoking in bars and restaurants across most of the country on jan .
1 . the new law has not gone down well in a nation long considered a smoker 's haven .
it has been suggested that the move has met with more resistance here than in other cigarette-loving nations such as france and italy because of the long shadow cast by the country 's past .
one of germany 's most fervent anti-smokers was hitler , who cracked down on the habit during the third reich . in fact , the ban in germany is more lenient than those imposed in other western european nations in recent years as restaurants in the country will be allowed to provide separate smoking rooms . bad example bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : still ignored by many the case against the rebellious schmidts was brought by anti-smoking activists in the western city of wiesbaden . " they were recklessly smoking in public and someone like mr schmidt should know better - he is setting a very bad example , so we launched legal proceedings , " activist horst keiser told reuters . " how can children and young people be expected to grasp that laws must be respected when even a statesman like helmut schmidt ignores them ?

he also wanted them to stop smoking in public . " a lot of people think , look at him , he 's 89 and still going strong , how bad can smoking be , " he added .

24 , that the creation of what he called a " european sports police " would help curb hooligans on both a continental level and a national level and work in conjunction with the legal authorities .
he also said it could help deal with issues such as money laundering and ground closures due to hooliganism and proposed discussing the idea with french interior minister michele alliot-marie before france takes over the rotating eu presidency on july 1 .
ahead of this summer 's european soccer championships in austria and switzerland , platini 's main priority is to police known hooligans from different countries at the continental level .
eu-wide standards police cooperation between the different countries in fact already exists .
in november 2007 , the european commission agreed to part finance a project that would see a specialized police force trained specifically to combat soccer-related violence .
" there is already quite close cooperation between the different police authorities from each country , and that is going to improve as the euro 2008 approaches , " european justice commissioner franco frattini said .
an initial 10 million euros -lrb- $ 14.6 million -rrb- was set aside from the eu budget next year for the training plan , he said .
frattini also presented plans being worked on by eu experts to set up common europe-wide standards on safety and security for sporting events .
the measures include travel bans on blacklisted hooligans , joint eu police teams working at stadiums , coaching fans to prevent violence and new financial aid from the eu for training police .
powerful catalyst bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : soccer is dogged by the hooligan problem speaking at the council of europe 's winter parliamentary assembly in strasbourg on thursday , platini expressed fears that soccer 's core social and cultural values were being eroded .
" european sport has always been a powerful catalyst for social and cultural integration , " he said .
but he fears that negative influences have infiltrated the world of soccer .
" society has passed other scourges on to the world of sport : money-laundering , match-fixing , illegal betting , racism and xenophobia , doping , child trafficking , " he lamented . dw staff -lrb- jp -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

not even the new german law banning tobacco in public buildings .
anti-smoking advocates are not amused and are pressing charges . " anyone who does n't read is an idiot , " said former chancellor helmut schmidt in an interview for die zeit 's weekly magazine leben on thursday , jan .
24 . but however many books the very learned schmidt might have read , he certainly does n't seem to be good at reading germany 's new and very visible no smoking signs . his remark was issued the same week that prosecutors in hamburg began investigating him for lighting up in the lobby of the komödie winterhuder fährhaus theater just hours after the controversial smoking ban came into force on january 1 . yet another controversy bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : schmidt in the days when everyone smoked hailing from a time when cigarettes were easily the least pernicious of politicans ' preferred poisons , schmidt would never have predicted the impact a quick smoke could have in this health-conscious age . but then the indomitable elder statesman of german politics was snapped by the mass circulation bild newspaper blithely puffing away at a reception with his wife , childhood sweetheart loki . and before he knew it , he was at the heart of a controversy at least as divisive as his policies on the soviet invasion of afghanistan back in the late 1970s . bodily harm ? bild has reported that the schmidts might even face bodily harm charges .
according to the german criminal code , " anyone who physically abuses someone else or damages their health can be given a suspended sentence of up to five years or be punished with a financial penalty . " in fact , helmut schmidt 's recalcitrance is hardly a surprise .
a dedicated smoker throughout his career , schmidt is still seldom photographed without a cigarette even as he approaches his 90s .
interviews are generally conducted amid a thick cloud of smoke and changing public attitudes have done nothing to curb his enthusiasm . nicknamed schmidt-schnauze -lrb- sassy schmidt -rrb- for his sharp tongue and ready wit , the former politician famed for never following the crowd is the last person likely to give up a lifetime 's habit simply because it has fallen out of fashion . during his years in office between 1974 and 1982 , schmidt weathered political turbulence ranging from the international oil crisis to the terrorism of the baader-meinhof era .
cigarette smoking never seemed to get in the way of his political duties . dismissal likely rüdiger bagger , a prosecutions spokesman in hamburg , confirmed the complaint had been received , but said the docket would be most likely be dismissed . " smoking is definitely damaging to the health , but there 's no evidence mr and mrs schmidt committed assault , " he said . hamburg has already announced that its bylaws department will not start imposing misdemeanour fines on smokers till march , so the complaint seems unlikely to have any legal consequences . unpopular motion germany implemented the ban on smoking in bars and restaurants across most of the country on jan .
1 . the new law has not gone down well in a nation long considered a smoker 's haven .
it has been suggested that the move has met with more resistance here than in other cigarette-loving nations such as france and italy because of the long shadow cast by the country 's past .
one of germany 's most fervent anti-smokers was hitler , who cracked down on the habit during the third reich . in fact , the ban in germany is more lenient than those imposed in other western european nations in recent years as restaurants in the country will be allowed to provide separate smoking rooms . bad example bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : still ignored by many the case against the rebellious schmidts was brought by anti-smoking activists in the western city of wiesbaden . " they were recklessly smoking in public and someone like mr schmidt should know better - he is setting a very bad example , so we launched legal proceedings , " activist horst keiser told reuters . " how can children and young people be expected to grasp that laws must be respected when even a statesman like helmut schmidt ignores them ? " keiser said he wanted the schmidts to be fined a few thousand euros and for the money to be donated to a children 's charity .
he also wanted them to stop smoking in public . " a lot of people think , look at him , he 's 89 and still going strong , how bad can smoking be , " he added .
" but no one realizes that in fact he 's had four bypasses and has a pacemaker . " according to the hamburger morgenpost , however , loki schmidt says that she and her husband have no intention of quitting . " even our doctors have advised us against it , " she maintains .
" they say it would be too stressful for our bodies . " dw staff -lrb- jp -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

a threat of terrorism anywhere in the world suffices , ruled a leipzig court . the federal administrative court in leipzig ruled thursday , jan .
24 , that the german intelligence agency -lrb- bnd -rrb- can bug the telephones of suspected terrorists even when there is no immediate threat to germany .
the possibility that " sleepers " in germany are involved in plans for international attacks is sufficient grounds for strategic monitoring , the court decided . according to the parliamentary control committee -lrb- pkg -rrb- , the bnd employed strategic monitoring tactics some 24,400 times , with 21 cases considered relevant to the intelligence services . no national restraints bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : intelligence can tap phone lines when an international terrorist threat is looming the case had been brought by a man currently serving time in a cologne jail for terrorist activities .
in october 2005 , a düsseldorf court sentenced him to eight years behind bars for his involvement in the al-tawhid organization .
the evidence against him was based on a telephone conversation in which he was heard to offer his services as a suicide bomber . the complainant argued that the intelligence services ' tapping of his telephones in october and november 2001 was illegal , with his lawyer arguing that indications of planned international terrorist activity was inadequate grounds for supervision . " this is absurd , " said a representative from the bnd .
" in this era of international terrorism , investigators can not be restricted by national borders . " internet evidence also on thursday , a court in schleswig-holstein sentenced a german of moroccan origin to jail for setting up an al-qaeda cell in sudan , africa , with people he met on the internet . redouane e.h. , a 38-year-old mobile-phone and internet shop manager based in kiel , will serve five years and nine months for smuggling fighters into iraq and funding al-qaeda . most of the evidence in the case against e.h. came from internet chat logs .
the judge said it was the first time evidence had been obtained from phone calls via the internet and used to convict someone in a german court . extra-territorial laws bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the internet facilitates the spread of terrorist networks e.h. has been on trial since july , accused of uploading to the internet messages of support for osama bin laden and details on how to construct bombs .
he also raised 5,000 euros -lrb- $ 7,400 -rrb- to support a jihad or holy war , before his arrest in july 2006 . he took part in a training camp in algeria in december 2005 before embarking on the iraqi smuggling operation and finally the move into sudan to aid al qaeda of mesopotamia . the man originally came to the university of kiel to study philosophy , and said that he became a radical muslim after the death of his brother in 2003 . " from today 's perspective , i realize it was bizarre lunacy , " he told the court as the trial drew to a close .
" i just do n't understand how i ever got involved in it . " e.h. was convicted under an extra-territorial law that makes it a crime for someone in germany to establish or belong to a terrorist organization anywhere in the world . dw staff -lrb- jp -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

not even the new german law banning tobacco in public buildings .
anti-smoking advocates are not amused and are pressing charges . " anyone who does n't read is an idiot , " said former chancellor helmut schmidt in an interview for die zeit 's weekly magazine leben on thursday , jan .
24 . but however many books the very learned schmidt might have read , he certainly does n't seem to be good at reading germany 's new and very visible no smoking signs . his remark was issued the same week that prosecutors in hamburg began investigating him for lighting up in the lobby of the komödie winterhuder fährhaus theater just hours after the controversial smoking ban came into force on january 1 . yet another controversy bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : schmidt in the days when everyone smoked hailing from a time when cigarettes were easily the least pernicious of politicans ' preferred poisons , schmidt would never have predicted the impact a quick smoke could have in this health-conscious age . but then the indomitable elder statesman of german politics was snapped by the mass circulation bild newspaper blithely puffing away at a reception with his wife , childhood sweetheart loki . and before he knew it , he was at the heart of a controversy at least as divisive as his policies on the soviet invasion of afghanistan back in the late 1970s . bodily harm ? bild has reported that the schmidts might even face bodily harm charges .
according to the german criminal code , " anyone who physically abuses someone else or damages their health can be given a suspended sentence of up to five years or be punished with a financial penalty . " in fact , helmut schmidt 's recalcitrance is hardly a surprise .
a dedicated smoker throughout his career , schmidt is still seldom photographed without a cigarette even as he approaches his 90s .
interviews are generally conducted amid a thick cloud of smoke and changing public attitudes have done nothing to curb his enthusiasm . nicknamed schmidt-schnauze -lrb- sassy schmidt -rrb- for his sharp tongue and ready wit , the former politician famed for never following the crowd is the last person likely to give up a lifetime 's habit simply because it has fallen out of fashion . during his years in office between 1974 and 1982 , schmidt weathered political turbulence ranging from the international oil crisis to the terrorism of the baader-meinhof era .
cigarette smoking never seemed to get in the way of his political duties . dismissal likely rüdiger bagger , a prosecutions spokesman in hamburg , confirmed the complaint had been received , but said the docket would be most likely be dismissed . " smoking is definitely damaging to the health , but there 's no evidence mr and mrs schmidt committed assault , " he said . hamburg has already announced that its bylaws department will not start imposing misdemeanour fines on smokers till march , so the complaint seems unlikely to have any legal consequences . unpopular motion germany implemented the ban on smoking in bars and restaurants across most of the country on jan .
1 . the new law has not gone down well in a nation long considered a smoker 's haven .
it has been suggested that the move has met with more resistance here than in other cigarette-loving nations such as france and italy because of the long shadow cast by the country 's past .
one of germany 's most fervent anti-smokers was hitler , who cracked down on the habit during the third reich . in fact , the ban in germany is more lenient than those imposed in other western european nations in recent years as restaurants in the country will be allowed to provide separate smoking rooms . bad example bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : still ignored by many the case against the rebellious schmidts was brought by anti-smoking activists in the western city of wiesbaden . " they were recklessly smoking in public and someone like mr schmidt should know better - he is setting a very bad example , so we launched legal proceedings , " activist horst keiser told reuters . " how can children and young people be expected to grasp that laws must be respected when even a statesman like helmut schmidt ignores them ? " keiser said he wanted the schmidts to be fined a few thousand euros and for the money to be donated to a children 's charity .
he also wanted them to stop smoking in public . " a lot of people think , look at him , he 's 89 and still going strong , how bad can smoking be , " he added .
" but no one realizes that in fact he 's had four bypasses and has a pacemaker . " according to the hamburger morgenpost , however , loki schmidt says that she and her husband have no intention of quitting . " even our doctors have advised us against it , " she maintains .
" they say it would be too stressful for our bodies . " dw staff -lrb- jp -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

24 , that the creation of what he called a " european sports police " would help curb hooligans on both a continental level and a national level and work in conjunction with the legal authorities .
he also said it could help deal with issues such as money laundering and ground closures due to hooliganism and proposed discussing the idea with french interior minister michele alliot-marie before france takes over the rotating eu presidency on july 1 .
ahead of this summer 's european soccer championships in austria and switzerland , platini 's main priority is to police known hooligans from different countries at the continental level .
eu-wide standards police cooperation between the different countries in fact already exists .
in november 2007 , the european commission agreed to part finance a project that would see a specialized police force trained specifically to combat soccer-related violence .
" there is already quite close cooperation between the different police authorities from each country , and that is going to improve as the euro 2008 approaches , " european justice commissioner franco frattini said .
an initial 10 million euros -lrb- $ 14.6 million -rrb- was set aside from the eu budget next year for the training plan , he said .
frattini also presented plans being worked on by eu experts to set up common europe-wide standards on safety and security for sporting events .
the measures include travel bans on blacklisted hooligans , joint eu police teams working at stadiums , coaching fans to prevent violence and new financial aid from the eu for training police .
powerful catalyst bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : soccer is dogged by the hooligan problem speaking at the council of europe 's winter parliamentary assembly in strasbourg on thursday , platini expressed fears that soccer 's core social and cultural values were being eroded .
" european sport has always been a powerful catalyst for social and cultural integration , " he said .
but he fears that negative influences have infiltrated the world of soccer .
" society has passed other scourges on to the world of sport : money-laundering , match-fixing , illegal betting , racism and xenophobia , doping , child trafficking , " he lamented . dw staff -lrb- jp -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

he managed the company 's us operations from 2002 to 2003 and became ceo in 2005 .

raw materials are needed there because these countries have relatively little of them .
population growth and industrialization are driving forces and that 's going to continue to be the case . the big question is how strong growth will be .
i 'm convinced that this will depend on chances for growth in the developed countries .
but it will still be stronger and better despite of it all .
that 's why the scarcity of raw materials will continue since they 'll continue to be in high demand .
that 's positive news for alcoa . why ?
because prices will remain on a high level with continuing strong demand ? it 's a growth business and i 'm saying that prices will develop in a positive , stable way . which markets are up and coming ?
what role does africa play ? bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : africa remains mainly interesting because of its raw materials africa is definitely an issue .
africa continues to be more of an issue in terms of delivering raw materials rather than using them .
i sincerely hope that africa , which has long been called a forgotten continent , will strongly profit from this and experience a stronger industrialization .
this can already be very much seen in south africa and in some northern african countries . here in davos , people are talking intensively behind the scenes about continuing talks on global free trade .
at the same time , there 's currently a global trend - also in europe and germany - to protect markets .
do you think that 's a good thing ? no , i think it 's missing the point .
i believe that there 's nothing that has contributed and led to global wealth over the past 20 years more than the opening of markets .
germany especially profited from this as an export-oriented country - probably more than most others .
that 's why people would hurt themselves with this .
one can only hope that these trends wo n't take over . what can be done to overcome the current economic crisis ? i think the recipe is always the same .
competitiveness has to be fostered , including an increased flexibility and people have to be careful to stay on a course of innovation .
that 's always been - and will hopefully always be - one of the greatest strengths of the german economy .

he managed the company 's us operations from 2002 to 2003 and became ceo in 2005 .
he resigned in 2007 over siemens ' slush fund affair despite having no personal responsibility for the scandal .
in october 2007 , he became chief operating officer at us company alcoa , the world 's second largest producer of aluminum . dw : how are the commodity markets shaping up in light of the current stock and financial market crisis ? bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : klaus kleinfeld klaus kleinfeld : commodity markets are very strongly driven by china 's and asia 's industrialization .
raw materials are needed there because these countries have relatively little of them .
population growth and industrialization are driving forces and that 's going to continue to be the case . the big question is how strong growth will be .
i 'm convinced that this will depend on chances for growth in the developed countries .
but it will still be stronger and better despite of it all .
that 's why the scarcity of raw materials will continue since they 'll continue to be in high demand .
that 's positive news for alcoa . why ?
because prices will remain on a high level with continuing strong demand ? it 's a growth business and i 'm saying that prices will develop in a positive , stable way . which markets are up and coming ?
what role does africa play ? bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : africa remains mainly interesting because of its raw materials africa is definitely an issue .
africa continues to be more of an issue in terms of delivering raw materials rather than using them .
i sincerely hope that africa , which has long been called a forgotten continent , will strongly profit from this and experience a stronger industrialization .
this can already be very much seen in south africa and in some northern african countries . here in davos , people are talking intensively behind the scenes about continuing talks on global free trade .
at the same time , there 's currently a global trend - also in europe and germany - to protect markets .
do you think that 's a good thing ? no , i think it 's missing the point .
i believe that there 's nothing that has contributed and led to global wealth over the past 20 years more than the opening of markets .
germany especially profited from this as an export-oriented country - probably more than most others .
that 's why people would hurt themselves with this .
one can only hope that these trends wo n't take over . what can be done to overcome the current economic crisis ? i think the recipe is always the same .
competitiveness has to be fostered , including an increased flexibility and people have to be careful to stay on a course of innovation .
that 's always been - and will hopefully always be - one of the greatest strengths of the german economy .
but needless to say , you ca n't completely separate that from costs and the challenges that come with it . interview : marco vollmar -lrb- win -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de politics -pipe- 25.01.2008 expert : italy must reform its electoral system großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : fewer parties would help italy avoid political crises italy was thrown into crisis on thursday , jan .
24 , when prime minister prodi resigned after losing a senate confidence vote .
dw-world.de spoke to an italian expert about the need to reform the country 's electoral system . professor giovanni guzzetta is a lawyer and lectures in public law at rome 's tor vergata university .
he has been involved in organizing electoral referendums in italy since 1991 and is currently the president of the italian electoral referendum organizing committee . dw-world.de : how do the current italian electoral laws work ? giovanni guzzetta : the electoral laws are based on proportional representation whereby the parties that are politically similar form a coalition .
the coalition that obtains the most votes wins a majority in the parliament . the problem with the current electoral law is that the threshold is very low and so even very small parties can obtain seats and become determining forces in the life of the majority .
this , in turn , can result in a large amount of fragmentation . for example , the political parties today number more than 20 and this produces instability because all governments are forced to negotiate with the various smaller parties . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : prodi won the confidence vote in the chamber of deputies , but not in the senate -lrb- upper house -rrb- what are the two different electoral reforms currently on the agenda ? the first is the one that they are discussing in the parliament .
it aims to raise the threshold to between four to five percent .
this is somewhat inspired by the german system . the other proposal is the subject of a referendum and is supported by 800,000 citizens , as is required by the italian constitution .
it aims to reduce much more drastically the number of parties by eliminating coalitions altogether .
it foresees that each party runs alone and the party that wins is the one that has the majority of votes .
this way , all of the instability of coalition governments would be avoided . you are the president of the italian electoral referendum organizing committee .
will the referendum to change the electoral laws go ahead ? we collected the signatures and we obtained the approval of the constitutional court less than a week ago .
but italian law requires that if early elections are called then a referendum must be delayed for a year .
once a new government is formed , the referendum will go ahead as long as that new government does n't propose its own electoral reform . the current government crisis brings back memories of 1993 when the amato government fell and carlo ciampi -lrb- the former head of the bank of italy who later went on to serve as president of italy and who is currently a senator for life -rrb- was appointed head of a technocratic government with the sole task of changing the electoral laws .
how has the political climate changed since then ? the truth is that the current politicians are very much divided over the electoral law so it will be very difficult to reach a strong enough agreement to make a final decision over the electoral laws .
the most probable outcome will be either early elections or a government that serves only to carry out the referendum . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : prodi failed to keep his center-left coalition from collapsing .
italy has had 61 governments since the end of world war ii .
are italians fed up with these constantly changing governments or do they like politics to be this way ? i believe that a majority of italians are fed up .
a majority of italians realize that italy is destined to a miserable decline if it does n't change its institutions .
for my generation - i 'm 41 years old - italy has been our destiny .
for the next generation , the generation of my children , italy will be a choice between many other possibilities : my children can choose to live in italy , germany or spain , for example . if italy does n't have the equipment to be a country that is upward-moving , well-governed , with services that function and with stable institutions , it risks losing ground with respect to other countries . what must happen in italy to ensure stable governments in the future ? you need big changes within the political class .
the political class was shaped culturally in the era of the cold war , but things need to change .
the institutions need to become more competitive and more stable .
you need changes that strengthen the power of citizens and give more responsibility and stability to governments . so not only electoral reform is needed but also changes to the political parties ? the renewal of the parties would also mean changing the constitution , but in the meantime the electoral reform is a really important step . interview : stephanie raison send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

24 , when prime minister prodi resigned after losing a senate confidence vote .
dw-world.de spoke to an italian expert about the need to reform the country 's electoral system . professor giovanni guzzetta is a lawyer and lectures in public law at rome 's tor vergata university .
he has been involved in organizing electoral referendums in italy since 1991 and is currently the president of the italian electoral referendum organizing committee . dw-world.de : how do the current italian electoral laws work ? giovanni guzzetta : the electoral laws are based on proportional representation whereby the parties that are politically similar form a coalition .
the coalition that obtains the most votes wins a majority in the parliament . the problem with the current electoral law is that the threshold is very low and so even very small parties can obtain seats and become determining forces in the life of the majority .
this , in turn , can result in a large amount of fragmentation . for example , the political parties today number more than 20 and this produces instability because all governments are forced to negotiate with the various smaller parties . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : prodi won the confidence vote in the chamber of deputies , but not in the senate -lrb- upper house -rrb- what are the two different electoral reforms currently on the agenda ? the first is the one that they are discussing in the parliament .
it aims to raise the threshold to between four to five percent .
this is somewhat inspired by the german system . the other proposal is the subject of a referendum and is supported by 800,000 citizens , as is required by the italian constitution .
it aims to reduce much more drastically the number of parties by eliminating coalitions altogether .
it foresees that each party runs alone and the party that wins is the one that has the majority of votes .
this way , all of the instability of coalition governments would be avoided . you are the president of the italian electoral referendum organizing committee .
will the referendum to change the electoral laws go ahead ? we collected the signatures and we obtained the approval of the constitutional court less than a week ago .
but italian law requires that if early elections are called then a referendum must be delayed for a year .
once a new government is formed , the referendum will go ahead as long as that new government does n't propose its own electoral reform . the current government crisis brings back memories of 1993 when the amato government fell and carlo ciampi -lrb- the former head of the bank of italy who later went on to serve as president of italy and who is currently a senator for life -rrb- was appointed head of a technocratic government with the sole task of changing the electoral laws .
how has the political climate changed since then ? the truth is that the current politicians are very much divided over the electoral law so it will be very difficult to reach a strong enough agreement to make a final decision over the electoral laws .
the most probable outcome will be either early elections or a government that serves only to carry out the referendum . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : prodi failed to keep his center-left coalition from collapsing .
italy has had 61 governments since the end of world war ii .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de society -pipe- 25.01.2008 former chancellor helmut schmidt sets bad example by smoking großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : helmut and loki - even their doctors tell them not to stop nothing , it seems , can induce former chancellor helmut schmidt to quit smoking .
not even the new german law banning tobacco in public buildings .
anti-smoking advocates are not amused and are pressing charges . " anyone who does n't read is an idiot , " said former chancellor helmut schmidt in an interview for die zeit 's weekly magazine leben on thursday , jan .
24 . but however many books the very learned schmidt might have read , he certainly does n't seem to be good at reading germany 's new and very visible no smoking signs . his remark was issued the same week that prosecutors in hamburg began investigating him for lighting up in the lobby of the komödie winterhuder fährhaus theater just hours after the controversial smoking ban came into force on january 1 . yet another controversy bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : schmidt in the days when everyone smoked hailing from a time when cigarettes were easily the least pernicious of politicans ' preferred poisons , schmidt would never have predicted the impact a quick smoke could have in this health-conscious age . but then the indomitable elder statesman of german politics was snapped by the mass circulation bild newspaper blithely puffing away at a reception with his wife , childhood sweetheart loki . and before he knew it , he was at the heart of a controversy at least as divisive as his policies on the soviet invasion of afghanistan back in the late 1970s . bodily harm ? bild has reported that the schmidts might even face bodily harm charges .
according to the german criminal code , " anyone who physically abuses someone else or damages their health can be given a suspended sentence of up to five years or be punished with a financial penalty . " in fact , helmut schmidt 's recalcitrance is hardly a surprise .
a dedicated smoker throughout his career , schmidt is still seldom photographed without a cigarette even as he approaches his 90s .
interviews are generally conducted amid a thick cloud of smoke and changing public attitudes have done nothing to curb his enthusiasm . nicknamed schmidt-schnauze -lrb- sassy schmidt -rrb- for his sharp tongue and ready wit , the former politician famed for never following the crowd is the last person likely to give up a lifetime 's habit simply because it has fallen out of fashion . during his years in office between 1974 and 1982 , schmidt weathered political turbulence ranging from the international oil crisis to the terrorism of the baader-meinhof era .
cigarette smoking never seemed to get in the way of his political duties . dismissal likely rüdiger bagger , a prosecutions spokesman in hamburg , confirmed the complaint had been received , but said the docket would be most likely be dismissed . " smoking is definitely damaging to the health , but there 's no evidence mr and mrs schmidt committed assault , " he said . hamburg has already announced that its bylaws department will not start imposing misdemeanour fines on smokers till march , so the complaint seems unlikely to have any legal consequences . unpopular motion germany implemented the ban on smoking in bars and restaurants across most of the country on jan .
1 . the new law has not gone down well in a nation long considered a smoker 's haven .
it has been suggested that the move has met with more resistance here than in other cigarette-loving nations such as france and italy because of the long shadow cast by the country 's past .
one of germany 's most fervent anti-smokers was hitler , who cracked down on the habit during the third reich . in fact , the ban in germany is more lenient than those imposed in other western european nations in recent years as restaurants in the country will be allowed to provide separate smoking rooms . bad example bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : still ignored by many the case against the rebellious schmidts was brought by anti-smoking activists in the western city of wiesbaden . " they were recklessly smoking in public and someone like mr schmidt should know better - he is setting a very bad example , so we launched legal proceedings , " activist horst keiser told reuters . " how can children and young people be expected to grasp that laws must be respected when even a statesman like helmut schmidt ignores them ? " keiser said he wanted the schmidts to be fined a few thousand euros and for the money to be donated to a children 's charity .
he also wanted them to stop smoking in public . " a lot of people think , look at him , he 's 89 and still going strong , how bad can smoking be , " he added .
" but no one realizes that in fact he 's had four bypasses and has a pacemaker . " according to the hamburger morgenpost , however , loki schmidt says that she and her husband have no intention of quitting . " even our doctors have advised us against it , " she maintains .
" they say it would be too stressful for our bodies . " dw staff -lrb- jp -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

anti-smoking advocates are not amused and are pressing charges . " anyone who does n't read is an idiot , " said former chancellor helmut schmidt in an interview for die zeit 's weekly magazine leben on thursday , jan .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de agriculture -pipe- 25.01.2008 consumers concerned by new gene technology law großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : consumers have a choice between gm and conventional products the bundestag is set friday , jan .
25 , to pass a gene technology law , while last week saw the introduction of a new non-gm label .
consumers are under the impression that gm food has become an unavoidable fact of life . just how many of the products on germany supermarket shelves are genetically modified ?
both skeptics and supporters of gene technology like to make out that gm crops are everywhere .
to the former , this would be an argument for introducing stricter regulations , for the latter , proof that gene technology is safe , increases production and lowers the cost of food . in fact , even though a not inconsiderable amount of agricultural land is earmarked for gm crops , the critics ' prediction that they would take over the world is greatly exaggerated .
just 6 percent - 102 million hectares - of agricultural land around the world produces gm crops . germany had just 2,700 hectares given over to gm crops in 2007 , which amounts to less than 0.1 percent of its entire agricultural land . european reservations bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : some argue that gene technology promises higher yields it 's a different story in the us , which devotes 55 million hectares of farmland to gm crops .
canada , argentina , brazil , china and india are also enthusiastic advocates of genetic modification . europe is less keen .
this stems partly from legal restrictions but also has to do with agricultural structures . " use of genetically modified seed is only worth it in regions where the fields are very large , because it is so expensive , " said heike moldenhauer from friends of the earth germany .
in these cases , the fact that gm crops are highly resistant to pests and damage reduces the chances of a failed harvest .
with smaller fields , these advantages are less crucial . the same principle applies in germany .
gm crops are grown almost exclusively in the former east germany , where fields are larger than they are in the western part of the country .
according to statistics compiled by the german office for consumer protection and food safety , the highest proportion of gm crops care to be found in brandenburg , saxony and mecklenburg-western pommerania . germany permits the import of gm crops , but only monsanto 's modified corn seed mon 810 may be grown in the european union .
other gm seed is used all over the world , including corn , rapeseed , cotton and soybean . allying consumer fears bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : consumers want to make informed choices nonetheless , 80 percent of the genetically modified products cultivated by the world 's farmers rarely end up directly in the consumers ' kitchens .
the bulk of it is used for animal feed after brussels banned use of processed animal protein in animal feed and european farmers largely switched to low-cost gm soybean . ultimately , consumers determined to avoid gm food should steer clear of animal products such as milk , meat and eggs .
but they can rest assured that the remaining 20 percent of gm crops being grown are destined for t-shirts and jeans .
for the time being , there are still plenty of alternatives to genetically modified tomatoes and potatoes in germany 's supermarkets . leila knüppel -lrb- jp -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?
dw-world.de berlin agrees on new gm labeling law - but how strict is it ?
with a view to creating greater transparency for consumers , germany is to introduce a special label for food that has not been genetically modified , such as products from animals that have not been fed biotech grains .
-lrb- 15.01.2008 -rrb- french scientists express doubt about genetically modified corn the environmental protection organization greenpeace has long said genetically modified maize could be a health hazard .
now , in a new study , a group of french scientists have also expressed their doubts about the corn .

the possibility that " sleepers " in germany are involved in plans for international attacks is sufficient grounds for strategic monitoring , the court decided . according to the parliamentary control committee -lrb- pkg -rrb- , the bnd employed strategic monitoring tactics some 24,400 times , with 21 cases considered relevant to the intelligence services . no national restraints bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : intelligence can tap phone lines when an international terrorist threat is looming the case had been brought by a man currently serving time in a cologne jail for terrorist activities .
in october 2005 , a düsseldorf court sentenced him to eight years behind bars for his involvement in the al-tawhid organization .
the evidence against him was based on a telephone conversation in which he was heard to offer his services as a suicide bomber . the complainant argued that the intelligence services ' tapping of his telephones in october and november 2001 was illegal , with his lawyer arguing that indications of planned international terrorist activity was inadequate grounds for supervision . " this is absurd , " said a representative from the bnd .
" in this era of international terrorism , investigators can not be restricted by national borders . " internet evidence also on thursday , a court in schleswig-holstein sentenced a german of moroccan origin to jail for setting up an al-qaeda cell in sudan , africa , with people he met on the internet . redouane e.h. , a 38-year-old mobile-phone and internet shop manager based in kiel , will serve five years and nine months for smuggling fighters into iraq and funding al-qaeda . most of the evidence in the case against e.h. came from internet chat logs .
the judge said it was the first time evidence had been obtained from phone calls via the internet and used to convict someone in a german court . extra-territorial laws bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the internet facilitates the spread of terrorist networks e.h. has been on trial since july , accused of uploading to the internet messages of support for osama bin laden and details on how to construct bombs .
he also raised 5,000 euros -lrb- $ 7,400 -rrb- to support a jihad or holy war , before his arrest in july 2006 . he took part in a training camp in algeria in december 2005 before embarking on the iraqi smuggling operation and finally the move into sudan to aid al qaeda of mesopotamia . the man originally came to the university of kiel to study philosophy , and said that he became a radical muslim after the death of his brother in 2003 . " from today 's perspective , i realize it was bizarre lunacy , " he told the court as the trial drew to a close .
" i just do n't understand how i ever got involved in it . " e.h. was convicted under an extra-territorial law that makes it a crime for someone in germany to establish or belong to a terrorist organization anywhere in the world . dw staff -lrb- jp -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

pleased with the state of things after opening borders in the european union 's eastern region , officials are considering an electronic entry and exit register designed to track down illegal immigrants . eu justice commissioner franco frattini said on friday , jan .
25 , that the register would be similar to the electronic scanning of fingerprints and eyes at us ports of entry .
he added that it would be part of a series of eu initiatives seeking to use modern technology to target overstayers - third-country nationals who enter the eu legally but then become illegal immigrants by extending their stay beyond their visa expiry date . frattini also wants to improve the bloc 's fight against illegal immigrants by replacing its current visa system with an electronic travel authorization -lrb- eta -rrb- . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : in the us , every visitor already gets fingerprinted and photographed the electronic visa , similar to one already in place in australia , would also include a traveler 's biometric data , such as electronic photos and fingerprints . " i will present in february a package of measures aimed at improving the capacity of the eu to protect its external borders , " frattini said at an informal meeting of eu justice and interior ministers in slovenia , the current holder of the bloc 's presidency . the package , which european commission sources said would be submitted to the eu executive on feb.13 , aimed to make a " better use of existing technology " , frattini said . hundreds of thousands of illegal immigrants live in the eu 's 27 member states . " one of the main problems we face now is overstayers - people who enter the eu legally and then disappear because they stay over the allowed period , " frattini said .
" this can not be tolerated .
overstayers are the factor number one of illegal immigration . " upbeat about schengen expansion managing overstayers has become an increasingly difficult task , particularly since december , when the eu expanded its borderless area to include nine new countries , most of them from eastern europe . the countries joined the so-called schengen agreement amid concerns that its expansion would make it easier for criminals and illegal immigrants to enter the bloc . such concerns have been felt particularly in germany , where there have been widespread reports about scores of chechen refugees with asylum status in poland crossing its eastern border . " none of the fears has come true , " said peter altmaier , state secretary at the german interior ministry .
" as far as we know , schengen is a big success . " eu justice commissioner franco frattini hailed the successes of the enlarged schengen area , noting that the program 's shared database on criminals had since lead to the arrest of " some 100 suspects " in the new member states . frattini added that the influx of chechen refugees into germany and austria showed that there was a pressing need for a common eu policy on asylum , another issue due to be debated by ministers in brdo , near the slovenian capital ljubljana . success or failure ? bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : german federal police now control people in a wide strip along the border slovenian interior minister dragutin mate , whose country currently holds the rotating eu presidency , also said that things looked very good .
he said that slovenian border patrol alone had confiscated 140 stolen vehicles and prevented 1,700 people on eu blacklists from entering the bloc . germany 's police union meanwhile on wednesday said that border patrols had stopped 564 foreigners without visa along germany 's borders with poland and the czech republic since border controls fell on dec .
21 , an increase of 150 percent when compared to the year before . altmaier conceded that more chechens had come to germany in the first two weeks after the border fell , but added that they had been returned to poland , the eu country they had first entered .
according to eu rules , asylum seekers are dealt with in the country they first enter . " these are normal procedures , " he said . debate on passenger data sharing bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : should the eu share passenger data ?
european union justice and interior ministers were also expected to discuss plans to share airline passengers ' data in a bid to prevent terrorists from entering the 27-member bloc . the so-called european passenger name record -lrb- pnr -rrb- would be modeled according to a similar system introduced by the united states in the aftermath of the sept .
11 , 2001 attacks . " terrorism remains the number one threat , " frattini said . frattini , who first floated the idea over the summer , said a european pnr was " absolutely necessary " and should therefore be adopted " as soon as possible . " but his plans have been met with resistance from civil liberties ' advocates , who fear that collecting details about a person 's travel arrangements in and out of the eu would violate their privacy . details about a traveler 's airline ticket , including how it was paid for , would be shared among all eu member states , as well as with third countries such as the us .
the eu insists it will not divulge sensitive information about a traveler 's ethnic origins or political and religious beliefs . dw staff -lrb- win -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

25 , to pass a gene technology law , while last week saw the introduction of a new non-gm label .
consumers are under the impression that gm food has become an unavoidable fact of life . just how many of the products on germany supermarket shelves are genetically modified ?
both skeptics and supporters of gene technology like to make out that gm crops are everywhere .
to the former , this would be an argument for introducing stricter regulations , for the latter , proof that gene technology is safe , increases production and lowers the cost of food . in fact , even though a not inconsiderable amount of agricultural land is earmarked for gm crops , the critics ' prediction that they would take over the world is greatly exaggerated .
just 6 percent - 102 million hectares - of agricultural land around the world produces gm crops . germany had just 2,700 hectares given over to gm crops in 2007 , which amounts to less than 0.1 percent of its entire agricultural land . european reservations bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : some argue that gene technology promises higher yields it 's a different story in the us , which devotes 55 million hectares of farmland to gm crops .
canada , argentina , brazil , china and india are also enthusiastic advocates of genetic modification . europe is less keen .
this stems partly from legal restrictions but also has to do with agricultural structures . " use of genetically modified seed is only worth it in regions where the fields are very large , because it is so expensive , " said heike moldenhauer from friends of the earth germany .
in these cases , the fact that gm crops are highly resistant to pests and damage reduces the chances of a failed harvest .
with smaller fields , these advantages are less crucial . the same principle applies in germany .
gm crops are grown almost exclusively in the former east germany , where fields are larger than they are in the western part of the country .
according to statistics compiled by the german office for consumer protection and food safety , the highest proportion of gm crops care to be found in brandenburg , saxony and mecklenburg-western pommerania . germany permits the import of gm crops , but only monsanto 's modified corn seed mon 810 may be grown in the european union .
other gm seed is used all over the world , including corn , rapeseed , cotton and soybean . allying consumer fears bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : consumers want to make informed choices nonetheless , 80 percent of the genetically modified products cultivated by the world 's farmers rarely end up directly in the consumers ' kitchens .
the bulk of it is used for animal feed after brussels banned use of processed animal protein in animal feed and european farmers largely switched to low-cost gm soybean . ultimately , consumers determined to avoid gm food should steer clear of animal products such as milk , meat and eggs .
but they can rest assured that the remaining 20 percent of gm crops being grown are destined for t-shirts and jeans .
for the time being , there are still plenty of alternatives to genetically modified tomatoes and potatoes in germany 's supermarkets . leila knüppel -lrb- jp -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

pleased with the state of things after opening borders in the european union 's eastern region , officials are considering an electronic entry and exit register designed to track down illegal immigrants . eu justice commissioner franco frattini said on friday , jan .
25 , that the register would be similar to the electronic scanning of fingerprints and eyes at us ports of entry .
he added that it would be part of a series of eu initiatives seeking to use modern technology to target overstayers - third-country nationals who enter the eu legally but then become illegal immigrants by extending their stay beyond their visa expiry date . frattini also wants to improve the bloc 's fight against illegal immigrants by replacing its current visa system with an electronic travel authorization -lrb- eta -rrb- . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : in the us , every visitor already gets fingerprinted and photographed the electronic visa , similar to one already in place in australia , would also include a traveler 's biometric data , such as electronic photos and fingerprints . " i will present in february a package of measures aimed at improving the capacity of the eu to protect its external borders , " frattini said at an informal meeting of eu justice and interior ministers in slovenia , the current holder of the bloc 's presidency . the package , which european commission sources said would be submitted to the eu executive on feb.13 , aimed to make a " better use of existing technology " , frattini said . hundreds of thousands of illegal immigrants live in the eu 's 27 member states . " one of the main problems we face now is overstayers - people who enter the eu legally and then disappear because they stay over the allowed period , " frattini said .
" this can not be tolerated .
overstayers are the factor number one of illegal immigration . " upbeat about schengen expansion managing overstayers has become an increasingly difficult task , particularly since december , when the eu expanded its borderless area to include nine new countries , most of them from eastern europe . the countries joined the so-called schengen agreement amid concerns that its expansion would make it easier for criminals and illegal immigrants to enter the bloc . such concerns have been felt particularly in germany , where there have been widespread reports about scores of chechen refugees with asylum status in poland crossing its eastern border . " none of the fears has come true , " said peter altmaier , state secretary at the german interior ministry .
" as far as we know , schengen is a big success . " eu justice commissioner franco frattini hailed the successes of the enlarged schengen area , noting that the program 's shared database on criminals had since lead to the arrest of " some 100 suspects " in the new member states . frattini added that the influx of chechen refugees into germany and austria showed that there was a pressing need for a common eu policy on asylum , another issue due to be debated by ministers in brdo , near the slovenian capital ljubljana . success or failure ? bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : german federal police now control people in a wide strip along the border slovenian interior minister dragutin mate , whose country currently holds the rotating eu presidency , also said that things looked very good .
he said that slovenian border patrol alone had confiscated 140 stolen vehicles and prevented 1,700 people on eu blacklists from entering the bloc . germany 's police union meanwhile on wednesday said that border patrols had stopped 564 foreigners without visa along germany 's borders with poland and the czech republic since border controls fell on dec .
21 , an increase of 150 percent when compared to the year before . altmaier conceded that more chechens had come to germany in the first two weeks after the border fell , but added that they had been returned to poland , the eu country they had first entered .
according to eu rules , asylum seekers are dealt with in the country they first enter . " these are normal procedures , " he said . debate on passenger data sharing bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : should the eu share passenger data ?
european union justice and interior ministers were also expected to discuss plans to share airline passengers ' data in a bid to prevent terrorists from entering the 27-member bloc . the so-called european passenger name record -lrb- pnr -rrb- would be modeled according to a similar system introduced by the united states in the aftermath of the sept .
11 , 2001 attacks . " terrorism remains the number one threat , " frattini said . frattini , who first floated the idea over the summer , said a european pnr was " absolutely necessary " and should therefore be adopted " as soon as possible . " but his plans have been met with resistance from civil liberties ' advocates , who fear that collecting details about a person 's travel arrangements in and out of the eu would violate their privacy . details about a traveler 's airline ticket , including how it was paid for , would be shared among all eu member states , as well as with third countries such as the us .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de agriculture -pipe- 25.01.2008 consumers concerned by new gene technology law großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : consumers have a choice between gm and conventional products the bundestag is set friday , jan .
25 , to pass a gene technology law , while last week saw the introduction of a new non-gm label .
consumers are under the impression that gm food has become an unavoidable fact of life . just how many of the products on germany supermarket shelves are genetically modified ?
both skeptics and supporters of gene technology like to make out that gm crops are everywhere .
to the former , this would be an argument for introducing stricter regulations , for the latter , proof that gene technology is safe , increases production and lowers the cost of food . in fact , even though a not inconsiderable amount of agricultural land is earmarked for gm crops , the critics ' prediction that they would take over the world is greatly exaggerated .
just 6 percent - 102 million hectares - of agricultural land around the world produces gm crops . germany had just 2,700 hectares given over to gm crops in 2007 , which amounts to less than 0.1 percent of its entire agricultural land . european reservations bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : some argue that gene technology promises higher yields it 's a different story in the us , which devotes 55 million hectares of farmland to gm crops .
canada , argentina , brazil , china and india are also enthusiastic advocates of genetic modification . europe is less keen .
this stems partly from legal restrictions but also has to do with agricultural structures . " use of genetically modified seed is only worth it in regions where the fields are very large , because it is so expensive , " said heike moldenhauer from friends of the earth germany .
in these cases , the fact that gm crops are highly resistant to pests and damage reduces the chances of a failed harvest .
with smaller fields , these advantages are less crucial . the same principle applies in germany .
gm crops are grown almost exclusively in the former east germany , where fields are larger than they are in the western part of the country .
according to statistics compiled by the german office for consumer protection and food safety , the highest proportion of gm crops care to be found in brandenburg , saxony and mecklenburg-western pommerania . germany permits the import of gm crops , but only monsanto 's modified corn seed mon 810 may be grown in the european union .
other gm seed is used all over the world , including corn , rapeseed , cotton and soybean . allying consumer fears bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : consumers want to make informed choices nonetheless , 80 percent of the genetically modified products cultivated by the world 's farmers rarely end up directly in the consumers ' kitchens .
the bulk of it is used for animal feed after brussels banned use of processed animal protein in animal feed and european farmers largely switched to low-cost gm soybean . ultimately , consumers determined to avoid gm food should steer clear of animal products such as milk , meat and eggs .
but they can rest assured that the remaining 20 percent of gm crops being grown are destined for t-shirts and jeans .
for the time being , there are still plenty of alternatives to genetically modified tomatoes and potatoes in germany 's supermarkets . leila knüppel -lrb- jp -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?
dw-world.de berlin agrees on new gm labeling law - but how strict is it ?

" the backroom boy turned ' vanilla ' futures trader who lost 4.9 billion euros -lrb- $ 7.2 billion -rrb- for socgen shows just how easy it is to dupe " sophisticated systems of checks and balances , wrote london 's financial times on thursday , jan .
24 , in its online edition .
" at one level the abuse at socgen is another example of a european bank trying to emulate wall street 's finest , but coming unstuck because of a failure in risk control . " but it is also true that as long as human nature remains what it is - and dealers are rewarded for making profits and fired for failure - then deception will always be a risk , " continued the paper . the case could " yet prove terminal " for societe generale , concluded the financial times and " a take-over attempt by one or more of its rivals must be a possibility . " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : one french paper saw italy 's unicredit as a potential buyer french financial publication les echos on thursday agreed that a buy-out was likely .
" it 's become booty in a banking landscape that has been shaken up by the unfortunate american mortgage crisis and put back in order , " the paper commented .
" if its long-time competitor bnp paribas does n't snap at the chance , another large european bank could - like unicredit in italy , for example . " in the us , a bank would have to replace its president in a similar situation , opined the paper , but the consequence for societe generale is likely to be a " loss of independence . " writing from munich on thursday , the süddeutsche zeitung predicted that the french bank would survive the crisis , as " the government wo n't allow it to collapse . " apparently investors attribute the losses to the criminal behavior of an individual and do n't see a connection to the credit crisis , " wrote the german paper .
nevertheless , " the case has further undermined trust in the financial branch , without which it can not fulfill its important role in the economy . " although fraud can not be rule out , banks and controllers should be responsible for " keeping the risks as small as possible , " concluded the paper . paris ' le figaro in its thursday edition agreed that " bankers are urgently called upon to stringently and uncompromisingly build up their control systems for risky businesses " and that the " stock exchange supervisory should adjust their tools to meet the requirements of the modern financial world . " this unbelievable affair adds to the mistrust that has ruined the reputation of the financial world since the beginning of the us mortgage crisis , " the french paper concluded . dw staff -lrb- kjb -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

a threat of terrorism anywhere in the world suffices , ruled a leipzig court . the federal administrative court in leipzig ruled thursday , jan .
24 , that the german intelligence agency -lrb- bnd -rrb- can bug the telephones of suspected terrorists even when there is no immediate threat to germany .
the possibility that " sleepers " in germany are involved in plans for international attacks is sufficient grounds for strategic monitoring , the court decided . according to the parliamentary control committee -lrb- pkg -rrb- , the bnd employed strategic monitoring tactics some 24,400 times , with 21 cases considered relevant to the intelligence services . no national restraints bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : intelligence can tap phone lines when an international terrorist threat is looming the case had been brought by a man currently serving time in a cologne jail for terrorist activities .
in october 2005 , a düsseldorf court sentenced him to eight years behind bars for his involvement in the al-tawhid organization .
the evidence against him was based on a telephone conversation in which he was heard to offer his services as a suicide bomber . the complainant argued that the intelligence services ' tapping of his telephones in october and november 2001 was illegal , with his lawyer arguing that indications of planned international terrorist activity was inadequate grounds for supervision . " this is absurd , " said a representative from the bnd .
" in this era of international terrorism , investigators can not be restricted by national borders .

" from today 's perspective , i realize it was bizarre lunacy , " he told the court as the trial drew to a close .
" i just do n't understand how i ever got involved in it .

not even the new german law banning tobacco in public buildings .
anti-smoking advocates are not amused and are pressing charges . " anyone who does n't read is an idiot , " said former chancellor helmut schmidt in an interview for die zeit 's weekly magazine leben on thursday , jan .
24 . but however many books the very learned schmidt might have read , he certainly does n't seem to be good at reading germany 's new and very visible no smoking signs . his remark was issued the same week that prosecutors in hamburg began investigating him for lighting up in the lobby of the komödie winterhuder fährhaus theater just hours after the controversial smoking ban came into force on january 1 . yet another controversy bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : schmidt in the days when everyone smoked hailing from a time when cigarettes were easily the least pernicious of politicans ' preferred poisons , schmidt would never have predicted the impact a quick smoke could have in this health-conscious age . but then the indomitable elder statesman of german politics was snapped by the mass circulation bild newspaper blithely puffing away at a reception with his wife , childhood sweetheart loki . and before he knew it , he was at the heart of a controversy at least as divisive as his policies on the soviet invasion of afghanistan back in the late 1970s . bodily harm ? bild has reported that the schmidts might even face bodily harm charges .
according to the german criminal code , " anyone who physically abuses someone else or damages their health can be given a suspended sentence of up to five years or be punished with a financial penalty . " in fact , helmut schmidt 's recalcitrance is hardly a surprise .
a dedicated smoker throughout his career , schmidt is still seldom photographed without a cigarette even as he approaches his 90s .
interviews are generally conducted amid a thick cloud of smoke and changing public attitudes have done nothing to curb his enthusiasm . nicknamed schmidt-schnauze -lrb- sassy schmidt -rrb- for his sharp tongue and ready wit , the former politician famed for never following the crowd is the last person likely to give up a lifetime 's habit simply because it has fallen out of fashion . during his years in office between 1974 and 1982 , schmidt weathered political turbulence ranging from the international oil crisis to the terrorism of the baader-meinhof era .
cigarette smoking never seemed to get in the way of his political duties . dismissal likely rüdiger bagger , a prosecutions spokesman in hamburg , confirmed the complaint had been received , but said the docket would be most likely be dismissed . " smoking is definitely damaging to the health , but there 's no evidence mr and mrs schmidt committed assault , " he said . hamburg has already announced that its bylaws department will not start imposing misdemeanour fines on smokers till march , so the complaint seems unlikely to have any legal consequences . unpopular motion germany implemented the ban on smoking in bars and restaurants across most of the country on jan .
1 . the new law has not gone down well in a nation long considered a smoker 's haven .
it has been suggested that the move has met with more resistance here than in other cigarette-loving nations such as france and italy because of the long shadow cast by the country 's past .
one of germany 's most fervent anti-smokers was hitler , who cracked down on the habit during the third reich . in fact , the ban in germany is more lenient than those imposed in other western european nations in recent years as restaurants in the country will be allowed to provide separate smoking rooms . bad example bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : still ignored by many the case against the rebellious schmidts was brought by anti-smoking activists in the western city of wiesbaden . " they were recklessly smoking in public and someone like mr schmidt should know better - he is setting a very bad example , so we launched legal proceedings , " activist horst keiser told reuters . " how can children and young people be expected to grasp that laws must be respected when even a statesman like helmut schmidt ignores them ? " keiser said he wanted the schmidts to be fined a few thousand euros and for the money to be donated to a children 's charity .
he also wanted them to stop smoking in public . " a lot of people think , look at him , he 's 89 and still going strong , how bad can smoking be , " he added .
" but no one realizes that in fact he 's had four bypasses and has a pacemaker . " according to the hamburger morgenpost , however , loki schmidt says that she and her husband have no intention of quitting . " even our doctors have advised us against it , " she maintains .
" they say it would be too stressful for our bodies . " dw staff -lrb- jp -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

25 , to pass a gene technology law , while last week saw the introduction of a new non-gm label .
consumers are under the impression that gm food has become an unavoidable fact of life . just how many of the products on germany supermarket shelves are genetically modified ?
both skeptics and supporters of gene technology like to make out that gm crops are everywhere .
to the former , this would be an argument for introducing stricter regulations , for the latter , proof that gene technology is safe , increases production and lowers the cost of food . in fact , even though a not inconsiderable amount of agricultural land is earmarked for gm crops , the critics ' prediction that they would take over the world is greatly exaggerated .
just 6 percent - 102 million hectares - of agricultural land around the world produces gm crops . germany had just 2,700 hectares given over to gm crops in 2007 , which amounts to less than 0.1 percent of its entire agricultural land . european reservations bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : some argue that gene technology promises higher yields it 's a different story in the us , which devotes 55 million hectares of farmland to gm crops .
canada , argentina , brazil , china and india are also enthusiastic advocates of genetic modification . europe is less keen .
this stems partly from legal restrictions but also has to do with agricultural structures . " use of genetically modified seed is only worth it in regions where the fields are very large , because it is so expensive , " said heike moldenhauer from friends of the earth germany .
in these cases , the fact that gm crops are highly resistant to pests and damage reduces the chances of a failed harvest .
with smaller fields , these advantages are less crucial . the same principle applies in germany .
gm crops are grown almost exclusively in the former east germany , where fields are larger than they are in the western part of the country .
according to statistics compiled by the german office for consumer protection and food safety , the highest proportion of gm crops care to be found in brandenburg , saxony and mecklenburg-western pommerania . germany permits the import of gm crops , but only monsanto 's modified corn seed mon 810 may be grown in the european union .
other gm seed is used all over the world , including corn , rapeseed , cotton and soybean . allying consumer fears bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : consumers want to make informed choices nonetheless , 80 percent of the genetically modified products cultivated by the world 's farmers rarely end up directly in the consumers ' kitchens .
the bulk of it is used for animal feed after brussels banned use of processed animal protein in animal feed and european farmers largely switched to low-cost gm soybean . ultimately , consumers determined to avoid gm food should steer clear of animal products such as milk , meat and eggs .
but they can rest assured that the remaining 20 percent of gm crops being grown are destined for t-shirts and jeans .
for the time being , there are still plenty of alternatives to genetically modified tomatoes and potatoes in germany 's supermarkets . leila knüppel -lrb- jp -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?
dw-world.de dw-world : berlin agrees on new gm labeling law - but how strict is it ?
with a view to creating greater transparency for consumers , germany is to introduce a special label for food that has not been genetically modified , such as products from animals that have not been fed biotech grains .
-lrb- 15.01.2008 -rrb- dw-world : french scientists express doubt about genetically modified corn the environmental protection organization greenpeace has long said genetically modified maize could be a health hazard .
now , in a new study , a group of french scientists have also expressed their doubts about the corn .

henry viii 's flagship the mary rose , housed at portsmouth 's historic dockyard , was raised from the bottom of the solent , in 1982 .
fears the national treasure would be sold for firewood if the funding bid failed clouded the 25th anniversary of the ship 's raising last october .
the heritage lottery fund grant will be used to complete its conservation and build a museum around the vessel .
the overall cost of the project will total £ 20.5m.
over 19,000 artefacts recovered from the ship will be on display at the museum , which is currently a temporary structure .
admiral john lippiett , of the mary rose trust , said : " -lsb- it -rsb- paves the way to complete the long conservation process and display the majority of amazing artefacts in a magnificent museum .
the mary rose was taken to a dry dock after being raised in 1982 " the learning facilities will be world class and able to meet the huge demand placed upon them by school children and students . "
dame liz forgan , chair of the heritage lottery fund -lrb- hlf -rrb- , said : " the mary rose is an amazing time-capsule and one of our most precious heritage icons . "
the mary rose , which sank on 19 july 1545 is the only 16th century warship in the world to be recovered and put on display .
in 2006 , the trust 's £ 13.5m heritage lottery fund bid for the major upgrade of the museum failed .
more than 60 million people worldwide watched the hull of the ship being brought to the surface in 1982 after 437 years submerged in the solent .
she is estimated to have generated more than £ 60m since 1982 as one of portsmouth 's major tourist attractions .
meanwhile , the victorian tea clipper the cutty sark , at greenwich in south-east london , has been awarded £ 10m from the fund .
the ship was badly damaged by fire in dry dock part way through a £ 25m conservation project in may last year .

henry viii 's flagship the mary rose , housed at portsmouth 's historic dockyard , was raised from the bottom of the solent , in 1982 .
fears the national treasure would be sold for firewood if the funding bid failed clouded the 25th anniversary of the ship 's raising last october .
the heritage lottery fund grant will be used to complete its conservation and build a museum around the vessel .
the overall cost of the project will total £ 20.5m.
over 19,000 artefacts recovered from the ship will be on display at the museum , which is currently a temporary structure .
admiral john lippiett , of the mary rose trust , said : " -lsb- it -rsb- paves the way to complete the long conservation process and display the majority of amazing artefacts in a magnificent museum .
the mary rose was taken to a dry dock after being raised in 1982 " the learning facilities will be world class and able to meet the huge demand placed upon them by school children and students . "
dame liz forgan , chair of the heritage lottery fund -lrb- hlf -rrb- , said : " the mary rose is an amazing time-capsule and one of our most precious heritage icons . "
the mary rose , which sank on 19 july 1545 is the only 16th century warship in the world to be recovered and put on display .
in 2006 , the trust 's £ 13.5m heritage lottery fund bid for the major upgrade of the museum failed .
more than 60 million people worldwide watched the hull of the ship being brought to the surface in 1982 after 437 years submerged in the solent .
she is estimated to have generated more than £ 60m since 1982 as one of portsmouth 's major tourist attractions .
meanwhile , the victorian tea clipper the cutty sark , at greenwich in south-east london , has been awarded £ 10m from the fund .
the ship was badly damaged by fire in dry dock part way through a £ 25m conservation project in may last year .

henry viii 's flagship the mary rose , housed at portsmouth 's historic dockyard , was raised from the bottom of the solent , in 1982 .
fears the national treasure would be sold for firewood if the funding bid failed clouded the 25th anniversary of the ship 's raising last october .
the heritage lottery fund grant will be used to complete its conservation and build a museum around the vessel .
the overall cost of the project will total £ 20.5m.
over 19,000 artefacts recovered from the ship will be on display at the museum , which is currently a temporary structure .
admiral john lippiett , of the mary rose trust , said : " -lsb- it -rsb- paves the way to complete the long conservation process and display the majority of amazing artefacts in a magnificent museum .
" the learning facilities will be world class and able to meet the huge demand placed upon them by school children and students . "
dame liz forgan , chair of the heritage lottery fund -lrb- hlf -rrb- , said : " the mary rose is an amazing time-capsule and one of our most precious heritage icons . "
the mary rose , which sank on 19 july 1545 is the only 16th century warship in the world to be recovered and put on display .
in 2006 , the trust 's £ 13.5m heritage lottery fund bid for the major upgrade of the museum failed .
more than 60 million people worldwide watched the hull of the ship being brought to the surface in 1982 after 437 years submerged in the solent .
she is estimated to have generated more than £ 60m since 1982 as one of portsmouth 's major tourist attractions .
meanwhile , the victorian tea clipper the cutty sark , at greenwich in south-east london , has been awarded £ 10m from the fund .
the ship was badly damaged by fire in dry dock part way through a £ 25m conservation project in may last year .

when 239 workers at the coal mine in hirwaun , south wales , bought their pit in 1995 , a year after it was closed down , experts warned it would not work .
with sacked staff pooling their £ 8,000 redundancy money to raise £ 2m , it was a gamble many feared would not reap rewards .
but 13 years on , as the pit closes for the last time because of dwindling coal reserves , the worker-owners can hang up their hard hats knowing they proved the doubters wrong .
tower history 1805 the site of the colliery was first worked 1864 the first drift , named tower , was started on hirwaun common march 1984 thousands of miners went on strike after it was announced 20 pits were to close with the loss of 20,000 jobs 1985 after a year of striking , miners agreed to go back to work - but pits closed rapidly over the next few years 1994 the industry was privatised and british coal closed tower colliery on april 22 , saying it would be uneconomical to continue production local mp , ann clwyd , staged a sit-in in the mine to protest against its closure , £ 2m was raised by 239 miners , led by tyrone o 'sullivan to buy tower 1995 after being told their bid was successful , the miners marched back to the pit as its owners on january 2 1999 an opera tells the story of the tower rescue 2001 a contract to supply aberthaw power station secures jobs at the pit 2004 : celebrating 10 years of the buy-out , tyrone o 'sullivan said : " we 've competed with the world .
it 's not that we 've been lucky . " 2006 : dwindling coal seams are blamed for the decision to close tower within three years source : bbc archives tower colliery provided jobs for men who had feared for their futures as mines closed across the country , in the years following the 1984-85 miners ' strike .
these men refused to accept the fate forced upon them when the pit closed in 1994 - they knew better than anyone that the pit 's seams were thick with quality anthracite coal .
and after returning to work as mine-owners , they turned the pit 's fortunes around .
soon , tower was turning in a profit , year after year , and secured major contracts at home and abroad , despite setbacks including an earthquake which caused a methane gas leak .
it shared its success with the residents of hirwaun , keeping a strong sense of community spirit in an area where unemployment brought bleak times for many other valley towns and villages .
and it helped wales progress into a stronger nation - first minister rhodri morgan said himself last month that the buy-out of tower was a pivotal moment in national self-confidence and paved the way for devolution .
as tyrone o 'sullivan , the man who led his colleagues in britain 's only miners ' buy-out , said : " many people said to me when we went back , ' oh , we will be lucky if we have three years ty ' or ' it all makes a difference even if it 's only two years ' .
" and lo and behold , here we are 13 years on .
so i think it 's been a great success but mostly it 's shown that ordinary working people can control their own life . "
for both the workers and members of the local community , the closure of the pit is devastating - but provides a moment to reflect and be proud .
coal is on its way back so i think this will be a good trade in the future to have ryan tamlin jenny williams , 61 , who worked in the pit 's kitchen and was among those who gave money to tower , said " it was a gamble at the beginning and a lot of people said not to do it .
" but it did succeed and it brought a lot of work . "
even children , who attended the final tower colliery christmas children 's party , were aware of the significance of the pit 's closure .
michael o 'sullivan said : " it 's really sad .
i wanted to work there but i ca n't .
i do n't know what i will do now . "
and what of the miners for whom life has revolved around tower ?
for many , they are laying their hope of work at the newly-opened aberpergwm drift mine in the neath valley .
they believe coal is making a comeback in wales , providing them with more security than they could have anticipated in the dark days of the 1980s .
ryan tamlin , 19 , who has already transferred from tower to aberpergwm , said he followed his father into mining after college because it is a " recognised trade " .
" it 's a good place to be because they 're expanding , " he said .
" coal is on its way back so i think this will be a good trade in the future to have . "
with these words , you suspect tower colliery 's closure may not represent the final chapter in the story of mining in south wales .

the nationwide core consumer price index -lrb- cpi -rrb- rose 0.8 % from a year earlier , government figures show .
the data indicated the rise was down to firms passing on the cost of rising food and energy prices to consumers , rather than higher consumer spending .
for this reason , it is thought that japanese interest rates will not rise beyond 0.5 % soon , and could even fall .
this view was supported by the narrowing of the country 's trade surplus in december , as exports fell and record oil prices pushed up the value of imports .
return to deflation ?
there are fears that the fragile economic recovery in japan will be knocked off course by a sharp slowdown in the us , which is a key export market for some of the country 's biggest firms .
this has fuelled a sharp sell-off in japanese stocks in recent weeks and many analysts now predict that the bank of japan could cut interest rates from their current level of 0.5 % to lift the domestic economy .
the economics minister , hiroko ota , said that japan had not made a huge move away from the deflationary environment , which plagued the country for more than a decade .
but she added : " looking ahead , the economy will likely expand moderately under stable prices towards the next fiscal year .
" based on such judgment , we firmly believe that we can continue to realise stable economic growth by providing the current accommodative monetary conditions for a while . "

the nationwide core consumer price index -lrb- cpi -rrb- rose 0.8 % from a year earlier , government figures show .
the data indicated the rise was down to firms passing on the cost of rising food and energy prices to consumers , rather than higher consumer spending .
for this reason , it is thought that japanese interest rates will not rise beyond 0.5 % soon , and could even fall .
this view was supported by the narrowing of the country 's trade surplus in december , as exports fell and record oil prices pushed up the value of imports .
return to deflation ?
there are fears that the fragile economic recovery in japan will be knocked off course by a sharp slowdown in the us , which is a key export market for some of the country 's biggest firms .
this has fuelled a sharp sell-off in japanese stocks in recent weeks and many analysts now predict that the bank of japan could cut interest rates from their current level of 0.5 % to lift the domestic economy .
the economics minister , hiroko ota , said that japan had not made a huge move away from the deflationary environment , which plagued the country for more than a decade .
but she added : " looking ahead , the economy will likely expand moderately under stable prices towards the next fiscal year .
" based on such judgment , we firmly believe that we can continue to realise stable economic growth by providing the current accommodative monetary conditions for a while . "

some experts put the rise down to a change in the law which has made divorces easier to obtain .
others say china 's one-child policy has produced a generation of adults focused on their own needs and unable to sustain a relationship .
the government also reported that the number of marriages rose by 12 % .
the rising divorce rate is part of a long-term trend .
since china began its market reforms in the late 1970s , the number of people getting a divorce has quadrupled .
this has been exacerbated by a change in the law in 2003 allowing couples to divorce in a day , analysts say .
previously , couples needed permission from either their employers or community committees to divorce .
the increase in break-ups did not mean that chinese were losing faith in marriage , said xu anqi of the shanghai academy of social science .
" people 's expectations are higher .
the things couples compromised on 10 years ago are n't tolerated today , " she told china 's state-run xinhua news agency .

beekeepers in wales are reporting a dip in honey production following the cold , wet weather .
a member of the welsh beekeepers ' association -lrb- wba -rrb- said 2007 was one of the worst harvests he could remember .
last year 's wet summer also left many vegetable growers in the uk with diseased crops .
speaking about the expected shortage , john tayler , secretary of the wba , said worker bees who foraged for nectar disliked inclement weather .
he blamed a lack of sunshine last summer , when the majority of honey is produced , for the failure of plants to produce enough nectar for the bees .
honey bee facts a colony of bees can have 40,000 workers a bee will visit from 100 to 1,000 flowers each outing from the hive it can take 50,000 bee flights to collect a pound of honey bees also produce wax for candles and royal jelly mr tayler said there was a shortage right across wales .
" generally across wales it was a poor honey harvest last year for the vast majority of beekeepers , " said mr tayler , who lives near llandovery in carmarthenshire .
he added that he had 16 hives which , in a good year , normally produced up to 600lbs -lrb- 272kgs -rrb- of honey , but last year that plummeted to just 40lbs -lrb- 18.1kgs -rrb- .
" there 's bound to be a shortage of what i call gourmet honey -lrb- privately produced -rrb- in the shops , " he explained .
" last summer 's bad weather has certainly had an affect on honey production .
worker bees do n't forage in the rain or cold weather . "
ceredigion beekeeper phil regan , from taliesin , near aberystwyth , said his honey production had more than halved due to a combination of the weather and the varroa parasitic mite which can kill bees .
" it 's one of the worst years of production i can ever remember , although the last few years have not been good , " said mr regan , who has been a beekeeper for more than 30 years .

he added that he had 16 hives which , in a good year , normally produced up to 600lbs -lrb- 272kgs -rrb- of honey , but last year that plummeted to just 40lbs -lrb- 18.1kgs -rrb- .

ceredigion beekeeper phil regan , from taliesin , near aberystwyth , said his honey production had more than halved due to a combination of the weather and the varroa parasitic mite which can kill bees .
" it 's one of the worst years of production i can ever remember , although the last few years have not been good , " said mr regan , who has been a beekeeper for more than 30 years .

beekeepers in wales are reporting a dip in honey production following the cold , wet weather .
a member of the welsh beekeepers ' association -lrb- wba -rrb- said 2007 was one of the worst harvests he could remember .
last year 's wet summer also left many vegetable growers in the uk with diseased crops .
speaking about the expected shortage , john tayler , secretary of the wba , said worker bees who foraged for nectar disliked inclement weather .
he blamed a lack of sunshine last summer , when the majority of honey is produced , for the failure of plants to produce enough nectar for the bees .

by catherine marston bbc news plans are afoot to close 2,500 post offices nationwide .
the post office in the village of burton fleming in east yorkshire is one of those facing closure .
how would its closure affect local people ?
villagers say burton fleming 's post office is vital to the community godfrey coleman is the oldest person in the village of burton fleming .
he has lived here all his life and has seen the area change almost beyond recognition .
he says the post office has been an essential part of life for as long as he can recall - as well as offering the usual services , it fulfils a vital social role .
everyone knows each other and staff at the post office know when someone is due to visit to collect their pension or withdraw money .
it 's totally frustrating that all these people 's voices , all their comments , all the reasons why they feel the post office should stay , are not being listened to tony gibson if a resident does not visit at their usual time , the staff raise the alarm and other residents check on that person .
it 's also a meeting place in burton fleming .
with no pub and only a village hall , the post office is often the place for a chat .
' reliant and dependent ' godfrey , like many of the pensioners in the village , fears losing the post office will mean losing his independence .
he has mobility problems and there is virtually no public transport to get him to other post offices in the area .
if the post office closes , he will need to rely on the kindness of neighbours ; he feels upset to think that means he will become dependent .
godfrey coleman fears for the loss of his independence " you become absolutely reliant , " he explains .
and it 's not just the elderly who fear the closure will change village life .
in such a cut-off area teenagers , especially , worry they will be more isolated than ever .
sixteen-year-old philip wells has become actively involved in the village campaign to save the post office .
changing times he fears that if it closes the heart of the community will go with it .
" for younger people , well , there will be nothing , " he warns .
" this will just be a place to live , there 's no connectivity , there 's nothing there .
" and i think that 's an absolutely terrible thing to happen - village life will not be as it is . "
the government says just 4,000 post offices make money and that more than 80 % of the rural network is not profitable .
the post office says people are just not using the branches in the same way as in the past .
teenager philip wells has been campaigning for his post office people now use online accounts and pay bills over the phone or by computer .
that means some single transactions cost the post office £ 8 .
adrian wells is overseeing the changes in east yorkshire and other areas for the post office .
he stresses that those areas losing their post offices are being offered alternatives - such as outreach services , where a post office will be set up for a few hours each week in village halls and other locations .
but he also says he recognises the loyalty people have to their branch .
" i do n't think anyone wants to see post offices close , " he says .
" but times are changing and the post office has to reflect those changes . "
in vain ?
burton fleming will find out on monday if the village is to lose what it sees as a vital feature of its community .
tony gibson has been running the village campaign to save the post office .
he has collected hundreds of signatures on a petition and letters of complaint .
but he fears the decision has really already been made and the campaign will not change the village 's fate .
" it 's totally frustrating that all these people 's voices , all their comments all the reasons why they feel the post office should stay , are not being listened to , " he says .

by catherine marston bbc news plans are afoot to close 2,500 post offices nationwide .
the post office in the village of burton fleming in east yorkshire is one of those facing closure .
how would its closure affect local people ?
villagers say burton fleming 's post office is vital to the community godfrey coleman is the oldest person in the village of burton fleming .
he has lived here all his life and has seen the area change almost beyond recognition .
he says the post office has been an essential part of life for as long as he can recall - as well as offering the usual services , it fulfils a vital social role .
everyone knows each other and staff at the post office know when someone is due to visit to collect their pension or withdraw money .
it 's totally frustrating that all these people 's voices , all their comments , all the reasons why they feel the post office should stay , are not being listened to tony gibson if a resident does not visit at their usual time , the staff raise the alarm and other residents check on that person .
it 's also a meeting place in burton fleming .
with no pub and only a village hall , the post office is often the place for a chat .
' reliant and dependent ' godfrey , like many of the pensioners in the village , fears losing the post office will mean losing his independence .
he has mobility problems and there is virtually no public transport to get him to other post offices in the area .
if the post office closes , he will need to rely on the kindness of neighbours ; he feels upset to think that means he will become dependent .
godfrey coleman fears for the loss of his independence " you become absolutely reliant , " he explains .
and it 's not just the elderly who fear the closure will change village life .
in such a cut-off area teenagers , especially , worry they will be more isolated than ever .
sixteen-year-old philip wells has become actively involved in the village campaign to save the post office .
changing times he fears that if it closes the heart of the community will go with it .
" for younger people , well , there will be nothing , " he warns .
" this will just be a place to live , there 's no connectivity , there 's nothing there .
" and i think that 's an absolutely terrible thing to happen - village life will not be as it is . "
the government says just 4,000 post offices make money and that more than 80 % of the rural network is not profitable .
the post office says people are just not using the branches in the same way as in the past .
teenager philip wells has been campaigning for his post office people now use online accounts and pay bills over the phone or by computer .
that means some single transactions cost the post office £ 8 .
adrian wells is overseeing the changes in east yorkshire and other areas for the post office .
he stresses that those areas losing their post offices are being offered alternatives - such as outreach services , where a post office will be set up for a few hours each week in village halls and other locations .
but he also says he recognises the loyalty people have to their branch .
" i do n't think anyone wants to see post offices close , " he says .
" but times are changing and the post office has to reflect those changes . "
in vain ?
burton fleming will find out on monday if the village is to lose what it sees as a vital feature of its community .
tony gibson has been running the village campaign to save the post office .
he has collected hundreds of signatures on a petition and letters of complaint .
but he fears the decision has really already been made and the campaign will not change the village 's fate .
" it 's totally frustrating that all these people 's voices , all their comments all the reasons why they feel the post office should stay , are not being listened to , " he says .

by catherine marston bbc news plans are afoot to close 2,500 post offices nationwide .
the post office in the village of burton fleming in east yorkshire is one of those facing closure .
how would its closure affect local people ?
villagers say burton fleming 's post office is vital to the community godfrey coleman is the oldest person in the village of burton fleming .
he has lived here all his life and has seen the area change almost beyond recognition .
he says the post office has been an essential part of life for as long as he can recall - as well as offering the usual services , it fulfils a vital social role .
everyone knows each other and staff at the post office know when someone is due to visit to collect their pension or withdraw money .
it 's totally frustrating that all these people 's voices , all their comments , all the reasons why they feel the post office should stay , are not being listened to tony gibson if a resident does not visit at their usual time , the staff raise the alarm and other residents check on that person .
it 's also a meeting place in burton fleming .
with no pub and only a village hall , the post office is often the place for a chat .
' reliant and dependent ' godfrey , like many of the pensioners in the village , fears losing the post office will mean losing his independence .
he has mobility problems and there is virtually no public transport to get him to other post offices in the area .
if the post office closes , he will need to rely on the kindness of neighbours ; he feels upset to think that means he will become dependent .
godfrey coleman fears for the loss of his independence " you become absolutely reliant , " he explains .
and it 's not just the elderly who fear the closure will change village life .
in such a cut-off area teenagers , especially , worry they will be more isolated than ever .
sixteen-year-old philip wells has become actively involved in the village campaign to save the post office .
changing times he fears that if it closes the heart of the community will go with it .
" for younger people , well , there will be nothing , " he warns .
" this will just be a place to live , there 's no connectivity , there 's nothing there .
" and i think that 's an absolutely terrible thing to happen - village life will not be as it is . "
the government says just 4,000 post offices make money and that more than 80 % of the rural network is not profitable .
the post office says people are just not using the branches in the same way as in the past .
teenager philip wells has been campaigning for his post office people now use online accounts and pay bills over the phone or by computer .

by catherine marston bbc news plans are afoot to close 2,500 post offices nationwide .
the post office in the village of burton fleming in east yorkshire is one of those facing closure .
how would its closure affect local people ?
godfrey coleman is the oldest person in the village of burton fleming .
he has lived here all his life and has seen the area change almost beyond recognition .
he says the post office has been an essential part of life for as long as he can recall - as well as offering the usual services , it fulfils a vital social role .
everyone knows each other and staff at the post office know when someone is due to visit to collect their pension or withdraw money . "
it 's totally frustrating that all these people 's voices , all their comments , all the reasons why they feel the post office should stay , are not being listened to " tony gibson if a resident does not visit at their usual time , the staff raise the alarm and other residents check on that person .
it 's also a meeting place in burton fleming .
with no pub and only a village hall , the post office is often the place for a chat .
' reliant and dependent ' godfrey , like many of the pensioners in the village , fears losing the post office will mean losing his independence .
he has mobility problems and there is virtually no public transport to get him to other post offices in the area .
if the post office closes , he will need to rely on the kindness of neighbours ; he feels upset to think that means he will become dependent .
" you become absolutely reliant , " he explains .
and it 's not just the elderly who fear the closure will change village life .
in such a cut-off area teenagers , especially , worry they will be more isolated than ever .
sixteen-year-old philip wells has become actively involved in the village campaign to save the post office .
changing times he fears that if it closes the heart of the community will go with it .
" for younger people , well , there will be nothing , " he warns .
" this will just be a place to live , there 's no connectivity , there 's nothing there .
" and i think that 's an absolutely terrible thing to happen - village life will not be as it is . "
the government says just 4,000 post offices make money and that more than 80 % of the rural network is not profitable .
the post office says people are just not using the branches in the same way as in the past .
people now use online accounts and pay bills over the phone or by computer .
that means some single transactions cost the post office £ 8 .
adrian wells is overseeing the changes in east yorkshire and other areas for the post office .
he stresses that those areas losing their post offices are being offered alternatives - such as outreach services , where a post office will be set up for a few hours each week in village halls and other locations .
but he also says he recognises the loyalty people have to their branch .
" i do n't think anyone wants to see post offices close , " he says .
" but times are changing and the post office has to reflect those changes . "
in vain ?
burton fleming will find out on monday if the village is to lose what it sees as a vital feature of its community .
tony gibson has been running the village campaign to save the post office .
he has collected hundreds of signatures on a petition and letters of complaint .
but he fears the decision has really already been made and the campaign will not change the village 's fate .
" it 's totally frustrating that all these people 's voices , all their comments all the reasons why they feel the post office should stay , are not being listened to , " he says .

bbc news -pipe- entertainment -pipe- sundance warms to sir ben 's ' wackness ' bbc news / entertainment graphics version bbc sport home news front page -pipe- africa -pipe- americas -pipe- asia-pacific -pipe- europe -pipe- middle east -pipe- south asia -pipe- uk -pipe- business -pipe- health -pipe- science & environment -pipe- technology -pipe- entertainment -pipe- also in the news -pipe- have your say -pipe- entertainment contents : arts & culture friday , 25 january 2008 , 08:22 gmt sundance warms to sir ben 's ' wackness ' by tom brook park city , utah sir ben kingsley is winning praise at sundance for his portrayal of a pot-smoking psychiatrist in a coming-of-age story called the wackness .
the film is set in new york in 1994 and chronicles the adventures of a middle class pot-dealing teenager who pays for his therapy sessions by handing over marijuana to his psychiatrist .
" he 's probably quite a good therapist in theory , " says sir ben , " but he does n't apply any of his healing tenets to himself because he 's an addict . "
as the story unfolds there is a reversal of roles as the teenager - played by josh peck - helps sir ben 's character mature .
as sir ben sees it : " it 's a young man , an adolescent , that forces me to face myself and grow up .
in turn , my gift to him is that he also has to go out into the world , into the big marketplace , and be honest to himself . " there is plenty of drug taking in the wackness which could lead to a restrictive rating " " so we both save each other eventually .
but it 's a very funny journey along the way . "
sir ben has delivered some indelible portrayals in his five decades as an actor - from his oscar-winning role in gandhi in 1982 to his scene-stealing role as ruthless gangster don logan in sexy beast in 2000 .
the actor says he is drawn to re-invention : " it 's the biggest joy for me . "
he maintains he is drawn to doing different characters because it helps him to continue to reach audiences .
" i wo n't do that by playing the same person over and over again .
i 'll do that by empathizing with as many human conditions as possible until i ca n't do it anymore . "
although the film is nicely shot - and the performances strong - there is plenty of drug taking in the wackness which could lead to a restrictive rating which would limit its commercial prospects .
one of the film 's weaknesses is that some of the depictions do not quite ring true .
too many rough edges have been smoothed out .
the picture , while not glossy , could have done with some more grit .
according to sir ben , more than one film company has expressed an interest in buying the wackness for distribution .
the film may have won praise at sundance , but positive responses at the festival can be a notoriously unreliable guide to how a film will perform in the outside world .
from sir ben 's point of view , the wackness has given him the opportunity to add one more great portrayal to his illustrious career .

the film is set in new york in 1994 and chronicles the adventures of a middle class pot-dealing teenager who pays for his therapy sessions by handing over marijuana to his psychiatrist .
" he 's probably quite a good therapist in theory , " says sir ben , " but he does n't apply any of his healing tenets to himself because he 's an addict . "
as the story unfolds there is a reversal of roles as the teenager - played by josh peck - helps sir ben 's character mature .
as sir ben sees it : " it 's a young man , an adolescent , that forces me to face myself and grow up .
in turn , my gift to him is that he also has to go out into the world , into the big marketplace , and be honest to himself. there is plenty of drug taking in the wackness which could lead to a restrictive rating " so we both save each other eventually .
but it 's a very funny journey along the way . "
sir ben has delivered some indelible portrayals in his five decades as an actor - from his oscar-winning role in gandhi in 1982 to his scene-stealing role as ruthless gangster don logan in sexy beast in 2000 .
mary-kate olsen 's character is another drug buyer in the film the actor says he is drawn to re-invention : " it 's the biggest joy for me . "
he maintains he is drawn to doing different characters because it helps him to continue to reach audiences .
" i wo n't do that by playing the same person over and over again .
i 'll do that by empathizing with as many human conditions as possible until i ca n't do it anymore . "
although the film is nicely shot - and the performances strong - there is plenty of drug taking in the wackness which could lead to a restrictive rating which would limit its commercial prospects .
one of the film 's weaknesses is that some of the depictions do not quite ring true .
too many rough edges have been smoothed out .
the picture , while not glossy , could have done with some more grit .
according to sir ben , more than one film company has expressed an interest in buying the wackness for distribution .
the film may have won praise at sundance , but positive responses at the festival can be a notoriously unreliable guide to how a film will perform in the outside world .
from sir ben 's point of view , the wackness has given him the opportunity to add one more great portrayal to his illustrious career .

the healthcare commission found epsom and st helier , surrey and sussex and ashford and st peter 's nhs trusts were among the least well performing .
frimley park , brighton and sussex and the royal west sussex nhs trusts were among the best performers .
in kent , dartford and gravesham , east kent and medway were " fair " .
maidstone and tunbridge wells was " better " .
east sussex hospitals nhs trust was also performing better and the royal surrey county hospital at guildford was fair .
it is the first time such a wide-ranging review of maternity services has been carried out . "
a ' least well-performing ' rating does not mean that the service is in any way unsafe , but that we could do better " epsom and st helier nh s trust across england , just over a quarter of the 148 trusts assessed were classed as " best performing " on 25 factors which included screening tests , ante-natal care and midwife support .
but 21 % of trusts fell into the " least well-performing " category .
the review highlighted a lack of midwives as a problem , and both surrey and sussex , which runs east surrey hospital at redhill , and epsom and st helier said they had recruited more .
" we have been very successful in attracting new staff , " said a spokeswoman for surrey and sussex .
" we now have 20 more midwives than this time last year , meeting the audit commission 's ratio of one midwife for every 35 births and we are now aiming to improve this even further . "
she said that reducing the rates of caesarean section was one of the trust 's key aims .
' improved services ' epsom and st helier said it had recruited 15 new midwives and two senior midwives since the start of 2008 .
" i 'd like to assure our patients that a ' least well-performing ' rating does not mean that the service is in any way unsafe , but that we could do better , " said chief executive samantha jones .
ashford and st peter 's said its maternity services had improved since a national survey in february 2007 .
of the mothers who responded to the survey , 91 % rated care during labour and delivery as good , very good or excellent , compared to 80 % earlier .
" for medical reasons 10 % of respondents had no choice over where to have their baby , " it said in a statement .
" this is a reflection of the specialist nature of services provided by the maternity service at ashford and st peter 's , supported by the neonatal intensive care unit at st peter 's . "

the secret is out .
although it does n't trip off the tongue too easily , the 22nd james bond film is now officially called quantum of solace .
while it may sound like a progressive rock band from the 1980s , the title actually comes from a short story by ian fleming in which 007 attends a dull dinner party in the bahamas .
the announcement , three weeks into the main film shoot at pinewood studios , will only serve to heat up the already frenzied speculation about the new james bond film .
as film fans began to dissect the deeper meaning of quantum of solace , journalists were given the chance to tour the sets on the vast 007 sound stage in buckinghamshire .
and there were plenty of clues about what we can expect from one of the most eagerly anticipated films of 2008 .
the budget for quantum of solace is larger than that of previous film casino royale -lrb- the producers wo n't say exactly how much -rrb- , but it 's not hard to see where the money is being spent .
re-creating italy among the sets at pinewood is a cavernous interior of the art gallery in the italian city of siena .
it is here that bond has an explosive fight scene , as revealed in some early footage released by the studio .
several statues - some eight metres tall - stand around the gallery set , wrapped in clear plastic - presumably to protect them from the pyrotechnics .
producer michael g wilson has let slip that the new film will open with a big car chase in the streets of siena .
he 's also mentioned an ambitious free-fall sequence involving motion-control cameras .
another siena-based set is a subterranean mi6 safe-house with a deep-water well .
it 's more like a crypt out of a harry potter film , with massive stone columns and huge wooden beams .
even gloomier is a complex of tunnels - the siena cisterns - which are so realistic that you feel genuinely deep underground when walking through them .
the action of the film is n't confined to sets at pinewood .
location filming will also include austria , italy , panama and chile .
inside m 's office but the most impressive set at pinewood has to be the mi6 headquarters .
a massive two-storey interior with ultra-modern décor , marble floors and frosted glass doors .
we are taken to see dame judi dench as bond 's boss m filming a scene in her office .
the crew is shooting close-ups of m as she speaks to her assistant tanner -lrb- played by rory kinnear -rrb- in an adjoining office .
here 's a detail for bond gadget obsessives : when m wants privacy she can touch a button and the glass wall that separates their offices frosts over .
not as impressive as an invisible car - nor as ridiculous .
leaving the mi6 set , the illusion is quickly broken - the outer shell is all plywood and gaffer tape .
it 's also hard to miss the member of the film crew who has just heard some news on his walkie-talkie .
" quantum of solace ? " he says , with a slight look of disbelief .
now that was a well-kept secret .
quantum of solace will be released in cinemas on 7 november .

the secret is out .
although it does n't trip off the tongue too easily , the 22nd james bond film is now officially called quantum of solace .
while it may sound like a progressive rock band from the 1980s , the title actually comes from a short story by ian fleming in which 007 attends a dull dinner party in the bahamas .
the announcement , three weeks into the main film shoot at pinewood studios , will only serve to heat up the already frenzied speculation about the new james bond film .
as film fans began to dissect the deeper meaning of quantum of solace , journalists were given the chance to tour the sets on the vast 007 sound stage in buckinghamshire .
and there were plenty of clues about what we can expect from one of the most eagerly anticipated films of 2008 .
olga kurylenko and gemma arterton star alongside daniel craig the budget for quantum of solace is larger than that of previous film casino royale -lrb- the producers wo n't say exactly how much -rrb- , but it 's not hard to see where the money is being spent .
re-creating italy among the sets at pinewood is a cavernous interior of the art gallery in the italian city of siena .
it is here that bond has an explosive fight scene , as revealed in some early footage released by the studio .
several statues - some eight metres tall - stand around the gallery set , wrapped in clear plastic - presumably to protect them from the pyrotechnics .
producer michael g wilson has let slip that the new film will open with a big car chase in the streets of siena .
he 's also mentioned an ambitious free-fall sequence involving motion-control cameras .
another siena-based set is a subterranean mi6 safe-house with a deep-water well .
it 's more like a crypt out of a harry potter film , with massive stone columns and huge wooden beams .
even gloomier is a complex of tunnels - the siena cisterns - which are so realistic that you feel genuinely deep underground when walking through them .
the action of the film is n't confined to sets at pinewood .
location filming will also include austria , italy , panama and chile .
inside m 's office dame judi dench reprises her role as bond 's boss , m but the most impressive set at pinewood has to be the mi6 headquarters .
a massive two-storey interior with ultra-modern décor , marble floors and frosted glass doors .
we are taken to see dame judi dench as bond 's boss m filming a scene in her office .
the crew is shooting close-ups of m as she speaks to her assistant tanner -lrb- played by rory kinnear -rrb- in an adjoining office .
here 's a detail for bond gadget obsessives : when m wants privacy she can touch a button and the glass wall that separates their offices frosts over .
not as impressive as an invisible car - nor as ridiculous .
leaving the mi6 set , the illusion is quickly broken - the outer shell is all plywood and gaffer tape .
it 's also hard to miss the member of the film crew who has just heard some news on his walkie-talkie .
" quantum of solace ? " he says , with a slight look of disbelief .
now that was a well-kept secret .
quantum of solace will be released in cinemas on 7 november .

the slippage , near chipping sodbury on thursday , closed the line between swindon and bristol parkway stations .
the train operator said the line had reopened and full peak services were expected to run on friday .
passengers have been warned that all journeys would be up to 30 minutes longer due to temporary signalling .
off peak , only an hourly service will run in both directions between london paddington and swansea .
a bus service continues to operate between bristol parkway and patchway stations .
signals crushed network rail said a 20mph speed limit put into place between bristol parkway and swindon on thursday was being increased to 40mph , which should help to reduce the delays .
route director dave ward said : " engineers have been on site through the night with a huge logistic team behind them , involving the whole industry .
" we managed to clear the 2,000 tonnes of rock using special trains to get it away .
" where the earth has fallen , it has severely damaged trackside equipment , including power to the signalling itself . "
the replacement signals will be tested over the weekend , when the line was due to be closed anyway for engineering works .
' act of god ' some passengers had praise for the way the incident had been handled .
one told the bbc : " it 's a bit of a pain , because it 's going to take longer , but it 's only half an hour , so it could be worse .
they 've done quite well to get things organised . "
another said : " it 's a bit annoying , but you ca n't stop a landslide i guess .
the website information is good .
it was an act of god , i suppose . "
the landslip is being blamed on heavy rainfall which saturated the embankment .
it is another blow for first great western , which has been severely criticised over delays , cancellations and over-crowding .
