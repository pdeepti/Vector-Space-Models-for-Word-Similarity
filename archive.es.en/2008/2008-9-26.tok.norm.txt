the pledges totalled $ 16 billion -lrb- 10.9 billion euros -rrb- according to an initial un estimate , including more than $ 3 billion to eradicate malaria , $ 2 billion to tackle an ongoing food crisis and $ 4.5 billion for educational programs .
nearly overshadowed by financial crisis fighting for money - and headlines - in light of the financial turmoil of the last few weeks , officials appeared happy with the outcome of the one-day talks .
the conference was held as the us congress was stalled in talks over a massive $ 700-billion bailout of the us financial industry .
leaders in new york were hounded with questions about the crisis at nearly every aid initiative that was launched .
un secretary general ban ki-moon said that the aid offers " exceeded our most optimistic expectations " and were a sign of " global partnership in action . "

developing countries touted their own ongoing crisis , a surge in food and energy prices that has caused social unrest in dozens of nations .
nigerian foreign minister ojo maduekwe said that globalization meant " either shared prosperity ... or shared misery for the world . "
jeffrey sachs , an economist from colombia university , said it was " preposterous " that industrial nations could not afford to give 0.7 percent of their national budgets to development aid , whether in a time of " boom " or " bust . "
among the commitments made thursday was a more than $ 3-billion initiative unveiled to eradicate malaria by 2015 .
the plan aims to save more than 4.2 million lives , mainly in africa , which has suffered most from the disease .
a $ 4.5-billion education plan aims to bring 15 million children to school over the next three years and achieve universal primary education by 2015 - one of seven millenium development goals .
us billionaires open their wallets microsoft founder bill gates and howard g. buffett , son of billionaire investor warren buffett , whose foundations provide hundreds of millions of dollars to global program fighting poverty and diseases , were present at the un meetings to answer calls for generosity .

the billionaires offered $ 76 million dollars to the world food program to assist some 350,000 farmers in 21 developing countries over the next five years .
the united states committed $ 61 million dollars to a similar program .

the european union offered an additional $ 730 million over the next three years to help address a surge in food prices .
other commitments involved addressing climate change and promoting gender equality .
but brown and others warned that despite some progress being made on education and combatting diseases like aids and malaria , many of the un 's targets were still falling flat .
norwegian prime minister jens stoltenberg said he had " hardly seen any progress at all " on cutting maternal mortality rates .

later , the anpav flight attendants ' union became the fifth of nine unions to sign up to the bailout deal . in response , the italian government decided to let a second deadline lapse in a bid to give the four remaining unions representing alitalia 's workforce a chance still to come on board .
" negotiations continue -lrb- and -rrb- the hands of the clock have been stopped , " a government official told reporters .
two other flight attendants unions said they would spend the weekend mulling whether to accept the rescue package proposed by the private italian consortium , the italian air company -lrb- cai -rrb- .
together , avia and sdl represent some 2,500 air stewards and hostesses .
two unions representing 1,400 pilots were still in talks on friday as the government endeavoured to win unanimous backing for the italian cai investor group deal .
italian labour minister maurizio sacconi told ansa news agency that the deal could , however , go ahead without the agreement of all unions .
unanimous approval " would be important ... but i think cai can pursue its course in any case , " he said .

"
despite supporting the building of mosques , the bishops said muslim communities should try to consider local residents when seeking to establish places of worship .
the bishops were meeting as part of their annual autumn plenary assembly in the city of fulda , hesse .
the assembly went on to condemn any attempts , political or not , to arouse an anti-islamic sentiment within germany .
" criticism is permitted , agitation is not , " stressed the chairman of the assembly , archbishop robert zollitsch .
he said the matter came down to the right to freedom of worship , but added that mosque designs should be adapted to their surroundings and should try to meet the " justifiable concerns " of neighbours .

but what should be a celebration of multi-lingualism in fact highlights a failure in language-learning across the bloc and a lack of attention on minority languages . when the council of europe and the european commission designated september 26 european day of languages , it was hoped that the initiative would stress the importance of language learning and increase intercultural understanding .
but the reality is that in 2008 , only a minority of the public actually learn a second language , let alone a third .
slovakian member of the european parliament anna zaborska believes that europeans fail to appreciate the linguistic diversity of the continent .
" i strongly feel that multi-lingualism is one of the eu 's hidden treasures , " she said .
minority complaints bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : english , french and german are the main langauges spoken at eu headquarters other meps are angry at what they see as the commission 's failure to set out concrete initiatives to promote minority languages in its new , much-touted multilingualism strategy . among those criticizing a lack of funding for languages and specific new programs are basque mep mikel irujo , jill evans of welsh party plaid cymru and transylvanian independent lászló tőkés .
speaking at a press conference earlier this week , they complained that the commission was not doing " more to promote minority languages at eu level " as well as " those languages that do not yet have official status , " with evans in particular repeating previous demands for welsh to become a fully-fledged eu language expensive and time-consuming meps are , in fact , actively encouraged to speak their mother tongue when parliament is in session .
the eu recognizes 23 languages , and employs legions of translators and interpreters to help communication .
it 's an expensive and time-consuming luxury , but according to german mep bernd posselt , multi-lingualism is an essential element of the eu 's democratic structure .
" the european parliament would never be accepted by voters if the electorate were unable to hear candidates talking in their own language , " he points out .
in practice , however , not all languages are equal .
officially , the eu institutions ' working languages are french , english and german .
but german is used infrequently , while english has slowly but surely nudged out french as the most common language spoken in brussels .
language as culture bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : few children these days learn another langauge minority languages , meanwhile , barely get a look in , says anna zaborska .
" my impression is that minority languages are not adequately protected ; " she said .
" they need to be cultivated .
the eu needs to protect european cultures and culture is expressed in music , cuisine - and languages . "
but too many people are happy simply to resort to english .
why should a pole bother wrestling with german , or a spaniard tackle finnish when everyone can get along nicely speaking the universal language , english ? it 's a mentality that bernd posselt resists .
he says the result is a globalized pidgin english - a far cry from the language of shakespeare . " if the other nationalities do n't join forces to prevent this development , this is all we will be left with , " he predicts . dw staff -lrb- jp -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

laissez-faire is done with , said french and current eu president nicolas sarkozy . in what was officially the largest-ever us bank failure , washington mutual 's business has been shut down after the bank collapsed , with customers pulling more than $ 16 billion -lrb- 10.9 billion euros -rrb- from their accounts . those accounts have been gobbled up by jp morgan , thus ensuring that the depositors wo n't lose their money . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the us economy looks down and out , but the euro zone is not faring much better in washington , just hours after congress appeared on the verge of agreement on an emergency rescue plan for the us financial system , a historic white house meeting turned into a bout of bickering and broke up with no formal consensus on the controversial proposal . president george w. bush had invited both presidential candidates , barak obama and john mccain , to take part in an effort to find a consensus on the $ 700-billion plan to prop up the ailing financial system . republicans and democrats , however , are struggling to find middle ground with the former at odds over what would amount to government ownership of collapsed companies , anathema to the center-right advocates of free markets . ireland officially falls into recession while the bickering goes on in washington , the fallout is continuing to be felt in europe .
ireland has become the first member of the 15-member euro zone to fall into recession as a result of the us financial crisis . as in other countries , the domestic property market has taken a hammering and pushed the country into its first recession in 25 years . germany , britain , france and italy are also perilously close to experiencing the same fate . " we expect that italy and germany will also record contractions in their third quarter gross domestic product , following contractions in the second quarter , " said barclays capital analyst julian callow , as reported by afp news agency . a recession is officially defined as two consecutive quarters of no gdp growth . sarkozy : laissez-faire is finished with european leaders scrambling to fend off further disaster , french president nicolas sarkozy has joined the chorus of demands for an overhaul of the financial system . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : french president nicolas sarkozy told the un he wanted an emergency summit speaking in toulon on thursday , sept .
25 , sarkozy said the economic turmoil provoked by crises in the american sub-prime and finance markets had put an end to the free-market economy . " laissez-faire is finished , the all-powerful market that is always right , that 's finished , " he said in a widely anticipated speech , his first in france on the economic crisis .
he called for new rules and regulations and a wide-ranging restructuring of the entire global banking system , saying that the crisis has laid bare serious flaws in the international banking network . with france currently occupying the rotating presidency of the eu , sarkozy said he would " propose initiatives " on these issues at the next eu summit on oct .

poland and ukraine were given the reprieve after uefa 's executive committee met in bordeaux to discuss a progress report on preparations for the tournament .
" the executive committee reconfirmed uefa 's commitment to organize euro 2012 in poland and ukraine , " uefa president michel platini told a news conference in bordeaux .
" at the same time , the committee stressed a number of conditions must be met in order to bring forward the whole project . "
platini said the co-hosts " promised " that stadiums in kiev and warsaw would be ready in time .
poland football chief doubts poland 's readiness bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : uefa president michel platini insists poland and ukraine must speed up euro preparations inadequate stadiums , problems with transport systems and not enough hotel beds had given rise to serious concerns and pushed uefa into a corner .
several contingency plans had been touted prior to friday 's meeting , such as using germany as a third , supporting host , or - as the president of the polish soccer association , michal listkiewicz , suggested - that poland and ukraine 's 2012 hosting rights be rescinded in favor of another country , and that the two nations instead plan to host the tournament in 2016 .
listkiewicz seems far from convinced his country will be ready in four years time .
the biggest problem : poor infrastructure and terrible traffic , he said .
" if the european championships took place in 2016 , we would have no problems about being ready then , " listkiewicz told die zeit online , the internet platform of the weekly newspaper .
" but realistically we are looking at having no good roads in time for 2012 , " he said .
" from gdansk -lrb- in poland -rrb- to donetsk -lrb- in the ukraine -rrb- is more than 1,500 kilometers -lrb- 930 miles -rrb- .
this is not like in austria and switzerland where everything lies close together . "
moreover , he cast doubt on whether poland 's partners in ukraine will be up to the job .
" if things do n't go well now , and uefa has another suggestion , then that would be in order , " he said .

" laissez-faire is finished , the all-powerful market that is always right , that 's finished , " he said in a widely anticipated speech , his first in france on the economic crisis .
he called for new rules and regulations and a wide-ranging restructuring of the entire global banking system , saying that the crisis has laid bare serious flaws in the international banking network . with france currently occupying the rotating presidency of the eu , sarkozy said he would " propose initiatives " on these issues at the next eu summit on oct .

the plan aims to save more than 4.2 million lives , mainly in africa , which has suffered most from the disease .

"
despite supporting the building of mosques , the bishops said muslim communities should try to consider local residents when seeking to establish places of worship .
the bishops were meeting as part of their annual autumn plenary assembly in the city of fulda , hesse .
the assembly went on to condemn any attempts , political or not , to arouse an anti-islamic sentiment within germany .
" criticism is permitted , agitation is not , " stressed the chairman of the assembly , archbishop robert zollitsch .
he said the matter came down to the right to freedom of worship , but added that mosque designs should be adapted to their surroundings and should try to meet the " justifiable concerns " of neighbours .

3 in muenster , germany .
zabel is one of germany 's most accomplished cyclists , with more than 200 professional career wins including 12 tour de france stages .
he wore the final sprinters ' green jersey at the tour de france a record six consecutive years between 1996 and 2001 , and was a four-time winner of the milan-san remo spring classic .
tainted memory of zabel ?
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : zabel was highly emotional when admitting to using performance enhancing drugs in may 2007 , zabel confessed that he had taken the blood-booster erythropoietin -lrb- epo -rrb- while training for the 1996 tour de france and while cycling for germany 's team telekom .
epo increases the production of red blood cells , thereby allowing an athlete 's blood to deliver oxygen to muscles more efficiently .
" i used it as a test and ended it after one week because i had problems with the side-effects , " said zabel last year .
" since then , for the past eleven years , i have always denied doping .
i lied , and i apologize for this , " zabel had said at a tearful press conference .
speculation was rife as to whether zabel would be dumped by milram amid the doping revelations , but the professional cycling team ultimately honored the racer 's three-year contract through to this year 's end .
mass doping revelations zabel 's confession last may came after several similar admissions from other riders and two doctors from germany 's most successful riding team .
university doctors andreas schmid and lothar heinrich admitted to epo blood doping in the mid-1990s at team telekom .
zabel was a team-mate of bjarne riis , who also admitted to using epo during his 1996 tour de france win . dw staff -lrb- dm -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

it included no new sanctions . steinmeier said that he was relieved that the group of five permanent security council powers plus germany had remained united over the iran issue .
western powers had feared that russia would withdraw its support after cancelling a meeting on thursday . without such unity , steinmeier said , pressure on iran could not be maintained , adding that the draft resolution would likely be approved by the council on saturday .
he was speaking on the sidelines of a un assembly meeting in new york .
the resolution " reaffirms " existing sanctions that have been placed on iran over its refusal to comply with security council demands to halt uranium enrichment , a process that can be used to build nuclear weapons .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : russia is reluctant to impose further sanctions on tehran no new sanctions against iran have been put forward something the united states , france and britain had been pushing for this week .
in an interview with ruters news agency , us secretary of state condoleeza rice said the six nations wanted to show they stood together in confronting tehran over its nuclear program .
" i think it 's also especially important that the iranians recognize that the p5 plus 1 process is intact , " said rice , referring to the five security council members and germany .
she said she did not know whether major powers would agree on a fourth sanctions resolution against iran by the end of the bush administration .
three sanctions resolutions against iran have already been passed by the 15-nation council .
a report by the un-backed international atomic energy agency -lrb- iaea -rrb- last week said iran had expanded uranium enrichment activities and was not fully cooperating with the agency 's investigation .
rice scolds security council bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : iranian president mahmoud ahmadinejad was sharply criticized by rice meanwhile , rice chided the council for not focussing on what she said were the biggest threats to international peace during a security council meeting on israeli settlements in the palestinian territories .
the us had expected the security council to address iranian president mahmoud ahmadinejad 's call for the " destruction " of israel during a speech before the general assembly on tuesday , she said .
" when this council decides what really needs to be taken up as a threat to international peace and security , that to me makes the top of the list , " rice said .
western suspicions linger western countries suspect iran is seeking the capability to develop nuclear weapons , while tehran maintains its program is solely for producing civilian nuclear energy .
british foreign secretary david miliband said that despite the failure to reach an agreement on new sanctions , the resolution was designed " to affirm our unity , to rally international support " for an ongoing carrot-and-stick approach against iran , which involves offering economic incentives if it halts its program and leaves open more sanctions if it continues . dw staff -lrb- dm / jg -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

austria 's voters appear to be fed up with rising inflation -lrb- at 3.9 percent , a 15-year high -rrb- , poor integration of the country 's large immigrant population , and the inability of the current government to do much about either .
the combined poll numbers of austria 's two far right-parties , the freedom party and the alliance for austria 's future are hovering around 25 percent .
that would represent the best draw for the austrian far-right since 1999 , when then-freedom party -lrb- and now alliance -rrb- leader jörg haider stunned europe by garnering 27 percent .
such a tally might well leave austria 's neighbors aghast , but one pollster , andreas kirchhofer of imas , told news agency reuters that austrians may be casting their votes against their current leaders more than for the rightists .
" they are fed up with the left-right coalition , " he said .
" they want another kind of government , but they do n't really know exactly what that should look like . " not-so-grand coalition the country 's ruling grand coalition of the center-left social democrats -lrb- spö -rrb- and center-right austrian people 's party -lrb- övp -rrb- has had a rough ride in its less than two years in power . the people 's party , stunned to have drawn less votes than the social democrats in 2006 , have never really taken to their junior partner role , preferring to stave off major leftward policy shifts and bide their time rather than engage with the spö .
luckily for the people 's party , the social democrats have had myriad problems of their own .
the man who took office as chancellor following the last elections , alfred gusenbauer , has not proven an effective leader .
prone to gaffes and unable to marshal public support for controversial policies such as the institution of public service in place of university fees , gusenbauer lost his post as spö party leader to werner faymann in june of this year .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : austria 's social democrats are pinning their hopes on new party leader faymann to pull them out of a slump faymann , for his part , promptly reversed his party 's long-standing position not to hold a referendum on europe .
in a letter to the populist , anti-eu tabloid kronen zeitung , faymann said his party now wanted one . with the social democrats in seeming disarray , their conservative coalition partners in the övp called a snap election in july .
but worsening economic conditions in the months since , along with some shrewd maneuvering from the far right , mean the övp may come to regret the decision . the övp currently trails the spö in opinion polls , and while they both enjoy comfortable leads over fringe parties , the two big parties ' combined total looks set to dip below 60 percent for the first time since world war ii .
as an editorial in the conservative newspaper die presse recently had it , " the only thing that 's clear is that the ' winner ' will also be a loser , because the voters want to punish them . "
the winner in all this is likely to be the far right .
right man at the right time ?
the new face of austria 's far right is heinz-christian strache .
while he may lack the charisma of his predecessor jörg haider , strache has clearly learned from him .
since breaking with the freedom party in 2005 , haider 's star has waned and strache 's has grown - mostly by emulating haider .
strache ran a campaign in viennese elections with posters featuring slogans like " vienna must not become istanbul ! " , a more strident take on haider 's old " vienna must not become chicago ! " poster by targeting voters ' cultural fears directly , not just through the guise of crime .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : it seems not everyone in austria is enamored by the far right strache may also have benefitted from his youth .
the haider formula always traded on the man 's relative vitality - physical fitness , sharp dress , sun tan .
strache has all of these traits , and as a trained dental technician , he can also claim brilliantly white teeth .
and such a package may be a bit more convincing in the 39-year old strache than in haider , now 59 .
the similarity has not gone unnoticed .
haider himself runs advertisements touting himself as " the original , " and övp party leader wilhelm molderer snapped in a recent television debate that strachen was " just a poor copy of jörg haider in the ' 80s . "
a stinging remark , but perhaps a backhanded compliment as well .
after all , jörg haider in the 80 's was a rousing success .
in his first election in charge in 1986 , haider helped double the party 's returns from 1983 to almost 10 percent , and by 1999 had taken it up to 27 percent . dw staff -lrb- mrh -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

austria 's voters appear to be fed up with rising inflation -lrb- at 3.9 percent , a 15-year high -rrb- , poor integration of the country 's large immigrant population , and the inability of the current government to do much about either .
the combined poll numbers of austria 's two far right-parties , the freedom party and the alliance for austria 's future are hovering around 25 percent .
that would represent the best draw for the austrian far-right since 1999 , when then-freedom party -lrb- and now alliance -rrb- leader jörg haider stunned europe by garnering 27 percent .
such a tally might well leave austria 's neighbors aghast , but one pollster , andreas kirchhofer of imas , told news agency reuters that austrians may be casting their votes against their current leaders more than for the rightists .
" they are fed up with the left-right coalition , " he said .
" they want another kind of government , but they do n't really know exactly what that should look like . " not-so-grand coalition the country 's ruling grand coalition of the center-left social democrats -lrb- spö -rrb- and center-right austrian people 's party -lrb- övp -rrb- has had a rough ride in its less than two years in power . the people 's party , stunned to have drawn less votes than the social democrats in 2006 , have never really taken to their junior partner role , preferring to stave off major leftward policy shifts and bide their time rather than engage with the spö .
luckily for the people 's party , the social democrats have had myriad problems of their own .
the man who took office as chancellor following the last elections , alfred gusenbauer , has not proven an effective leader .
prone to gaffes and unable to marshal public support for controversial policies such as the institution of public service in place of university fees , gusenbauer lost his post as spö party leader to werner faymann in june of this year .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : austria 's social democrats are pinning their hopes on new party leader faymann to pull them out of a slump faymann , for his part , promptly reversed his party 's long-standing position not to hold a referendum on europe .
in a letter to the populist , anti-eu tabloid kronen zeitung , faymann said his party now wanted one . with the social democrats in seeming disarray , their conservative coalition partners in the övp called a snap election in july .
but worsening economic conditions in the months since , along with some shrewd maneuvering from the far right , mean the övp may come to regret the decision . the övp currently trails the spö in opinion polls , and while they both enjoy comfortable leads over fringe parties , the two big parties ' combined total looks set to dip below 60 percent for the first time since world war ii .
as an editorial in the conservative newspaper die presse recently had it , " the only thing that 's clear is that the ' winner ' will also be a loser , because the voters want to punish them . "
the winner in all this is likely to be the far right .
right man at the right time ?
the new face of austria 's far right is heinz-christian strache .
while he may lack the charisma of his predecessor jörg haider , strache has clearly learned from him .
since breaking with the freedom party in 2005 , haider 's star has waned and strache 's has grown - mostly by emulating haider .
strache ran a campaign in viennese elections with posters featuring slogans like " vienna must not become istanbul ! " , a more strident take on haider 's old " vienna must not become chicago ! " poster by targeting voters ' cultural fears directly , not just through the guise of crime .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : it seems not everyone in austria is enamored by the far right strache may also have benefitted from his youth .
the haider formula always traded on the man 's relative vitality - physical fitness , sharp dress , sun tan .
strache has all of these traits , and as a trained dental technician , he can also claim brilliantly white teeth .
and such a package may be a bit more convincing in the 39-year old strache than in haider , now 59 .
the similarity has not gone unnoticed .
haider himself runs advertisements touting himself as " the original , " and övp party leader wilhelm molderer snapped in a recent television debate that strachen was " just a poor copy of jörg haider in the ' 80s . "
a stinging remark , but perhaps a backhanded compliment as well .
after all , jörg haider in the 80 's was a rousing success .
in his first election in charge in 1986 , haider helped double the party 's returns from 1983 to almost 10 percent , and by 1999 had taken it up to 27 percent . dw staff -lrb- mrh -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

ireland has become the first member of the 15-member euro zone to fall into recession as a result of the us financial crisis . as in other countries , the domestic property market has taken a hammering and pushed the country into its first recession in 25 years . germany , britain , france and italy are also perilously close to experiencing the same fate . " we expect that italy and germany will also record contractions in their third quarter gross domestic product , following contractions in the second quarter , " said barclays capital analyst julian callow , as reported by afp news agency . a recession is officially defined as two consecutive quarters of no gdp growth . sarkozy : laissez-faire is finished with european leaders scrambling to fend off further disaster , french president nicolas sarkozy has joined the chorus of demands for an overhaul of the financial system . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : french president nicolas sarkozy told the un he wanted an emergency summit speaking in toulon on thursday , sept .

" laissez-faire is finished , the all-powerful market that is always right , that 's finished , " he said in a widely anticipated speech , his first in france on the economic crisis .
he called for new rules and regulations and a wide-ranging restructuring of the entire global banking system , saying that the crisis has laid bare serious flaws in the international banking network . with france currently occupying the rotating presidency of the eu , sarkozy said he would " propose initiatives " on these issues at the next eu summit on oct .

3 in muenster , germany .
zabel is one of germany 's most accomplished cyclists , with more than 200 professional career wins including 12 tour de france stages .
he wore the final sprinters ' green jersey at the tour de france a record six consecutive years between 1996 and 2001 , and was a four-time winner of the milan-san remo spring classic .
tainted memory of zabel ?
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : zabel was highly emotional when admitting to using performance enhancing drugs in may 2007 , zabel confessed that he had taken the blood-booster erythropoietin -lrb- epo -rrb- while training for the 1996 tour de france and while cycling for germany 's team telekom .
epo increases the production of red blood cells , thereby allowing an athlete 's blood to deliver oxygen to muscles more efficiently .
" i used it as a test and ended it after one week because i had problems with the side-effects , " said zabel last year .
" since then , for the past eleven years , i have always denied doping .
i lied , and i apologize for this , " zabel had said at a tearful press conference .
speculation was rife as to whether zabel would be dumped by milram amid the doping revelations , but the professional cycling team ultimately honored the racer 's three-year contract through to this year 's end .
mass doping revelations zabel 's confession last may came after several similar admissions from other riders and two doctors from germany 's most successful riding team .
university doctors andreas schmid and lothar heinrich admitted to epo blood doping in the mid-1990s at team telekom .
zabel was a team-mate of bjarne riis , who also admitted to using epo during his 1996 tour de france win . dw staff -lrb- dm -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

it included no new sanctions . steinmeier said that he was relieved that the group of five permanent security council powers plus germany had remained united over the iran issue .
western powers had feared that russia would withdraw its support after cancelling a meeting on thursday . without such unity , steinmeier said , pressure on iran could not be maintained , adding that the draft resolution would likely be approved by the council on saturday .
he was speaking on the sidelines of a un assembly meeting in new york .
the resolution " reaffirms " existing sanctions that have been placed on iran over its refusal to comply with security council demands to halt uranium enrichment , a process that can be used to build nuclear weapons .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : russia is reluctant to impose further sanctions on tehran no new sanctions against iran have been put forward something the united states , france and britain had been pushing for this week .

she said she did not know whether major powers would agree on a fourth sanctions resolution against iran by the end of the bush administration .
three sanctions resolutions against iran have already been passed by the 15-nation council .
a report by the un-backed international atomic energy agency -lrb- iaea -rrb- last week said iran had expanded uranium enrichment activities and was not fully cooperating with the agency 's investigation .

" when this council decides what really needs to be taken up as a threat to international peace and security , that to me makes the top of the list , " rice said .
western suspicions linger western countries suspect iran is seeking the capability to develop nuclear weapons , while tehran maintains its program is solely for producing civilian nuclear energy .
british foreign secretary david miliband said that despite the failure to reach an agreement on new sanctions , the resolution was designed " to affirm our unity , to rally international support " for an ongoing carrot-and-stick approach against iran , which involves offering economic incentives if it halts its program and leaves open more sanctions if it continues . dw staff -lrb- dm / jg -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

26 , was greeted with delight by environmental groups , with greenpeace praising the parliament 's environment committee for " warding off disaster " and brussels-based group transport and environment -lrb- t & e -rrb- saying that parliamentarians had " stood up to enormous pressure " from lobbyists .
car industry disappointed but it was met with dismay by auto lobbies and politicians , with the association of european car manufacturers , acea , saying that the committee had " given the wrong signal " and " missed the opportunity to shape a realistic framework " for development .
guenther beckstein , conservative premier of the german state of bavaria , which is home to major manufacturers bmw and audi , said in a statement that " the anti-industry decision by the socialist majority in the committee endangers thousands of jobs -lrb- and -rrb- must be corrected " by the full parliament and the council of eu states .
the committee decided that car makers selling their vehicles in the eu should ensure that the average co2 emissions of the cars they sell are no more than 120 grams per kilometer -lrb- g / km -rrb- in 2012 .
penalties for non-compliance should start at 20 euros -lrb- $ 29.30 -rrb- per car sold and per g / km over the limit in 2012 , and rise to 95 euros per g / km in 2015 , they said .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the eu has pledged to further cut its co2 emissions by 2020 and the eu should bring in a further target of 95 g / km by 2020 , they decided .
initial proposals less strict ahead of the meeting , committee members had been widely expected to back a compromise proposal capping penalties at 50 euros per g / km and ruling that only the most efficient 70 percent of cars should be covered in the first years of the scheme .
environmental groups had slammed the compromise as both delaying and drastically weakening the original proposals from the european commission , the eu 's executive body .
" the cumulative effect of the loopholes outlined below would be no mandated emissions reductions by 2012 , the date of the official eu target , " greenpeace , t & e and friends of the earth said in a joint statement ahead of the vote .
unexpected win for the environment but on the day , the committee voted down both of those amendments in what observers see as a severe blow to the automobile industry .
" climate triumphs over car industry ! " the gue-ngl left-wing group of the parliament declared in a statement .
the proposed law is now set to go to the parliament 's plenary session on oct .
20-23 and to the council of eu member states , with experts saying that it is likely to face another intense lobbying battle before final acceptance .
co2 is the gas most closely linked with global warming , and experts estimate that cars alone account for 14 percent of all eu co2 emissions .
the eu has pledged to cut its total co2 emissions to at least 20 percent below 1990 levels by 2020 . dpa news agency -lrb- ls -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de aviation -pipe- 26.09.2008 italian government gives alitalia more time großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : alitalia loses about three million euros a day and has a debt of about 1.2 billion euros as the italian government again extended a deadline on bailout talks to save struggling airline alitalia , lufthansa 's chief jetted into rome to voice his airline ’ s interest in snapping up a share of the italian carrier . lufthansa chief executive wolfgang mayrhuber travelled to italy on friday to hold discussions with four major unions backing the billion-euro -lrb- $ 1.45 billion -rrb- rescue deal .
later , the anpav flight attendants ' union became the fifth of nine unions to sign up to the bailout deal . in response , the italian government decided to let a second deadline lapse in a bid to give the four remaining unions representing alitalia 's workforce a chance still to come on board .
" negotiations continue -lrb- and -rrb- the hands of the clock have been stopped , " a government official told reporters .
two other flight attendants unions said they would spend the weekend mulling whether to accept the rescue package proposed by the private italian consortium , the italian air company -lrb- cai -rrb- .
together , avia and sdl represent some 2,500 air stewards and hostesses .
two unions representing 1,400 pilots were still in talks on friday as the government endeavoured to win unanimous backing for the italian cai investor group deal .
italian labour minister maurizio sacconi told ansa news agency that the deal could , however , go ahead without the agreement of all unions .
unanimous approval " would be important ... but i think cai can pursue its course in any case , " he said .
the issues in dispute range from pay for ground crew and leave , to temporary work contracts .
the italian civil aviation authority had said it would ground alitalia unless a bailout plan had been agreed by thursday , but that threat has not been followed up .
lufthansa chief meets with italian unions lufthansa , which this week moved to take over belgian flag carrier brussels airlines , has frequently been seen as a potential saviour for stumbling alitalia , despite insisting in the past it was not interested .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : italian prime minister silvio berlusconi had pledged to keep alitalia in italian hands officials from the german airline would not comment on its supposed interest in alitalia , but confirmed that mayrhuber was in rome on the italian government 's invitation to discuss the italian flag carrier 's precarious situation , a spokeswoman for lufthansa said in frankfurt .
uil union leader luigi angeletti confirmed mayrhuber had expressed lufthansa 's interest in alitalia during his meeting with union representatives .
industry sources said lufthansa is mulling whether to take a 20 percent stake in alitalia , according to news agency reuters .
a separate union source said the german airline was interested in an even bigger stake .

later , the anpav flight attendants ' union became the fifth of nine unions to sign up to the bailout deal . in response , the italian government decided to let a second deadline lapse in a bid to give the four remaining unions representing alitalia 's workforce a chance still to come on board .
" negotiations continue -lrb- and -rrb- the hands of the clock have been stopped , " a government official told reporters .
two other flight attendants unions said they would spend the weekend mulling whether to accept the rescue package proposed by the private italian consortium , the italian air company -lrb- cai -rrb- .
together , avia and sdl represent some 2,500 air stewards and hostesses .
two unions representing 1,400 pilots were still in talks on friday as the government endeavoured to win unanimous backing for the italian cai investor group deal .
italian labour minister maurizio sacconi told ansa news agency that the deal could , however , go ahead without the agreement of all unions .
unanimous approval " would be important ... but i think cai can pursue its course in any case , " he said .
the issues in dispute range from pay for ground crew and leave , to temporary work contracts .
the italian civil aviation authority had said it would ground alitalia unless a bailout plan had been agreed by thursday , but that threat has not been followed up .

uil union leader luigi angeletti confirmed mayrhuber had expressed lufthansa 's interest in alitalia during his meeting with union representatives .
industry sources said lufthansa is mulling whether to take a 20 percent stake in alitalia , according to news agency reuters .
a separate union source said the german airline was interested in an even bigger stake .
rival air france-klm is also seeking an alliance with alitalia .
it is said to be looking to gain as much as a 25 percent stake in the cai consortium .
the holding company attempted earlier this year to buy alitalia , but the deal collapsed amid union opposition . dw staff -lrb- dm -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

it included no new sanctions . steinmeier said that he was relieved that the group of five permanent security council powers plus germany had remained united over the iran issue .
western powers had feared that russia would withdraw its support after cancelling a meeting on thursday . without such unity , steinmeier said , pressure on iran could not be maintained , adding that the draft resolution would likely be approved by the council on saturday .
he was speaking on the sidelines of a un assembly meeting in new york .
the resolution " reaffirms " existing sanctions that have been placed on iran over its refusal to comply with security council demands to halt uranium enrichment , a process that can be used to build nuclear weapons .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : russia is reluctant to impose further sanctions on tehran no new sanctions against iran have been put forward something the united states , france and britain had been pushing for this week .

" i think it 's also especially important that the iranians recognize that the p5 plus 1 process is intact , " said rice , referring to the five security council members and germany .
she said she did not know whether major powers would agree on a fourth sanctions resolution against iran by the end of the bush administration .
three sanctions resolutions against iran have already been passed by the 15-nation council .
a report by the un-backed international atomic energy agency -lrb- iaea -rrb- last week said iran had expanded uranium enrichment activities and was not fully cooperating with the agency 's investigation .

the us had expected the security council to address iranian president mahmoud ahmadinejad 's call for the " destruction " of israel during a speech before the general assembly on tuesday , she said .
" when this council decides what really needs to be taken up as a threat to international peace and security , that to me makes the top of the list , " rice said .
western suspicions linger western countries suspect iran is seeking the capability to develop nuclear weapons , while tehran maintains its program is solely for producing civilian nuclear energy .
british foreign secretary david miliband said that despite the failure to reach an agreement on new sanctions , the resolution was designed " to affirm our unity , to rally international support " for an ongoing carrot-and-stick approach against iran , which involves offering economic incentives if it halts its program and leaves open more sanctions if it continues . dw staff -lrb- dm / jg -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de politics -pipe- 26.09.2008 disenchanted austrian voters could turn to far right großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the new face of austria 's far right christian strache , right , is drawing voters fed up with government bickering and growing economic uncertainty , austrian voters could hand the far right big gains in general elections on sunday . if opinion polls prove correct , the austrian far-right may notch large gains in general elections on sunday , sept 28 .
austria 's voters appear to be fed up with rising inflation -lrb- at 3.9 percent , a 15-year high -rrb- , poor integration of the country 's large immigrant population , and the inability of the current government to do much about either .
the combined poll numbers of austria 's two far right-parties , the freedom party and the alliance for austria 's future are hovering around 25 percent .
that would represent the best draw for the austrian far-right since 1999 , when then-freedom party -lrb- and now alliance -rrb- leader jörg haider stunned europe by garnering 27 percent .
such a tally might well leave austria 's neighbors aghast , but one pollster , andreas kirchhofer of imas , told news agency reuters that austrians may be casting their votes against their current leaders more than for the rightists .
" they are fed up with the left-right coalition , " he said .
" they want another kind of government , but they do n't really know exactly what that should look like . " not-so-grand coalition the country 's ruling grand coalition of the center-left social democrats -lrb- spö -rrb- and center-right austrian people 's party -lrb- övp -rrb- has had a rough ride in its less than two years in power . the people 's party , stunned to have drawn less votes than the social democrats in 2006 , have never really taken to their junior partner role , preferring to stave off major leftward policy shifts and bide their time rather than engage with the spö .
luckily for the people 's party , the social democrats have had myriad problems of their own .
the man who took office as chancellor following the last elections , alfred gusenbauer , has not proven an effective leader .
prone to gaffes and unable to marshal public support for controversial policies such as the institution of public service in place of university fees , gusenbauer lost his post as spö party leader to werner faymann in june of this year .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : austria 's social democrats are pinning their hopes on new party leader faymann to pull them out of a slump faymann , for his part , promptly reversed his party 's long-standing position not to hold a referendum on europe .
in a letter to the populist , anti-eu tabloid kronen zeitung , faymann said his party now wanted one . with the social democrats in seeming disarray , their conservative coalition partners in the övp called a snap election in july .
but worsening economic conditions in the months since , along with some shrewd maneuvering from the far right , mean the övp may come to regret the decision . the övp currently trails the spö in opinion polls , and while they both enjoy comfortable leads over fringe parties , the two big parties ' combined total looks set to dip below 60 percent for the first time since world war ii .
as an editorial in the conservative newspaper die presse recently had it , " the only thing that 's clear is that the ' winner ' will also be a loser , because the voters want to punish them . "
the winner in all this is likely to be the far right .
right man at the right time ?
the new face of austria 's far right is heinz-christian strache .
while he may lack the charisma of his predecessor jörg haider , strache has clearly learned from him .
since breaking with the freedom party in 2005 , haider 's star has waned and strache 's has grown - mostly by emulating haider .
strache ran a campaign in viennese elections with posters featuring slogans like " vienna must not become istanbul ! " , a more strident take on haider 's old " vienna must not become chicago ! " poster by targeting voters ' cultural fears directly , not just through the guise of crime .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : it seems not everyone in austria is enamored by the far right strache may also have benefitted from his youth .
the haider formula always traded on the man 's relative vitality - physical fitness , sharp dress , sun tan .
strache has all of these traits , and as a trained dental technician , he can also claim brilliantly white teeth .
and such a package may be a bit more convincing in the 39-year old strache than in haider , now 59 .
the similarity has not gone unnoticed .
haider himself runs advertisements touting himself as " the original , " and övp party leader wilhelm molderer snapped in a recent television debate that strachen was " just a poor copy of jörg haider in the ' 80s . "
a stinging remark , but perhaps a backhanded compliment as well .
after all , jörg haider in the 80 's was a rousing success .
in his first election in charge in 1986 , haider helped double the party 's returns from 1983 to almost 10 percent , and by 1999 had taken it up to 27 percent . dw staff -lrb- mrh -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

austria 's voters appear to be fed up with rising inflation -lrb- at 3.9 percent , a 15-year high -rrb- , poor integration of the country 's large immigrant population , and the inability of the current government to do much about either .
the combined poll numbers of austria 's two far right-parties , the freedom party and the alliance for austria 's future are hovering around 25 percent .
that would represent the best draw for the austrian far-right since 1999 , when then-freedom party -lrb- and now alliance -rrb- leader jörg haider stunned europe by garnering 27 percent .
such a tally might well leave austria 's neighbors aghast , but one pollster , andreas kirchhofer of imas , told news agency reuters that austrians may be casting their votes against their current leaders more than for the rightists .

luckily for the people 's party , the social democrats have had myriad problems of their own .
the man who took office as chancellor following the last elections , alfred gusenbauer , has not proven an effective leader .

as an editorial in the conservative newspaper die presse recently had it , " the only thing that 's clear is that the ' winner ' will also be a loser , because the voters want to punish them . "
the winner in all this is likely to be the far right .
right man at the right time ?
the new face of austria 's far right is heinz-christian strache .
while he may lack the charisma of his predecessor jörg haider , strache has clearly learned from him .
since breaking with the freedom party in 2005 , haider 's star has waned and strache 's has grown - mostly by emulating haider .
strache ran a campaign in viennese elections with posters featuring slogans like " vienna must not become istanbul ! " , a more strident take on haider 's old " vienna must not become chicago ! " poster by targeting voters ' cultural fears directly , not just through the guise of crime .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : it seems not everyone in austria is enamored by the far right strache may also have benefitted from his youth .
the haider formula always traded on the man 's relative vitality - physical fitness , sharp dress , sun tan .
strache has all of these traits , and as a trained dental technician , he can also claim brilliantly white teeth .

the similarity has not gone unnoticed .
haider himself runs advertisements touting himself as " the original , " and övp party leader wilhelm molderer snapped in a recent television debate that strachen was " just a poor copy of jörg haider in the ' 80s . "
a stinging remark , but perhaps a backhanded compliment as well .
after all , jörg haider in the 80 's was a rousing success .

the pledges totalled $ 16 billion -lrb- 10.9 billion euros -rrb- according to an initial un estimate , including more than $ 3 billion to eradicate malaria , $ 2 billion to tackle an ongoing food crisis and $ 4.5 billion for educational programs .

among the commitments made thursday was a more than $ 3-billion initiative unveiled to eradicate malaria by 2015 .
the plan aims to save more than 4.2 million lives , mainly in africa , which has suffered most from the disease .

but what should be a celebration of multi-lingualism in fact highlights a failure in language-learning across the bloc and a lack of attention on minority languages . when the council of europe and the european commission designated september 26 european day of languages , it was hoped that the initiative would stress the importance of language learning and increase intercultural understanding .
but the reality is that in 2008 , only a minority of the public actually learn a second language , let alone a third .
slovakian member of the european parliament anna zaborska believes that europeans fail to appreciate the linguistic diversity of the continent .
" i strongly feel that multi-lingualism is one of the eu 's hidden treasures , " she said .
minority complaints bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : english , french and german are the main langauges spoken at eu headquarters other meps are angry at what they see as the commission 's failure to set out concrete initiatives to promote minority languages in its new , much-touted multilingualism strategy . among those criticizing a lack of funding for languages and specific new programs are basque mep mikel irujo , jill evans of welsh party plaid cymru and transylvanian independent lászló tőkés .
speaking at a press conference earlier this week , they complained that the commission was not doing " more to promote minority languages at eu level " as well as " those languages that do not yet have official status , " with evans in particular repeating previous demands for welsh to become a fully-fledged eu language expensive and time-consuming meps are , in fact , actively encouraged to speak their mother tongue when parliament is in session .
the eu recognizes 23 languages , and employs legions of translators and interpreters to help communication .
it 's an expensive and time-consuming luxury , but according to german mep bernd posselt , multi-lingualism is an essential element of the eu 's democratic structure .
" the european parliament would never be accepted by voters if the electorate were unable to hear candidates talking in their own language , " he points out .
in practice , however , not all languages are equal .
officially , the eu institutions ' working languages are french , english and german .
but german is used infrequently , while english has slowly but surely nudged out french as the most common language spoken in brussels .
language as culture bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : few children these days learn another langauge minority languages , meanwhile , barely get a look in , says anna zaborska .
" my impression is that minority languages are not adequately protected ; " she said .
" they need to be cultivated .
the eu needs to protect european cultures and culture is expressed in music , cuisine - and languages . "
but too many people are happy simply to resort to english .
why should a pole bother wrestling with german , or a spaniard tackle finnish when everyone can get along nicely speaking the universal language , english ? it 's a mentality that bernd posselt resists .
he says the result is a globalized pidgin english - a far cry from the language of shakespeare . " if the other nationalities do n't join forces to prevent this development , this is all we will be left with , " he predicts . dw staff -lrb- jp -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

minority complaints bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : english , french and german are the main langauges spoken at eu headquarters other meps are angry at what they see as the commission 's failure to set out concrete initiatives to promote minority languages in its new , much-touted multilingualism strategy . among those criticizing a lack of funding for languages and specific new programs are basque mep mikel irujo , jill evans of welsh party plaid cymru and transylvanian independent lászló tőkés .
speaking at a press conference earlier this week , they complained that the commission was not doing " more to promote minority languages at eu level " as well as " those languages that do not yet have official status , " with evans in particular repeating previous demands for welsh to become a fully-fledged eu language expensive and time-consuming meps are , in fact , actively encouraged to speak their mother tongue when parliament is in session .
the eu recognizes 23 languages , and employs legions of translators and interpreters to help communication .
it 's an expensive and time-consuming luxury , but according to german mep bernd posselt , multi-lingualism is an essential element of the eu 's democratic structure .
" the european parliament would never be accepted by voters if the electorate were unable to hear candidates talking in their own language , " he points out .
in practice , however , not all languages are equal .
officially , the eu institutions ' working languages are french , english and german .
but german is used infrequently , while english has slowly but surely nudged out french as the most common language spoken in brussels .
language as culture bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : few children these days learn another langauge minority languages , meanwhile , barely get a look in , says anna zaborska .
" my impression is that minority languages are not adequately protected ; " she said .
" they need to be cultivated .
the eu needs to protect european cultures and culture is expressed in music , cuisine - and languages . "
but too many people are happy simply to resort to english .
why should a pole bother wrestling with german , or a spaniard tackle finnish when everyone can get along nicely speaking the universal language , english ? it 's a mentality that bernd posselt resists .
he says the result is a globalized pidgin english - a far cry from the language of shakespeare . " if the other nationalities do n't join forces to prevent this development , this is all we will be left with , " he predicts . dw staff -lrb- jp -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

laissez-faire is done with , said french and current eu president nicolas sarkozy . in what was officially the largest-ever us bank failure , washington mutual 's business has been shut down after the bank collapsed , with customers pulling more than $ 16 billion -lrb- 10.9 billion euros -rrb- from their accounts . those accounts have been gobbled up by jp morgan , thus ensuring that the depositors wo n't lose their money . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the us economy looks down and out , but the euro zone is not faring much better in washington , just hours after congress appeared on the verge of agreement on an emergency rescue plan for the us financial system , a historic white house meeting turned into a bout of bickering and broke up with no formal consensus on the controversial proposal . president george w. bush had invited both presidential candidates , barak obama and john mccain , to take part in an effort to find a consensus on the $ 700-billion plan to prop up the ailing financial system . republicans and democrats , however , are struggling to find middle ground with the former at odds over what would amount to government ownership of collapsed companies , anathema to the center-right advocates of free markets . ireland officially falls into recession while the bickering goes on in washington , the fallout is continuing to be felt in europe .
ireland has become the first member of the 15-member euro zone to fall into recession as a result of the us financial crisis . as in other countries , the domestic property market has taken a hammering and pushed the country into its first recession in 25 years . germany , britain , france and italy are also perilously close to experiencing the same fate . " we expect that italy and germany will also record contractions in their third quarter gross domestic product , following contractions in the second quarter , " said barclays capital analyst julian callow , as reported by afp news agency . a recession is officially defined as two consecutive quarters of no gdp growth . sarkozy : laissez-faire is finished with european leaders scrambling to fend off further disaster , french president nicolas sarkozy has joined the chorus of demands for an overhaul of the financial system . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : french president nicolas sarkozy told the un he wanted an emergency summit speaking in toulon on thursday , sept .
25 , sarkozy said the economic turmoil provoked by crises in the american sub-prime and finance markets had put an end to the free-market economy . " laissez-faire is finished , the all-powerful market that is always right , that 's finished , " he said in a widely anticipated speech , his first in france on the economic crisis .
he called for new rules and regulations and a wide-ranging restructuring of the entire global banking system , saying that the crisis has laid bare serious flaws in the international banking network . with france currently occupying the rotating presidency of the eu , sarkozy said he would " propose initiatives " on these issues at the next eu summit on oct .

26 , was greeted with delight by environmental groups , with greenpeace praising the parliament 's environment committee for " warding off disaster " and brussels-based group transport and environment -lrb- t & e -rrb- saying that parliamentarians had " stood up to enormous pressure " from lobbyists .
car industry disappointed but it was met with dismay by auto lobbies and politicians , with the association of european car manufacturers , acea , saying that the committee had " given the wrong signal " and " missed the opportunity to shape a realistic framework " for development .
guenther beckstein , conservative premier of the german state of bavaria , which is home to major manufacturers bmw and audi , said in a statement that " the anti-industry decision by the socialist majority in the committee endangers thousands of jobs -lrb- and -rrb- must be corrected " by the full parliament and the council of eu states .
the committee decided that car makers selling their vehicles in the eu should ensure that the average co2 emissions of the cars they sell are no more than 120 grams per kilometer -lrb- g / km -rrb- in 2012 .
penalties for non-compliance should start at 20 euros -lrb- $ 29.30 -rrb- per car sold and per g / km over the limit in 2012 , and rise to 95 euros per g / km in 2015 , they said .

initial proposals less strict ahead of the meeting , committee members had been widely expected to back a compromise proposal capping penalties at 50 euros per g / km and ruling that only the most efficient 70 percent of cars should be covered in the first years of the scheme .
environmental groups had slammed the compromise as both delaying and drastically weakening the original proposals from the european commission , the eu 's executive body .
" the cumulative effect of the loopholes outlined below would be no mandated emissions reductions by 2012 , the date of the official eu target , " greenpeace , t & e and friends of the earth said in a joint statement ahead of the vote .
unexpected win for the environment but on the day , the committee voted down both of those amendments in what observers see as a severe blow to the automobile industry .
" climate triumphs over car industry ! " the gue-ngl left-wing group of the parliament declared in a statement .
the proposed law is now set to go to the parliament 's plenary session on oct .
20-23 and to the council of eu member states , with experts saying that it is likely to face another intense lobbying battle before final acceptance .
co2 is the gas most closely linked with global warming , and experts estimate that cars alone account for 14 percent of all eu co2 emissions .

car industry disappointed but it was met with dismay by auto lobbies and politicians , with the association of european car manufacturers , acea , saying that the committee had " given the wrong signal " and " missed the opportunity to shape a realistic framework " for development .
guenther beckstein , conservative premier of the german state of bavaria , which is home to major manufacturers bmw and audi , said in a statement that " the anti-industry decision by the socialist majority in the committee endangers thousands of jobs -lrb- and -rrb- must be corrected " by the full parliament and the council of eu states .
the committee decided that car makers selling their vehicles in the eu should ensure that the average co2 emissions of the cars they sell are no more than 120 grams per kilometer -lrb- g / km -rrb- in 2012 .
penalties for non-compliance should start at 20 euros -lrb- $ 29.30 -rrb- per car sold and per g / km over the limit in 2012 , and rise to 95 euros per g / km in 2015 , they said .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the eu has pledged to further cut its co2 emissions by 2020 and the eu should bring in a further target of 95 g / km by 2020 , they decided .
initial proposals less strict ahead of the meeting , committee members had been widely expected to back a compromise proposal capping penalties at 50 euros per g / km and ruling that only the most efficient 70 percent of cars should be covered in the first years of the scheme .
environmental groups had slammed the compromise as both delaying and drastically weakening the original proposals from the european commission , the eu 's executive body .
" the cumulative effect of the loopholes outlined below would be no mandated emissions reductions by 2012 , the date of the official eu target , " greenpeace , t & e and friends of the earth said in a joint statement ahead of the vote .
unexpected win for the environment but on the day , the committee voted down both of those amendments in what observers see as a severe blow to the automobile industry .
" climate triumphs over car industry ! " the gue-ngl left-wing group of the parliament declared in a statement .
the proposed law is now set to go to the parliament 's plenary session on oct .
20-23 and to the council of eu member states , with experts saying that it is likely to face another intense lobbying battle before final acceptance .
co2 is the gas most closely linked with global warming , and experts estimate that cars alone account for 14 percent of all eu co2 emissions .

zabel is one of germany 's most accomplished cyclists , with more than 200 professional career wins including 12 tour de france stages .
he wore the final sprinters ' green jersey at the tour de france a record six consecutive years between 1996 and 2001 , and was a four-time winner of the milan-san remo spring classic .
tainted memory of zabel ?
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : zabel was highly emotional when admitting to using performance enhancing drugs in may 2007 , zabel confessed that he had taken the blood-booster erythropoietin -lrb- epo -rrb- while training for the 1996 tour de france and while cycling for germany 's team telekom .
epo increases the production of red blood cells , thereby allowing an athlete 's blood to deliver oxygen to muscles more efficiently .
" i used it as a test and ended it after one week because i had problems with the side-effects , " said zabel last year .
" since then , for the past eleven years , i have always denied doping .
i lied , and i apologize for this , " zabel had said at a tearful press conference .
speculation was rife as to whether zabel would be dumped by milram amid the doping revelations , but the professional cycling team ultimately honored the racer 's three-year contract through to this year 's end .
mass doping revelations zabel 's confession last may came after several similar admissions from other riders and two doctors from germany 's most successful riding team .
university doctors andreas schmid and lothar heinrich admitted to epo blood doping in the mid-1990s at team telekom .

poland and ukraine were given the reprieve after uefa 's executive committee met in bordeaux to discuss a progress report on preparations for the tournament .
" the executive committee reconfirmed uefa 's commitment to organize euro 2012 in poland and ukraine , " uefa president michel platini told a news conference in bordeaux .
" at the same time , the committee stressed a number of conditions must be met in order to bring forward the whole project . "
platini said the co-hosts " promised " that stadiums in kiev and warsaw would be ready in time .
poland football chief doubts poland 's readiness bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : uefa president michel platini insists poland and ukraine must speed up euro preparations inadequate stadiums , problems with transport systems and not enough hotel beds had given rise to serious concerns and pushed uefa into a corner .
several contingency plans had been touted prior to friday 's meeting , such as using germany as a third , supporting host , or - as the president of the polish soccer association , michal listkiewicz , suggested - that poland and ukraine 's 2012 hosting rights be rescinded in favor of another country , and that the two nations instead plan to host the tournament in 2016 .
listkiewicz seems far from convinced his country will be ready in four years time .
the biggest problem : poor infrastructure and terrible traffic , he said .
" if the european championships took place in 2016 , we would have no problems about being ready then , " listkiewicz told die zeit online , the internet platform of the weekly newspaper .
" but realistically we are looking at having no good roads in time for 2012 , " he said .
" from gdansk -lrb- in poland -rrb- to donetsk -lrb- in the ukraine -rrb- is more than 1,500 kilometers -lrb- 930 miles -rrb- .
this is not like in austria and switzerland where everything lies close together . "
moreover , he cast doubt on whether poland 's partners in ukraine will be up to the job .
" if things do n't go well now , and uefa has another suggestion , then that would be in order , " he said .
2016 euro expansion bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : from 2016 there will be more suspense and more games at the euro championship also to come from the bordeaux meeting was an announcement that as of 2016 , the european championship finals would be played in an expanded format , seeing 24 teams participate instead of the current 16 .

later , the anpav flight attendants ' union became the fifth of nine unions to sign up to the bailout deal . in response , the italian government decided to let a second deadline lapse in a bid to give the four remaining unions representing alitalia 's workforce a chance still to come on board .
" negotiations continue -lrb- and -rrb- the hands of the clock have been stopped , " a government official told reporters .
two other flight attendants unions said they would spend the weekend mulling whether to accept the rescue package proposed by the private italian consortium , the italian air company -lrb- cai -rrb- .
together , avia and sdl represent some 2,500 air stewards and hostesses .
two unions representing 1,400 pilots were still in talks on friday as the government endeavoured to win unanimous backing for the italian cai investor group deal .
italian labour minister maurizio sacconi told ansa news agency that the deal could , however , go ahead without the agreement of all unions .
unanimous approval " would be important ... but i think cai can pursue its course in any case , " he said .
the issues in dispute range from pay for ground crew and leave , to temporary work contracts .
the italian civil aviation authority had said it would ground alitalia unless a bailout plan had been agreed by thursday , but that threat has not been followed up .

uil union leader luigi angeletti confirmed mayrhuber had expressed lufthansa 's interest in alitalia during his meeting with union representatives .
industry sources said lufthansa is mulling whether to take a 20 percent stake in alitalia , according to news agency reuters .
a separate union source said the german airline was interested in an even bigger stake .
rival air france-klm is also seeking an alliance with alitalia .
it is said to be looking to gain as much as a 25 percent stake in the cai consortium .

he called for new rules and regulations and a wide-ranging restructuring of the entire global banking system , saying that the crisis has laid bare serious flaws in the international banking network . with france currently occupying the rotating presidency of the eu , sarkozy said he would " propose initiatives " on these issues at the next eu summit on oct .

the conference was held as the us congress was stalled in talks over a massive $ 700-billion bailout of the us financial industry .
leaders in new york were hounded with questions about the crisis at nearly every aid initiative that was launched .
un secretary general ban ki-moon said that the aid offers " exceeded our most optimistic expectations " and were a sign of " global partnership in action . "
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : africa has suffered most from malaria the new pledges were " all the more remarkable because it comes against the backdrop of a global financial crisis , " he added .
nearly 80 world leaders attended the one-day session to review progress on the millennium development goals -lrb- mdgs -rrb- , a series of ambitious un targets aimed at improving the plight of the world 's poorest by 2015 .
one step closer to eradicating poverty british prime minister gordon brown , who has spearheaded efforts to boost global aid , called it " the broadest coalition ever assembled " to combat poverty .
he said it would bring the world far closer to achieving the un 's targets .
many leaders talked up the economic linkages between the world 's industrial nations and its poorest in an effort to attract more development aid .
developing countries touted their own ongoing crisis , a surge in food and energy prices that has caused social unrest in dozens of nations .
nigerian foreign minister ojo maduekwe said that globalization meant " either shared prosperity ... or shared misery for the world . "
jeffrey sachs , an economist from colombia university , said it was " preposterous " that industrial nations could not afford to give 0.7 percent of their national budgets to development aid , whether in a time of " boom " or " bust . "
among the commitments made thursday was a more than $ 3-billion initiative unveiled to eradicate malaria by 2015 .
the plan aims to save more than 4.2 million lives , mainly in africa , which has suffered most from the disease .
a $ 4.5-billion education plan aims to bring 15 million children to school over the next three years and achieve universal primary education by 2015 - one of seven millenium development goals .
us billionaires open their wallets microsoft founder bill gates and howard g. buffett , son of billionaire investor warren buffett , whose foundations provide hundreds of millions of dollars to global program fighting poverty and diseases , were present at the un meetings to answer calls for generosity .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : bill gates was a major donor at the conference gates said that the mdgs , for all their shortcomings , had been crucial in " raising the visibility of the suffering faced by the world 's poorest people " and said he was encouraged by some of the innovative ideas coming out of the process .
the billionaires offered $ 76 million dollars to the world food program to assist some 350,000 farmers in 21 developing countries over the next five years .
the united states committed $ 61 million dollars to a similar program .
chinese premier wen jiabao said that development should be the top priority of all governments .
he announced new debt-forgiveness plans and pledged $ 30 million dollars and 1,000 experts to help poorer countries grow their own food .
the european union offered an additional $ 730 million over the next three years to help address a surge in food prices .
other commitments involved addressing climate change and promoting gender equality .
but brown and others warned that despite some progress being made on education and combatting diseases like aids and malaria , many of the un 's targets were still falling flat .
norwegian prime minister jens stoltenberg said he had " hardly seen any progress at all " on cutting maternal mortality rates .
norway , britain , the world bank and world health organization created a health taskforce to free up $ 2.4 billion by 2009 and $ 7 billion by 2015 . dpa news agency -lrb- kjb -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

car industry disappointed but it was met with dismay by auto lobbies and politicians , with the association of european car manufacturers , acea , saying that the committee had " given the wrong signal " and " missed the opportunity to shape a realistic framework " for development .
guenther beckstein , conservative premier of the german state of bavaria , which is home to major manufacturers bmw and audi , said in a statement that " the anti-industry decision by the socialist majority in the committee endangers thousands of jobs -lrb- and -rrb- must be corrected " by the full parliament and the council of eu states .
the committee decided that car makers selling their vehicles in the eu should ensure that the average co2 emissions of the cars they sell are no more than 120 grams per kilometer -lrb- g / km -rrb- in 2012 .
penalties for non-compliance should start at 20 euros -lrb- $ 29.30 -rrb- per car sold and per g / km over the limit in 2012 , and rise to 95 euros per g / km in 2015 , they said .

environmental groups had slammed the compromise as both delaying and drastically weakening the original proposals from the european commission , the eu 's executive body .
" the cumulative effect of the loopholes outlined below would be no mandated emissions reductions by 2012 , the date of the official eu target , " greenpeace , t & e and friends of the earth said in a joint statement ahead of the vote .
unexpected win for the environment but on the day , the committee voted down both of those amendments in what observers see as a severe blow to the automobile industry .

the proposed law is now set to go to the parliament 's plenary session on oct .

car industry disappointed but it was met with dismay by auto lobbies and politicians , with the association of european car manufacturers , acea , saying that the committee had " given the wrong signal " and " missed the opportunity to shape a realistic framework " for development .
guenther beckstein , conservative premier of the german state of bavaria , which is home to major manufacturers bmw and audi , said in a statement that " the anti-industry decision by the socialist majority in the committee endangers thousands of jobs -lrb- and -rrb- must be corrected " by the full parliament and the council of eu states .
the committee decided that car makers selling their vehicles in the eu should ensure that the average co2 emissions of the cars they sell are no more than 120 grams per kilometer -lrb- g / km -rrb- in 2012 .
penalties for non-compliance should start at 20 euros -lrb- $ 29.30 -rrb- per car sold and per g / km over the limit in 2012 , and rise to 95 euros per g / km in 2015 , they said .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the eu has pledged to further cut its co2 emissions by 2020 and the eu should bring in a further target of 95 g / km by 2020 , they decided .
initial proposals less strict ahead of the meeting , committee members had been widely expected to back a compromise proposal capping penalties at 50 euros per g / km and ruling that only the most efficient 70 percent of cars should be covered in the first years of the scheme .
environmental groups had slammed the compromise as both delaying and drastically weakening the original proposals from the european commission , the eu 's executive body .
" the cumulative effect of the loopholes outlined below would be no mandated emissions reductions by 2012 , the date of the official eu target , " greenpeace , t & e and friends of the earth said in a joint statement ahead of the vote .
unexpected win for the environment but on the day , the committee voted down both of those amendments in what observers see as a severe blow to the automobile industry .
" climate triumphs over car industry ! " the gue-ngl left-wing group of the parliament declared in a statement .
the proposed law is now set to go to the parliament 's plenary session on oct .
20-23 and to the council of eu member states , with experts saying that it is likely to face another intense lobbying battle before final acceptance .

austria 's voters appear to be fed up with rising inflation -lrb- at 3.9 percent , a 15-year high -rrb- , poor integration of the country 's large immigrant population , and the inability of the current government to do much about either .
the combined poll numbers of austria 's two far right-parties , the freedom party and the alliance for austria 's future are hovering around 25 percent .
that would represent the best draw for the austrian far-right since 1999 , when then-freedom party -lrb- and now alliance -rrb- leader jörg haider stunned europe by garnering 27 percent .
such a tally might well leave austria 's neighbors aghast , but one pollster , andreas kirchhofer of imas , told news agency reuters that austrians may be casting their votes against their current leaders more than for the rightists .
" they are fed up with the left-right coalition , " he said .

luckily for the people 's party , the social democrats have had myriad problems of their own .
the man who took office as chancellor following the last elections , alfred gusenbauer , has not proven an effective leader .
prone to gaffes and unable to marshal public support for controversial policies such as the institution of public service in place of university fees , gusenbauer lost his post as spö party leader to werner faymann in june of this year .

as an editorial in the conservative newspaper die presse recently had it , " the only thing that 's clear is that the ' winner ' will also be a loser , because the voters want to punish them . "
the winner in all this is likely to be the far right .

while he may lack the charisma of his predecessor jörg haider , strache has clearly learned from him .
since breaking with the freedom party in 2005 , haider 's star has waned and strache 's has grown - mostly by emulating haider .
strache ran a campaign in viennese elections with posters featuring slogans like " vienna must not become istanbul ! " , a more strident take on haider 's old " vienna must not become chicago ! " poster by targeting voters ' cultural fears directly , not just through the guise of crime .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : it seems not everyone in austria is enamored by the far right strache may also have benefitted from his youth .

austria 's voters appear to be fed up with rising inflation -lrb- at 3.9 percent , a 15-year high -rrb- , poor integration of the country 's large immigrant population , and the inability of the current government to do much about either .
the combined poll numbers of austria 's two far right-parties , the freedom party and the alliance for austria 's future are hovering around 25 percent .
that would represent the best draw for the austrian far-right since 1999 , when then-freedom party -lrb- and now alliance -rrb- leader jörg haider stunned europe by garnering 27 percent .
such a tally might well leave austria 's neighbors aghast , but one pollster , andreas kirchhofer of imas , told news agency reuters that austrians may be casting their votes against their current leaders more than for the rightists .

but worsening economic conditions in the months since , along with some shrewd maneuvering from the far right , mean the övp may come to regret the decision . the övp currently trails the spö in opinion polls , and while they both enjoy comfortable leads over fringe parties , the two big parties ' combined total looks set to dip below 60 percent for the first time since world war ii .
as an editorial in the conservative newspaper die presse recently had it , " the only thing that 's clear is that the ' winner ' will also be a loser , because the voters want to punish them . "
the winner in all this is likely to be the far right .
right man at the right time ?
the new face of austria 's far right is heinz-christian strache .
while he may lack the charisma of his predecessor jörg haider , strache has clearly learned from him .
since breaking with the freedom party in 2005 , haider 's star has waned and strache 's has grown - mostly by emulating haider .
strache ran a campaign in viennese elections with posters featuring slogans like " vienna must not become istanbul ! " , a more strident take on haider 's old " vienna must not become chicago ! " poster by targeting voters ' cultural fears directly , not just through the guise of crime .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : it seems not everyone in austria is enamored by the far right strache may also have benefitted from his youth .
the haider formula always traded on the man 's relative vitality - physical fitness , sharp dress , sun tan .
strache has all of these traits , and as a trained dental technician , he can also claim brilliantly white teeth .
and such a package may be a bit more convincing in the 39-year old strache than in haider , now 59 .
the similarity has not gone unnoticed .
haider himself runs advertisements touting himself as " the original , " and övp party leader wilhelm molderer snapped in a recent television debate that strachen was " just a poor copy of jörg haider in the ' 80s . "
a stinging remark , but perhaps a backhanded compliment as well .
after all , jörg haider in the 80 's was a rousing success .
in his first election in charge in 1986 , haider helped double the party 's returns from 1983 to almost 10 percent , and by 1999 had taken it up to 27 percent . dw staff -lrb- mrh -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

the pledges totalled $ 16 billion -lrb- 10.9 billion euros -rrb- according to an initial un estimate , including more than $ 3 billion to eradicate malaria , $ 2 billion to tackle an ongoing food crisis and $ 4.5 billion for educational programs .
nearly overshadowed by financial crisis fighting for money - and headlines - in light of the financial turmoil of the last few weeks , officials appeared happy with the outcome of the one-day talks .
the conference was held as the us congress was stalled in talks over a massive $ 700-billion bailout of the us financial industry .
leaders in new york were hounded with questions about the crisis at nearly every aid initiative that was launched .

developing countries touted their own ongoing crisis , a surge in food and energy prices that has caused social unrest in dozens of nations .
nigerian foreign minister ojo maduekwe said that globalization meant " either shared prosperity ... or shared misery for the world . "
jeffrey sachs , an economist from colombia university , said it was " preposterous " that industrial nations could not afford to give 0.7 percent of their national budgets to development aid , whether in a time of " boom " or " bust . "
among the commitments made thursday was a more than $ 3-billion initiative unveiled to eradicate malaria by 2015 .
the plan aims to save more than 4.2 million lives , mainly in africa , which has suffered most from the disease .
a $ 4.5-billion education plan aims to bring 15 million children to school over the next three years and achieve universal primary education by 2015 - one of seven millenium development goals .

bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : bill gates was a major donor at the conference gates said that the mdgs , for all their shortcomings , had been crucial in " raising the visibility of the suffering faced by the world 's poorest people " and said he was encouraged by some of the innovative ideas coming out of the process .
the billionaires offered $ 76 million dollars to the world food program to assist some 350,000 farmers in 21 developing countries over the next five years .
the united states committed $ 61 million dollars to a similar program .
chinese premier wen jiabao said that development should be the top priority of all governments .
he announced new debt-forgiveness plans and pledged $ 30 million dollars and 1,000 experts to help poorer countries grow their own food .
the european union offered an additional $ 730 million over the next three years to help address a surge in food prices .
other commitments involved addressing climate change and promoting gender equality .
but brown and others warned that despite some progress being made on education and combatting diseases like aids and malaria , many of the un 's targets were still falling flat .
norwegian prime minister jens stoltenberg said he had " hardly seen any progress at all " on cutting maternal mortality rates .
norway , britain , the world bank and world health organization created a health taskforce to free up $ 2.4 billion by 2009 and $ 7 billion by 2015 . dpa news agency -lrb- kjb -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

car industry disappointed but it was met with dismay by auto lobbies and politicians , with the association of european car manufacturers , acea , saying that the committee had " given the wrong signal " and " missed the opportunity to shape a realistic framework " for development .
guenther beckstein , conservative premier of the german state of bavaria , which is home to major manufacturers bmw and audi , said in a statement that " the anti-industry decision by the socialist majority in the committee endangers thousands of jobs -lrb- and -rrb- must be corrected " by the full parliament and the council of eu states .
the committee decided that car makers selling their vehicles in the eu should ensure that the average co2 emissions of the cars they sell are no more than 120 grams per kilometer -lrb- g / km -rrb- in 2012 .
penalties for non-compliance should start at 20 euros -lrb- $ 29.30 -rrb- per car sold and per g / km over the limit in 2012 , and rise to 95 euros per g / km in 2015 , they said .

environmental groups had slammed the compromise as both delaying and drastically weakening the original proposals from the european commission , the eu 's executive body .
" the cumulative effect of the loopholes outlined below would be no mandated emissions reductions by 2012 , the date of the official eu target , " greenpeace , t & e and friends of the earth said in a joint statement ahead of the vote .
unexpected win for the environment but on the day , the committee voted down both of those amendments in what observers see as a severe blow to the automobile industry .
" climate triumphs over car industry ! " the gue-ngl left-wing group of the parliament declared in a statement .
the proposed law is now set to go to the parliament 's plenary session on oct .

laissez-faire is done with , said french and current eu president nicolas sarkozy . in what was officially the largest-ever us bank failure , washington mutual 's business has been shut down after the bank collapsed , with customers pulling more than $ 16 billion -lrb- 10.9 billion euros -rrb- from their accounts . those accounts have been gobbled up by jp morgan , thus ensuring that the depositors wo n't lose their money . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the us economy looks down and out , but the euro zone is not faring much better in washington , just hours after congress appeared on the verge of agreement on an emergency rescue plan for the us financial system , a historic white house meeting turned into a bout of bickering and broke up with no formal consensus on the controversial proposal . president george w. bush had invited both presidential candidates , barak obama and john mccain , to take part in an effort to find a consensus on the $ 700-billion plan to prop up the ailing financial system . republicans and democrats , however , are struggling to find middle ground with the former at odds over what would amount to government ownership of collapsed companies , anathema to the center-right advocates of free markets . ireland officially falls into recession while the bickering goes on in washington , the fallout is continuing to be felt in europe .
ireland has become the first member of the 15-member euro zone to fall into recession as a result of the us financial crisis . as in other countries , the domestic property market has taken a hammering and pushed the country into its first recession in 25 years . germany , britain , france and italy are also perilously close to experiencing the same fate . " we expect that italy and germany will also record contractions in their third quarter gross domestic product , following contractions in the second quarter , " said barclays capital analyst julian callow , as reported by afp news agency . a recession is officially defined as two consecutive quarters of no gdp growth . sarkozy : laissez-faire is finished with european leaders scrambling to fend off further disaster , french president nicolas sarkozy has joined the chorus of demands for an overhaul of the financial system . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : french president nicolas sarkozy told the un he wanted an emergency summit speaking in toulon on thursday , sept .
25 , sarkozy said the economic turmoil provoked by crises in the american sub-prime and finance markets had put an end to the free-market economy . " laissez-faire is finished , the all-powerful market that is always right , that 's finished , " he said in a widely anticipated speech , his first in france on the economic crisis .
he called for new rules and regulations and a wide-ranging restructuring of the entire global banking system , saying that the crisis has laid bare serious flaws in the international banking network . with france currently occupying the rotating presidency of the eu , sarkozy said he would " propose initiatives " on these issues at the next eu summit on oct .

but what should be a celebration of multi-lingualism in fact highlights a failure in language-learning across the bloc and a lack of attention on minority languages . when the council of europe and the european commission designated september 26 european day of languages , it was hoped that the initiative would stress the importance of language learning and increase intercultural understanding .
but the reality is that in 2008 , only a minority of the public actually learn a second language , let alone a third .
slovakian member of the european parliament anna zaborska believes that europeans fail to appreciate the linguistic diversity of the continent .
" i strongly feel that multi-lingualism is one of the eu 's hidden treasures , " she said .
minority complaints bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : english , french and german are the main langauges spoken at eu headquarters other meps are angry at what they see as the commission 's failure to set out concrete initiatives to promote minority languages in its new , much-touted multilingualism strategy . among those criticizing a lack of funding for languages and specific new programs are basque mep mikel irujo , jill evans of welsh party plaid cymru and transylvanian independent lászló tőkés .
speaking at a press conference earlier this week , they complained that the commission was not doing " more to promote minority languages at eu level " as well as " those languages that do not yet have official status , " with evans in particular repeating previous demands for welsh to become a fully-fledged eu language expensive and time-consuming meps are , in fact , actively encouraged to speak their mother tongue when parliament is in session .
the eu recognizes 23 languages , and employs legions of translators and interpreters to help communication .
it 's an expensive and time-consuming luxury , but according to german mep bernd posselt , multi-lingualism is an essential element of the eu 's democratic structure .
" the european parliament would never be accepted by voters if the electorate were unable to hear candidates talking in their own language , " he points out .
in practice , however , not all languages are equal .
officially , the eu institutions ' working languages are french , english and german .
but german is used infrequently , while english has slowly but surely nudged out french as the most common language spoken in brussels .
language as culture bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : few children these days learn another langauge minority languages , meanwhile , barely get a look in , says anna zaborska .
" my impression is that minority languages are not adequately protected ; " she said .
" they need to be cultivated .
the eu needs to protect european cultures and culture is expressed in music , cuisine - and languages . "
but too many people are happy simply to resort to english .
why should a pole bother wrestling with german , or a spaniard tackle finnish when everyone can get along nicely speaking the universal language , english ? it 's a mentality that bernd posselt resists .

developing countries touted their own ongoing crisis , a surge in food and energy prices that has caused social unrest in dozens of nations .
nigerian foreign minister ojo maduekwe said that globalization meant " either shared prosperity ... or shared misery for the world . "
jeffrey sachs , an economist from colombia university , said it was " preposterous " that industrial nations could not afford to give 0.7 percent of their national budgets to development aid , whether in a time of " boom " or " bust . "
among the commitments made thursday was a more than $ 3-billion initiative unveiled to eradicate malaria by 2015 .
the plan aims to save more than 4.2 million lives , mainly in africa , which has suffered most from the disease .

bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : bill gates was a major donor at the conference gates said that the mdgs , for all their shortcomings , had been crucial in " raising the visibility of the suffering faced by the world 's poorest people " and said he was encouraged by some of the innovative ideas coming out of the process .
the billionaires offered $ 76 million dollars to the world food program to assist some 350,000 farmers in 21 developing countries over the next five years .
the united states committed $ 61 million dollars to a similar program .
chinese premier wen jiabao said that development should be the top priority of all governments .
he announced new debt-forgiveness plans and pledged $ 30 million dollars and 1,000 experts to help poorer countries grow their own food .
the european union offered an additional $ 730 million over the next three years to help address a surge in food prices .
other commitments involved addressing climate change and promoting gender equality .
but brown and others warned that despite some progress being made on education and combatting diseases like aids and malaria , many of the un 's targets were still falling flat .
norwegian prime minister jens stoltenberg said he had " hardly seen any progress at all " on cutting maternal mortality rates .

austria 's voters appear to be fed up with rising inflation -lrb- at 3.9 percent , a 15-year high -rrb- , poor integration of the country 's large immigrant population , and the inability of the current government to do much about either .
the combined poll numbers of austria 's two far right-parties , the freedom party and the alliance for austria 's future are hovering around 25 percent .
that would represent the best draw for the austrian far-right since 1999 , when then-freedom party -lrb- and now alliance -rrb- leader jörg haider stunned europe by garnering 27 percent .
such a tally might well leave austria 's neighbors aghast , but one pollster , andreas kirchhofer of imas , told news agency reuters that austrians may be casting their votes against their current leaders more than for the rightists .
" they are fed up with the left-right coalition , " he said .
" they want another kind of government , but they do n't really know exactly what that should look like . " not-so-grand coalition the country 's ruling grand coalition of the center-left social democrats -lrb- spö -rrb- and center-right austrian people 's party -lrb- övp -rrb- has had a rough ride in its less than two years in power . the people 's party , stunned to have drawn less votes than the social democrats in 2006 , have never really taken to their junior partner role , preferring to stave off major leftward policy shifts and bide their time rather than engage with the spö .
luckily for the people 's party , the social democrats have had myriad problems of their own .
the man who took office as chancellor following the last elections , alfred gusenbauer , has not proven an effective leader .
prone to gaffes and unable to marshal public support for controversial policies such as the institution of public service in place of university fees , gusenbauer lost his post as spö party leader to werner faymann in june of this year .

but worsening economic conditions in the months since , along with some shrewd maneuvering from the far right , mean the övp may come to regret the decision . the övp currently trails the spö in opinion polls , and while they both enjoy comfortable leads over fringe parties , the two big parties ' combined total looks set to dip below 60 percent for the first time since world war ii .
as an editorial in the conservative newspaper die presse recently had it , " the only thing that 's clear is that the ' winner ' will also be a loser , because the voters want to punish them . "
the winner in all this is likely to be the far right .
right man at the right time ?
the new face of austria 's far right is heinz-christian strache .
while he may lack the charisma of his predecessor jörg haider , strache has clearly learned from him .
since breaking with the freedom party in 2005 , haider 's star has waned and strache 's has grown - mostly by emulating haider .
strache ran a campaign in viennese elections with posters featuring slogans like " vienna must not become istanbul ! " , a more strident take on haider 's old " vienna must not become chicago ! " poster by targeting voters ' cultural fears directly , not just through the guise of crime .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : it seems not everyone in austria is enamored by the far right strache may also have benefitted from his youth .
the haider formula always traded on the man 's relative vitality - physical fitness , sharp dress , sun tan .
strache has all of these traits , and as a trained dental technician , he can also claim brilliantly white teeth .
and such a package may be a bit more convincing in the 39-year old strache than in haider , now 59 .
the similarity has not gone unnoticed .
haider himself runs advertisements touting himself as " the original , " and övp party leader wilhelm molderer snapped in a recent television debate that strachen was " just a poor copy of jörg haider in the ' 80s . "
a stinging remark , but perhaps a backhanded compliment as well .
after all , jörg haider in the 80 's was a rousing success .

austria 's voters appear to be fed up with rising inflation -lrb- at 3.9 percent , a 15-year high -rrb- , poor integration of the country 's large immigrant population , and the inability of the current government to do much about either .
the combined poll numbers of austria 's two far right-parties , the freedom party and the alliance for austria 's future are hovering around 25 percent .
that would represent the best draw for the austrian far-right since 1999 , when then-freedom party -lrb- and now alliance -rrb- leader jörg haider stunned europe by garnering 27 percent .
such a tally might well leave austria 's neighbors aghast , but one pollster , andreas kirchhofer of imas , told news agency reuters that austrians may be casting their votes against their current leaders more than for the rightists .
" they are fed up with the left-right coalition , " he said .
" they want another kind of government , but they do n't really know exactly what that should look like . " not-so-grand coalition the country 's ruling grand coalition of the center-left social democrats -lrb- spö -rrb- and center-right austrian people 's party -lrb- övp -rrb- has had a rough ride in its less than two years in power . the people 's party , stunned to have drawn less votes than the social democrats in 2006 , have never really taken to their junior partner role , preferring to stave off major leftward policy shifts and bide their time rather than engage with the spö .
luckily for the people 's party , the social democrats have had myriad problems of their own .
the man who took office as chancellor following the last elections , alfred gusenbauer , has not proven an effective leader .
prone to gaffes and unable to marshal public support for controversial policies such as the institution of public service in place of university fees , gusenbauer lost his post as spö party leader to werner faymann in june of this year .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : austria 's social democrats are pinning their hopes on new party leader faymann to pull them out of a slump faymann , for his part , promptly reversed his party 's long-standing position not to hold a referendum on europe .
in a letter to the populist , anti-eu tabloid kronen zeitung , faymann said his party now wanted one . with the social democrats in seeming disarray , their conservative coalition partners in the övp called a snap election in july .
but worsening economic conditions in the months since , along with some shrewd maneuvering from the far right , mean the övp may come to regret the decision . the övp currently trails the spö in opinion polls , and while they both enjoy comfortable leads over fringe parties , the two big parties ' combined total looks set to dip below 60 percent for the first time since world war ii .
as an editorial in the conservative newspaper die presse recently had it , " the only thing that 's clear is that the ' winner ' will also be a loser , because the voters want to punish them . "
the winner in all this is likely to be the far right .
right man at the right time ?
the new face of austria 's far right is heinz-christian strache .
while he may lack the charisma of his predecessor jörg haider , strache has clearly learned from him .
since breaking with the freedom party in 2005 , haider 's star has waned and strache 's has grown - mostly by emulating haider .
strache ran a campaign in viennese elections with posters featuring slogans like " vienna must not become istanbul ! " , a more strident take on haider 's old " vienna must not become chicago ! " poster by targeting voters ' cultural fears directly , not just through the guise of crime .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : it seems not everyone in austria is enamored by the far right strache may also have benefitted from his youth .
the haider formula always traded on the man 's relative vitality - physical fitness , sharp dress , sun tan .
strache has all of these traits , and as a trained dental technician , he can also claim brilliantly white teeth .
and such a package may be a bit more convincing in the 39-year old strache than in haider , now 59 .
the similarity has not gone unnoticed .
haider himself runs advertisements touting himself as " the original , " and övp party leader wilhelm molderer snapped in a recent television debate that strachen was " just a poor copy of jörg haider in the ' 80s . "
a stinging remark , but perhaps a backhanded compliment as well .
after all , jörg haider in the 80 's was a rousing success .
in his first election in charge in 1986 , haider helped double the party 's returns from 1983 to almost 10 percent , and by 1999 had taken it up to 27 percent . dw staff -lrb- mrh -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

the pledges totalled $ 16 billion -lrb- 10.9 billion euros -rrb- according to an initial un estimate , including more than $ 3 billion to eradicate malaria , $ 2 billion to tackle an ongoing food crisis and $ 4.5 billion for educational programs .
nearly overshadowed by financial crisis fighting for money - and headlines - in light of the financial turmoil of the last few weeks , officials appeared happy with the outcome of the one-day talks .

leaders in new york were hounded with questions about the crisis at nearly every aid initiative that was launched .

nigerian foreign minister ojo maduekwe said that globalization meant " either shared prosperity ... or shared misery for the world . "
jeffrey sachs , an economist from colombia university , said it was " preposterous " that industrial nations could not afford to give 0.7 percent of their national budgets to development aid , whether in a time of " boom " or " bust . "
among the commitments made thursday was a more than $ 3-billion initiative unveiled to eradicate malaria by 2015 .
the plan aims to save more than 4.2 million lives , mainly in africa , which has suffered most from the disease .
a $ 4.5-billion education plan aims to bring 15 million children to school over the next three years and achieve universal primary education by 2015 - one of seven millenium development goals .

the european union offered an additional $ 730 million over the next three years to help address a surge in food prices .
other commitments involved addressing climate change and promoting gender equality .
but brown and others warned that despite some progress being made on education and combatting diseases like aids and malaria , many of the un 's targets were still falling flat .
norwegian prime minister jens stoltenberg said he had " hardly seen any progress at all " on cutting maternal mortality rates .

it included no new sanctions . steinmeier said that he was relieved that the group of five permanent security council powers plus germany had remained united over the iran issue .
western powers had feared that russia would withdraw its support after cancelling a meeting on thursday . without such unity , steinmeier said , pressure on iran could not be maintained , adding that the draft resolution would likely be approved by the council on saturday .
he was speaking on the sidelines of a un assembly meeting in new york .
the resolution " reaffirms " existing sanctions that have been placed on iran over its refusal to comply with security council demands to halt uranium enrichment , a process that can be used to build nuclear weapons .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : russia is reluctant to impose further sanctions on tehran no new sanctions against iran have been put forward something the united states , france and britain had been pushing for this week .
in an interview with ruters news agency , us secretary of state condoleeza rice said the six nations wanted to show they stood together in confronting tehran over its nuclear program .
" i think it 's also especially important that the iranians recognize that the p5 plus 1 process is intact , " said rice , referring to the five security council members and germany .
she said she did not know whether major powers would agree on a fourth sanctions resolution against iran by the end of the bush administration .
three sanctions resolutions against iran have already been passed by the 15-nation council .
a report by the un-backed international atomic energy agency -lrb- iaea -rrb- last week said iran had expanded uranium enrichment activities and was not fully cooperating with the agency 's investigation .
rice scolds security council bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : iranian president mahmoud ahmadinejad was sharply criticized by rice meanwhile , rice chided the council for not focussing on what she said were the biggest threats to international peace during a security council meeting on israeli settlements in the palestinian territories .
the us had expected the security council to address iranian president mahmoud ahmadinejad 's call for the " destruction " of israel during a speech before the general assembly on tuesday , she said .
" when this council decides what really needs to be taken up as a threat to international peace and security , that to me makes the top of the list , " rice said .
western suspicions linger western countries suspect iran is seeking the capability to develop nuclear weapons , while tehran maintains its program is solely for producing civilian nuclear energy .

it included no new sanctions . steinmeier said that he was relieved that the group of five permanent security council powers plus germany had remained united over the iran issue .
western powers had feared that russia would withdraw its support after cancelling a meeting on thursday . without such unity , steinmeier said , pressure on iran could not be maintained , adding that the draft resolution would likely be approved by the council on saturday .
he was speaking on the sidelines of a un assembly meeting in new york .
the resolution " reaffirms " existing sanctions that have been placed on iran over its refusal to comply with security council demands to halt uranium enrichment , a process that can be used to build nuclear weapons .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : russia is reluctant to impose further sanctions on tehran no new sanctions against iran have been put forward something the united states , france and britain had been pushing for this week .
in an interview with ruters news agency , us secretary of state condoleeza rice said the six nations wanted to show they stood together in confronting tehran over its nuclear program .
" i think it 's also especially important that the iranians recognize that the p5 plus 1 process is intact , " said rice , referring to the five security council members and germany .
she said she did not know whether major powers would agree on a fourth sanctions resolution against iran by the end of the bush administration .
three sanctions resolutions against iran have already been passed by the 15-nation council .
a report by the un-backed international atomic energy agency -lrb- iaea -rrb- last week said iran had expanded uranium enrichment activities and was not fully cooperating with the agency 's investigation .
rice scolds security council bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : iranian president mahmoud ahmadinejad was sharply criticized by rice meanwhile , rice chided the council for not focussing on what she said were the biggest threats to international peace during a security council meeting on israeli settlements in the palestinian territories .
the us had expected the security council to address iranian president mahmoud ahmadinejad 's call for the " destruction " of israel during a speech before the general assembly on tuesday , she said .
" when this council decides what really needs to be taken up as a threat to international peace and security , that to me makes the top of the list , " rice said .
western suspicions linger western countries suspect iran is seeking the capability to develop nuclear weapons , while tehran maintains its program is solely for producing civilian nuclear energy .
british foreign secretary david miliband said that despite the failure to reach an agreement on new sanctions , the resolution was designed " to affirm our unity , to rally international support " for an ongoing carrot-and-stick approach against iran , which involves offering economic incentives if it halts its program and leaves open more sanctions if it continues . dw staff -lrb- dm / jg -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

poland and ukraine were given the reprieve after uefa 's executive committee met in bordeaux to discuss a progress report on preparations for the tournament .
" the executive committee reconfirmed uefa 's commitment to organize euro 2012 in poland and ukraine , " uefa president michel platini told a news conference in bordeaux .

austria 's voters appear to be fed up with rising inflation -lrb- at 3.9 percent , a 15-year high -rrb- , poor integration of the country 's large immigrant population , and the inability of the current government to do much about either .
the combined poll numbers of austria 's two far right-parties , the freedom party and the alliance for austria 's future are hovering around 25 percent .
that would represent the best draw for the austrian far-right since 1999 , when then-freedom party -lrb- and now alliance -rrb- leader jörg haider stunned europe by garnering 27 percent .
such a tally might well leave austria 's neighbors aghast , but one pollster , andreas kirchhofer of imas , told news agency reuters that austrians may be casting their votes against their current leaders more than for the rightists .
" they are fed up with the left-right coalition , " he said .
" they want another kind of government , but they do n't really know exactly what that should look like . " not-so-grand coalition the country 's ruling grand coalition of the center-left social democrats -lrb- spö -rrb- and center-right austrian people 's party -lrb- övp -rrb- has had a rough ride in its less than two years in power . the people 's party , stunned to have drawn less votes than the social democrats in 2006 , have never really taken to their junior partner role , preferring to stave off major leftward policy shifts and bide their time rather than engage with the spö .
luckily for the people 's party , the social democrats have had myriad problems of their own .
the man who took office as chancellor following the last elections , alfred gusenbauer , has not proven an effective leader .
prone to gaffes and unable to marshal public support for controversial policies such as the institution of public service in place of university fees , gusenbauer lost his post as spö party leader to werner faymann in june of this year .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : austria 's social democrats are pinning their hopes on new party leader faymann to pull them out of a slump faymann , for his part , promptly reversed his party 's long-standing position not to hold a referendum on europe .
in a letter to the populist , anti-eu tabloid kronen zeitung , faymann said his party now wanted one . with the social democrats in seeming disarray , their conservative coalition partners in the övp called a snap election in july .
but worsening economic conditions in the months since , along with some shrewd maneuvering from the far right , mean the övp may come to regret the decision . the övp currently trails the spö in opinion polls , and while they both enjoy comfortable leads over fringe parties , the two big parties ' combined total looks set to dip below 60 percent for the first time since world war ii .
as an editorial in the conservative newspaper die presse recently had it , " the only thing that 's clear is that the ' winner ' will also be a loser , because the voters want to punish them . "
the winner in all this is likely to be the far right .
right man at the right time ?
the new face of austria 's far right is heinz-christian strache .
while he may lack the charisma of his predecessor jörg haider , strache has clearly learned from him .
since breaking with the freedom party in 2005 , haider 's star has waned and strache 's has grown - mostly by emulating haider .
strache ran a campaign in viennese elections with posters featuring slogans like " vienna must not become istanbul ! " , a more strident take on haider 's old " vienna must not become chicago ! " poster by targeting voters ' cultural fears directly , not just through the guise of crime .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : it seems not everyone in austria is enamored by the far right strache may also have benefitted from his youth .
the haider formula always traded on the man 's relative vitality - physical fitness , sharp dress , sun tan .
strache has all of these traits , and as a trained dental technician , he can also claim brilliantly white teeth .
and such a package may be a bit more convincing in the 39-year old strache than in haider , now 59 .
the similarity has not gone unnoticed .
haider himself runs advertisements touting himself as " the original , " and övp party leader wilhelm molderer snapped in a recent television debate that strachen was " just a poor copy of jörg haider in the ' 80s . "
a stinging remark , but perhaps a backhanded compliment as well .
after all , jörg haider in the 80 's was a rousing success .
in his first election in charge in 1986 , haider helped double the party 's returns from 1983 to almost 10 percent , and by 1999 had taken it up to 27 percent . dw staff -lrb- mrh -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de european union -pipe- 26.09.2008 day of european languages reveals differences , not diversity großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : not many in europe learn a second language , let alone a third september 26 is european day of languages .
but what should be a celebration of multi-lingualism in fact highlights a failure in language-learning across the bloc and a lack of attention on minority languages . when the council of europe and the european commission designated september 26 european day of languages , it was hoped that the initiative would stress the importance of language learning and increase intercultural understanding .
but the reality is that in 2008 , only a minority of the public actually learn a second language , let alone a third .
slovakian member of the european parliament anna zaborska believes that europeans fail to appreciate the linguistic diversity of the continent .
" i strongly feel that multi-lingualism is one of the eu 's hidden treasures , " she said .
minority complaints bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : english , french and german are the main langauges spoken at eu headquarters other meps are angry at what they see as the commission 's failure to set out concrete initiatives to promote minority languages in its new , much-touted multilingualism strategy . among those criticizing a lack of funding for languages and specific new programs are basque mep mikel irujo , jill evans of welsh party plaid cymru and transylvanian independent lászló tőkés .
speaking at a press conference earlier this week , they complained that the commission was not doing " more to promote minority languages at eu level " as well as " those languages that do not yet have official status , " with evans in particular repeating previous demands for welsh to become a fully-fledged eu language expensive and time-consuming meps are , in fact , actively encouraged to speak their mother tongue when parliament is in session .
the eu recognizes 23 languages , and employs legions of translators and interpreters to help communication .
it 's an expensive and time-consuming luxury , but according to german mep bernd posselt , multi-lingualism is an essential element of the eu 's democratic structure .
" the european parliament would never be accepted by voters if the electorate were unable to hear candidates talking in their own language , " he points out .
in practice , however , not all languages are equal .
officially , the eu institutions ' working languages are french , english and german .
but german is used infrequently , while english has slowly but surely nudged out french as the most common language spoken in brussels .
language as culture bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : few children these days learn another langauge minority languages , meanwhile , barely get a look in , says anna zaborska .
" my impression is that minority languages are not adequately protected ; " she said .
" they need to be cultivated .
the eu needs to protect european cultures and culture is expressed in music , cuisine - and languages . "
but too many people are happy simply to resort to english .
why should a pole bother wrestling with german , or a spaniard tackle finnish when everyone can get along nicely speaking the universal language , english ? it 's a mentality that bernd posselt resists .
he says the result is a globalized pidgin english - a far cry from the language of shakespeare . " if the other nationalities do n't join forces to prevent this development , this is all we will be left with , " he predicts . dw staff -lrb- jp -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

but what should be a celebration of multi-lingualism in fact highlights a failure in language-learning across the bloc and a lack of attention on minority languages . when the council of europe and the european commission designated september 26 european day of languages , it was hoped that the initiative would stress the importance of language learning and increase intercultural understanding .
but the reality is that in 2008 , only a minority of the public actually learn a second language , let alone a third .
slovakian member of the european parliament anna zaborska believes that europeans fail to appreciate the linguistic diversity of the continent .
" i strongly feel that multi-lingualism is one of the eu 's hidden treasures , " she said .
minority complaints bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : english , french and german are the main langauges spoken at eu headquarters other meps are angry at what they see as the commission 's failure to set out concrete initiatives to promote minority languages in its new , much-touted multilingualism strategy . among those criticizing a lack of funding for languages and specific new programs are basque mep mikel irujo , jill evans of welsh party plaid cymru and transylvanian independent lászló tőkés .
speaking at a press conference earlier this week , they complained that the commission was not doing " more to promote minority languages at eu level " as well as " those languages that do not yet have official status , " with evans in particular repeating previous demands for welsh to become a fully-fledged eu language expensive and time-consuming meps are , in fact , actively encouraged to speak their mother tongue when parliament is in session .
the eu recognizes 23 languages , and employs legions of translators and interpreters to help communication .
it 's an expensive and time-consuming luxury , but according to german mep bernd posselt , multi-lingualism is an essential element of the eu 's democratic structure .
" the european parliament would never be accepted by voters if the electorate were unable to hear candidates talking in their own language , " he points out .
in practice , however , not all languages are equal .
officially , the eu institutions ' working languages are french , english and german .
but german is used infrequently , while english has slowly but surely nudged out french as the most common language spoken in brussels .
language as culture bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : few children these days learn another langauge minority languages , meanwhile , barely get a look in , says anna zaborska .
" my impression is that minority languages are not adequately protected ; " she said .
" they need to be cultivated .
the eu needs to protect european cultures and culture is expressed in music , cuisine - and languages . "
but too many people are happy simply to resort to english .
why should a pole bother wrestling with german , or a spaniard tackle finnish when everyone can get along nicely speaking the universal language , english ? it 's a mentality that bernd posselt resists .
he says the result is a globalized pidgin english - a far cry from the language of shakespeare .

but what should be a celebration of multi-lingualism in fact highlights a failure in language-learning across the bloc and a lack of attention on minority languages . when the council of europe and the european commission designated september 26 european day of languages , it was hoped that the initiative would stress the importance of language learning and increase intercultural understanding .
but the reality is that in 2008 , only a minority of the public actually learn a second language , let alone a third .
slovakian member of the european parliament anna zaborska believes that europeans fail to appreciate the linguistic diversity of the continent .
" i strongly feel that multi-lingualism is one of the eu 's hidden treasures , " she said .
minority complaints bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : english , french and german are the main langauges spoken at eu headquarters other meps are angry at what they see as the commission 's failure to set out concrete initiatives to promote minority languages in its new , much-touted multilingualism strategy . among those criticizing a lack of funding for languages and specific new programs are basque mep mikel irujo , jill evans of welsh party plaid cymru and transylvanian independent lászló tőkés .
speaking at a press conference earlier this week , they complained that the commission was not doing " more to promote minority languages at eu level " as well as " those languages that do not yet have official status , " with evans in particular repeating previous demands for welsh to become a fully-fledged eu language expensive and time-consuming meps are , in fact , actively encouraged to speak their mother tongue when parliament is in session .
the eu recognizes 23 languages , and employs legions of translators and interpreters to help communication .
it 's an expensive and time-consuming luxury , but according to german mep bernd posselt , multi-lingualism is an essential element of the eu 's democratic structure .
" the european parliament would never be accepted by voters if the electorate were unable to hear candidates talking in their own language , " he points out .
in practice , however , not all languages are equal .
officially , the eu institutions ' working languages are french , english and german .
but german is used infrequently , while english has slowly but surely nudged out french as the most common language spoken in brussels .
language as culture bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : few children these days learn another langauge minority languages , meanwhile , barely get a look in , says anna zaborska .
" my impression is that minority languages are not adequately protected ; " she said .
" they need to be cultivated .
the eu needs to protect european cultures and culture is expressed in music , cuisine - and languages . "
but too many people are happy simply to resort to english .
why should a pole bother wrestling with german , or a spaniard tackle finnish when everyone can get along nicely speaking the universal language , english ? it 's a mentality that bernd posselt resists .
he says the result is a globalized pidgin english - a far cry from the language of shakespeare . " if the other nationalities do n't join forces to prevent this development , this is all we will be left with , " he predicts . dw staff -lrb- jp -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

car industry disappointed but it was met with dismay by auto lobbies and politicians , with the association of european car manufacturers , acea , saying that the committee had " given the wrong signal " and " missed the opportunity to shape a realistic framework " for development .
guenther beckstein , conservative premier of the german state of bavaria , which is home to major manufacturers bmw and audi , said in a statement that " the anti-industry decision by the socialist majority in the committee endangers thousands of jobs -lrb- and -rrb- must be corrected " by the full parliament and the council of eu states .
the committee decided that car makers selling their vehicles in the eu should ensure that the average co2 emissions of the cars they sell are no more than 120 grams per kilometer -lrb- g / km -rrb- in 2012 .
penalties for non-compliance should start at 20 euros -lrb- $ 29.30 -rrb- per car sold and per g / km over the limit in 2012 , and rise to 95 euros per g / km in 2015 , they said .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the eu has pledged to further cut its co2 emissions by 2020 and the eu should bring in a further target of 95 g / km by 2020 , they decided .
initial proposals less strict ahead of the meeting , committee members had been widely expected to back a compromise proposal capping penalties at 50 euros per g / km and ruling that only the most efficient 70 percent of cars should be covered in the first years of the scheme .
environmental groups had slammed the compromise as both delaying and drastically weakening the original proposals from the european commission , the eu 's executive body .
" the cumulative effect of the loopholes outlined below would be no mandated emissions reductions by 2012 , the date of the official eu target , " greenpeace , t & e and friends of the earth said in a joint statement ahead of the vote .
unexpected win for the environment but on the day , the committee voted down both of those amendments in what observers see as a severe blow to the automobile industry .

poland and ukraine were given the reprieve after uefa 's executive committee met in bordeaux to discuss a progress report on preparations for the tournament .
" the executive committee reconfirmed uefa 's commitment to organize euro 2012 in poland and ukraine , " uefa president michel platini told a news conference in bordeaux .
" at the same time , the committee stressed a number of conditions must be met in order to bring forward the whole project . "
platini said the co-hosts " promised " that stadiums in kiev and warsaw would be ready in time .
poland football chief doubts poland 's readiness bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : uefa president michel platini insists poland and ukraine must speed up euro preparations inadequate stadiums , problems with transport systems and not enough hotel beds had given rise to serious concerns and pushed uefa into a corner .
several contingency plans had been touted prior to friday 's meeting , such as using germany as a third , supporting host , or - as the president of the polish soccer association , michal listkiewicz , suggested - that poland and ukraine 's 2012 hosting rights be rescinded in favor of another country , and that the two nations instead plan to host the tournament in 2016 .
listkiewicz seems far from convinced his country will be ready in four years time .
the biggest problem : poor infrastructure and terrible traffic , he said .
" if the european championships took place in 2016 , we would have no problems about being ready then , " listkiewicz told die zeit online , the internet platform of the weekly newspaper .
" but realistically we are looking at having no good roads in time for 2012 , " he said .

this is not like in austria and switzerland where everything lies close together . "
moreover , he cast doubt on whether poland 's partners in ukraine will be up to the job .
" if things do n't go well now , and uefa has another suggestion , then that would be in order , " he said .

austria 's voters appear to be fed up with rising inflation -lrb- at 3.9 percent , a 15-year high -rrb- , poor integration of the country 's large immigrant population , and the inability of the current government to do much about either .
the combined poll numbers of austria 's two far right-parties , the freedom party and the alliance for austria 's future are hovering around 25 percent .
that would represent the best draw for the austrian far-right since 1999 , when then-freedom party -lrb- and now alliance -rrb- leader jörg haider stunned europe by garnering 27 percent .
such a tally might well leave austria 's neighbors aghast , but one pollster , andreas kirchhofer of imas , told news agency reuters that austrians may be casting their votes against their current leaders more than for the rightists .
" they are fed up with the left-right coalition , " he said .
" they want another kind of government , but they do n't really know exactly what that should look like . " not-so-grand coalition the country 's ruling grand coalition of the center-left social democrats -lrb- spö -rrb- and center-right austrian people 's party -lrb- övp -rrb- has had a rough ride in its less than two years in power . the people 's party , stunned to have drawn less votes than the social democrats in 2006 , have never really taken to their junior partner role , preferring to stave off major leftward policy shifts and bide their time rather than engage with the spö .
luckily for the people 's party , the social democrats have had myriad problems of their own .
the man who took office as chancellor following the last elections , alfred gusenbauer , has not proven an effective leader .
prone to gaffes and unable to marshal public support for controversial policies such as the institution of public service in place of university fees , gusenbauer lost his post as spö party leader to werner faymann in june of this year .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : austria 's social democrats are pinning their hopes on new party leader faymann to pull them out of a slump faymann , for his part , promptly reversed his party 's long-standing position not to hold a referendum on europe .
in a letter to the populist , anti-eu tabloid kronen zeitung , faymann said his party now wanted one . with the social democrats in seeming disarray , their conservative coalition partners in the övp called a snap election in july .
but worsening economic conditions in the months since , along with some shrewd maneuvering from the far right , mean the övp may come to regret the decision . the övp currently trails the spö in opinion polls , and while they both enjoy comfortable leads over fringe parties , the two big parties ' combined total looks set to dip below 60 percent for the first time since world war ii .
as an editorial in the conservative newspaper die presse recently had it , " the only thing that 's clear is that the ' winner ' will also be a loser , because the voters want to punish them . "
the winner in all this is likely to be the far right .
right man at the right time ?
the new face of austria 's far right is heinz-christian strache .
while he may lack the charisma of his predecessor jörg haider , strache has clearly learned from him .
since breaking with the freedom party in 2005 , haider 's star has waned and strache 's has grown - mostly by emulating haider .
strache ran a campaign in viennese elections with posters featuring slogans like " vienna must not become istanbul ! " , a more strident take on haider 's old " vienna must not become chicago ! " poster by targeting voters ' cultural fears directly , not just through the guise of crime .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : it seems not everyone in austria is enamored by the far right strache may also have benefitted from his youth .
the haider formula always traded on the man 's relative vitality - physical fitness , sharp dress , sun tan .
strache has all of these traits , and as a trained dental technician , he can also claim brilliantly white teeth .
and such a package may be a bit more convincing in the 39-year old strache than in haider , now 59 .
the similarity has not gone unnoticed .
haider himself runs advertisements touting himself as " the original , " and övp party leader wilhelm molderer snapped in a recent television debate that strachen was " just a poor copy of jörg haider in the ' 80s . "
a stinging remark , but perhaps a backhanded compliment as well .
after all , jörg haider in the 80 's was a rousing success .
in his first election in charge in 1986 , haider helped double the party 's returns from 1983 to almost 10 percent , and by 1999 had taken it up to 27 percent . dw staff -lrb- mrh -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

"
despite supporting the building of mosques , the bishops said muslim communities should try to consider local residents when seeking to establish places of worship .
the bishops were meeting as part of their annual autumn plenary assembly in the city of fulda , hesse .
the assembly went on to condemn any attempts , political or not , to arouse an anti-islamic sentiment within germany .
" criticism is permitted , agitation is not , " stressed the chairman of the assembly , archbishop robert zollitsch .
he said the matter came down to the right to freedom of worship , but added that mosque designs should be adapted to their surroundings and should try to meet the " justifiable concerns " of neighbours .

the pledges totalled $ 16 billion -lrb- 10.9 billion euros -rrb- according to an initial un estimate , including more than $ 3 billion to eradicate malaria , $ 2 billion to tackle an ongoing food crisis and $ 4.5 billion for educational programs .

the conference was held as the us congress was stalled in talks over a massive $ 700-billion bailout of the us financial industry .
leaders in new york were hounded with questions about the crisis at nearly every aid initiative that was launched .

26 , was greeted with delight by environmental groups , with greenpeace praising the parliament 's environment committee for " warding off disaster " and brussels-based group transport and environment -lrb- t & e -rrb- saying that parliamentarians had " stood up to enormous pressure " from lobbyists .
car industry disappointed but it was met with dismay by auto lobbies and politicians , with the association of european car manufacturers , acea , saying that the committee had " given the wrong signal " and " missed the opportunity to shape a realistic framework " for development .
guenther beckstein , conservative premier of the german state of bavaria , which is home to major manufacturers bmw and audi , said in a statement that " the anti-industry decision by the socialist majority in the committee endangers thousands of jobs -lrb- and -rrb- must be corrected " by the full parliament and the council of eu states .
the committee decided that car makers selling their vehicles in the eu should ensure that the average co2 emissions of the cars they sell are no more than 120 grams per kilometer -lrb- g / km -rrb- in 2012 .
penalties for non-compliance should start at 20 euros -lrb- $ 29.30 -rrb- per car sold and per g / km over the limit in 2012 , and rise to 95 euros per g / km in 2015 , they said .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the eu has pledged to further cut its co2 emissions by 2020 and the eu should bring in a further target of 95 g / km by 2020 , they decided .
initial proposals less strict ahead of the meeting , committee members had been widely expected to back a compromise proposal capping penalties at 50 euros per g / km and ruling that only the most efficient 70 percent of cars should be covered in the first years of the scheme .
environmental groups had slammed the compromise as both delaying and drastically weakening the original proposals from the european commission , the eu 's executive body .
" the cumulative effect of the loopholes outlined below would be no mandated emissions reductions by 2012 , the date of the official eu target , " greenpeace , t & e and friends of the earth said in a joint statement ahead of the vote .
unexpected win for the environment but on the day , the committee voted down both of those amendments in what observers see as a severe blow to the automobile industry .
" climate triumphs over car industry ! " the gue-ngl left-wing group of the parliament declared in a statement .
the proposed law is now set to go to the parliament 's plenary session on oct .
20-23 and to the council of eu member states , with experts saying that it is likely to face another intense lobbying battle before final acceptance .
co2 is the gas most closely linked with global warming , and experts estimate that cars alone account for 14 percent of all eu co2 emissions .
the eu has pledged to cut its total co2 emissions to at least 20 percent below 1990 levels by 2020 . dpa news agency -lrb- ls -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

austria 's voters appear to be fed up with rising inflation -lrb- at 3.9 percent , a 15-year high -rrb- , poor integration of the country 's large immigrant population , and the inability of the current government to do much about either .
the combined poll numbers of austria 's two far right-parties , the freedom party and the alliance for austria 's future are hovering around 25 percent .
that would represent the best draw for the austrian far-right since 1999 , when then-freedom party -lrb- and now alliance -rrb- leader jörg haider stunned europe by garnering 27 percent .
such a tally might well leave austria 's neighbors aghast , but one pollster , andreas kirchhofer of imas , told news agency reuters that austrians may be casting their votes against their current leaders more than for the rightists .
" they are fed up with the left-right coalition , " he said .
" they want another kind of government , but they do n't really know exactly what that should look like . " not-so-grand coalition the country 's ruling grand coalition of the center-left social democrats -lrb- spö -rrb- and center-right austrian people 's party -lrb- övp -rrb- has had a rough ride in its less than two years in power . the people 's party , stunned to have drawn less votes than the social democrats in 2006 , have never really taken to their junior partner role , preferring to stave off major leftward policy shifts and bide their time rather than engage with the spö .
luckily for the people 's party , the social democrats have had myriad problems of their own .
the man who took office as chancellor following the last elections , alfred gusenbauer , has not proven an effective leader .
prone to gaffes and unable to marshal public support for controversial policies such as the institution of public service in place of university fees , gusenbauer lost his post as spö party leader to werner faymann in june of this year .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : austria 's social democrats are pinning their hopes on new party leader faymann to pull them out of a slump faymann , for his part , promptly reversed his party 's long-standing position not to hold a referendum on europe .
in a letter to the populist , anti-eu tabloid kronen zeitung , faymann said his party now wanted one . with the social democrats in seeming disarray , their conservative coalition partners in the övp called a snap election in july .
but worsening economic conditions in the months since , along with some shrewd maneuvering from the far right , mean the övp may come to regret the decision . the övp currently trails the spö in opinion polls , and while they both enjoy comfortable leads over fringe parties , the two big parties ' combined total looks set to dip below 60 percent for the first time since world war ii .
as an editorial in the conservative newspaper die presse recently had it , " the only thing that 's clear is that the ' winner ' will also be a loser , because the voters want to punish them . "
the winner in all this is likely to be the far right .
right man at the right time ?
the new face of austria 's far right is heinz-christian strache .
while he may lack the charisma of his predecessor jörg haider , strache has clearly learned from him .
since breaking with the freedom party in 2005 , haider 's star has waned and strache 's has grown - mostly by emulating haider .
strache ran a campaign in viennese elections with posters featuring slogans like " vienna must not become istanbul ! " , a more strident take on haider 's old " vienna must not become chicago ! " poster by targeting voters ' cultural fears directly , not just through the guise of crime .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : it seems not everyone in austria is enamored by the far right strache may also have benefitted from his youth .
the haider formula always traded on the man 's relative vitality - physical fitness , sharp dress , sun tan .
strache has all of these traits , and as a trained dental technician , he can also claim brilliantly white teeth .
and such a package may be a bit more convincing in the 39-year old strache than in haider , now 59 .
the similarity has not gone unnoticed .
haider himself runs advertisements touting himself as " the original , " and övp party leader wilhelm molderer snapped in a recent television debate that strachen was " just a poor copy of jörg haider in the ' 80s . "
a stinging remark , but perhaps a backhanded compliment as well .
after all , jörg haider in the 80 's was a rousing success .
in his first election in charge in 1986 , haider helped double the party 's returns from 1983 to almost 10 percent , and by 1999 had taken it up to 27 percent . dw staff -lrb- mrh -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

austria 's voters appear to be fed up with rising inflation -lrb- at 3.9 percent , a 15-year high -rrb- , poor integration of the country 's large immigrant population , and the inability of the current government to do much about either .
the combined poll numbers of austria 's two far right-parties , the freedom party and the alliance for austria 's future are hovering around 25 percent .
that would represent the best draw for the austrian far-right since 1999 , when then-freedom party -lrb- and now alliance -rrb- leader jörg haider stunned europe by garnering 27 percent .
such a tally might well leave austria 's neighbors aghast , but one pollster , andreas kirchhofer of imas , told news agency reuters that austrians may be casting their votes against their current leaders more than for the rightists .
" they are fed up with the left-right coalition , " he said .
" they want another kind of government , but they do n't really know exactly what that should look like . " not-so-grand coalition the country 's ruling grand coalition of the center-left social democrats -lrb- spö -rrb- and center-right austrian people 's party -lrb- övp -rrb- has had a rough ride in its less than two years in power . the people 's party , stunned to have drawn less votes than the social democrats in 2006 , have never really taken to their junior partner role , preferring to stave off major leftward policy shifts and bide their time rather than engage with the spö .
luckily for the people 's party , the social democrats have had myriad problems of their own .
the man who took office as chancellor following the last elections , alfred gusenbauer , has not proven an effective leader .
prone to gaffes and unable to marshal public support for controversial policies such as the institution of public service in place of university fees , gusenbauer lost his post as spö party leader to werner faymann in june of this year .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : austria 's social democrats are pinning their hopes on new party leader faymann to pull them out of a slump faymann , for his part , promptly reversed his party 's long-standing position not to hold a referendum on europe .
in a letter to the populist , anti-eu tabloid kronen zeitung , faymann said his party now wanted one . with the social democrats in seeming disarray , their conservative coalition partners in the övp called a snap election in july .
but worsening economic conditions in the months since , along with some shrewd maneuvering from the far right , mean the övp may come to regret the decision . the övp currently trails the spö in opinion polls , and while they both enjoy comfortable leads over fringe parties , the two big parties ' combined total looks set to dip below 60 percent for the first time since world war ii .
as an editorial in the conservative newspaper die presse recently had it , " the only thing that 's clear is that the ' winner ' will also be a loser , because the voters want to punish them . "
the winner in all this is likely to be the far right .
right man at the right time ?
the new face of austria 's far right is heinz-christian strache .
while he may lack the charisma of his predecessor jörg haider , strache has clearly learned from him .
since breaking with the freedom party in 2005 , haider 's star has waned and strache 's has grown - mostly by emulating haider .
strache ran a campaign in viennese elections with posters featuring slogans like " vienna must not become istanbul ! " , a more strident take on haider 's old " vienna must not become chicago ! " poster by targeting voters ' cultural fears directly , not just through the guise of crime .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : it seems not everyone in austria is enamored by the far right strache may also have benefitted from his youth .
the haider formula always traded on the man 's relative vitality - physical fitness , sharp dress , sun tan .
strache has all of these traits , and as a trained dental technician , he can also claim brilliantly white teeth .
and such a package may be a bit more convincing in the 39-year old strache than in haider , now 59 .
the similarity has not gone unnoticed .
haider himself runs advertisements touting himself as " the original , " and övp party leader wilhelm molderer snapped in a recent television debate that strachen was " just a poor copy of jörg haider in the ' 80s . "
a stinging remark , but perhaps a backhanded compliment as well .
after all , jörg haider in the 80 's was a rousing success .
in his first election in charge in 1986 , haider helped double the party 's returns from 1983 to almost 10 percent , and by 1999 had taken it up to 27 percent . dw staff -lrb- mrh -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de politics -pipe- 26.09.2008 disenchanted austrian voters could turn to far right großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the new face of austria 's far right christian strache , right , is drawing voters fed up with government bickering and growing economic uncertainty , austrian voters could hand the far right big gains in general elections on sunday . if opinion polls prove correct , the austrian far-right may notch large gains in general elections on sunday , sept 28 .
austria 's voters appear to be fed up with rising inflation -lrb- at 3.9 percent , a 15-year high -rrb- , poor integration of the country 's large immigrant population , and the inability of the current government to do much about either .
the combined poll numbers of austria 's two far right-parties , the freedom party and the alliance for austria 's future are hovering around 25 percent .
that would represent the best draw for the austrian far-right since 1999 , when then-freedom party -lrb- and now alliance -rrb- leader jörg haider stunned europe by garnering 27 percent .
such a tally might well leave austria 's neighbors aghast , but one pollster , andreas kirchhofer of imas , told news agency reuters that austrians may be casting their votes against their current leaders more than for the rightists .
" they are fed up with the left-right coalition , " he said .
" they want another kind of government , but they do n't really know exactly what that should look like . " not-so-grand coalition the country 's ruling grand coalition of the center-left social democrats -lrb- spö -rrb- and center-right austrian people 's party -lrb- övp -rrb- has had a rough ride in its less than two years in power . the people 's party , stunned to have drawn less votes than the social democrats in 2006 , have never really taken to their junior partner role , preferring to stave off major leftward policy shifts and bide their time rather than engage with the spö .
luckily for the people 's party , the social democrats have had myriad problems of their own .
the man who took office as chancellor following the last elections , alfred gusenbauer , has not proven an effective leader .
prone to gaffes and unable to marshal public support for controversial policies such as the institution of public service in place of university fees , gusenbauer lost his post as spö party leader to werner faymann in june of this year .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : austria 's social democrats are pinning their hopes on new party leader faymann to pull them out of a slump faymann , for his part , promptly reversed his party 's long-standing position not to hold a referendum on europe .
in a letter to the populist , anti-eu tabloid kronen zeitung , faymann said his party now wanted one . with the social democrats in seeming disarray , their conservative coalition partners in the övp called a snap election in july .
but worsening economic conditions in the months since , along with some shrewd maneuvering from the far right , mean the övp may come to regret the decision . the övp currently trails the spö in opinion polls , and while they both enjoy comfortable leads over fringe parties , the two big parties ' combined total looks set to dip below 60 percent for the first time since world war ii .
as an editorial in the conservative newspaper die presse recently had it , " the only thing that 's clear is that the ' winner ' will also be a loser , because the voters want to punish them . "
the winner in all this is likely to be the far right .
right man at the right time ?
the new face of austria 's far right is heinz-christian strache .

austria 's voters appear to be fed up with rising inflation -lrb- at 3.9 percent , a 15-year high -rrb- , poor integration of the country 's large immigrant population , and the inability of the current government to do much about either .
the combined poll numbers of austria 's two far right-parties , the freedom party and the alliance for austria 's future are hovering around 25 percent .
that would represent the best draw for the austrian far-right since 1999 , when then-freedom party -lrb- and now alliance -rrb- leader jörg haider stunned europe by garnering 27 percent .
such a tally might well leave austria 's neighbors aghast , but one pollster , andreas kirchhofer of imas , told news agency reuters that austrians may be casting their votes against their current leaders more than for the rightists .

poland and ukraine were given the reprieve after uefa 's executive committee met in bordeaux to discuss a progress report on preparations for the tournament .
" the executive committee reconfirmed uefa 's commitment to organize euro 2012 in poland and ukraine , " uefa president michel platini told a news conference in bordeaux .

listkiewicz seems far from convinced his country will be ready in four years time .
the biggest problem : poor infrastructure and terrible traffic , he said .
" if the european championships took place in 2016 , we would have no problems about being ready then , " listkiewicz told die zeit online , the internet platform of the weekly newspaper .

3 in muenster , germany .
zabel is one of germany 's most accomplished cyclists , with more than 200 professional career wins including 12 tour de france stages .
he wore the final sprinters ' green jersey at the tour de france a record six consecutive years between 1996 and 2001 , and was a four-time winner of the milan-san remo spring classic .
tainted memory of zabel ?
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : zabel was highly emotional when admitting to using performance enhancing drugs in may 2007 , zabel confessed that he had taken the blood-booster erythropoietin -lrb- epo -rrb- while training for the 1996 tour de france and while cycling for germany 's team telekom .
epo increases the production of red blood cells , thereby allowing an athlete 's blood to deliver oxygen to muscles more efficiently .
" i used it as a test and ended it after one week because i had problems with the side-effects , " said zabel last year .
" since then , for the past eleven years , i have always denied doping .
i lied , and i apologize for this , " zabel had said at a tearful press conference .
speculation was rife as to whether zabel would be dumped by milram amid the doping revelations , but the professional cycling team ultimately honored the racer 's three-year contract through to this year 's end .
mass doping revelations zabel 's confession last may came after several similar admissions from other riders and two doctors from germany 's most successful riding team .
university doctors andreas schmid and lothar heinrich admitted to epo blood doping in the mid-1990s at team telekom .
zabel was a team-mate of bjarne riis , who also admitted to using epo during his 1996 tour de france win . dw staff -lrb- dm -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

car industry disappointed but it was met with dismay by auto lobbies and politicians , with the association of european car manufacturers , acea , saying that the committee had " given the wrong signal " and " missed the opportunity to shape a realistic framework " for development .
guenther beckstein , conservative premier of the german state of bavaria , which is home to major manufacturers bmw and audi , said in a statement that " the anti-industry decision by the socialist majority in the committee endangers thousands of jobs -lrb- and -rrb- must be corrected " by the full parliament and the council of eu states .
the committee decided that car makers selling their vehicles in the eu should ensure that the average co2 emissions of the cars they sell are no more than 120 grams per kilometer -lrb- g / km -rrb- in 2012 .
penalties for non-compliance should start at 20 euros -lrb- $ 29.30 -rrb- per car sold and per g / km over the limit in 2012 , and rise to 95 euros per g / km in 2015 , they said .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the eu has pledged to further cut its co2 emissions by 2020 and the eu should bring in a further target of 95 g / km by 2020 , they decided .
initial proposals less strict ahead of the meeting , committee members had been widely expected to back a compromise proposal capping penalties at 50 euros per g / km and ruling that only the most efficient 70 percent of cars should be covered in the first years of the scheme .
environmental groups had slammed the compromise as both delaying and drastically weakening the original proposals from the european commission , the eu 's executive body .
" the cumulative effect of the loopholes outlined below would be no mandated emissions reductions by 2012 , the date of the official eu target , " greenpeace , t & e and friends of the earth said in a joint statement ahead of the vote .
unexpected win for the environment but on the day , the committee voted down both of those amendments in what observers see as a severe blow to the automobile industry .
" climate triumphs over car industry ! " the gue-ngl left-wing group of the parliament declared in a statement .
the proposed law is now set to go to the parliament 's plenary session on oct .
20-23 and to the council of eu member states , with experts saying that it is likely to face another intense lobbying battle before final acceptance .
co2 is the gas most closely linked with global warming , and experts estimate that cars alone account for 14 percent of all eu co2 emissions .

car industry disappointed but it was met with dismay by auto lobbies and politicians , with the association of european car manufacturers , acea , saying that the committee had " given the wrong signal " and " missed the opportunity to shape a realistic framework " for development .
guenther beckstein , conservative premier of the german state of bavaria , which is home to major manufacturers bmw and audi , said in a statement that " the anti-industry decision by the socialist majority in the committee endangers thousands of jobs -lrb- and -rrb- must be corrected " by the full parliament and the council of eu states .

the pledges totalled $ 16 billion -lrb- 10.9 billion euros -rrb- according to an initial un estimate , including more than $ 3 billion to eradicate malaria , $ 2 billion to tackle an ongoing food crisis and $ 4.5 billion for educational programs .
nearly overshadowed by financial crisis fighting for money - and headlines - in light of the financial turmoil of the last few weeks , officials appeared happy with the outcome of the one-day talks .

jeffrey sachs , an economist from colombia university , said it was " preposterous " that industrial nations could not afford to give 0.7 percent of their national budgets to development aid , whether in a time of " boom " or " bust . "
among the commitments made thursday was a more than $ 3-billion initiative unveiled to eradicate malaria by 2015 .
the plan aims to save more than 4.2 million lives , mainly in africa , which has suffered most from the disease .
a $ 4.5-billion education plan aims to bring 15 million children to school over the next three years and achieve universal primary education by 2015 - one of seven millenium development goals .
us billionaires open their wallets microsoft founder bill gates and howard g. buffett , son of billionaire investor warren buffett , whose foundations provide hundreds of millions of dollars to global program fighting poverty and diseases , were present at the un meetings to answer calls for generosity .

the billionaires offered $ 76 million dollars to the world food program to assist some 350,000 farmers in 21 developing countries over the next five years .
the united states committed $ 61 million dollars to a similar program .
chinese premier wen jiabao said that development should be the top priority of all governments .
he announced new debt-forgiveness plans and pledged $ 30 million dollars and 1,000 experts to help poorer countries grow their own food .
the european union offered an additional $ 730 million over the next three years to help address a surge in food prices .
other commitments involved addressing climate change and promoting gender equality .
but brown and others warned that despite some progress being made on education and combatting diseases like aids and malaria , many of the un 's targets were still falling flat .
norwegian prime minister jens stoltenberg said he had " hardly seen any progress at all " on cutting maternal mortality rates .

it included no new sanctions . steinmeier said that he was relieved that the group of five permanent security council powers plus germany had remained united over the iran issue .
western powers had feared that russia would withdraw its support after cancelling a meeting on thursday . without such unity , steinmeier said , pressure on iran could not be maintained , adding that the draft resolution would likely be approved by the council on saturday .
he was speaking on the sidelines of a un assembly meeting in new york .
the resolution " reaffirms " existing sanctions that have been placed on iran over its refusal to comply with security council demands to halt uranium enrichment , a process that can be used to build nuclear weapons .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : russia is reluctant to impose further sanctions on tehran no new sanctions against iran have been put forward something the united states , france and britain had been pushing for this week .
in an interview with ruters news agency , us secretary of state condoleeza rice said the six nations wanted to show they stood together in confronting tehran over its nuclear program .
" i think it 's also especially important that the iranians recognize that the p5 plus 1 process is intact , " said rice , referring to the five security council members and germany .
she said she did not know whether major powers would agree on a fourth sanctions resolution against iran by the end of the bush administration .
three sanctions resolutions against iran have already been passed by the 15-nation council .
a report by the un-backed international atomic energy agency -lrb- iaea -rrb- last week said iran had expanded uranium enrichment activities and was not fully cooperating with the agency 's investigation .
rice scolds security council bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : iranian president mahmoud ahmadinejad was sharply criticized by rice meanwhile , rice chided the council for not focussing on what she said were the biggest threats to international peace during a security council meeting on israeli settlements in the palestinian territories .
the us had expected the security council to address iranian president mahmoud ahmadinejad 's call for the " destruction " of israel during a speech before the general assembly on tuesday , she said .
" when this council decides what really needs to be taken up as a threat to international peace and security , that to me makes the top of the list , " rice said .
western suspicions linger western countries suspect iran is seeking the capability to develop nuclear weapons , while tehran maintains its program is solely for producing civilian nuclear energy .
british foreign secretary david miliband said that despite the failure to reach an agreement on new sanctions , the resolution was designed " to affirm our unity , to rally international support " for an ongoing carrot-and-stick approach against iran , which involves offering economic incentives if it halts its program and leaves open more sanctions if it continues . dw staff -lrb- dm / jg -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

-lrb- 11.08.2008 -rrb- west renews sanctions threat in iran nuclear standoff iran 's refusal to halt nuclear work and respond to a new package of western incentives has led to the us and britain threatening un sanctions unless tehran gives an " unambigious and positive " answer by tuesday .
-lrb- 04.08.2008 -rrb- germany urges iran to stop playing for time in nuclear standoff iran must stop " dallying " and give a " clear answer " to initiatives offered by six western world powers in the standoff over tehran 's nuclear program , german foreign minister steinmeier said in an interview .

western powers had feared that russia would withdraw its support after cancelling a meeting on thursday . without such unity , steinmeier said , pressure on iran could not be maintained , adding that the draft resolution would likely be approved by the council on saturday .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de european union -pipe- 26.09.2008 day of european languages reveals differences , not diversity großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : not many in europe learn a second language , let alone a third september 26 is european day of languages .
but what should be a celebration of multi-lingualism in fact highlights a failure in language-learning across the bloc and a lack of attention on minority languages . when the council of europe and the european commission designated september 26 european day of languages , it was hoped that the initiative would stress the importance of language learning and increase intercultural understanding .
but the reality is that in 2008 , only a minority of the public actually learn a second language , let alone a third .
slovakian member of the european parliament anna zaborska believes that europeans fail to appreciate the linguistic diversity of the continent .
" i strongly feel that multi-lingualism is one of the eu 's hidden treasures , " she said .
minority complaints bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : english , french and german are the main langauges spoken at eu headquarters other meps are angry at what they see as the commission 's failure to set out concrete initiatives to promote minority languages in its new , much-touted multilingualism strategy . among those criticizing a lack of funding for languages and specific new programs are basque mep mikel irujo , jill evans of welsh party plaid cymru and transylvanian independent lászló tőkés .
speaking at a press conference earlier this week , they complained that the commission was not doing " more to promote minority languages at eu level " as well as " those languages that do not yet have official status , " with evans in particular repeating previous demands for welsh to become a fully-fledged eu language expensive and time-consuming meps are , in fact , actively encouraged to speak their mother tongue when parliament is in session .
the eu recognizes 23 languages , and employs legions of translators and interpreters to help communication .
it 's an expensive and time-consuming luxury , but according to german mep bernd posselt , multi-lingualism is an essential element of the eu 's democratic structure .
" the european parliament would never be accepted by voters if the electorate were unable to hear candidates talking in their own language , " he points out .
in practice , however , not all languages are equal .
officially , the eu institutions ' working languages are french , english and german .
but german is used infrequently , while english has slowly but surely nudged out french as the most common language spoken in brussels .
language as culture bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : few children these days learn another langauge minority languages , meanwhile , barely get a look in , says anna zaborska .
" my impression is that minority languages are not adequately protected ; " she said .
" they need to be cultivated .
the eu needs to protect european cultures and culture is expressed in music , cuisine - and languages . "
but too many people are happy simply to resort to english .
why should a pole bother wrestling with german , or a spaniard tackle finnish when everyone can get along nicely speaking the universal language , english ? it 's a mentality that bernd posselt resists .
he says the result is a globalized pidgin english - a far cry from the language of shakespeare . " if the other nationalities do n't join forces to prevent this development , this is all we will be left with , " he predicts . dw staff -lrb- jp -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

3 in muenster , germany .
zabel is one of germany 's most accomplished cyclists , with more than 200 professional career wins including 12 tour de france stages .
he wore the final sprinters ' green jersey at the tour de france a record six consecutive years between 1996 and 2001 , and was a four-time winner of the milan-san remo spring classic .
tainted memory of zabel ?
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : zabel was highly emotional when admitting to using performance enhancing drugs in may 2007 , zabel confessed that he had taken the blood-booster erythropoietin -lrb- epo -rrb- while training for the 1996 tour de france and while cycling for germany 's team telekom .
epo increases the production of red blood cells , thereby allowing an athlete 's blood to deliver oxygen to muscles more efficiently .
" i used it as a test and ended it after one week because i had problems with the side-effects , " said zabel last year .
" since then , for the past eleven years , i have always denied doping .
i lied , and i apologize for this , " zabel had said at a tearful press conference .
speculation was rife as to whether zabel would be dumped by milram amid the doping revelations , but the professional cycling team ultimately honored the racer 's three-year contract through to this year 's end .
mass doping revelations zabel 's confession last may came after several similar admissions from other riders and two doctors from germany 's most successful riding team .
university doctors andreas schmid and lothar heinrich admitted to epo blood doping in the mid-1990s at team telekom .
zabel was a team-mate of bjarne riis , who also admitted to using epo during his 1996 tour de france win . dw staff -lrb- dm -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

poland and ukraine were given the reprieve after uefa 's executive committee met in bordeaux to discuss a progress report on preparations for the tournament .
" the executive committee reconfirmed uefa 's commitment to organize euro 2012 in poland and ukraine , " uefa president michel platini told a news conference in bordeaux .
" at the same time , the committee stressed a number of conditions must be met in order to bring forward the whole project . "
platini said the co-hosts " promised " that stadiums in kiev and warsaw would be ready in time .

listkiewicz seems far from convinced his country will be ready in four years time .
the biggest problem : poor infrastructure and terrible traffic , he said .
" if the european championships took place in 2016 , we would have no problems about being ready then , " listkiewicz told die zeit online , the internet platform of the weekly newspaper .

moreover , he cast doubt on whether poland 's partners in ukraine will be up to the job .

zabel is one of germany 's most accomplished cyclists , with more than 200 professional career wins including 12 tour de france stages .
he wore the final sprinters ' green jersey at the tour de france a record six consecutive years between 1996 and 2001 , and was a four-time winner of the milan-san remo spring classic .
tainted memory of zabel ?
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : zabel was highly emotional when admitting to using performance enhancing drugs in may 2007 , zabel confessed that he had taken the blood-booster erythropoietin -lrb- epo -rrb- while training for the 1996 tour de france and while cycling for germany 's team telekom .
epo increases the production of red blood cells , thereby allowing an athlete 's blood to deliver oxygen to muscles more efficiently .
" i used it as a test and ended it after one week because i had problems with the side-effects , " said zabel last year .
" since then , for the past eleven years , i have always denied doping .
i lied , and i apologize for this , " zabel had said at a tearful press conference .
speculation was rife as to whether zabel would be dumped by milram amid the doping revelations , but the professional cycling team ultimately honored the racer 's three-year contract through to this year 's end .
mass doping revelations zabel 's confession last may came after several similar admissions from other riders and two doctors from germany 's most successful riding team .
university doctors andreas schmid and lothar heinrich admitted to epo blood doping in the mid-1990s at team telekom .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de diplomacy -pipe- 26.09.2008 german foreign minister welcomes iran resolution großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : steinmeier spoke at the un general assembly on friday german foreign affairs minister frank-walter steinmeier has lauded the draft resolution over iran 's nuclear program agreed by the world 's major powers on friday .
it included no new sanctions . steinmeier said that he was relieved that the group of five permanent security council powers plus germany had remained united over the iran issue .
western powers had feared that russia would withdraw its support after cancelling a meeting on thursday . without such unity , steinmeier said , pressure on iran could not be maintained , adding that the draft resolution would likely be approved by the council on saturday .
he was speaking on the sidelines of a un assembly meeting in new york .
the resolution " reaffirms " existing sanctions that have been placed on iran over its refusal to comply with security council demands to halt uranium enrichment , a process that can be used to build nuclear weapons .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : russia is reluctant to impose further sanctions on tehran no new sanctions against iran have been put forward something the united states , france and britain had been pushing for this week .
in an interview with ruters news agency , us secretary of state condoleeza rice said the six nations wanted to show they stood together in confronting tehran over its nuclear program .
" i think it 's also especially important that the iranians recognize that the p5 plus 1 process is intact , " said rice , referring to the five security council members and germany .
she said she did not know whether major powers would agree on a fourth sanctions resolution against iran by the end of the bush administration .
three sanctions resolutions against iran have already been passed by the 15-nation council .
a report by the un-backed international atomic energy agency -lrb- iaea -rrb- last week said iran had expanded uranium enrichment activities and was not fully cooperating with the agency 's investigation .
rice scolds security council bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : iranian president mahmoud ahmadinejad was sharply criticized by rice meanwhile , rice chided the council for not focussing on what she said were the biggest threats to international peace during a security council meeting on israeli settlements in the palestinian territories .
the us had expected the security council to address iranian president mahmoud ahmadinejad 's call for the " destruction " of israel during a speech before the general assembly on tuesday , she said .
" when this council decides what really needs to be taken up as a threat to international peace and security , that to me makes the top of the list , " rice said .
western suspicions linger western countries suspect iran is seeking the capability to develop nuclear weapons , while tehran maintains its program is solely for producing civilian nuclear energy .
british foreign secretary david miliband said that despite the failure to reach an agreement on new sanctions , the resolution was designed " to affirm our unity , to rally international support " for an ongoing carrot-and-stick approach against iran , which involves offering economic incentives if it halts its program and leaves open more sanctions if it continues . dw staff -lrb- dm / jg -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

car industry disappointed but it was met with dismay by auto lobbies and politicians , with the association of european car manufacturers , acea , saying that the committee had " given the wrong signal " and " missed the opportunity to shape a realistic framework " for development .
guenther beckstein , conservative premier of the german state of bavaria , which is home to major manufacturers bmw and audi , said in a statement that " the anti-industry decision by the socialist majority in the committee endangers thousands of jobs -lrb- and -rrb- must be corrected " by the full parliament and the council of eu states .
the committee decided that car makers selling their vehicles in the eu should ensure that the average co2 emissions of the cars they sell are no more than 120 grams per kilometer -lrb- g / km -rrb- in 2012 .
penalties for non-compliance should start at 20 euros -lrb- $ 29.30 -rrb- per car sold and per g / km over the limit in 2012 , and rise to 95 euros per g / km in 2015 , they said .

environmental groups had slammed the compromise as both delaying and drastically weakening the original proposals from the european commission , the eu 's executive body .
" the cumulative effect of the loopholes outlined below would be no mandated emissions reductions by 2012 , the date of the official eu target , " greenpeace , t & e and friends of the earth said in a joint statement ahead of the vote .

laissez-faire is done with , said french and current eu president nicolas sarkozy . in what was officially the largest-ever us bank failure , washington mutual 's business has been shut down after the bank collapsed , with customers pulling more than $ 16 billion -lrb- 10.9 billion euros -rrb- from their accounts . those accounts have been gobbled up by jp morgan , thus ensuring that the depositors wo n't lose their money . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the us economy looks down and out , but the euro zone is not faring much better in washington , just hours after congress appeared on the verge of agreement on an emergency rescue plan for the us financial system , a historic white house meeting turned into a bout of bickering and broke up with no formal consensus on the controversial proposal . president george w. bush had invited both presidential candidates , barak obama and john mccain , to take part in an effort to find a consensus on the $ 700-billion plan to prop up the ailing financial system . republicans and democrats , however , are struggling to find middle ground with the former at odds over what would amount to government ownership of collapsed companies , anathema to the center-right advocates of free markets . ireland officially falls into recession while the bickering goes on in washington , the fallout is continuing to be felt in europe .
ireland has become the first member of the 15-member euro zone to fall into recession as a result of the us financial crisis . as in other countries , the domestic property market has taken a hammering and pushed the country into its first recession in 25 years . germany , britain , france and italy are also perilously close to experiencing the same fate . " we expect that italy and germany will also record contractions in their third quarter gross domestic product , following contractions in the second quarter , " said barclays capital analyst julian callow , as reported by afp news agency . a recession is officially defined as two consecutive quarters of no gdp growth . sarkozy : laissez-faire is finished with european leaders scrambling to fend off further disaster , french president nicolas sarkozy has joined the chorus of demands for an overhaul of the financial system . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : french president nicolas sarkozy told the un he wanted an emergency summit speaking in toulon on thursday , sept .
25 , sarkozy said the economic turmoil provoked by crises in the american sub-prime and finance markets had put an end to the free-market economy . " laissez-faire is finished , the all-powerful market that is always right , that 's finished , " he said in a widely anticipated speech , his first in france on the economic crisis .
he called for new rules and regulations and a wide-ranging restructuring of the entire global banking system , saying that the crisis has laid bare serious flaws in the international banking network . with france currently occupying the rotating presidency of the eu , sarkozy said he would " propose initiatives " on these issues at the next eu summit on oct .

it included no new sanctions . steinmeier said that he was relieved that the group of five permanent security council powers plus germany had remained united over the iran issue .
western powers had feared that russia would withdraw its support after cancelling a meeting on thursday . without such unity , steinmeier said , pressure on iran could not be maintained , adding that the draft resolution would likely be approved by the council on saturday .
he was speaking on the sidelines of a un assembly meeting in new york .
the resolution " reaffirms " existing sanctions that have been placed on iran over its refusal to comply with security council demands to halt uranium enrichment , a process that can be used to build nuclear weapons .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : russia is reluctant to impose further sanctions on tehran no new sanctions against iran have been put forward something the united states , france and britain had been pushing for this week .
in an interview with ruters news agency , us secretary of state condoleeza rice said the six nations wanted to show they stood together in confronting tehran over its nuclear program .
" i think it 's also especially important that the iranians recognize that the p5 plus 1 process is intact , " said rice , referring to the five security council members and germany .
she said she did not know whether major powers would agree on a fourth sanctions resolution against iran by the end of the bush administration .
three sanctions resolutions against iran have already been passed by the 15-nation council .
a report by the un-backed international atomic energy agency -lrb- iaea -rrb- last week said iran had expanded uranium enrichment activities and was not fully cooperating with the agency 's investigation .
rice scolds security council bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : iranian president mahmoud ahmadinejad was sharply criticized by rice meanwhile , rice chided the council for not focussing on what she said were the biggest threats to international peace during a security council meeting on israeli settlements in the palestinian territories .
the us had expected the security council to address iranian president mahmoud ahmadinejad 's call for the " destruction " of israel during a speech before the general assembly on tuesday , she said .
" when this council decides what really needs to be taken up as a threat to international peace and security , that to me makes the top of the list , " rice said .
western suspicions linger western countries suspect iran is seeking the capability to develop nuclear weapons , while tehran maintains its program is solely for producing civilian nuclear energy .
british foreign secretary david miliband said that despite the failure to reach an agreement on new sanctions , the resolution was designed " to affirm our unity , to rally international support " for an ongoing carrot-and-stick approach against iran , which involves offering economic incentives if it halts its program and leaves open more sanctions if it continues . dw staff -lrb- dm / jg -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

later , the anpav flight attendants ' union became the fifth of nine unions to sign up to the bailout deal . in response , the italian government decided to let a second deadline lapse in a bid to give the four remaining unions representing alitalia 's workforce a chance still to come on board .
" negotiations continue -lrb- and -rrb- the hands of the clock have been stopped , " a government official told reporters .
two other flight attendants unions said they would spend the weekend mulling whether to accept the rescue package proposed by the private italian consortium , the italian air company -lrb- cai -rrb- .
together , avia and sdl represent some 2,500 air stewards and hostesses .
two unions representing 1,400 pilots were still in talks on friday as the government endeavoured to win unanimous backing for the italian cai investor group deal .
italian labour minister maurizio sacconi told ansa news agency that the deal could , however , go ahead without the agreement of all unions .
unanimous approval " would be important ... but i think cai can pursue its course in any case , " he said .
the issues in dispute range from pay for ground crew and leave , to temporary work contracts .
the italian civil aviation authority had said it would ground alitalia unless a bailout plan had been agreed by thursday , but that threat has not been followed up .
lufthansa chief meets with italian unions lufthansa , which this week moved to take over belgian flag carrier brussels airlines , has frequently been seen as a potential saviour for stumbling alitalia , despite insisting in the past it was not interested .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : italian prime minister silvio berlusconi had pledged to keep alitalia in italian hands officials from the german airline would not comment on its supposed interest in alitalia , but confirmed that mayrhuber was in rome on the italian government 's invitation to discuss the italian flag carrier 's precarious situation , a spokeswoman for lufthansa said in frankfurt .
uil union leader luigi angeletti confirmed mayrhuber had expressed lufthansa 's interest in alitalia during his meeting with union representatives .
industry sources said lufthansa is mulling whether to take a 20 percent stake in alitalia , according to news agency reuters .

"
despite supporting the building of mosques , the bishops said muslim communities should try to consider local residents when seeking to establish places of worship .
the bishops were meeting as part of their annual autumn plenary assembly in the city of fulda , hesse .
the assembly went on to condemn any attempts , political or not , to arouse an anti-islamic sentiment within germany .
" criticism is permitted , agitation is not , " stressed the chairman of the assembly , archbishop robert zollitsch .
he said the matter came down to the right to freedom of worship , but added that mosque designs should be adapted to their surroundings and should try to meet the " justifiable concerns " of neighbours .
far-right seizes on cologne mosque in the western german city of cologne , there has been widespread opposition to a project to build a mosque near a main street with two 55-metre-high minarets .

"
despite supporting the building of mosques , the bishops said muslim communities should try to consider local residents when seeking to establish places of worship .
the bishops were meeting as part of their annual autumn plenary assembly in the city of fulda , hesse .
the assembly went on to condemn any attempts , political or not , to arouse an anti-islamic sentiment within germany .
" criticism is permitted , agitation is not , " stressed the chairman of the assembly , archbishop robert zollitsch .
he said the matter came down to the right to freedom of worship , but added that mosque designs should be adapted to their surroundings and should try to meet the " justifiable concerns " of neighbours .

hart , a priest in beguildy in south powys , is starting a three-and-a-half year prison sentence .
lucy thorpe , of the nspcc warned that people viewing images online " should realise more children get abused in the real world as a result " .
cardiff crown court found hart guilty of possessing almost 57,000 images .
the church in wales also says it is examining clergy records which pre-date the introduction of its child protection policies .
as well as taking his own pictures , the collection of images came from websites in brazil , germany , japan , the uk , the us , denmark , russia and other eastern european countries .
ms thorpe said : " viewing child abuse images on the internet increases the demand for these indecent pictures and the degradation and suffering of children used to create them .
" it is an awful fact that it 's almost impossible to take these images out of circulation .
" behind most images is an abused child and these children will suffer for many years knowing that other offenders will pore over images of their abuse , " she added .
' position of trust ' dyfed-powys police said they were pleased with hart 's conviction and sentence .
det insp diane davies said : " the images found on mr hart 's computer were made when he was a vicar - he had a position of trust within the communities he served .
" we worked closely with the child exploitation and online protection team -lrb- ceop -rrb- during this investigation as well as the crown prosecution service .
" ceop provided us with expert assistance that meant together we were able to gather sufficient evidence to secure the conviction of mr hart . "
we hope this sentence today increases awareness of the seriousness of this crime and recognises it for what it is - child abuse " the church in wales " we have also worked closely with the church in wales and the community throughout the investigation and thank them for their cooperation .
" most of all , i am grateful to those individuals that have been spoken to by the investigation team in the course of our inquiries , " she said .
the church in wales said it was " deeply saddened and shocked " that one of its clerics had committed such crimes .
" we hope this sentence today increases awareness of the seriousness of this crime and recognises it for what it is - child abuse .
it is a crime all the more insidious because it is hidden - committed alone , secretively and in the home .
" there is no place for any form of abuse in the church in wales .
we give the highest priority to the care and protection of children and vulnerable people in the community , " it said in a statement .
the court heard how hart had 44 images showing child sex abuse in the most serious category five - with 52,240 in the least serious category , 2,419 in category two , a further 684 in category three and 1,445 in category four .
hart has been suspended from his pastoral duties and now faces a church in wales disciplinary panel .
the court also disqualified him from working with children .

hart , a priest in beguildy in south powys , is starting a three-and-a-half year prison sentence .
lucy thorpe , of the nspcc warned that people viewing images online " should realise more children get abused in the real world as a result " .
cardiff crown court found hart guilty of possessing almost 57,000 images .
the church in wales also says it is examining clergy records which pre-date the introduction of its child protection policies .
as well as taking his own pictures , the collection of images came from websites in brazil , germany , japan , the uk , the us , denmark , russia and other eastern european countries .
ms thorpe said : " viewing child abuse images on the internet increases the demand for these indecent pictures and the degradation and suffering of children used to create them .
" it is an awful fact that it 's almost impossible to take these images out of circulation .
" behind most images is an abused child and these children will suffer for many years knowing that other offenders will pore over images of their abuse , " she added .
' position of trust ' dyfed-powys police said they were pleased with hart 's conviction and sentence .
det insp diane davies said : " the images found on mr hart 's computer were made when he was a vicar - he had a position of trust within the communities he served .
" we worked closely with the child exploitation and online protection team -lrb- ceop -rrb- during this investigation as well as the crown prosecution service .
" ceop provided us with expert assistance that meant together we were able to gather sufficient evidence to secure the conviction of mr hart .
we hope this sentence today increases awareness of the seriousness of this crime and recognises it for what it is - child abuse the church in wales " we have also worked closely with the church in wales and the community throughout the investigation and thank them for their cooperation .
" most of all , i am grateful to those individuals that have been spoken to by the investigation team in the course of our inquiries , " she said .
the church in wales said it was " deeply saddened and shocked " that one of its clerics had committed such crimes .
" we hope this sentence today increases awareness of the seriousness of this crime and recognises it for what it is - child abuse .
it is a crime all the more insidious because it is hidden - committed alone , secretively and in the home .
" there is no place for any form of abuse in the church in wales .
we give the highest priority to the care and protection of children and vulnerable people in the community , " it said in a statement .
the court heard how hart had 44 images showing child sex abuse in the most serious category five - with 52,240 in the least serious category , 2,419 in category two , a further 684 in category three and 1,445 in category four .
hart has been suspended from his pastoral duties and now faces a church in wales disciplinary panel .
the court also disqualified him from working with children .

advertisement parents say merging the two schools could harm their children 's education parents in carmarthenshire have expressed concern that plans to reorganise secondary schools in dinefwr could affect welsh medium education .
a paper obtained by bbc wales discusses merging the welsh medium ysgol maes yr yrfa with bilingual ysgol y gwendraeth .
the proposals were debated in a meeting last thursday and could see secondary schools there cut from five to three .
but carmarthenshire county council said it would be " premature " to read too much into the proposals .
but it added the status quo was not an option .
the document was drawn up after discussions between council and assembly government officials , local head teachers and the voluntary sector .
' our choice and our right ' while all lessons at ysgol maes yr yrfa take place in welsh , ysgol gwendraeth is a bilingual school where english is used in the majority of classes .

in a statement , carmarthenshire county council said there was no " hidden agenda " .
" in order to build upon the very positive collaborative work already being done in the area , all the interested parties including the welsh assembly government , the heads of the five secondary schools , coleg sir gar , the voluntary sector and county council have been engaged in discussion to explore the issues involved including drawing up a suitable curriculum for all our young people .

" i was eight months pregnant , disabled , and here was this car clamper threatening to take away my car . "
ms grant said she would never forget to leave her disabled blue badge out on display again .
after stopping briefly at a car park in northfield , birmingham , to get some food she returned to find her car had been clamped .
" i just had n't seen the sign saying you had to pay to park , " she said .
" i showed the attendant my blue badge which would 've made me exempt and apologised for not having it on display .
" but he was n't interested .
he said i needed to pay £ 250 in cash or i could face having the car towed away .
" he knew i was disabled and i was obviously heavily pregnant , but there was absolutely no sympathy there . "
she said she believed the clamping firm only agreed to back off once she got bbc radio wm involved .
since january 2007 trading standards officers in birmingham have received more than 650 complaints about clampers .
and now city councillors have had enough .
the authority 's public protection committee has written to the government demanding that car-clamping by private firms be made illegal throughout england .
most of the clamping in birmingham takes place in private car parks and areas of wasteland in digbeth , much of which lies unused ahead of the massive eastside development planned there .
however , reports have come in from across the city .
trading standards said it was actually " very rare " for a wheel clamp to be put on a car .
instead , the vehicle would usually be towed away , leaving drivers paying £ 390 to have their car released - rather than £ 150 to have a clamp removed .
birmingham city councillor neil eustace said he received " dozens " of e-mails from people each day telling of their clamping experiences . "
we will listen to people 's cases and we regularly waive fees " car-clamper walton wilkins " it 's about demanding money through menaces , " he said .
" a lot of them can be quite nasty and something needs to be done .
i 'd like to see clamping banned altogether , but at the very least i 'd like to see local authorities given the control themselves to regulate their local clampers . "
city council staff have calculated that one clamper who tows away three or four vehicles a day will generate about £ 400,000 for their employer in a year .
in may , a 27-year-old boss of a car-clamping company which operated throughout staffordshire and worcestershire was jailed for four years for taking thousands of pounds unlawfully from motorists .
rebecca meakin was blackmailing drivers by giving them minutes - or even seconds - to pay up to have a clamp removed before their vehicles were towed away .
' wrong business ' however , some of those who run clamping companies said they were being treated unfairly .
walton wilkins 's company midway park operates in car parks across birmingham and the black country .
" you only ever hear one side of the story , " he said .
" if i was out to make money , i 'm in the wrong business as my company actually made a loss last year , and i do n't know where the council gets its figures from .
" we will listen to people 's cases and we regularly waive fees .
today , for instance - there was a man who had been receiving treatment at the queen elizabeth hospital and got back to find his car had been towed .
" after speaking to us we made sure he would n't have to pay a thing . "
clamping is already illegal in scotland , where the definition of theft includes anyone who immobilises a vehicle .
however , in england the clamping or towing away of vehicles is only seen as a temporary measure and so it remains legal .
it is also not an offence for firms to demand to be paid in cash only .
the government 's home affairs committee has been asking all local councils for their experiences of clamping before it decides what action to take .
the licensing requirements for clampers are regulated by the security industry authority -lrb- sia -rrb- .
however , birmingham 's councillors have pointed out that the sia is powerless to determine several important factors , including how much can be charged to release vehicles , the minimum length of time before which a vehicle can be towed away and what warning signs should be displayed .
and so unless there are any changes to the way clampers operate , people like ms grant will be steering away from private car parks .
" it made me feel bad about human nature , " she said .
" the whole thing was just so nasty . "

and now city councillors have had enough .
the authority 's public protection committee has written to the government demanding that car-clamping by private firms be made illegal throughout england .
most of the clamping in birmingham takes place in private car parks and areas of wasteland in digbeth , much of which lies unused ahead of the massive eastside development planned there .
however , reports have come in from across the city .
trading standards said it was actually " very rare " for a wheel clamp to be put on a car .
instead , the vehicle would usually be towed away , leaving drivers paying £ 390 to have their car released - rather than £ 150 to have a clamp removed .
birmingham city councillor neil eustace said he received " dozens " of e-mails from people each day telling of their clamping experiences .
we will listen to people 's cases and we regularly waive fees car-clamper walton wilkins " it 's about demanding money through menaces , " he said .
" a lot of them can be quite nasty and something needs to be done .
i 'd like to see clamping banned altogether , but at the very least i 'd like to see local authorities given the control themselves to regulate their local clampers . "
city council staff have calculated that one clamper who tows away three or four vehicles a day will generate about £ 400,000 for their employer in a year .
in may , a 27-year-old boss of a car-clamping company which operated throughout staffordshire and worcestershire was jailed for four years for taking thousands of pounds unlawfully from motorists .
rebecca meakin was blackmailing drivers by giving them minutes - or even seconds - to pay up to have a clamp removed before their vehicles were towed away .
' wrong business ' however , some of those who run clamping companies said they were being treated unfairly .
walton wilkins 's company midway park operates in car parks across birmingham and the black country .
" you only ever hear one side of the story , " he said .
" if i was out to make money , i 'm in the wrong business as my company actually made a loss last year , and i do n't know where the council gets its figures from .
" we will listen to people 's cases and we regularly waive fees .
today , for instance - there was a man who had been receiving treatment at the queen elizabeth hospital and got back to find his car had been towed .
" after speaking to us we made sure he would n't have to pay a thing . "
rebecca meakin was jailed for four years clamping is already illegal in scotland , where the definition of theft includes anyone who immobilises a vehicle .
however , in england the clamping or towing away of vehicles is only seen as a temporary measure and so it remains legal .
it is also not an offence for firms to demand to be paid in cash only .
the government 's home affairs committee has been asking all local councils for their experiences of clamping before it decides what action to take .
the licensing requirements for clampers are regulated by the security industry authority -lrb- sia -rrb- .
however , birmingham 's councillors have pointed out that the sia is powerless to determine several important factors , including how much can be charged to release vehicles , the minimum length of time before which a vehicle can be towed away and what warning signs should be displayed .
and so unless there are any changes to the way clampers operate , people like ms grant will be steering away from private car parks .
" it made me feel bad about human nature , " she said .
" the whole thing was just so nasty . "

rebecca meakin was blackmailing drivers by giving them minutes - or even seconds - to pay up to have a clamp removed before their vehicles were towed away .
' wrong business ' however , some of those who run clamping companies said they were being treated unfairly .
walton wilkins 's company midway park operates in car parks across birmingham and the black country .
" you only ever hear one side of the story , " he said .
" if i was out to make money , i 'm in the wrong business as my company actually made a loss last year , and i do n't know where the council gets its figures from .
" we will listen to people 's cases and we regularly waive fees .
today , for instance - there was a man who had been receiving treatment at the queen elizabeth hospital and got back to find his car had been towed .
" after speaking to us we made sure he would n't have to pay a thing . "
rebecca meakin was jailed for four years clamping is already illegal in scotland , where the definition of theft includes anyone who immobilises a vehicle .
however , in england the clamping or towing away of vehicles is only seen as a temporary measure and so it remains legal .
it is also not an offence for firms to demand to be paid in cash only .
the government 's home affairs committee has been asking all local councils for their experiences of clamping before it decides what action to take .
the licensing requirements for clampers are regulated by the security industry authority -lrb- sia -rrb- .
however , birmingham 's councillors have pointed out that the sia is powerless to determine several important factors , including how much can be charged to release vehicles , the minimum length of time before which a vehicle can be towed away and what warning signs should be displayed .
and so unless there are any changes to the way clampers operate , people like ms grant will be steering away from private car parks .
" it made me feel bad about human nature , " she said .
" the whole thing was just so nasty . "

about half of the cuts , which will affect back room jobs at its global banking and markets operation , will take place in the uk .
hsbc employs about 335,000 people around the world .
last month , hsbc said half year profits fell 28 % to $ 10.2bn -lrb- £ 5.2bn -rrb- , as it was forced to write-off $ 14bn from bad debts in the us and asset write-downs .
meanwhile , pre-tax profits fell 35 % to $ 2.1bn during the same period .
an hsbc spokesman said the firm had opted to reduce its workforce , " because of market conditions and the economic environment , and our cautious outlook for 2009 " .
many of the job-losses will be at the headquarters of hsbc 's investment banking division , which are in london 's canary wharf .
banks around the world have been coming under increased pressure from the credit crisis currently affecting financial markets .
the problems have forced governments to step in and boost money markets as well as bail out a number of companies .
earlier this year , the uk government had to buy mortgage lender northern rock , while in the us lenders fannie mae and freddie mac have been rescued as well as insurer aig and investment bank lehman brothers filed for bankruptcy .

from left , billy doherty , mickey bradley , damian o 'neill , feargal sharkey , john o 'neill .
pic paddy simms .
thirty years after the release of teenage kicks , undertones bassist mickey bradley recalls the birth of the iconic single .
" the idea of the undertones making a record for -lsb- record shop owner and music producer -rsb- terri hooley began with something close to jealousy .
we had been playing in derry every weekend since january 1977 - listening to john peel every night , reading nme every week , and sending off for mail order punk singles every time we had money .
then in the spring of 1978 we discovered that someone in belfast was getting punk bands in to make records !
and john peel was playing them !
what about us ?
we did n't know terri and we barely knew belfast .
we certainly never thought of playing there .
but through a circuitous process , which involved the brother of someone who worked in radio rentals with lead singer feargal sharkey , a cassette of a demo tape made its way to terri .
terri hooley of good vibrations in his belfast record shop the offer was relayed back , through the same channel , that we too could join the good vibrations stable of recording artists .
as usual , we were in the middle of a personnel crisis - feargal wanted to leave .
this happened regularly with all of us .
-lrb- i remember wanting to leave after our first lp , for no particular reason other than it was something to do . -rrb-
he may have thought the band was going nowhere , or maybe he thought tv aerial installation was the career he wanted , but i was delegated by the rest of the band to talk to him .
i phoned him , from john and damian o 'neill 's house , which was the centre of operations for the band .
' ok , you 're leaving , but why not wait till we make the record ? '
it was never spoken of again .
by feargal , anyway .
i , on the other hand , repeat it early and often .
the band in liverpool in 1979 .
pic tom sheehan the night before we made the record , we played at the battle of the bands in mcmordie hall at queen 's .
we were second last on , and if i say so myself , we were the best band on that night .
we stayed in my sister 's boyfriend 's student house in tate 's avenue that night , and next morning we were taken in a white van to wizard studios somewhere in belfast .
to this day i still do n't know where wizard actually was .
as i said , belfast was unknown territory to us .
our only previous experience of a recording studio was making a demo at magee university in derry , in a room which was only used for recording language tapes .
it had cardboard egg cartons on the wall for sound insulation .
wizard was a proper studio .
it was abbey road , as far as we knew .
we recorded four songs .
we thought this was the only record we 'd ever make , so we thought we may as well do an ep .
click here for more stories from the bbc 's new foyle and west service the good vibrations record label did n't have a sleeve-making department .
in fact , it did n't have any departments , it was just terri in his shop .
so when he rang us a few weeks later to say the records had arrived , he really meant we had to go up to his shop and help with the sleeves .
that process involved folding a printed a4 sheet around the record .
i still have memories of us on our knees in the back of terri 's shop , with a pile of singles and a pile of unfolded sleeves .
we then had to run up great victoria street to shaftesbury square post office and post a copy to radio one 's john peel .
" i hope he plays it , " said terri as we went out the door ... "
' teenage kicks ' is re-released this week to mark the single 's 30th anniversary .

thirty years after the release of teenage kicks , undertones bassist mickey bradley recalls the birth of the iconic single .
" the idea of the undertones making a record for -lsb- record shop owner and music producer -rsb- terri hooley began with something close to jealousy .
we had been playing in derry every weekend since january 1977 - listening to john peel every night , reading nme every week , and sending off for mail order punk singles every time we had money .
then in the spring of 1978 we discovered that someone in belfast was getting punk bands in to make records !
and john peel was playing them !
what about us ?
we did n't know terri and we barely knew belfast .
we certainly never thought of playing there .
but through a circuitous process , which involved the brother of someone who worked in radio rentals with lead singer feargal sharkey , a cassette of a demo tape made its way to terri .
terri hooley of good vibrations in his belfast record shop the offer was relayed back , through the same channel , that we too could join the good vibrations stable of recording artists .
as usual , we were in the middle of a personnel crisis - feargal wanted to leave .
this happened regularly with all of us .
-lrb- i remember wanting to leave after our first lp , for no particular reason other than it was something to do . -rrb-
he may have thought the band was going nowhere , or maybe he thought tv aerial installation was the career he wanted , but i was delegated by the rest of the band to talk to him .
i phoned him , from john and damian o 'neill 's house , which was the centre of operations for the band .
' ok , you 're leaving , but why not wait till we make the record ? '
it was never spoken of again .
by feargal , anyway .
i , on the other hand , repeat it early and often .
the band in liverpool in 1979 .
pic tom sheehan the night before we made the record , we played at the battle of the bands in mcmordie hall at queen 's .
we were second last on , and if i say so myself , we were the best band on that night .
we stayed in my sister 's boyfriend 's student house in tate 's avenue that night , and next morning we were taken in a white van to wizard studios somewhere in belfast .
to this day i still do n't know where wizard actually was .
as i said , belfast was unknown territory to us .
our only previous experience of a recording studio was making a demo at magee university in derry , in a room which was only used for recording language tapes .
it had cardboard egg cartons on the wall for sound insulation .
wizard was a proper studio .
it was abbey road , as far as we knew .
we recorded four songs .
we thought this was the only record we 'd ever make , so we thought we may as well do an ep .
click here for more stories from the bbc 's new foyle and west service the good vibrations record label did n't have a sleeve-making department .
in fact , it did n't have any departments , it was just terri in his shop .
so when he rang us a few weeks later to say the records had arrived , he really meant we had to go up to his shop and help with the sleeves .
that process involved folding a printed a4 sheet around the record .
i still have memories of us on our knees in the back of terri 's shop , with a pile of singles and a pile of unfolded sleeves .
we then had to run up great victoria street to shaftesbury square post office and post a copy to radio one 's john peel .
" i hope he plays it , " said terri as we went out the door ... "
' teenage kicks ' is re-released this week to mark the single 's 30th anniversary .

the retailer and health clubs group posted a £ 9.7m -lrb- $ 18m -rrb- loss for the six months to the end of july against an £ 8.3m profit at the same time in 2007 .
the loss came as sales fell 5.6 % to £ 344.7m at jjb .
two newly acquired businesses also made losses .
looking ahead , the group said it remained very cautious about the future amid the current consumer slowdown .
" my non-executive board colleague david jones formerly chairman and ceo of next plc has described the current climate as ' the worst retail recession i have ever known ' , " chaiman roger lane-smith said .
" i can only say that david 's statement is borne out by our trading results as reported today . "
over the first half of the year the wigan-based group has closed 96 stores and axed 700 jobs as it battles the current slowdown on the high street .
the shake-up and introduction of more own-brands helped gross margin - a measure of profitability - at jjb 's retail division improve from 50.8 % last year to 51.7 % this year .
" looking ahead we remain very cautious about the outlook for retail given the background of a weakening consumer economy , " mr lane-smith added .
but chief executive chris ronnie insisted that management would stay " calm and focused " over the rest of this financial year .

the retailer and health clubs group posted a £ 9.7m -lrb- $ 18m -rrb- loss for the six months to the end of july against an £ 8.3m profit at the same time in 2007 .
the loss came as sales fell 5.6 % to £ 344.7m at jjb .
two newly acquired businesses also made losses .
looking ahead , the group said it remained very cautious about the future amid the current consumer slowdown .
" my non-executive board colleague david jones formerly chairman and ceo of next plc has described the current climate as ' the worst retail recession i have ever known ' , " chaiman roger lane-smith said .
" i can only say that david 's statement is borne out by our trading results as reported today . "
over the first half of the year the wigan-based group has closed 96 stores and axed 700 jobs as it battles the current slowdown on the high street .
the shake-up and introduction of more own-brands helped gross margin - a measure of profitability - at jjb 's retail division improve from 50.8 % last year to 51.7 % this year .
" looking ahead we remain very cautious about the outlook for retail given the background of a weakening consumer economy , " mr lane-smith added .
but chief executive chris ronnie insisted that management would stay " calm and focused " over the rest of this financial year .

it is based on techniques used by us presidential candidate barack obama .
competition conservative party chairman caroline spelman said it would play " an important role in getting our message out " .
a new policy theme will be announced every four weeks or so , with registered site members asked to come up with their ideas .
the first competition is to find out " what the uk 's sporting legacy should be for the 2012 olympics " , with the winner getting the chance to meet shadow culture and sport secretary jeremy hunt .

the transformation of the summerlee museum of scottish industrial life in coatbridge took two years to complete and was designed to make the area 's history more accessible to young people .
" hard work , and not much pay , " that is how 79-year-old john twaddle recalls his days working in lanarkshire 's coal mines .
he started his career as a mining engineer in 1947 and retired in 1996 .
he said : " there were very good times and very sad times because we had a lot of very severe incidents like at auchengeich , almost 50 years ago , when we lost 47 men one friday morning . "
mr twaddle left the mining industry as it began to decline during the 1980s .
but he remembers lanarkshire when it was viewed as scotland 's industrial heartland and hopes the newly refurbished summerlee museum will help young people appreciate what life was like during that time .
he said : " i look at the exhibitions and they all seem to be showing what it was like in the older days .

from that point of view it 's interesting . "
based at the site of the former summerlee iron works by the monklands canal , the location of the museum could hardly be more appropriate .
the area around the entrance has been excavated and now displays large steam cranes and trains , but it is inside where visitors will see the biggest difference .
' completely changed ' a mezzanine level has been added with a viewing platform looking out to coatbridge and the remains of the summerlee iron works .
there is also a discovery zone where children can play with interactive displays involving water , levers and pulleys .
and there is a huge virtual reality blast furnace which will give visitors the chance to try their hand at making iron .
carol ettershank , north lanarkshire council 's project manager , said she was delighted by the transformation .
she said : " from the minute they walk into the exhibition people will see it 's completely changed . "
" we were lacking a good internal space for visitors .
it was very cold , very unwelcoming and it was difficult for people to engage and understand what the story of lanarkshire and the industrial west of scotland was all about .
" the displays are much more engaging , much more interactive .
they tell the stories of people 's lives in a much more vibrant way . "
but traditional machinery remains a major feature of the exhibition .
a huge winding wheel from the former cardowan colliery at stepps dominates the main hall and an old-fashioned tram will ferry visitors around the site .
david adams mcgilp , regional director of visitscotland , said the new summerlee museum should benefit the whole area .
he said : " this is a very welcome development for lanarkshire as it 's a unique study and celebration of scottish industry .

the transformation of the summerlee museum of scottish industrial life in coatbridge took two years to complete and was designed to make the area 's history more accessible to young people .
john twaddle worked as a mining engineer in lanarkshire for 20 years " hard work , and not much pay , " that is how 79-year-old john twaddle recalls his days working in lanarkshire 's coal mines .
he started his career as a mining engineer in 1947 and retired in 1996 .
he said : " there were very good times and very sad times because we had a lot of very severe incidents like at auchengeich , almost 50 years ago , when we lost 47 men one friday morning . "
mr twaddle left the mining industry as it began to decline during the 1980s .
but he remembers lanarkshire when it was viewed as scotland 's industrial heartland and hopes the newly refurbished summerlee museum will help young people appreciate what life was like during that time .
he said : " i look at the exhibitions and they all seem to be showing what it was like in the older days .
we can look at it now and say this is what we did 100 years ago , and this what we do today .
from that point of view it 's interesting . "
based at the site of the former summerlee iron works by the monklands canal , the location of the museum could hardly be more appropriate .
the area around the entrance has been excavated and now displays large steam cranes and trains , but it is inside where visitors will see the biggest difference .
' completely changed ' a mezzanine level has been added with a viewing platform looking out to coatbridge and the remains of the summerlee iron works .
there is also a discovery zone where children can play with interactive displays involving water , levers and pulleys .
and there is a huge virtual reality blast furnace which will give visitors the chance to try their hand at making iron .
the summerlee museum is reopening after a £ 10.5m refit carol ettershank , north lanarkshire council 's project manager , said she was delighted by the transformation .
she said : " from the minute they walk into the exhibition people will see it 's completely changed . "
" we were lacking a good internal space for visitors .
it was very cold , very unwelcoming and it was difficult for people to engage and understand what the story of lanarkshire and the industrial west of scotland was all about .
" the displays are much more engaging , much more interactive .
they tell the stories of people 's lives in a much more vibrant way . "
but traditional machinery remains a major feature of the exhibition .
a huge winding wheel from the former cardowan colliery at stepps dominates the main hall and an old-fashioned tram will ferry visitors around the site .
david adams mcgilp , regional director of visitscotland , said the new summerlee museum should benefit the whole area .
he said : " this is a very welcome development for lanarkshire as it 's a unique study and celebration of scottish industry .
" i visited this place a decade ago and i personally can see a huge change . "
admission to the museum is free and it will be open seven days a week .
