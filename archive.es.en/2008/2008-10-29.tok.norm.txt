one proposal aims to support the struggling auto industry . addressing germany 's import-export federation bga in berlin on wednesday , oct .
29 , merkel said the package would include incentives for investment rather than being just a broad-based rise in government spending . " it will be targeted , it will be courageous and above all it will be sustainable , " merkel said of the upcoming measures .
" a quick flash in the pan can not truly help our economy . " she also stepped up pressure for next month 's g20 summit in washington to agree on a brief for negotiations on financial-market regulation .
those world negotiations ought not to take longer than a year , she said . to give direct help to small and medium-sized enterprises -lrb- smes -rrb- , the german economy ministry set up a hotline for smes having problems with financing because of the international crisis . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : business owners can call a finance ministry official during regular business hours " we do not want to leave smes to fend for themselves in this situation , and we will offer support where it is possible , " economy minister michael glos said in a statement . germany is to boost the ailing car industry by reducing its taxes on low-emission cars , merkel 's spokesman ulrich wilhelm said . the vehicle-tax changes to be adopted by merkel 's cabinet next week would be part of a program to boost the flagging economy . the disclosure follows days of debate in berlin about whether to increase government spending , cut taxes or both to ease the effects of an approaching slump . promoting cleaner cars wilhelm gave no details but said the package would be a " well-adjusted concept . " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the proposal would work to get heavily polluting cars off the road the proposal was " concretely " planned to alter the scale of vehicle tax , so tax rates were no longer keyed to a vehicle 's engine size but instead to the engine 's level of emissions , finance ministry spokesman torsten albig said . environmentalists have pressed for the change , saying it will encourage owners of polluting cars to scrap them and thus help reduce carbon dioxide emissions blamed for global warming . senior german officials have said berlin will also offer new soft loans and grants to improve building insulation , tax deductions for home-improvement work and changes in the amortization rule for taxes . eu on board eu industry commissioner guenter verheugen threw his weight wednesday behind a call to give the bloc 's carmakers cheap loans worth up to 40 billion euros to develop eco-friendly cars through the financial crisis . " we are in a situation where it is getting harder for big european businesses to get credit , " verheugen said .
" it is not a question of hand-outs , it 's a question of the european investment bank making available a low-interest credit program . " the european carmakers association acea said the industry needed state help . " in today 's difficult operating environment ... the european automotive industry more than ever requires a stable and predictable policy framework to ensure competitiveness and employment , " the organization said in a press release . dw staff -lrb- sms -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

" it is just a stone 's throw away from a former paintbrush-making factory , where anti-nazi activist otto weidt illegally gave deaf and blind jews shelter and an opportunity to work during hitler 's reign , " he told the daily berliner zeitung .
" this house is the only authentic location in germany in which to remember these silent heroes . " a " tiny minority " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : a small number of germans hid jews from the nazis the term is used by historians to describe the germans who opposed hitler 's racist policies and helped jews escape nazi persecution .
the names of just 3,000 " silent heroes " are officially known , but historians believe more cases remain unrecorded . according to some estimates , 20,000 people across the country are thought to have offered their jewish fellow citizens some form of support and refuge during the nazi years .
the german population numbered some 70 million at the time . by end of world war ii , approximately 6 million european jews were killed as part of the nazi program of deliberate extermination led by adolf hitler . compared to the number of people who allowed nazi atrocities to happen or even took part in them , the people who shielded jews were " a tiny minority , " stressed berlin mayor klaus wowereit , who attended the opening . " but it is this minority that gives us direction , " he said .
" by commemorating these courageous people we are ensuring that attacks on human dignity will not be tolerated . " a sensitive issue bildunterschrift : the exhibition is one of a kind the exhibition consists of photographs , letters and other documents from 250 germans who risked their lives giving jews food , shelter or a place to work from 1938 to 1945 . " there are many memorial sites dedicated to those targeted by the nazis , but there has never been one which is solely dedicated to these heroes , " said johannes tuchel , director of an umbrella organization for memorials of resistance to the nazis , which put the exhibition together . tuchel said the " silent heroes " exhibition had not opened sooner because the issue of resistance to the nazis was still sensitive in germany . " we are still in the early stages of our research , " he told the daily tagesspiegel .
he and his organization now plan to begin cooperating with eastern european archivists as well as colleagues at the yad vashem memorial in israel to extend the project . dw staff -lrb- jp -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

looking more like something out of thousand and one nights than ring of the nibelung , the venue was hardly evocative of the hard seats filled by worshipful wagnerians at the german composer 's opera house in the bavarian town of bayreuth .
when the final tones of twilight of the gods faded on saturday evening - part of a wagner gala by the bayreuth festival orchestra under conductor christian thielemann - the minor sensation was complete : the emirate had inaugurated the abu dhabi classics , a first in the gulf states .
but what would richard wagner have thought ?
top acts the concert marked another step in abu dhabi 's mission to become a cultural capital .
a total of 22 concerts are scheduled until the season 's end in may 2009 .
among the guest artists will be top-flight stars dear to classical music fans : lang lang and cecilia bartoli , zubin mehta and lorin maazel , the vienna philharmonic and the philharmonic orchestra of london , the cellist misha maisky and pianist arcadi volodos , bobby mcferrin and till broenner .
the abu dhabi classics will run until 2012 at least , and its concerts will be integrated into the educational programm of schools in abu dhabi , the largest emirate of the united arab emirates -lrb- uae -rrb- .
new markets bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : katharina wagner on hand for the premiere was katharina wagner , who was recently named co-director of the annual bayreuth festival and is seeking new markets for bayreuth and her great-grandfather 's music .
she announced that the bayreuth festival orchestra would , in future , be performing away from home once a year .
" we intend to revive this tradition , " wagner said , adding that entire productions , such as the ring of the nibelung , might be exported .
she did not rule out directing a production herself in abu dhabi at some time .
building bridges abu dhabi 's new music event aims to " build bridges , " say culture officials in the emirate .
the fabulously rich oil producer sees the creation of a music scene modeled after those in the west as a way to secure its place in the globalised world .
following years of construction , " the new generation of rulers wants to take a further step , " remarked zaki nusseibeh , deputy chairman of the abu dhabi authority for culture and heritage -lrb- adach -rrb- .
the uae 's longtime ruler , sheik zayed bin sultan al nahyan , died four years ago and was succeeded by a son .
with 10 percent of the world 's oil reserves , abu dhabi looks as though it will enjoy oil income for some time to come .
it has a population of about 800,000 and is somewhat smaller than the german state of bavaria .
cultural diversity bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : abu dhabi is set to host a branch of the louvre museum abu dhabi already boasts a literature prize and film festival , and is currently having 100 books by western authors translated into arabic .
" we spend a lot of money on culture , " noted abdulla salim al amri , director of arts and culture at the adch .
he declined to specify a figure , saying that " any amount you name is ok . "
every day , abu dhabi produces oil valued at some 240 million euros .
off its coast , on saadiyat island , abu dhabi is developing a cultural district that will likely have no equal worldwide .
covering an area of 27 square kilometers and expected to be completed in 2018 , it will include four museums , a performing arts center , housing for 150,000 people , a golf course , and a marina .
one of the museums , an outpost of the paris-based louvre , is a shell flooded with light designed by french architect jean nouvel .
frank gehry , architect of the celebrated guggenheim museum bilbao , has designed an eighth branch of the new york-based museum for saadiyat island .
the performing arts center , a gigantic leaf-like structure of glass and concrete designed by zaha hadid , will contain an opera house , concert hall , and music hall for up to 6,300 spectators .
norman foster is contributing a national museum , and japan 's tadeo ando has designed a museum dedicated to the uae 's maritime past .
so it was probably only a matter of time until abu dhabi latched on to wagner , tchaikovsky and co .

looking more like something out of thousand and one nights than ring of the nibelung , the venue was hardly evocative of the hard seats filled by worshipful wagnerians at the german composer 's opera house in the bavarian town of bayreuth .
when the final tones of twilight of the gods faded on saturday evening - part of a wagner gala by the bayreuth festival orchestra under conductor christian thielemann - the minor sensation was complete : the emirate had inaugurated the abu dhabi classics , a first in the gulf states .
but what would richard wagner have thought ?
top acts the concert marked another step in abu dhabi 's mission to become a cultural capital .
a total of 22 concerts are scheduled until the season 's end in may 2009 .
among the guest artists will be top-flight stars dear to classical music fans : lang lang and cecilia bartoli , zubin mehta and lorin maazel , the vienna philharmonic and the philharmonic orchestra of london , the cellist misha maisky and pianist arcadi volodos , bobby mcferrin and till broenner .
the abu dhabi classics will run until 2012 at least , and its concerts will be integrated into the educational programm of schools in abu dhabi , the largest emirate of the united arab emirates -lrb- uae -rrb- .
new markets bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : katharina wagner on hand for the premiere was katharina wagner , who was recently named co-director of the annual bayreuth festival and is seeking new markets for bayreuth and her great-grandfather 's music .
she announced that the bayreuth festival orchestra would , in future , be performing away from home once a year .
" we intend to revive this tradition , " wagner said , adding that entire productions , such as the ring of the nibelung , might be exported .
she did not rule out directing a production herself in abu dhabi at some time .
building bridges abu dhabi 's new music event aims to " build bridges , " say culture officials in the emirate .
the fabulously rich oil producer sees the creation of a music scene modeled after those in the west as a way to secure its place in the globalised world .
following years of construction , " the new generation of rulers wants to take a further step , " remarked zaki nusseibeh , deputy chairman of the abu dhabi authority for culture and heritage -lrb- adach -rrb- .
the uae 's longtime ruler , sheik zayed bin sultan al nahyan , died four years ago and was succeeded by a son .
with 10 percent of the world 's oil reserves , abu dhabi looks as though it will enjoy oil income for some time to come .
it has a population of about 800,000 and is somewhat smaller than the german state of bavaria .
cultural diversity bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : abu dhabi is set to host a branch of the louvre museum abu dhabi already boasts a literature prize and film festival , and is currently having 100 books by western authors translated into arabic .
" we spend a lot of money on culture , " noted abdulla salim al amri , director of arts and culture at the adch .
he declined to specify a figure , saying that " any amount you name is ok . "
every day , abu dhabi produces oil valued at some 240 million euros .
off its coast , on saadiyat island , abu dhabi is developing a cultural district that will likely have no equal worldwide .
covering an area of 27 square kilometers and expected to be completed in 2018 , it will include four museums , a performing arts center , housing for 150,000 people , a golf course , and a marina .
one of the museums , an outpost of the paris-based louvre , is a shell flooded with light designed by french architect jean nouvel .
frank gehry , architect of the celebrated guggenheim museum bilbao , has designed an eighth branch of the new york-based museum for saadiyat island .
the performing arts center , a gigantic leaf-like structure of glass and concrete designed by zaha hadid , will contain an opera house , concert hall , and music hall for up to 6,300 spectators .
norman foster is contributing a national museum , and japan 's tadeo ando has designed a museum dedicated to the uae 's maritime past .
so it was probably only a matter of time until abu dhabi latched on to wagner , tchaikovsky and co .
the german connection bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the concert was held in the luxury emirates palace germany 's till janczukowicz , executive artistic director of the abu dhabi classics , presented the emirate with a plan and managed within a few months to sign top artists who are booked for years in advance .
curiosity , and not only money , attracted them to the gulf , he said .
abu dhabi had seen european orchestras before , most recently the dresden state orchestra of saxony .
the new york philharmonic will perform in the emirate next year .
the arab world has a special affinity for the romanticist wagner , nusseibeh noted .
in his opera " parsifal , " for instance , the german composer distilled his longing for the orient , he said .
arabs ' fondness for wagner has nothing to do with his " ideology , " nusseibeh added , referring to wagner 's strident anti-semitism .
" the arab world is n't part of this debate , " he said .
foreigners made up the bulk of the some 1,000 people who came to saturday evening 's premiere at the emirates palace hotel .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de drugs -pipe- 29.10.2008 dutch municipalities plan new campaign against drug tourists großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : dutch municipalities are hoping to cooperate in a new initiative against drugs tourism municipal officials in the netherlands are taking another crack at stopping drug tourists flooding into their country to take advantage of the country 's soft drugs policy . the dutch association for municipalities , vng , announced tuesday , oct .
28 that it will host a soft drugs summit in the third week of november in maastricht .
participants will seek ways to discourage tourists who visit the netherlands to take advantage of its liberal drug laws .
by extension , the summit also seeks to reduce drug-related crime .
the summit comes in the wake of last week 's decision by the south- western dutch towns of roosendaal and bergen op zoom to gradually close their local " coffee shops " in an attempt to reduce drug-related crimes .
all dutch cities and towns close to the german or belgian borders are invited to the summit .
after the summit , the vng will present the cities ' common position to the government .
the goal , according to vng , is to get the government to negotiate an international soft drugs policy with belgium and germany .
the netherlands effectively decriminalized soft drugs a few decades ago when it introduced a policy of " non-enforcement . "
although possession and cultivation of cannabis remains technically illegal in holland , law enforcement has systematically turned a blind eye , and the courts usually rule in favor of individual defendants .
the sale and use of so-called soft drugs , such as marijuana , is legal in designated stores , usually referred to as " coffee shops . "
maastricht suffering most from drug-related crime maastricht mayor gerd leers calls the current dutch drugs policy " hypocritical . "
he says it enables drug-related crime and also increases the sale and distribution of hard drugs , such as heroin .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : a police officer talks to a french drug tourist in maastricht maastricht is one of the dutch cities suffering most from drug- related crime .
the city is visited by more than 1.5 million drugs tourists per year and has 16 " coffee shops , " 10 more than in dutch cities of comparable size not located close to the border .
police estimate maastricht also has more than 100 " soft drugs supermarkets , " illegal stores where one can purchase soft drugs in larger quantities than the 5 grams per person allowed under dutch law .
leers says police officers in his city deal with triple the amount of crime as their colleagues in the metropolitan area of the hague .
most of the crime in maastricht is drug-related , and the number of drug-related murders each year is increasing , according to police officials .
german cross-border smokers favor enschede bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : drug tourism could go up in smoke the town of enschede has been particularly problematic for local authorities , because of its immediate proximity to the german border .

28 that it will host a soft drugs summit in the third week of november in maastricht .
participants will seek ways to discourage tourists who visit the netherlands to take advantage of its liberal drug laws .
by extension , the summit also seeks to reduce drug-related crime .
the summit comes in the wake of last week 's decision by the south- western dutch towns of roosendaal and bergen op zoom to gradually close their local " coffee shops " in an attempt to reduce drug-related crimes .
all dutch cities and towns close to the german or belgian borders are invited to the summit .
after the summit , the vng will present the cities ' common position to the government .
the goal , according to vng , is to get the government to negotiate an international soft drugs policy with belgium and germany .
the netherlands effectively decriminalized soft drugs a few decades ago when it introduced a policy of " non-enforcement . "
although possession and cultivation of cannabis remains technically illegal in holland , law enforcement has systematically turned a blind eye , and the courts usually rule in favor of individual defendants .
the sale and use of so-called soft drugs , such as marijuana , is legal in designated stores , usually referred to as " coffee shops . "

" it is just a stone 's throw away from a former paintbrush-making factory , where anti-nazi activist otto weidt illegally gave deaf and blind jews shelter and an opportunity to work during hitler 's reign , " he told the daily berliner zeitung .
" this house is the only authentic location in germany in which to remember these silent heroes . " a " tiny minority " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : a small number of germans hid jews from the nazis the term is used by historians to describe the germans who opposed hitler 's racist policies and helped jews escape nazi persecution .
the names of just 3,000 " silent heroes " are officially known , but historians believe more cases remain unrecorded . according to some estimates , 20,000 people across the country are thought to have offered their jewish fellow citizens some form of support and refuge during the nazi years .
the german population numbered some 70 million at the time . by end of world war ii , approximately 6 million european jews were killed as part of the nazi program of deliberate extermination led by adolf hitler . compared to the number of people who allowed nazi atrocities to happen or even took part in them , the people who shielded jews were " a tiny minority , " stressed berlin mayor klaus wowereit , who attended the opening . " but it is this minority that gives us direction , " he said .

as unemployment rises , some countries look to restrict visas , which could push more people to enter europe illegally . spain 's building boom drew africans to the southern european country by the hundreds of thousands in recent years .
many of these workers were the first to be laid off when spain 's real estate market cooled earlier this year .
spain , a country which welcomed 1 million immigrants in 2007 , now finds itself with 11.3 percent unemployment , the euro zone 's highest .
this has lead spain to slam the door on further immigration with laws aimed at cutting the number of work permits , restricting family reunion visas , and offering money to unemployed foreigners to go home .
spain is not alone in grappling with how to deal with migrant workers .
the international labor organization predicts that 20 million jobs will disappear worldwide by the end of next year .
countries across europe are considering more restrictive immigration measures .
europe warns against ejecting workers yet simply sending workers home wo n't help the situation , the united nations has warned .
it will simply decrease the number of legal immigrants and increase the number of illegal immigration .
to try and prevent that , the european union launched a 15 million euro -lrb- $ 18.70 million -rrb- initiative on tuesday , oct .
28 together with the un to try and protect migrant workers during the current economic crisis .
the program was launched on the sidelines of the global forum on migration and development in manila .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : many people migrate looking for job opportunities rich countries should not try to restrict migration from poor countries , even during the economic slowdown , peter sutherland , the un secretary general 's special representative on migration , warned .
" we 've seen how ineffective simple prohibition policies in regard to migration actually are , " he said .
" they do n't really work .
migrants migrate .
they will find a way , one way or another to do it . "
the number of migrants in the world is now estimated to be 40 million , 25 percent of whom are illegal , with the united states having the most migrants , according to sharan burrow , president of the international trade union confederation .
" our fear is that those numbers will increase , " burrow said at the opening of the four-day migration forum in manila .
britain looks to tighten immigration rising unemployment in the uk means that the country needs to consider restricting immigration , british immigration minister phil woolas recently told the times newspaper .
" if people are being made unemployed , the question of immigration becomes extremely thorny ... it 's been too easy to get into this country in the past and it 's going to get harder , " woolas said .
many european migrants from new eu member countries have come to britain in the past four years .
but there are some signs that many are heading home as the crisis hits , reuters recently reported .
the british government has considerred immigration reform which would have put into place an australian-style point system to let in highly-skilled workers but restrict access for unskilled migrants .
europe remains under pressure bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : many polish workers have headed west in search of work while officias say that they have not yet seen numbers of illegal immigrants spike globally , there are signs that european countries continue to be under pressure from illegal immigrants .
on monday , about 400 illegal immigrants were detained by italians as they tried to land on the italian island of lampedusa .
an additional 280 illegal immigrants had made landfall on the island over the weekend , according to the coast guard .
there has been a sharp increase in the number of people trying to enter italy by sea , according to figures from the interior ministry , which so far this year totals 23,600 .
afp news agency puts the number of immigrants who have tried to reach italy in october at 2,800 .
in greece , 10,000 would-be immigrants have been arrested trying to enter the country illegally during the first nine months of this year , compared to 9,240 last year , according to afp . dw staff -lrb- th -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

but observers disagree on the possible effects of the decline . analysts took conflicting lessons from the euro 's fall to two-and-a-half-year lows , with some saying the fall is a short-term problem that could help boost exports , while others saw it as a sign of serious policy discord in the 15-nation euro zone .
in european trading on tuesday , oct .
28 , the euro touched a low of $ 1.23 - the last time it was so weak was in april , 2006 - before reaching $ 1.25 in asian trading .
the currency fell even farther against the yen ; in all it weakened against 14 of the 16 most active currencies .
analysts attributed the drop to a number of factors , including the widespread perception that europe 's economy is on the brink of a recession and the expectation that european central bank president jean-claude trichet may soon lower interest rates .
' a question of politics ' exchanges rates are n't just a question of economics , " it is a question of politics , " said ognian hishow , a german economist who is currently a visiting professor at the university of rochester .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the last time the euro fell so low was in april , 2006 " once the world starts to get suspicious of a given player - like the euro zone now - then they will look for an alternative for where to put their money , " he said .
" right now , the only good alternative is the us dollar . "
alexandra boehne , a finance expert for the german chamber of commerce , noted that the falling euro reflects the growing concern over the extent of the european financial crisis .
" no one knows how the financial-market crisis will develop , how long it will continue and how bad the economy will get , " she said .
financial players have known about the economic crisis in the us since last year , but the news that europe is heavily affected is new to the market .
' the markets are insecure ' " people have only been aware of a problem in europe since the autumn of 2008 , " she said .
" the markets are very insecure right now . "
some analysts say european banks ' heavy exposure to credit-soaked emerging markets , particularly in eastern europe , has left the currency vulnerable .
bloomberg news service cited a report on tuesday that showed european banks ' lending to emerging markets is around 21 percent of europe 's gross domestic product , compared with 4 percent for the us and 5 percent for japan .
meanwhile there are other indicators that recession may be around the corner - including a ground-shaking report on monday that german consumer confidence had plunged to five-year lows . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the financial crisis : a game of dominos in the end , " investors conclude that america is still the most reliable destination when it comes to where to put your money in such rainy days , " hishow said .
not all analysts agree about the extent of the euro problem .
the chamber of commerce 's boehme said it could actually give germany 's giant export economy a boost by making things " made in germany , " like automobiles and chemicals , cheaper .
pessimism on export growth according to hishow , however , this would be the case if it were n't for the fact that germany 's main export markets - the us and the rest of europe - are stagnating .
" where can german companies sell their goods ?

in latin america ? "
hishow asks rhetorically .
" in the dollar area it is impossible because of the downsizing there , and china , while its currency is pegged to the dollar , is facing hard times too , so there 's not enough help there , " he said .

meanwhile christian dreger , an economist at the german institute for economics research -lrb- diw -rrb- , argues that the drop in the euro is merely a temporary blip .

he expects the euro 's " short term drop " to reverse itself .
he calls the bout of euro-selling an " adjustment " to issues of monetary policy , namely " pressure on the euro because of potential for further interest rate cuts . "

dreger says he disagrees with the investors who are betting that europe will recover more slowly than the us .
he thinks they are overreacting to possible weakness in central european economies , and believes the euro will appreciate because " it will benefit more from catching-up processes in emerging markets like china and india , where the eu is heavily invested . "

as unemployment rises , some countries look to restrict visas , which could push more people to enter europe illegally . spain 's building boom drew africans to the southern european country by the hundreds of thousands in recent years .
many of these workers were the first to be laid off when spain 's real estate market cooled earlier this year .
spain , a country which welcomed 1 million immigrants in 2007 , now finds itself with 11.3 percent unemployment , the euro zone 's highest .
this has lead spain to slam the door on further immigration with laws aimed at cutting the number of work permits , restricting family reunion visas , and offering money to unemployed foreigners to go home .
spain is not alone in grappling with how to deal with migrant workers .
the international labor organization predicts that 20 million jobs will disappear worldwide by the end of next year .
countries across europe are considering more restrictive immigration measures .
europe warns against ejecting workers yet simply sending workers home wo n't help the situation , the united nations has warned .
it will simply decrease the number of legal immigrants and increase the number of illegal immigration .
to try and prevent that , the european union launched a 15 million euro -lrb- $ 18.70 million -rrb- initiative on tuesday , oct .
28 together with the un to try and protect migrant workers during the current economic crisis .
the program was launched on the sidelines of the global forum on migration and development in manila .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : many people migrate looking for job opportunities rich countries should not try to restrict migration from poor countries , even during the economic slowdown , peter sutherland , the un secretary general 's special representative on migration , warned .
" we 've seen how ineffective simple prohibition policies in regard to migration actually are , " he said .
" they do n't really work .
migrants migrate .
they will find a way , one way or another to do it . "
the number of migrants in the world is now estimated to be 40 million , 25 percent of whom are illegal , with the united states having the most migrants , according to sharan burrow , president of the international trade union confederation .
" our fear is that those numbers will increase , " burrow said at the opening of the four-day migration forum in manila .
britain looks to tighten immigration rising unemployment in the uk means that the country needs to consider restricting immigration , british immigration minister phil woolas recently told the times newspaper .
" if people are being made unemployed , the question of immigration becomes extremely thorny ... it 's been too easy to get into this country in the past and it 's going to get harder , " woolas said .
many european migrants from new eu member countries have come to britain in the past four years .
but there are some signs that many are heading home as the crisis hits , reuters recently reported .
the british government has considerred immigration reform which would have put into place an australian-style point system to let in highly-skilled workers but restrict access for unskilled migrants .
europe remains under pressure bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : many polish workers have headed west in search of work while officias say that they have not yet seen numbers of illegal immigrants spike globally , there are signs that european countries continue to be under pressure from illegal immigrants .
on monday , about 400 illegal immigrants were detained by italians as they tried to land on the italian island of lampedusa .
an additional 280 illegal immigrants had made landfall on the island over the weekend , according to the coast guard .
there has been a sharp increase in the number of people trying to enter italy by sea , according to figures from the interior ministry , which so far this year totals 23,600 .
afp news agency puts the number of immigrants who have tried to reach italy in october at 2,800 .
in greece , 10,000 would-be immigrants have been arrested trying to enter the country illegally during the first nine months of this year , compared to 9,240 last year , according to afp . dw staff -lrb- th -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de exchange rates -pipe- 29.10.2008 falling euro may signal deeper eu woes großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : a dollar will buy more euros these days euro zone members have watched their currency fall sharply against the dollar in recent days , as forex markets react to the complex global financial crisis .
but observers disagree on the possible effects of the decline . analysts took conflicting lessons from the euro 's fall to two-and-a-half-year lows , with some saying the fall is a short-term problem that could help boost exports , while others saw it as a sign of serious policy discord in the 15-nation euro zone .
in european trading on tuesday , oct .
28 , the euro touched a low of $ 1.23 - the last time it was so weak was in april , 2006 - before reaching $ 1.25 in asian trading .
the currency fell even farther against the yen ; in all it weakened against 14 of the 16 most active currencies .
analysts attributed the drop to a number of factors , including the widespread perception that europe 's economy is on the brink of a recession and the expectation that european central bank president jean-claude trichet may soon lower interest rates .
' a question of politics ' exchanges rates are n't just a question of economics , " it is a question of politics , " said ognian hishow , a german economist who is currently a visiting professor at the university of rochester .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the last time the euro fell so low was in april , 2006 " once the world starts to get suspicious of a given player - like the euro zone now - then they will look for an alternative for where to put their money , " he said .
" right now , the only good alternative is the us dollar . "
alexandra boehne , a finance expert for the german chamber of commerce , noted that the falling euro reflects the growing concern over the extent of the european financial crisis .
" no one knows how the financial-market crisis will develop , how long it will continue and how bad the economy will get , " she said .
financial players have known about the economic crisis in the us since last year , but the news that europe is heavily affected is new to the market .
' the markets are insecure ' " people have only been aware of a problem in europe since the autumn of 2008 , " she said .
" the markets are very insecure right now . "
some analysts say european banks ' heavy exposure to credit-soaked emerging markets , particularly in eastern europe , has left the currency vulnerable .
bloomberg news service cited a report on tuesday that showed european banks ' lending to emerging markets is around 21 percent of europe 's gross domestic product , compared with 4 percent for the us and 5 percent for japan .
meanwhile there are other indicators that recession may be around the corner - including a ground-shaking report on monday that german consumer confidence had plunged to five-year lows . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the financial crisis : a game of dominos in the end , " investors conclude that america is still the most reliable destination when it comes to where to put your money in such rainy days , " hishow said .
not all analysts agree about the extent of the euro problem .
the chamber of commerce 's boehme said it could actually give germany 's giant export economy a boost by making things " made in germany , " like automobiles and chemicals , cheaper .
pessimism on export growth according to hishow , however , this would be the case if it were n't for the fact that germany 's main export markets - the us and the rest of europe - are stagnating .
" where can german companies sell their goods ?
in america ?
in latin america ? "
hishow asks rhetorically .
" in the dollar area it is impossible because of the downsizing there , and china , while its currency is pegged to the dollar , is facing hard times too , so there 's not enough help there , " he said .
" i 'm not optimistic . "
meanwhile christian dreger , an economist at the german institute for economics research -lrb- diw -rrb- , argues that the drop in the euro is merely a temporary blip .
compared to the 80 us cents that the euro was trading for in 2002 , the european currency is still strong , he notes .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : ecb head trichet : plans to cut rates ?
he expects the euro 's " short term drop " to reverse itself .
he calls the bout of euro-selling an " adjustment " to issues of monetary policy , namely " pressure on the euro because of potential for further interest rate cuts . "
upside for the dollar ?
dreger says he disagrees with the investors who are betting that europe will recover more slowly than the us .
he thinks they are overreacting to possible weakness in central european economies , and believes the euro will appreciate because " it will benefit more from catching-up processes in emerging markets like china and india , where the eu is heavily invested . "
economist hishow disagrees .
over time , he says , there will be a correction in the american trade balance and the dollar will improve .
moreover , he said he strongly believes the financial crisis and the falling euro are signals of deep underlying problems in the euro zone .
european integration at fault " this crisis is a proof of how incomplete european integration is , " he said .
" when there are hard times , there is no unified response . "
as examples he cites the vociferous controversy between germany and france on how to respond to the economic crisis , and points out that if anything , the euro zone countries are drifting apart economically . " they tend to act in self-interest first and foremost , " he said .
he predicts the dollar 's dominance as a reserve currency will continue unless europe manages to find a way to boost the process of integration .
" i know many europeans do n't like this conclusion , but it is the reality , " hishow said .
" so we have to accept it . " jennifer abramsohn send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

" it is just a stone 's throw away from a former paintbrush-making factory , where anti-nazi activist otto weidt illegally gave deaf and blind jews shelter and an opportunity to work during hitler 's reign , " he told the daily berliner zeitung .
" this house is the only authentic location in germany in which to remember these silent heroes . " a " tiny minority " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : a small number of germans hid jews from the nazis the term is used by historians to describe the germans who opposed hitler 's racist policies and helped jews escape nazi persecution .
the names of just 3,000 " silent heroes " are officially known , but historians believe more cases remain unrecorded . according to some estimates , 20,000 people across the country are thought to have offered their jewish fellow citizens some form of support and refuge during the nazi years .
the german population numbered some 70 million at the time . by end of world war ii , approximately 6 million european jews were killed as part of the nazi program of deliberate extermination led by adolf hitler . compared to the number of people who allowed nazi atrocities to happen or even took part in them , the people who shielded jews were " a tiny minority , " stressed berlin mayor klaus wowereit , who attended the opening . " but it is this minority that gives us direction , " he said .
" by commemorating these courageous people we are ensuring that attacks on human dignity will not be tolerated . " a sensitive issue bildunterschrift : the exhibition is one of a kind the exhibition consists of photographs , letters and other documents from 250 germans who risked their lives giving jews food , shelter or a place to work from 1938 to 1945 . " there are many memorial sites dedicated to those targeted by the nazis , but there has never been one which is solely dedicated to these heroes , " said johannes tuchel , director of an umbrella organization for memorials of resistance to the nazis , which put the exhibition together . tuchel said the " silent heroes " exhibition had not opened sooner because the issue of resistance to the nazis was still sensitive in germany . " we are still in the early stages of our research , " he told the daily tagesspiegel .
he and his organization now plan to begin cooperating with eastern european archivists as well as colleagues at the yad vashem memorial in israel to extend the project . dw staff -lrb- jp -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

one proposal aims to support the struggling auto industry . addressing germany 's import-export federation bga in berlin on wednesday , oct .
29 , merkel said the package would include incentives for investment rather than being just a broad-based rise in government spending . " it will be targeted , it will be courageous and above all it will be sustainable , " merkel said of the upcoming measures .
" a quick flash in the pan can not truly help our economy . " she also stepped up pressure for next month 's g20 summit in washington to agree on a brief for negotiations on financial-market regulation .
those world negotiations ought not to take longer than a year , she said . to give direct help to small and medium-sized enterprises -lrb- smes -rrb- , the german economy ministry set up a hotline for smes having problems with financing because of the international crisis . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : business owners can call a finance ministry official during regular business hours " we do not want to leave smes to fend for themselves in this situation , and we will offer support where it is possible , " economy minister michael glos said in a statement . germany is to boost the ailing car industry by reducing its taxes on low-emission cars , merkel 's spokesman ulrich wilhelm said . the vehicle-tax changes to be adopted by merkel 's cabinet next week would be part of a program to boost the flagging economy . the disclosure follows days of debate in berlin about whether to increase government spending , cut taxes or both to ease the effects of an approaching slump . promoting cleaner cars wilhelm gave no details but said the package would be a " well-adjusted concept . " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the proposal would work to get heavily polluting cars off the road the proposal was " concretely " planned to alter the scale of vehicle tax , so tax rates were no longer keyed to a vehicle 's engine size but instead to the engine 's level of emissions , finance ministry spokesman torsten albig said . environmentalists have pressed for the change , saying it will encourage owners of polluting cars to scrap them and thus help reduce carbon dioxide emissions blamed for global warming . senior german officials have said berlin will also offer new soft loans and grants to improve building insulation , tax deductions for home-improvement work and changes in the amortization rule for taxes . eu on board eu industry commissioner guenter verheugen threw his weight wednesday behind a call to give the bloc 's carmakers cheap loans worth up to 40 billion euros to develop eco-friendly cars through the financial crisis . " we are in a situation where it is getting harder for big european businesses to get credit , " verheugen said .
" it is not a question of hand-outs , it 's a question of the european investment bank making available a low-interest credit program . " the european carmakers association acea said the industry needed state help .

as unemployment rises , some countries look to restrict visas , which could push more people to enter europe illegally . spain 's building boom drew africans to the southern european country by the hundreds of thousands in recent years .
many of these workers were the first to be laid off when spain 's real estate market cooled earlier this year .
spain , a country which welcomed 1 million immigrants in 2007 , now finds itself with 11.3 percent unemployment , the euro zone 's highest .
this has lead spain to slam the door on further immigration with laws aimed at cutting the number of work permits , restricting family reunion visas , and offering money to unemployed foreigners to go home .
spain is not alone in grappling with how to deal with migrant workers .
the international labor organization predicts that 20 million jobs will disappear worldwide by the end of next year .
countries across europe are considering more restrictive immigration measures .
europe warns against ejecting workers yet simply sending workers home wo n't help the situation , the united nations has warned .
it will simply decrease the number of legal immigrants and increase the number of illegal immigration .
to try and prevent that , the european union launched a 15 million euro -lrb- $ 18.70 million -rrb- initiative on tuesday , oct .
28 together with the un to try and protect migrant workers during the current economic crisis .
the program was launched on the sidelines of the global forum on migration and development in manila .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : many people migrate looking for job opportunities rich countries should not try to restrict migration from poor countries , even during the economic slowdown , peter sutherland , the un secretary general 's special representative on migration , warned .
" we 've seen how ineffective simple prohibition policies in regard to migration actually are , " he said .
" they do n't really work .
migrants migrate .
they will find a way , one way or another to do it . "
the number of migrants in the world is now estimated to be 40 million , 25 percent of whom are illegal , with the united states having the most migrants , according to sharan burrow , president of the international trade union confederation .
" our fear is that those numbers will increase , " burrow said at the opening of the four-day migration forum in manila .
britain looks to tighten immigration rising unemployment in the uk means that the country needs to consider restricting immigration , british immigration minister phil woolas recently told the times newspaper .
" if people are being made unemployed , the question of immigration becomes extremely thorny ... it 's been too easy to get into this country in the past and it 's going to get harder , " woolas said .
many european migrants from new eu member countries have come to britain in the past four years .
but there are some signs that many are heading home as the crisis hits , reuters recently reported .
the british government has considerred immigration reform which would have put into place an australian-style point system to let in highly-skilled workers but restrict access for unskilled migrants .
europe remains under pressure bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : many polish workers have headed west in search of work while officias say that they have not yet seen numbers of illegal immigrants spike globally , there are signs that european countries continue to be under pressure from illegal immigrants .
on monday , about 400 illegal immigrants were detained by italians as they tried to land on the italian island of lampedusa .
an additional 280 illegal immigrants had made landfall on the island over the weekend , according to the coast guard .
there has been a sharp increase in the number of people trying to enter italy by sea , according to figures from the interior ministry , which so far this year totals 23,600 .
afp news agency puts the number of immigrants who have tried to reach italy in october at 2,800 .
in greece , 10,000 would-be immigrants have been arrested trying to enter the country illegally during the first nine months of this year , compared to 9,240 last year , according to afp . dw staff -lrb- th -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

a comprehensive recovery plan is also in the works , but there 's no guarantee the moves will stave off recession . the european commission said on wednesday , oct .
29 , it was extending 6.5 billion euros -lrb- $ 8.4 billion -rrb- in emergency credit to hungary . the eastern european country , which does not have the euro , has run into liquidity problems due to the devaluation of its currency amidst the global economic crisis .
the hungarian forint has lost almost 20 percent of its value in the past month against the euro and the dollar . " we all know that some other eu member states and some neighbors of the eu are under stress in their financial and exchange-rate markets , and we are ready to act , " said eu economic and monetary affairs commissioner joaquin almunia . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the borders with neighboring eu states are gone , but hungary has yet to get the euro the eu also raised the amount available to non-euro member states for emergency balance-of-payments aid from 12 billion euros to 25 billion euros . eu commission chief jose manuel barroso said the increase demonstrated the solidarity among the bloc 's members . " we also stand ready to provide substantial medium-term financial assistance to other member states experiencing balance-of-payments pressures or serious financial stability risks , " barroso said . the eu 's three baltic members as well as bulgaria and romania are currently battling serious deficits , although none has formally asked the union for credit help . the plan , the plan ! bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : barroso says it 's all for one and one for all but the bloc has also acknowledged that loans alone wo n't be enough to keep the eu from sliding into recession .
barroso said the eu executive would present a " comprehensive european union recovery plan " on nov .
26 . that plan is set to include increasing funds available to the european investment bank to make loans to small and medium-sized businesses . other idea that have been suggested are to make it easier for unemployed people to access eu funds to start businesses and to ensure that other european funds available for public investment are being used effectively . another key , barroso said , was innovation . " we need to find innovative funding for a wide range of transport , energy and high- technology networks which can provide jobs in the short-term and also contribute to sustainable growth in the long-term , " he added . proactive vs. protection bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the eu thinks small businesses , such as this newspaper shop , are crucial brussels is clearly worried the financial crisis could cause unemployment , which would then send europe 's economies into worse of a downward spiral . many individual member states , including germany , have developed national recovery plans .
but the commission chief warned against country-first , bloc-second economic policies . " the global financial crisis is not an excuse for protectionism : trade barriers ship out prosperity and open the gates instead to short-term economic populism , " barroso said . he also cautioned against the idea that the best approach would be to pump government money into industry on the national level . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the recovery plan is aimed at keeping the eu afloat " it would be a mistake to think that the solution for the current crisis is a public subsidizing of all the problems we have , " barroso said . he stressed that the various national economies were inevitably linked to one another . " on the real economy , as on the financial markets , we must swim together or we will sink together , " barroso said .

a comprehensive recovery plan is also in the works , but there 's no guarantee the moves will stave off recession . the european commission said on wednesday , oct .
29 , it was extending 6.5 billion euros -lrb- $ 8.4 billion -rrb- in emergency credit to hungary . the eastern european country , which does not have the euro , has run into liquidity problems due to the devaluation of its currency amidst the global economic crisis .
the hungarian forint has lost almost 20 percent of its value in the past month against the euro and the dollar . " we all know that some other eu member states and some neighbors of the eu are under stress in their financial and exchange-rate markets , and we are ready to act , " said eu economic and monetary affairs commissioner joaquin almunia . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the borders with neighboring eu states are gone , but hungary has yet to get the euro the eu also raised the amount available to non-euro member states for emergency balance-of-payments aid from 12 billion euros to 25 billion euros . eu commission chief jose manuel barroso said the increase demonstrated the solidarity among the bloc 's members . " we also stand ready to provide substantial medium-term financial assistance to other member states experiencing balance-of-payments pressures or serious financial stability risks , " barroso said . the eu 's three baltic members as well as bulgaria and romania are currently battling serious deficits , although none has formally asked the union for credit help . the plan , the plan ! bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : barroso says it 's all for one and one for all but the bloc has also acknowledged that loans alone wo n't be enough to keep the eu from sliding into recession .
barroso said the eu executive would present a " comprehensive european union recovery plan " on nov .
26 . that plan is set to include increasing funds available to the european investment bank to make loans to small and medium-sized businesses . other idea that have been suggested are to make it easier for unemployed people to access eu funds to start businesses and to ensure that other european funds available for public investment are being used effectively . another key , barroso said , was innovation . " we need to find innovative funding for a wide range of transport , energy and high- technology networks which can provide jobs in the short-term and also contribute to sustainable growth in the long-term , " he added . proactive vs. protection bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the eu thinks small businesses , such as this newspaper shop , are crucial brussels is clearly worried the financial crisis could cause unemployment , which would then send europe 's economies into worse of a downward spiral . many individual member states , including germany , have developed national recovery plans .
but the commission chief warned against country-first , bloc-second economic policies . " the global financial crisis is not an excuse for protectionism : trade barriers ship out prosperity and open the gates instead to short-term economic populism , " barroso said . he also cautioned against the idea that the best approach would be to pump government money into industry on the national level . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the recovery plan is aimed at keeping the eu afloat " it would be a mistake to think that the solution for the current crisis is a public subsidizing of all the problems we have , " barroso said . he stressed that the various national economies were inevitably linked to one another . " on the real economy , as on the financial markets , we must swim together or we will sink together , " barroso said .

it may also become the owner of austrian airlines . lufthansa already holds minority stakes in both eurowings and bmi , which was formerly named british midland .
high fuel prices earlier this year and a looming recession have put heavy pressure on smaller , weaker airlines in recent weeks , speeding up consolidation in the aviation industry . in frankfurt , lufthansa said on wednesday , oct .
29 , that it had received an offer from another eurowings shareholder , ak industriebeteiligung , for 50.9 percent of the airline and this would be acquired by the end of the year . earlier plans to merge eurowings , which mainly flies routes within europe , with an airline run by german travel company tui failed . control of bmi is to be acquired from businessman michael bishop , lufthansa said .
the british airline 's landing and takeoff slots at heathrow airport , the principal london airport , add to its value to lufthansa . in a third possible merger , lufthansa was also the only company to put in a binding bid for austrian airlines earlier this week . financial crisis bites into lufthansa profits the pair of lufthansa takeovers comes on the heels of a profit warning issued by the company tuesday . lufthansa said that it expects operational earnings this year to total just 1.1 billion euros -lrb- $ 1.4 billion -rrb- , down from its past forecast of 1.4 billion euros and blamed the drop on high fuel costs and weakened sales due to the global financial crisis . the airline posted 149 million euros in net profit between july and september , while operating profit in the third quarter plunged by 53.4 percent to 279 million euros , the company said in a statement . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : mayrhuber is confident that lufthansa has the tools to survive " this is a respectable result taking into consideration the considerable strains being felt as a result of the ongoing crisis in the financial markets and the overall economic situation , " chairman wolfgang mayrhuber said .
" in addition , we are working on our productivity , our measures to improve fuel consumption and the reduction of external costs . " in the first nine months of the year , operating profit fell by 9.3 percent to 984 million euros .
net profit during the same period plummeted by 65.1 percent to 551 million euros . the company 's results had been inflated in 2007 by lufthansa 's acquisition of the airline swiss and the sale of its stake in the british travel group thomas cook . swiss suffered heavy losses during the third quarter , with operating profit sinking by 76 percent to 112 million euros . lufthansa forecast only minor growth in passenger numbers due to market turmoil , expecting them to rise by just 0.8 percent in 2009 versus 5.2 percent this year . degrees of suffering the lufthansa figures follow on from seemingly endless bad news coming from europe 's airline industry . the denmark-based low-cost carrier sterling airways filed for bankruptcy on tuesday while air france-klm last week said it would struggle to meet its billion-euro earnings target and that it would trim its investment plans . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : alitalia is one european airline currently suffering the future of ailing italian carrier alitalia also remained uncertain .
the airline , which is 49.9 percent state-owned , is losing about three million euros a day and has debts totaling some 1.2 billion euros , which will have to be shouldered by the italian taxpayer .
however , it could be saved by british airways which earlier this month reiterated the company 's interest in a partnership with alitalia . non-european airlines were feeling the strain too , with carriers worldwide expected to lose around $ 5.2 billion this year owing to sharply higher oil prices and declining demand , the industry association iata said on october 17 , with losses expected to continue next year . dw staff -lrb- nda -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

" it is just a stone 's throw away from a former paintbrush-making factory , where anti-nazi activist otto weidt illegally gave deaf and blind jews shelter and an opportunity to work during hitler 's reign , " he told the daily berliner zeitung .
" this house is the only authentic location in germany in which to remember these silent heroes . " a " tiny minority " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : a small number of germans hid jews from the nazis the term is used by historians to describe the germans who opposed hitler 's racist policies and helped jews escape nazi persecution .
the names of just 3,000 " silent heroes " are officially known , but historians believe more cases remain unrecorded . according to some estimates , 20,000 people across the country are thought to have offered their jewish fellow citizens some form of support and refuge during the nazi years .
the german population numbered some 70 million at the time . by end of world war ii , approximately 6 million european jews were killed as part of the nazi program of deliberate extermination led by adolf hitler . compared to the number of people who allowed nazi atrocities to happen or even took part in them , the people who shielded jews were " a tiny minority , " stressed berlin mayor klaus wowereit , who attended the opening . " but it is this minority that gives us direction , " he said .
" by commemorating these courageous people we are ensuring that attacks on human dignity will not be tolerated . " a sensitive issue bildunterschrift : the exhibition is one of a kind the exhibition consists of photographs , letters and other documents from 250 germans who risked their lives giving jews food , shelter or a place to work from 1938 to 1945 . " there are many memorial sites dedicated to those targeted by the nazis , but there has never been one which is solely dedicated to these heroes , " said johannes tuchel , director of an umbrella organization for memorials of resistance to the nazis , which put the exhibition together . tuchel said the " silent heroes " exhibition had not opened sooner because the issue of resistance to the nazis was still sensitive in germany . " we are still in the early stages of our research , " he told the daily tagesspiegel .
he and his organization now plan to begin cooperating with eastern european archivists as well as colleagues at the yad vashem memorial in israel to extend the project . dw staff -lrb- jp -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

the hooksiel plant is intended as a prototype for a park with 80 turbines 100 kilometers off the coast of the north sea island of borkum , construction on which is to begin early next year .
the netherlands and denmark already have offshore wind farms , while last week saw britain declared a world leader in wind power generation , as its government announced a major program to cut the cost of off-shore wind farms .

progress bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : denmark has been overtaken by britain as the world 's wind power leader " offshore wind power is of key importance for our future energy supply and a decisive factor in achieving our expansion goals for renewable energy , " gabriel said .
" the start of operations at this pilot plant is an important step that shows we are making progress . "
the hooksiel plant is intended as a prototype for a park with 80 turbines 100 kilometers off the coast of the north sea island of borkum , construction on which is to begin early next year .
the netherlands and denmark already have offshore wind farms , while last week saw britain declared a world leader in wind power generation , as its government announced a major program to cut the cost of off-shore wind farms .
also on board the scheme are five international players in the offshore wind industry , including german rwe innogy .

the share of renewable energy used in the production of electricity grew to 14 percent in 2007 from 11.5 percent the previous year , according to the german government , which has targeted 30 percent by 2020 , the most ambitious target in the eu .
by 2030 , germany hopes to be providing 15 percent of households with electricity produced at offshore wind farms , the equivalent of around 25,000 megawatts . dw staff -lrb- jp -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

but the luxury carmaker now also has to counter suspicions of manipulation . what goes up must come down - that was the motto of porsche 's share liquidity initiative on the german stock exchange , the dax , on wednesday , oct .
29 .
porsche 's willingness to make vw stocks available to investors immediately caused prices , which had zoomed up to over 1,000 euros -lrb- $ 1,250 -rrb- on tuesday , to tumble .
by midday , vw shares had lost 38 percent , having fallen from their opening level of 945 euros to 588 .
porsche representatives said the action was necessary to restore a measure of stability to vw share prices .
and they denied that their company was profiting from the rollercoaster ride .
" we want to ensure that prices return to a sensible level , " a porsche spokesman told the online portal of the german financial periodical manager-magazin .
" we do n't want to cash in on vw .
calming things down is what 's in our interest . "
ironically , the action became necessary precisely because porsche ambitions vis-a-vis vw had created an emergency shortage of the latter carmaker 's stock .
larger goal remains bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : porsche says it still intends to move in on vw vw share prices skyrocketed because investors underestimated the extent to which porsche had acquired volkswagen stocks and options .
last weekend , porsche announced that it controlled 74 percent of vw shares .
that left speculators who had sold the stock short or borrowed it in a position of having to buy whatever shares were available at vastly inflated prices .
by law , the german state of lower saxony where volkswagen 's headquarters are located owns 20.1 percent of company 's shares .
porsche 's decision on wednesday to cancel up to five percent of its guarantees dramatically improves vw share availability , but it does not represent a fundamental change in porsche strategy .
porsche reaffirmed on wednesday its intention to acquire up to 75 percent of vw stock , either on exchange markets or by other means .
porsche 's own stock was up by around 10 percent at midday on wednesday . dw staff -lrb- jc -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

the five megawatts produced at the pilot site will flow into the gas and electrical station in the coastal city of wilhelmshaven , enough to serve 5,000 households .

the german population numbered some 70 million at the time . by end of world war ii , approximately 6 million european jews were killed as part of the nazi program of deliberate extermination led by adolf hitler . compared to the number of people who allowed nazi atrocities to happen or even took part in them , the people who shielded jews were " a tiny minority , " stressed berlin mayor klaus wowereit , who attended the opening . " but it is this minority that gives us direction , " he said .
" by commemorating these courageous people we are ensuring that attacks on human dignity will not be tolerated . " a sensitive issue bildunterschrift : the exhibition is one of a kind the exhibition consists of photographs , letters and other documents from 250 germans who risked their lives giving jews food , shelter or a place to work from 1938 to 1945 . " there are many memorial sites dedicated to those targeted by the nazis , but there has never been one which is solely dedicated to these heroes , " said johannes tuchel , director of an umbrella organization for memorials of resistance to the nazis , which put the exhibition together . tuchel said the " silent heroes " exhibition had not opened sooner because the issue of resistance to the nazis was still sensitive in germany . " we are still in the early stages of our research , " he told the daily tagesspiegel .
he and his organization now plan to begin cooperating with eastern european archivists as well as colleagues at the yad vashem memorial in israel to extend the project . dw staff -lrb- jp -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

the british airline 's landing and takeoff slots at heathrow airport , the principal london airport , add to its value to lufthansa . in a third possible merger , lufthansa was also the only company to put in a binding bid for austrian airlines earlier this week . financial crisis bites into lufthansa profits the pair of lufthansa takeovers comes on the heels of a profit warning issued by the company tuesday . lufthansa said that it expects operational earnings this year to total just 1.1 billion euros -lrb- $ 1.4 billion -rrb- , down from its past forecast of 1.4 billion euros and blamed the drop on high fuel costs and weakened sales due to the global financial crisis . the airline posted 149 million euros in net profit between july and september , while operating profit in the third quarter plunged by 53.4 percent to 279 million euros , the company said in a statement . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : mayrhuber is confident that lufthansa has the tools to survive " this is a respectable result taking into consideration the considerable strains being felt as a result of the ongoing crisis in the financial markets and the overall economic situation , " chairman wolfgang mayrhuber said .

net profit during the same period plummeted by 65.1 percent to 551 million euros . the company 's results had been inflated in 2007 by lufthansa 's acquisition of the airline swiss and the sale of its stake in the british travel group thomas cook . swiss suffered heavy losses during the third quarter , with operating profit sinking by 76 percent to 112 million euros . lufthansa forecast only minor growth in passenger numbers due to market turmoil , expecting them to rise by just 0.8 percent in 2009 versus 5.2 percent this year . degrees of suffering the lufthansa figures follow on from seemingly endless bad news coming from europe 's airline industry . the denmark-based low-cost carrier sterling airways filed for bankruptcy on tuesday while air france-klm last week said it would struggle to meet its billion-euro earnings target and that it would trim its investment plans . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : alitalia is one european airline currently suffering the future of ailing italian carrier alitalia also remained uncertain .
the airline , which is 49.9 percent state-owned , is losing about three million euros a day and has debts totaling some 1.2 billion euros , which will have to be shouldered by the italian taxpayer .
however , it could be saved by british airways which earlier this month reiterated the company 's interest in a partnership with alitalia . non-european airlines were feeling the strain too , with carriers worldwide expected to lose around $ 5.2 billion this year owing to sharply higher oil prices and declining demand , the industry association iata said on october 17 , with losses expected to continue next year . dw staff -lrb- nda -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de exchange rates -pipe- 29.10.2008 falling euro may signal deeper eu woes großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : a dollar will buy more euros these days euro zone members have watched their currency fall sharply against the dollar in recent days , as forex markets react to the complex global financial crisis .
but observers disagree on the possible effects of the decline . analysts took conflicting lessons from the euro 's fall to two-and-a-half-year lows , with some saying the fall is a short-term problem that could help boost exports , while others saw it as a sign of serious policy discord in the 15-nation euro zone .
in european trading on tuesday , oct .
28 , the euro touched a low of $ 1.23 - the last time it was so weak was in april , 2006 - before reaching $ 1.25 in asian trading .
the currency fell even farther against the yen ; in all it weakened against 14 of the 16 most active currencies .
analysts attributed the drop to a number of factors , including the widespread perception that europe 's economy is on the brink of a recession and the expectation that european central bank president jean-claude trichet may soon lower interest rates .
' a question of politics ' exchanges rates are n't just a question of economics , " it is a question of politics , " said ognian hishow , a german economist who is currently a visiting professor at the university of rochester .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the last time the euro fell so low was in april , 2006 " once the world starts to get suspicious of a given player - like the euro zone now - then they will look for an alternative for where to put their money , " he said .
" right now , the only good alternative is the us dollar . "
alexandra boehne , a finance expert for the german chamber of commerce , noted that the falling euro reflects the growing concern over the extent of the european financial crisis .
" no one knows how the financial-market crisis will develop , how long it will continue and how bad the economy will get , " she said .
financial players have known about the economic crisis in the us since last year , but the news that europe is heavily affected is new to the market .
' the markets are insecure ' " people have only been aware of a problem in europe since the autumn of 2008 , " she said .
" the markets are very insecure right now . "
some analysts say european banks ' heavy exposure to credit-soaked emerging markets , particularly in eastern europe , has left the currency vulnerable .
bloomberg news service cited a report on tuesday that showed european banks ' lending to emerging markets is around 21 percent of europe 's gross domestic product , compared with 4 percent for the us and 5 percent for japan .
meanwhile there are other indicators that recession may be around the corner - including a ground-shaking report on monday that german consumer confidence had plunged to five-year lows . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the financial crisis : a game of dominos in the end , " investors conclude that america is still the most reliable destination when it comes to where to put your money in such rainy days , " hishow said .
not all analysts agree about the extent of the euro problem .
the chamber of commerce 's boehme said it could actually give germany 's giant export economy a boost by making things " made in germany , " like automobiles and chemicals , cheaper .
pessimism on export growth according to hishow , however , this would be the case if it were n't for the fact that germany 's main export markets - the us and the rest of europe - are stagnating .
" where can german companies sell their goods ?
in america ?
in latin america ? "
hishow asks rhetorically .
" in the dollar area it is impossible because of the downsizing there , and china , while its currency is pegged to the dollar , is facing hard times too , so there 's not enough help there , " he said .
" i 'm not optimistic . "
meanwhile christian dreger , an economist at the german institute for economics research -lrb- diw -rrb- , argues that the drop in the euro is merely a temporary blip .
compared to the 80 us cents that the euro was trading for in 2002 , the european currency is still strong , he notes .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : ecb head trichet : plans to cut rates ?
he expects the euro 's " short term drop " to reverse itself .
he calls the bout of euro-selling an " adjustment " to issues of monetary policy , namely " pressure on the euro because of potential for further interest rate cuts . "
upside for the dollar ?
dreger says he disagrees with the investors who are betting that europe will recover more slowly than the us .
he thinks they are overreacting to possible weakness in central european economies , and believes the euro will appreciate because " it will benefit more from catching-up processes in emerging markets like china and india , where the eu is heavily invested . "
economist hishow disagrees .
over time , he says , there will be a correction in the american trade balance and the dollar will improve .
moreover , he said he strongly believes the financial crisis and the falling euro are signals of deep underlying problems in the euro zone .
european integration at fault " this crisis is a proof of how incomplete european integration is , " he said .
" when there are hard times , there is no unified response . "
as examples he cites the vociferous controversy between germany and france on how to respond to the economic crisis , and points out that if anything , the euro zone countries are drifting apart economically . " they tend to act in self-interest first and foremost , " he said .
he predicts the dollar 's dominance as a reserve currency will continue unless europe manages to find a way to boost the process of integration .
" i know many europeans do n't like this conclusion , but it is the reality , " hishow said .
" so we have to accept it . " jennifer abramsohn send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

but observers disagree on the possible effects of the decline . analysts took conflicting lessons from the euro 's fall to two-and-a-half-year lows , with some saying the fall is a short-term problem that could help boost exports , while others saw it as a sign of serious policy discord in the 15-nation euro zone .
in european trading on tuesday , oct .
28 , the euro touched a low of $ 1.23 - the last time it was so weak was in april , 2006 - before reaching $ 1.25 in asian trading .
the currency fell even farther against the yen ; in all it weakened against 14 of the 16 most active currencies .
analysts attributed the drop to a number of factors , including the widespread perception that europe 's economy is on the brink of a recession and the expectation that european central bank president jean-claude trichet may soon lower interest rates .
' a question of politics ' exchanges rates are n't just a question of economics , " it is a question of politics , " said ognian hishow , a german economist who is currently a visiting professor at the university of rochester .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the last time the euro fell so low was in april , 2006 " once the world starts to get suspicious of a given player - like the euro zone now - then they will look for an alternative for where to put their money , " he said .
" right now , the only good alternative is the us dollar . "
alexandra boehne , a finance expert for the german chamber of commerce , noted that the falling euro reflects the growing concern over the extent of the european financial crisis .
" no one knows how the financial-market crisis will develop , how long it will continue and how bad the economy will get , " she said .
financial players have known about the economic crisis in the us since last year , but the news that europe is heavily affected is new to the market .
' the markets are insecure ' " people have only been aware of a problem in europe since the autumn of 2008 , " she said .
" the markets are very insecure right now . "
some analysts say european banks ' heavy exposure to credit-soaked emerging markets , particularly in eastern europe , has left the currency vulnerable .
bloomberg news service cited a report on tuesday that showed european banks ' lending to emerging markets is around 21 percent of europe 's gross domestic product , compared with 4 percent for the us and 5 percent for japan .
meanwhile there are other indicators that recession may be around the corner - including a ground-shaking report on monday that german consumer confidence had plunged to five-year lows . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the financial crisis : a game of dominos in the end , " investors conclude that america is still the most reliable destination when it comes to where to put your money in such rainy days , " hishow said .
not all analysts agree about the extent of the euro problem .
the chamber of commerce 's boehme said it could actually give germany 's giant export economy a boost by making things " made in germany , " like automobiles and chemicals , cheaper .
pessimism on export growth according to hishow , however , this would be the case if it were n't for the fact that germany 's main export markets - the us and the rest of europe - are stagnating .
" where can german companies sell their goods ?
in america ?
in latin america ? "
hishow asks rhetorically .
" in the dollar area it is impossible because of the downsizing there , and china , while its currency is pegged to the dollar , is facing hard times too , so there 's not enough help there , " he said .
" i 'm not optimistic . "
meanwhile christian dreger , an economist at the german institute for economics research -lrb- diw -rrb- , argues that the drop in the euro is merely a temporary blip .
compared to the 80 us cents that the euro was trading for in 2002 , the european currency is still strong , he notes .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : ecb head trichet : plans to cut rates ?
he expects the euro 's " short term drop " to reverse itself .
he calls the bout of euro-selling an " adjustment " to issues of monetary policy , namely " pressure on the euro because of potential for further interest rate cuts . "
upside for the dollar ?
dreger says he disagrees with the investors who are betting that europe will recover more slowly than the us .
he thinks they are overreacting to possible weakness in central european economies , and believes the euro will appreciate because " it will benefit more from catching-up processes in emerging markets like china and india , where the eu is heavily invested . "
economist hishow disagrees .
over time , he says , there will be a correction in the american trade balance and the dollar will improve .
moreover , he said he strongly believes the financial crisis and the falling euro are signals of deep underlying problems in the euro zone .
european integration at fault " this crisis is a proof of how incomplete european integration is , " he said .
" when there are hard times , there is no unified response . "
as examples he cites the vociferous controversy between germany and france on how to respond to the economic crisis , and points out that if anything , the euro zone countries are drifting apart economically . " they tend to act in self-interest first and foremost , " he said .
he predicts the dollar 's dominance as a reserve currency will continue unless europe manages to find a way to boost the process of integration .
" i know many europeans do n't like this conclusion , but it is the reality , " hishow said .

the currency fell even farther against the yen ; in all it weakened against 14 of the 16 most active currencies .
analysts attributed the drop to a number of factors , including the widespread perception that europe 's economy is on the brink of a recession and the expectation that european central bank president jean-claude trichet may soon lower interest rates .
' a question of politics ' exchanges rates are n't just a question of economics , " it is a question of politics , " said ognian hishow , a german economist who is currently a visiting professor at the university of rochester .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the last time the euro fell so low was in april , 2006 " once the world starts to get suspicious of a given player - like the euro zone now - then they will look for an alternative for where to put their money , " he said .
" right now , the only good alternative is the us dollar . "
alexandra boehne , a finance expert for the german chamber of commerce , noted that the falling euro reflects the growing concern over the extent of the european financial crisis .
" no one knows how the financial-market crisis will develop , how long it will continue and how bad the economy will get , " she said .
financial players have known about the economic crisis in the us since last year , but the news that europe is heavily affected is new to the market .
' the markets are insecure ' " people have only been aware of a problem in europe since the autumn of 2008 , " she said .
" the markets are very insecure right now . "
some analysts say european banks ' heavy exposure to credit-soaked emerging markets , particularly in eastern europe , has left the currency vulnerable .
bloomberg news service cited a report on tuesday that showed european banks ' lending to emerging markets is around 21 percent of europe 's gross domestic product , compared with 4 percent for the us and 5 percent for japan .
meanwhile there are other indicators that recession may be around the corner - including a ground-shaking report on monday that german consumer confidence had plunged to five-year lows . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the financial crisis : a game of dominos in the end , " investors conclude that america is still the most reliable destination when it comes to where to put your money in such rainy days , " hishow said .
not all analysts agree about the extent of the euro problem .
the chamber of commerce 's boehme said it could actually give germany 's giant export economy a boost by making things " made in germany , " like automobiles and chemicals , cheaper .
pessimism on export growth according to hishow , however , this would be the case if it were n't for the fact that germany 's main export markets - the us and the rest of europe - are stagnating .
" where can german companies sell their goods ?
in america ?
in latin america ? "
hishow asks rhetorically .
" in the dollar area it is impossible because of the downsizing there , and china , while its currency is pegged to the dollar , is facing hard times too , so there 's not enough help there , " he said .
" i 'm not optimistic . "
meanwhile christian dreger , an economist at the german institute for economics research -lrb- diw -rrb- , argues that the drop in the euro is merely a temporary blip .
compared to the 80 us cents that the euro was trading for in 2002 , the european currency is still strong , he notes .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : ecb head trichet : plans to cut rates ?
he expects the euro 's " short term drop " to reverse itself .
he calls the bout of euro-selling an " adjustment " to issues of monetary policy , namely " pressure on the euro because of potential for further interest rate cuts . "
upside for the dollar ?
dreger says he disagrees with the investors who are betting that europe will recover more slowly than the us .
he thinks they are overreacting to possible weakness in central european economies , and believes the euro will appreciate because " it will benefit more from catching-up processes in emerging markets like china and india , where the eu is heavily invested . "
economist hishow disagrees .
over time , he says , there will be a correction in the american trade balance and the dollar will improve .
moreover , he said he strongly believes the financial crisis and the falling euro are signals of deep underlying problems in the euro zone .
european integration at fault " this crisis is a proof of how incomplete european integration is , " he said .
" when there are hard times , there is no unified response . "
as examples he cites the vociferous controversy between germany and france on how to respond to the economic crisis , and points out that if anything , the euro zone countries are drifting apart economically . " they tend to act in self-interest first and foremost , " he said .
he predicts the dollar 's dominance as a reserve currency will continue unless europe manages to find a way to boost the process of integration .
" i know many europeans do n't like this conclusion , but it is the reality , " hishow said .

but observers disagree on the possible effects of the decline . analysts took conflicting lessons from the euro 's fall to two-and-a-half-year lows , with some saying the fall is a short-term problem that could help boost exports , while others saw it as a sign of serious policy discord in the 15-nation euro zone .

the summit comes in the wake of last week 's decision by the south- western dutch towns of roosendaal and bergen op zoom to gradually close their local " coffee shops " in an attempt to reduce drug-related crimes .
all dutch cities and towns close to the german or belgian borders are invited to the summit .
after the summit , the vng will present the cities ' common position to the government .
the goal , according to vng , is to get the government to negotiate an international soft drugs policy with belgium and germany .
the netherlands effectively decriminalized soft drugs a few decades ago when it introduced a policy of " non-enforcement . "
although possession and cultivation of cannabis remains technically illegal in holland , law enforcement has systematically turned a blind eye , and the courts usually rule in favor of individual defendants .
the sale and use of so-called soft drugs , such as marijuana , is legal in designated stores , usually referred to as " coffee shops . "
maastricht suffering most from drug-related crime maastricht mayor gerd leers calls the current dutch drugs policy " hypocritical . "
he says it enables drug-related crime and also increases the sale and distribution of hard drugs , such as heroin .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : a police officer talks to a french drug tourist in maastricht maastricht is one of the dutch cities suffering most from drug- related crime .
the city is visited by more than 1.5 million drugs tourists per year and has 16 " coffee shops , " 10 more than in dutch cities of comparable size not located close to the border .
police estimate maastricht also has more than 100 " soft drugs supermarkets , " illegal stores where one can purchase soft drugs in larger quantities than the 5 grams per person allowed under dutch law .
leers says police officers in his city deal with triple the amount of crime as their colleagues in the metropolitan area of the hague .
most of the crime in maastricht is drug-related , and the number of drug-related murders each year is increasing , according to police officials .
german cross-border smokers favor enschede bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : drug tourism could go up in smoke the town of enschede has been particularly problematic for local authorities , because of its immediate proximity to the german border .
thousands of drug tourists , mainly from germany , pour across the border each year for a taste of legal marijuana .
the netherlands have considered many ways in the past to deter drug tourism , such as restricting the sale of soft drugs to dutch nationals by demanding coffee shops ask to see passports while political pressure has led to a decline in the number of coffee shops .
the last official figures showed that the netherlands had 740 coffee shops in 2004 compared to 1,180 in 1997 .
but it is unclear whether the reduction in the number of coffee shops has actually resulted in a decrease in drug consumption and drug tourism . dw staff -lrb- nda -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

28 that it will host a soft drugs summit in the third week of november in maastricht .
participants will seek ways to discourage tourists who visit the netherlands to take advantage of its liberal drug laws .
by extension , the summit also seeks to reduce drug-related crime .
the summit comes in the wake of last week 's decision by the south- western dutch towns of roosendaal and bergen op zoom to gradually close their local " coffee shops " in an attempt to reduce drug-related crimes .
all dutch cities and towns close to the german or belgian borders are invited to the summit .
after the summit , the vng will present the cities ' common position to the government .
the goal , according to vng , is to get the government to negotiate an international soft drugs policy with belgium and germany .
the netherlands effectively decriminalized soft drugs a few decades ago when it introduced a policy of " non-enforcement . "
although possession and cultivation of cannabis remains technically illegal in holland , law enforcement has systematically turned a blind eye , and the courts usually rule in favor of individual defendants .
the sale and use of so-called soft drugs , such as marijuana , is legal in designated stores , usually referred to as " coffee shops . "
maastricht suffering most from drug-related crime maastricht mayor gerd leers calls the current dutch drugs policy " hypocritical . "
he says it enables drug-related crime and also increases the sale and distribution of hard drugs , such as heroin .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : a police officer talks to a french drug tourist in maastricht maastricht is one of the dutch cities suffering most from drug- related crime .
the city is visited by more than 1.5 million drugs tourists per year and has 16 " coffee shops , " 10 more than in dutch cities of comparable size not located close to the border .
police estimate maastricht also has more than 100 " soft drugs supermarkets , " illegal stores where one can purchase soft drugs in larger quantities than the 5 grams per person allowed under dutch law .
leers says police officers in his city deal with triple the amount of crime as their colleagues in the metropolitan area of the hague .
most of the crime in maastricht is drug-related , and the number of drug-related murders each year is increasing , according to police officials .
german cross-border smokers favor enschede bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : drug tourism could go up in smoke the town of enschede has been particularly problematic for local authorities , because of its immediate proximity to the german border .
thousands of drug tourists , mainly from germany , pour across the border each year for a taste of legal marijuana .
the netherlands have considered many ways in the past to deter drug tourism , such as restricting the sale of soft drugs to dutch nationals by demanding coffee shops ask to see passports while political pressure has led to a decline in the number of coffee shops .
the last official figures showed that the netherlands had 740 coffee shops in 2004 compared to 1,180 in 1997 .
but it is unclear whether the reduction in the number of coffee shops has actually resulted in a decrease in drug consumption and drug tourism . dw staff -lrb- nda -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

looking more like something out of thousand and one nights than ring of the nibelung , the venue was hardly evocative of the hard seats filled by worshipful wagnerians at the german composer 's opera house in the bavarian town of bayreuth .
when the final tones of twilight of the gods faded on saturday evening - part of a wagner gala by the bayreuth festival orchestra under conductor christian thielemann - the minor sensation was complete : the emirate had inaugurated the abu dhabi classics , a first in the gulf states .
but what would richard wagner have thought ?
top acts the concert marked another step in abu dhabi 's mission to become a cultural capital .
a total of 22 concerts are scheduled until the season 's end in may 2009 .
among the guest artists will be top-flight stars dear to classical music fans : lang lang and cecilia bartoli , zubin mehta and lorin maazel , the vienna philharmonic and the philharmonic orchestra of london , the cellist misha maisky and pianist arcadi volodos , bobby mcferrin and till broenner .
the abu dhabi classics will run until 2012 at least , and its concerts will be integrated into the educational programm of schools in abu dhabi , the largest emirate of the united arab emirates -lrb- uae -rrb- .
new markets bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : katharina wagner on hand for the premiere was katharina wagner , who was recently named co-director of the annual bayreuth festival and is seeking new markets for bayreuth and her great-grandfather 's music .
she announced that the bayreuth festival orchestra would , in future , be performing away from home once a year .
" we intend to revive this tradition , " wagner said , adding that entire productions , such as the ring of the nibelung , might be exported .
she did not rule out directing a production herself in abu dhabi at some time .
building bridges abu dhabi 's new music event aims to " build bridges , " say culture officials in the emirate .
the fabulously rich oil producer sees the creation of a music scene modeled after those in the west as a way to secure its place in the globalised world .
following years of construction , " the new generation of rulers wants to take a further step , " remarked zaki nusseibeh , deputy chairman of the abu dhabi authority for culture and heritage -lrb- adach -rrb- .
the uae 's longtime ruler , sheik zayed bin sultan al nahyan , died four years ago and was succeeded by a son .
with 10 percent of the world 's oil reserves , abu dhabi looks as though it will enjoy oil income for some time to come .
it has a population of about 800,000 and is somewhat smaller than the german state of bavaria .
cultural diversity bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : abu dhabi is set to host a branch of the louvre museum abu dhabi already boasts a literature prize and film festival , and is currently having 100 books by western authors translated into arabic .
" we spend a lot of money on culture , " noted abdulla salim al amri , director of arts and culture at the adch .
he declined to specify a figure , saying that " any amount you name is ok . "
every day , abu dhabi produces oil valued at some 240 million euros .
off its coast , on saadiyat island , abu dhabi is developing a cultural district that will likely have no equal worldwide .
covering an area of 27 square kilometers and expected to be completed in 2018 , it will include four museums , a performing arts center , housing for 150,000 people , a golf course , and a marina .
one of the museums , an outpost of the paris-based louvre , is a shell flooded with light designed by french architect jean nouvel .
frank gehry , architect of the celebrated guggenheim museum bilbao , has designed an eighth branch of the new york-based museum for saadiyat island .
the performing arts center , a gigantic leaf-like structure of glass and concrete designed by zaha hadid , will contain an opera house , concert hall , and music hall for up to 6,300 spectators .
norman foster is contributing a national museum , and japan 's tadeo ando has designed a museum dedicated to the uae 's maritime past .
so it was probably only a matter of time until abu dhabi latched on to wagner , tchaikovsky and co .
the german connection bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the concert was held in the luxury emirates palace germany 's till janczukowicz , executive artistic director of the abu dhabi classics , presented the emirate with a plan and managed within a few months to sign top artists who are booked for years in advance .
curiosity , and not only money , attracted them to the gulf , he said .
abu dhabi had seen european orchestras before , most recently the dresden state orchestra of saxony .
the new york philharmonic will perform in the emirate next year .
the arab world has a special affinity for the romanticist wagner , nusseibeh noted .
in his opera " parsifal , " for instance , the german composer distilled his longing for the orient , he said .
arabs ' fondness for wagner has nothing to do with his " ideology , " nusseibeh added , referring to wagner 's strident anti-semitism .
" the arab world is n't part of this debate , " he said .
foreigners made up the bulk of the some 1,000 people who came to saturday evening 's premiere at the emirates palace hotel .

looking more like something out of thousand and one nights than ring of the nibelung , the venue was hardly evocative of the hard seats filled by worshipful wagnerians at the german composer 's opera house in the bavarian town of bayreuth .
when the final tones of twilight of the gods faded on saturday evening - part of a wagner gala by the bayreuth festival orchestra under conductor christian thielemann - the minor sensation was complete : the emirate had inaugurated the abu dhabi classics , a first in the gulf states .
but what would richard wagner have thought ?
top acts the concert marked another step in abu dhabi 's mission to become a cultural capital .
a total of 22 concerts are scheduled until the season 's end in may 2009 .
among the guest artists will be top-flight stars dear to classical music fans : lang lang and cecilia bartoli , zubin mehta and lorin maazel , the vienna philharmonic and the philharmonic orchestra of london , the cellist misha maisky and pianist arcadi volodos , bobby mcferrin and till broenner .
the abu dhabi classics will run until 2012 at least , and its concerts will be integrated into the educational programm of schools in abu dhabi , the largest emirate of the united arab emirates -lrb- uae -rrb- .
new markets bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : katharina wagner on hand for the premiere was katharina wagner , who was recently named co-director of the annual bayreuth festival and is seeking new markets for bayreuth and her great-grandfather 's music .
she announced that the bayreuth festival orchestra would , in future , be performing away from home once a year .
" we intend to revive this tradition , " wagner said , adding that entire productions , such as the ring of the nibelung , might be exported .
she did not rule out directing a production herself in abu dhabi at some time .
building bridges abu dhabi 's new music event aims to " build bridges , " say culture officials in the emirate .
the fabulously rich oil producer sees the creation of a music scene modeled after those in the west as a way to secure its place in the globalised world .
following years of construction , " the new generation of rulers wants to take a further step , " remarked zaki nusseibeh , deputy chairman of the abu dhabi authority for culture and heritage -lrb- adach -rrb- .
the uae 's longtime ruler , sheik zayed bin sultan al nahyan , died four years ago and was succeeded by a son .
with 10 percent of the world 's oil reserves , abu dhabi looks as though it will enjoy oil income for some time to come .
it has a population of about 800,000 and is somewhat smaller than the german state of bavaria .
cultural diversity bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : abu dhabi is set to host a branch of the louvre museum abu dhabi already boasts a literature prize and film festival , and is currently having 100 books by western authors translated into arabic .
" we spend a lot of money on culture , " noted abdulla salim al amri , director of arts and culture at the adch .
he declined to specify a figure , saying that " any amount you name is ok . "
every day , abu dhabi produces oil valued at some 240 million euros .
off its coast , on saadiyat island , abu dhabi is developing a cultural district that will likely have no equal worldwide .
covering an area of 27 square kilometers and expected to be completed in 2018 , it will include four museums , a performing arts center , housing for 150,000 people , a golf course , and a marina .
one of the museums , an outpost of the paris-based louvre , is a shell flooded with light designed by french architect jean nouvel .
frank gehry , architect of the celebrated guggenheim museum bilbao , has designed an eighth branch of the new york-based museum for saadiyat island .
the performing arts center , a gigantic leaf-like structure of glass and concrete designed by zaha hadid , will contain an opera house , concert hall , and music hall for up to 6,300 spectators .
norman foster is contributing a national museum , and japan 's tadeo ando has designed a museum dedicated to the uae 's maritime past .
so it was probably only a matter of time until abu dhabi latched on to wagner , tchaikovsky and co .
the german connection bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the concert was held in the luxury emirates palace germany 's till janczukowicz , executive artistic director of the abu dhabi classics , presented the emirate with a plan and managed within a few months to sign top artists who are booked for years in advance .
curiosity , and not only money , attracted them to the gulf , he said .
abu dhabi had seen european orchestras before , most recently the dresden state orchestra of saxony .
the new york philharmonic will perform in the emirate next year .
the arab world has a special affinity for the romanticist wagner , nusseibeh noted .
in his opera " parsifal , " for instance , the german composer distilled his longing for the orient , he said .
arabs ' fondness for wagner has nothing to do with his " ideology , " nusseibeh added , referring to wagner 's strident anti-semitism .
" the arab world is n't part of this debate , " he said .
foreigners made up the bulk of the some 1,000 people who came to saturday evening 's premiere at the emirates palace hotel .

top acts the concert marked another step in abu dhabi 's mission to become a cultural capital .
a total of 22 concerts are scheduled until the season 's end in may 2009 .
among the guest artists will be top-flight stars dear to classical music fans : lang lang and cecilia bartoli , zubin mehta and lorin maazel , the vienna philharmonic and the philharmonic orchestra of london , the cellist misha maisky and pianist arcadi volodos , bobby mcferrin and till broenner .
the abu dhabi classics will run until 2012 at least , and its concerts will be integrated into the educational programm of schools in abu dhabi , the largest emirate of the united arab emirates -lrb- uae -rrb- .
new markets bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : katharina wagner on hand for the premiere was katharina wagner , who was recently named co-director of the annual bayreuth festival and is seeking new markets for bayreuth and her great-grandfather 's music .
she announced that the bayreuth festival orchestra would , in future , be performing away from home once a year .
" we intend to revive this tradition , " wagner said , adding that entire productions , such as the ring of the nibelung , might be exported .
she did not rule out directing a production herself in abu dhabi at some time .
building bridges abu dhabi 's new music event aims to " build bridges , " say culture officials in the emirate .
the fabulously rich oil producer sees the creation of a music scene modeled after those in the west as a way to secure its place in the globalised world .
following years of construction , " the new generation of rulers wants to take a further step , " remarked zaki nusseibeh , deputy chairman of the abu dhabi authority for culture and heritage -lrb- adach -rrb- .
the uae 's longtime ruler , sheik zayed bin sultan al nahyan , died four years ago and was succeeded by a son .
with 10 percent of the world 's oil reserves , abu dhabi looks as though it will enjoy oil income for some time to come .
it has a population of about 800,000 and is somewhat smaller than the german state of bavaria .
cultural diversity bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : abu dhabi is set to host a branch of the louvre museum abu dhabi already boasts a literature prize and film festival , and is currently having 100 books by western authors translated into arabic .
" we spend a lot of money on culture , " noted abdulla salim al amri , director of arts and culture at the adch .
he declined to specify a figure , saying that " any amount you name is ok . "
every day , abu dhabi produces oil valued at some 240 million euros .
off its coast , on saadiyat island , abu dhabi is developing a cultural district that will likely have no equal worldwide .
covering an area of 27 square kilometers and expected to be completed in 2018 , it will include four museums , a performing arts center , housing for 150,000 people , a golf course , and a marina .
one of the museums , an outpost of the paris-based louvre , is a shell flooded with light designed by french architect jean nouvel .
frank gehry , architect of the celebrated guggenheim museum bilbao , has designed an eighth branch of the new york-based museum for saadiyat island .
the performing arts center , a gigantic leaf-like structure of glass and concrete designed by zaha hadid , will contain an opera house , concert hall , and music hall for up to 6,300 spectators .
norman foster is contributing a national museum , and japan 's tadeo ando has designed a museum dedicated to the uae 's maritime past .
so it was probably only a matter of time until abu dhabi latched on to wagner , tchaikovsky and co .
the german connection bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the concert was held in the luxury emirates palace germany 's till janczukowicz , executive artistic director of the abu dhabi classics , presented the emirate with a plan and managed within a few months to sign top artists who are booked for years in advance .
curiosity , and not only money , attracted them to the gulf , he said .
abu dhabi had seen european orchestras before , most recently the dresden state orchestra of saxony .
the new york philharmonic will perform in the emirate next year .
the arab world has a special affinity for the romanticist wagner , nusseibeh noted .
in his opera " parsifal , " for instance , the german composer distilled his longing for the orient , he said .
arabs ' fondness for wagner has nothing to do with his " ideology , " nusseibeh added , referring to wagner 's strident anti-semitism .
" the arab world is n't part of this debate , " he said .
foreigners made up the bulk of the some 1,000 people who came to saturday evening 's premiere at the emirates palace hotel .
about 100 students also attended , prompting nusseibeh to remark that everyone could understand wagner 's music . dpa news agency -lrb- jp -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

" a quick flash in the pan can not truly help our economy . " she also stepped up pressure for next month 's g20 summit in washington to agree on a brief for negotiations on financial-market regulation .
those world negotiations ought not to take longer than a year , she said . to give direct help to small and medium-sized enterprises -lrb- smes -rrb- , the german economy ministry set up a hotline for smes having problems with financing because of the international crisis . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : business owners can call a finance ministry official during regular business hours " we do not want to leave smes to fend for themselves in this situation , and we will offer support where it is possible , " economy minister michael glos said in a statement . germany is to boost the ailing car industry by reducing its taxes on low-emission cars , merkel 's spokesman ulrich wilhelm said . the vehicle-tax changes to be adopted by merkel 's cabinet next week would be part of a program to boost the flagging economy . the disclosure follows days of debate in berlin about whether to increase government spending , cut taxes or both to ease the effects of an approaching slump . promoting cleaner cars wilhelm gave no details but said the package would be a " well-adjusted concept .

" we are in a situation where it is getting harder for big european businesses to get credit , " verheugen said .
" it is not a question of hand-outs , it 's a question of the european investment bank making available a low-interest credit program . " the european carmakers association acea said the industry needed state help .

one proposal aims to support the struggling auto industry . addressing germany 's import-export federation bga in berlin on wednesday , oct .
29 , merkel said the package would include incentives for investment rather than being just a broad-based rise in government spending . " it will be targeted , it will be courageous and above all it will be sustainable , " merkel said of the upcoming measures .
" a quick flash in the pan can not truly help our economy . " she also stepped up pressure for next month 's g20 summit in washington to agree on a brief for negotiations on financial-market regulation .
those world negotiations ought not to take longer than a year , she said . to give direct help to small and medium-sized enterprises -lrb- smes -rrb- , the german economy ministry set up a hotline for smes having problems with financing because of the international crisis . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : business owners can call a finance ministry official during regular business hours " we do not want to leave smes to fend for themselves in this situation , and we will offer support where it is possible , " economy minister michael glos said in a statement . germany is to boost the ailing car industry by reducing its taxes on low-emission cars , merkel 's spokesman ulrich wilhelm said . the vehicle-tax changes to be adopted by merkel 's cabinet next week would be part of a program to boost the flagging economy . the disclosure follows days of debate in berlin about whether to increase government spending , cut taxes or both to ease the effects of an approaching slump . promoting cleaner cars wilhelm gave no details but said the package would be a " well-adjusted concept . " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the proposal would work to get heavily polluting cars off the road the proposal was " concretely " planned to alter the scale of vehicle tax , so tax rates were no longer keyed to a vehicle 's engine size but instead to the engine 's level of emissions , finance ministry spokesman torsten albig said . environmentalists have pressed for the change , saying it will encourage owners of polluting cars to scrap them and thus help reduce carbon dioxide emissions blamed for global warming . senior german officials have said berlin will also offer new soft loans and grants to improve building insulation , tax deductions for home-improvement work and changes in the amortization rule for taxes . eu on board eu industry commissioner guenter verheugen threw his weight wednesday behind a call to give the bloc 's carmakers cheap loans worth up to 40 billion euros to develop eco-friendly cars through the financial crisis . " we are in a situation where it is getting harder for big european businesses to get credit , " verheugen said .
" it is not a question of hand-outs , it 's a question of the european investment bank making available a low-interest credit program . " the european carmakers association acea said the industry needed state help . " in today 's difficult operating environment ... the european automotive industry more than ever requires a stable and predictable policy framework to ensure competitiveness and employment , " the organization said in a press release . dw staff -lrb- sms -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

the five megawatts produced at the pilot site will flow into the gas and electrical station in the coastal city of wilhelmshaven , enough to serve 5,000 households .
progress bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : denmark has been overtaken by britain as the world 's wind power leader " offshore wind power is of key importance for our future energy supply and a decisive factor in achieving our expansion goals for renewable energy , " gabriel said .
" the start of operations at this pilot plant is an important step that shows we are making progress . "
the hooksiel plant is intended as a prototype for a park with 80 turbines 100 kilometers off the coast of the north sea island of borkum , construction on which is to begin early next year .
the netherlands and denmark already have offshore wind farms , while last week saw britain declared a world leader in wind power generation , as its government announced a major program to cut the cost of off-shore wind farms .
also on board the scheme are five international players in the offshore wind industry , including german rwe innogy .
reluctance bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : germany plans to build more offshore wind farms germany has in fact dragged its heels in the sector , due to the relatively high cost of offshore wind power plants , but now has little choice but to pursue such plans as it is running out of suitable land .
the share of renewable energy used in the production of electricity grew to 14 percent in 2007 from 11.5 percent the previous year , according to the german government , which has targeted 30 percent by 2020 , the most ambitious target in the eu .
by 2030 , germany hopes to be providing 15 percent of households with electricity produced at offshore wind farms , the equivalent of around 25,000 megawatts . dw staff -lrb- jp -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

a comprehensive recovery plan is also in the works , but there 's no guarantee the moves will stave off recession . the european commission said on wednesday , oct .
29 , it was extending 6.5 billion euros -lrb- $ 8.4 billion -rrb- in emergency credit to hungary . the eastern european country , which does not have the euro , has run into liquidity problems due to the devaluation of its currency amidst the global economic crisis .

" we also stand ready to provide substantial medium-term financial assistance to other member states experiencing balance-of-payments pressures or serious financial stability risks , " barroso said . the eu 's three baltic members as well as bulgaria and romania are currently battling serious deficits , although none has formally asked the union for credit help . the plan , the plan ! bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : barroso says it 's all for one and one for all but the bloc has also acknowledged that loans alone wo n't be enough to keep the eu from sliding into recession .
barroso said the eu executive would present a " comprehensive european union recovery plan " on nov .
26 . that plan is set to include increasing funds available to the european investment bank to make loans to small and medium-sized businesses . other idea that have been suggested are to make it easier for unemployed people to access eu funds to start businesses and to ensure that other european funds available for public investment are being used effectively . another key , barroso said , was innovation .

but the commission chief warned against country-first , bloc-second economic policies . " the global financial crisis is not an excuse for protectionism : trade barriers ship out prosperity and open the gates instead to short-term economic populism , " barroso said . he also cautioned against the idea that the best approach would be to pump government money into industry on the national level . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the recovery plan is aimed at keeping the eu afloat " it would be a mistake to think that the solution for the current crisis is a public subsidizing of all the problems we have , " barroso said . he stressed that the various national economies were inevitably linked to one another .

as unemployment rises , some countries look to restrict visas , which could push more people to enter europe illegally . spain 's building boom drew africans to the southern european country by the hundreds of thousands in recent years .
many of these workers were the first to be laid off when spain 's real estate market cooled earlier this year .
spain , a country which welcomed 1 million immigrants in 2007 , now finds itself with 11.3 percent unemployment , the euro zone 's highest .
this has lead spain to slam the door on further immigration with laws aimed at cutting the number of work permits , restricting family reunion visas , and offering money to unemployed foreigners to go home .
spain is not alone in grappling with how to deal with migrant workers .
the international labor organization predicts that 20 million jobs will disappear worldwide by the end of next year .
countries across europe are considering more restrictive immigration measures .
europe warns against ejecting workers yet simply sending workers home wo n't help the situation , the united nations has warned .
it will simply decrease the number of legal immigrants and increase the number of illegal immigration .
to try and prevent that , the european union launched a 15 million euro -lrb- $ 18.70 million -rrb- initiative on tuesday , oct .
28 together with the un to try and protect migrant workers during the current economic crisis .
the program was launched on the sidelines of the global forum on migration and development in manila .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : many people migrate looking for job opportunities rich countries should not try to restrict migration from poor countries , even during the economic slowdown , peter sutherland , the un secretary general 's special representative on migration , warned .
" we 've seen how ineffective simple prohibition policies in regard to migration actually are , " he said .
" they do n't really work .
migrants migrate .
they will find a way , one way or another to do it . "
the number of migrants in the world is now estimated to be 40 million , 25 percent of whom are illegal , with the united states having the most migrants , according to sharan burrow , president of the international trade union confederation .
" our fear is that those numbers will increase , " burrow said at the opening of the four-day migration forum in manila .
britain looks to tighten immigration rising unemployment in the uk means that the country needs to consider restricting immigration , british immigration minister phil woolas recently told the times newspaper .
" if people are being made unemployed , the question of immigration becomes extremely thorny ... it 's been too easy to get into this country in the past and it 's going to get harder , " woolas said .
many european migrants from new eu member countries have come to britain in the past four years .
but there are some signs that many are heading home as the crisis hits , reuters recently reported .
the british government has considerred immigration reform which would have put into place an australian-style point system to let in highly-skilled workers but restrict access for unskilled migrants .
europe remains under pressure bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : many polish workers have headed west in search of work while officias say that they have not yet seen numbers of illegal immigrants spike globally , there are signs that european countries continue to be under pressure from illegal immigrants .
on monday , about 400 illegal immigrants were detained by italians as they tried to land on the italian island of lampedusa .
an additional 280 illegal immigrants had made landfall on the island over the weekend , according to the coast guard .
there has been a sharp increase in the number of people trying to enter italy by sea , according to figures from the interior ministry , which so far this year totals 23,600 .
afp news agency puts the number of immigrants who have tried to reach italy in october at 2,800 .
in greece , 10,000 would-be immigrants have been arrested trying to enter the country illegally during the first nine months of this year , compared to 9,240 last year , according to afp . dw staff -lrb- th -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

but observers disagree on the possible effects of the decline . analysts took conflicting lessons from the euro 's fall to two-and-a-half-year lows , with some saying the fall is a short-term problem that could help boost exports , while others saw it as a sign of serious policy discord in the 15-nation euro zone .
in european trading on tuesday , oct .
28 , the euro touched a low of $ 1.23 - the last time it was so weak was in april , 2006 - before reaching $ 1.25 in asian trading .
the currency fell even farther against the yen ; in all it weakened against 14 of the 16 most active currencies .
analysts attributed the drop to a number of factors , including the widespread perception that europe 's economy is on the brink of a recession and the expectation that european central bank president jean-claude trichet may soon lower interest rates .
' a question of politics ' exchanges rates are n't just a question of economics , " it is a question of politics , " said ognian hishow , a german economist who is currently a visiting professor at the university of rochester .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the last time the euro fell so low was in april , 2006 " once the world starts to get suspicious of a given player - like the euro zone now - then they will look for an alternative for where to put their money , " he said .
" right now , the only good alternative is the us dollar . "
alexandra boehne , a finance expert for the german chamber of commerce , noted that the falling euro reflects the growing concern over the extent of the european financial crisis .
" no one knows how the financial-market crisis will develop , how long it will continue and how bad the economy will get , " she said .
financial players have known about the economic crisis in the us since last year , but the news that europe is heavily affected is new to the market .
' the markets are insecure ' " people have only been aware of a problem in europe since the autumn of 2008 , " she said .
" the markets are very insecure right now . "
some analysts say european banks ' heavy exposure to credit-soaked emerging markets , particularly in eastern europe , has left the currency vulnerable .
bloomberg news service cited a report on tuesday that showed european banks ' lending to emerging markets is around 21 percent of europe 's gross domestic product , compared with 4 percent for the us and 5 percent for japan .
meanwhile there are other indicators that recession may be around the corner - including a ground-shaking report on monday that german consumer confidence had plunged to five-year lows . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the financial crisis : a game of dominos in the end , " investors conclude that america is still the most reliable destination when it comes to where to put your money in such rainy days , " hishow said .
not all analysts agree about the extent of the euro problem .
the chamber of commerce 's boehme said it could actually give germany 's giant export economy a boost by making things " made in germany , " like automobiles and chemicals , cheaper .
pessimism on export growth according to hishow , however , this would be the case if it were n't for the fact that germany 's main export markets - the us and the rest of europe - are stagnating .
" where can german companies sell their goods ?
in america ?
in latin america ? "
hishow asks rhetorically .
" in the dollar area it is impossible because of the downsizing there , and china , while its currency is pegged to the dollar , is facing hard times too , so there 's not enough help there , " he said .
" i 'm not optimistic . "
meanwhile christian dreger , an economist at the german institute for economics research -lrb- diw -rrb- , argues that the drop in the euro is merely a temporary blip .
compared to the 80 us cents that the euro was trading for in 2002 , the european currency is still strong , he notes .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : ecb head trichet : plans to cut rates ?
he expects the euro 's " short term drop " to reverse itself .
he calls the bout of euro-selling an " adjustment " to issues of monetary policy , namely " pressure on the euro because of potential for further interest rate cuts . "
upside for the dollar ?
dreger says he disagrees with the investors who are betting that europe will recover more slowly than the us .
he thinks they are overreacting to possible weakness in central european economies , and believes the euro will appreciate because " it will benefit more from catching-up processes in emerging markets like china and india , where the eu is heavily invested . "
economist hishow disagrees .
over time , he says , there will be a correction in the american trade balance and the dollar will improve .
moreover , he said he strongly believes the financial crisis and the falling euro are signals of deep underlying problems in the euro zone .
european integration at fault " this crisis is a proof of how incomplete european integration is , " he said .
" when there are hard times , there is no unified response . "
as examples he cites the vociferous controversy between germany and france on how to respond to the economic crisis , and points out that if anything , the euro zone countries are drifting apart economically . " they tend to act in self-interest first and foremost , " he said .
he predicts the dollar 's dominance as a reserve currency will continue unless europe manages to find a way to boost the process of integration .
" i know many europeans do n't like this conclusion , but it is the reality , " hishow said .
" so we have to accept it . " jennifer abramsohn send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

but observers disagree on the possible effects of the decline . analysts took conflicting lessons from the euro 's fall to two-and-a-half-year lows , with some saying the fall is a short-term problem that could help boost exports , while others saw it as a sign of serious policy discord in the 15-nation euro zone .
in european trading on tuesday , oct .
28 , the euro touched a low of $ 1.23 - the last time it was so weak was in april , 2006 - before reaching $ 1.25 in asian trading .
the currency fell even farther against the yen ; in all it weakened against 14 of the 16 most active currencies .
analysts attributed the drop to a number of factors , including the widespread perception that europe 's economy is on the brink of a recession and the expectation that european central bank president jean-claude trichet may soon lower interest rates .
' a question of politics ' exchanges rates are n't just a question of economics , " it is a question of politics , " said ognian hishow , a german economist who is currently a visiting professor at the university of rochester .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the last time the euro fell so low was in april , 2006 " once the world starts to get suspicious of a given player - like the euro zone now - then they will look for an alternative for where to put their money , " he said .
" right now , the only good alternative is the us dollar . "
alexandra boehne , a finance expert for the german chamber of commerce , noted that the falling euro reflects the growing concern over the extent of the european financial crisis .
" no one knows how the financial-market crisis will develop , how long it will continue and how bad the economy will get , " she said .
financial players have known about the economic crisis in the us since last year , but the news that europe is heavily affected is new to the market .
' the markets are insecure ' " people have only been aware of a problem in europe since the autumn of 2008 , " she said .
" the markets are very insecure right now . "
some analysts say european banks ' heavy exposure to credit-soaked emerging markets , particularly in eastern europe , has left the currency vulnerable .
bloomberg news service cited a report on tuesday that showed european banks ' lending to emerging markets is around 21 percent of europe 's gross domestic product , compared with 4 percent for the us and 5 percent for japan .
meanwhile there are other indicators that recession may be around the corner - including a ground-shaking report on monday that german consumer confidence had plunged to five-year lows . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the financial crisis : a game of dominos in the end , " investors conclude that america is still the most reliable destination when it comes to where to put your money in such rainy days , " hishow said .
not all analysts agree about the extent of the euro problem .
the chamber of commerce 's boehme said it could actually give germany 's giant export economy a boost by making things " made in germany , " like automobiles and chemicals , cheaper .
pessimism on export growth according to hishow , however , this would be the case if it were n't for the fact that germany 's main export markets - the us and the rest of europe - are stagnating .
" where can german companies sell their goods ?
in america ?
in latin america ? "
hishow asks rhetorically .
" in the dollar area it is impossible because of the downsizing there , and china , while its currency is pegged to the dollar , is facing hard times too , so there 's not enough help there , " he said .
" i 'm not optimistic . "
meanwhile christian dreger , an economist at the german institute for economics research -lrb- diw -rrb- , argues that the drop in the euro is merely a temporary blip .
compared to the 80 us cents that the euro was trading for in 2002 , the european currency is still strong , he notes .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : ecb head trichet : plans to cut rates ?
he expects the euro 's " short term drop " to reverse itself .
he calls the bout of euro-selling an " adjustment " to issues of monetary policy , namely " pressure on the euro because of potential for further interest rate cuts . "
upside for the dollar ?
dreger says he disagrees with the investors who are betting that europe will recover more slowly than the us .
he thinks they are overreacting to possible weakness in central european economies , and believes the euro will appreciate because " it will benefit more from catching-up processes in emerging markets like china and india , where the eu is heavily invested . "
economist hishow disagrees .
over time , he says , there will be a correction in the american trade balance and the dollar will improve .
moreover , he said he strongly believes the financial crisis and the falling euro are signals of deep underlying problems in the euro zone .
european integration at fault " this crisis is a proof of how incomplete european integration is , " he said .
" when there are hard times , there is no unified response . "
as examples he cites the vociferous controversy between germany and france on how to respond to the economic crisis , and points out that if anything , the euro zone countries are drifting apart economically . " they tend to act in self-interest first and foremost , " he said .
he predicts the dollar 's dominance as a reserve currency will continue unless europe manages to find a way to boost the process of integration .
" i know many europeans do n't like this conclusion , but it is the reality , " hishow said .
" so we have to accept it . " jennifer abramsohn send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

" it is just a stone 's throw away from a former paintbrush-making factory , where anti-nazi activist otto weidt illegally gave deaf and blind jews shelter and an opportunity to work during hitler 's reign , " he told the daily berliner zeitung .
" this house is the only authentic location in germany in which to remember these silent heroes . " a " tiny minority " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : a small number of germans hid jews from the nazis the term is used by historians to describe the germans who opposed hitler 's racist policies and helped jews escape nazi persecution .
the names of just 3,000 " silent heroes " are officially known , but historians believe more cases remain unrecorded . according to some estimates , 20,000 people across the country are thought to have offered their jewish fellow citizens some form of support and refuge during the nazi years .
the german population numbered some 70 million at the time . by end of world war ii , approximately 6 million european jews were killed as part of the nazi program of deliberate extermination led by adolf hitler . compared to the number of people who allowed nazi atrocities to happen or even took part in them , the people who shielded jews were " a tiny minority , " stressed berlin mayor klaus wowereit , who attended the opening . " but it is this minority that gives us direction , " he said .
" by commemorating these courageous people we are ensuring that attacks on human dignity will not be tolerated . " a sensitive issue bildunterschrift : the exhibition is one of a kind the exhibition consists of photographs , letters and other documents from 250 germans who risked their lives giving jews food , shelter or a place to work from 1938 to 1945 . " there are many memorial sites dedicated to those targeted by the nazis , but there has never been one which is solely dedicated to these heroes , " said johannes tuchel , director of an umbrella organization for memorials of resistance to the nazis , which put the exhibition together . tuchel said the " silent heroes " exhibition had not opened sooner because the issue of resistance to the nazis was still sensitive in germany . " we are still in the early stages of our research , " he told the daily tagesspiegel .
he and his organization now plan to begin cooperating with eastern european archivists as well as colleagues at the yad vashem memorial in israel to extend the project . dw staff -lrb- jp -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

the five megawatts produced at the pilot site will flow into the gas and electrical station in the coastal city of wilhelmshaven , enough to serve 5,000 households .
progress bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : denmark has been overtaken by britain as the world 's wind power leader " offshore wind power is of key importance for our future energy supply and a decisive factor in achieving our expansion goals for renewable energy , " gabriel said .
" the start of operations at this pilot plant is an important step that shows we are making progress . "
the hooksiel plant is intended as a prototype for a park with 80 turbines 100 kilometers off the coast of the north sea island of borkum , construction on which is to begin early next year .
the netherlands and denmark already have offshore wind farms , while last week saw britain declared a world leader in wind power generation , as its government announced a major program to cut the cost of off-shore wind farms .
also on board the scheme are five international players in the offshore wind industry , including german rwe innogy .
reluctance bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : germany plans to build more offshore wind farms germany has in fact dragged its heels in the sector , due to the relatively high cost of offshore wind power plants , but now has little choice but to pursue such plans as it is running out of suitable land .
the share of renewable energy used in the production of electricity grew to 14 percent in 2007 from 11.5 percent the previous year , according to the german government , which has targeted 30 percent by 2020 , the most ambitious target in the eu .
by 2030 , germany hopes to be providing 15 percent of households with electricity produced at offshore wind farms , the equivalent of around 25,000 megawatts . dw staff -lrb- jp -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

" it is just a stone 's throw away from a former paintbrush-making factory , where anti-nazi activist otto weidt illegally gave deaf and blind jews shelter and an opportunity to work during hitler 's reign , " he told the daily berliner zeitung .
" this house is the only authentic location in germany in which to remember these silent heroes . " a " tiny minority " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : a small number of germans hid jews from the nazis the term is used by historians to describe the germans who opposed hitler 's racist policies and helped jews escape nazi persecution .
the names of just 3,000 " silent heroes " are officially known , but historians believe more cases remain unrecorded . according to some estimates , 20,000 people across the country are thought to have offered their jewish fellow citizens some form of support and refuge during the nazi years .
the german population numbered some 70 million at the time . by end of world war ii , approximately 6 million european jews were killed as part of the nazi program of deliberate extermination led by adolf hitler . compared to the number of people who allowed nazi atrocities to happen or even took part in them , the people who shielded jews were " a tiny minority , " stressed berlin mayor klaus wowereit , who attended the opening . " but it is this minority that gives us direction , " he said .
" by commemorating these courageous people we are ensuring that attacks on human dignity will not be tolerated . " a sensitive issue bildunterschrift : the exhibition is one of a kind the exhibition consists of photographs , letters and other documents from 250 germans who risked their lives giving jews food , shelter or a place to work from 1938 to 1945 . " there are many memorial sites dedicated to those targeted by the nazis , but there has never been one which is solely dedicated to these heroes , " said johannes tuchel , director of an umbrella organization for memorials of resistance to the nazis , which put the exhibition together . tuchel said the " silent heroes " exhibition had not opened sooner because the issue of resistance to the nazis was still sensitive in germany . " we are still in the early stages of our research , " he told the daily tagesspiegel .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de exchange rates -pipe- 29.10.2008 falling euro may signal deeper eu woes großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : a dollar will buy more euros these days euro zone members have watched their currency fall sharply against the dollar in recent days , as forex markets react to the complex global financial crisis .
but observers disagree on the possible effects of the decline . analysts took conflicting lessons from the euro 's fall to two-and-a-half-year lows , with some saying the fall is a short-term problem that could help boost exports , while others saw it as a sign of serious policy discord in the 15-nation euro zone .
in european trading on tuesday , oct .
28 , the euro touched a low of $ 1.23 - the last time it was so weak was in april , 2006 - before reaching $ 1.25 in asian trading .
the currency fell even farther against the yen ; in all it weakened against 14 of the 16 most active currencies .
analysts attributed the drop to a number of factors , including the widespread perception that europe 's economy is on the brink of a recession and the expectation that european central bank president jean-claude trichet may soon lower interest rates .
' a question of politics ' exchanges rates are n't just a question of economics , " it is a question of politics , " said ognian hishow , a german economist who is currently a visiting professor at the university of rochester .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the last time the euro fell so low was in april , 2006 " once the world starts to get suspicious of a given player - like the euro zone now - then they will look for an alternative for where to put their money , " he said .
" right now , the only good alternative is the us dollar . "
alexandra boehne , a finance expert for the german chamber of commerce , noted that the falling euro reflects the growing concern over the extent of the european financial crisis .
" no one knows how the financial-market crisis will develop , how long it will continue and how bad the economy will get , " she said .
financial players have known about the economic crisis in the us since last year , but the news that europe is heavily affected is new to the market .
' the markets are insecure ' " people have only been aware of a problem in europe since the autumn of 2008 , " she said .
" the markets are very insecure right now . "
some analysts say european banks ' heavy exposure to credit-soaked emerging markets , particularly in eastern europe , has left the currency vulnerable .
bloomberg news service cited a report on tuesday that showed european banks ' lending to emerging markets is around 21 percent of europe 's gross domestic product , compared with 4 percent for the us and 5 percent for japan .
meanwhile there are other indicators that recession may be around the corner - including a ground-shaking report on monday that german consumer confidence had plunged to five-year lows . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the financial crisis : a game of dominos in the end , " investors conclude that america is still the most reliable destination when it comes to where to put your money in such rainy days , " hishow said .
not all analysts agree about the extent of the euro problem .
the chamber of commerce 's boehme said it could actually give germany 's giant export economy a boost by making things " made in germany , " like automobiles and chemicals , cheaper .
pessimism on export growth according to hishow , however , this would be the case if it were n't for the fact that germany 's main export markets - the us and the rest of europe - are stagnating .
" where can german companies sell their goods ?
in america ?
in latin america ? "
hishow asks rhetorically .
" in the dollar area it is impossible because of the downsizing there , and china , while its currency is pegged to the dollar , is facing hard times too , so there 's not enough help there , " he said .
" i 'm not optimistic . "
meanwhile christian dreger , an economist at the german institute for economics research -lrb- diw -rrb- , argues that the drop in the euro is merely a temporary blip .
compared to the 80 us cents that the euro was trading for in 2002 , the european currency is still strong , he notes .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : ecb head trichet : plans to cut rates ?
he expects the euro 's " short term drop " to reverse itself .
he calls the bout of euro-selling an " adjustment " to issues of monetary policy , namely " pressure on the euro because of potential for further interest rate cuts . "
upside for the dollar ?
dreger says he disagrees with the investors who are betting that europe will recover more slowly than the us .
he thinks they are overreacting to possible weakness in central european economies , and believes the euro will appreciate because " it will benefit more from catching-up processes in emerging markets like china and india , where the eu is heavily invested . "
economist hishow disagrees .
over time , he says , there will be a correction in the american trade balance and the dollar will improve .
moreover , he said he strongly believes the financial crisis and the falling euro are signals of deep underlying problems in the euro zone .
european integration at fault " this crisis is a proof of how incomplete european integration is , " he said .
" when there are hard times , there is no unified response . "
as examples he cites the vociferous controversy between germany and france on how to respond to the economic crisis , and points out that if anything , the euro zone countries are drifting apart economically . " they tend to act in self-interest first and foremost , " he said .
he predicts the dollar 's dominance as a reserve currency will continue unless europe manages to find a way to boost the process of integration .
" i know many europeans do n't like this conclusion , but it is the reality , " hishow said .
" so we have to accept it . " jennifer abramsohn send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

but observers disagree on the possible effects of the decline . analysts took conflicting lessons from the euro 's fall to two-and-a-half-year lows , with some saying the fall is a short-term problem that could help boost exports , while others saw it as a sign of serious policy discord in the 15-nation euro zone .
in european trading on tuesday , oct .
28 , the euro touched a low of $ 1.23 - the last time it was so weak was in april , 2006 - before reaching $ 1.25 in asian trading .
the currency fell even farther against the yen ; in all it weakened against 14 of the 16 most active currencies .
analysts attributed the drop to a number of factors , including the widespread perception that europe 's economy is on the brink of a recession and the expectation that european central bank president jean-claude trichet may soon lower interest rates .
' a question of politics ' exchanges rates are n't just a question of economics , " it is a question of politics , " said ognian hishow , a german economist who is currently a visiting professor at the university of rochester .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the last time the euro fell so low was in april , 2006 " once the world starts to get suspicious of a given player - like the euro zone now - then they will look for an alternative for where to put their money , " he said .
" right now , the only good alternative is the us dollar . "
alexandra boehne , a finance expert for the german chamber of commerce , noted that the falling euro reflects the growing concern over the extent of the european financial crisis .
" no one knows how the financial-market crisis will develop , how long it will continue and how bad the economy will get , " she said .
financial players have known about the economic crisis in the us since last year , but the news that europe is heavily affected is new to the market .
' the markets are insecure ' " people have only been aware of a problem in europe since the autumn of 2008 , " she said .
" the markets are very insecure right now . "
some analysts say european banks ' heavy exposure to credit-soaked emerging markets , particularly in eastern europe , has left the currency vulnerable .
bloomberg news service cited a report on tuesday that showed european banks ' lending to emerging markets is around 21 percent of europe 's gross domestic product , compared with 4 percent for the us and 5 percent for japan .
meanwhile there are other indicators that recession may be around the corner - including a ground-shaking report on monday that german consumer confidence had plunged to five-year lows . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the financial crisis : a game of dominos in the end , " investors conclude that america is still the most reliable destination when it comes to where to put your money in such rainy days , " hishow said .
not all analysts agree about the extent of the euro problem .
the chamber of commerce 's boehme said it could actually give germany 's giant export economy a boost by making things " made in germany , " like automobiles and chemicals , cheaper .
pessimism on export growth according to hishow , however , this would be the case if it were n't for the fact that germany 's main export markets - the us and the rest of europe - are stagnating .
" where can german companies sell their goods ?
in america ?
in latin america ? "
hishow asks rhetorically .
" in the dollar area it is impossible because of the downsizing there , and china , while its currency is pegged to the dollar , is facing hard times too , so there 's not enough help there , " he said .
" i 'm not optimistic . "
meanwhile christian dreger , an economist at the german institute for economics research -lrb- diw -rrb- , argues that the drop in the euro is merely a temporary blip .
compared to the 80 us cents that the euro was trading for in 2002 , the european currency is still strong , he notes .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : ecb head trichet : plans to cut rates ?
he expects the euro 's " short term drop " to reverse itself .
he calls the bout of euro-selling an " adjustment " to issues of monetary policy , namely " pressure on the euro because of potential for further interest rate cuts . "
upside for the dollar ?
dreger says he disagrees with the investors who are betting that europe will recover more slowly than the us .
he thinks they are overreacting to possible weakness in central european economies , and believes the euro will appreciate because " it will benefit more from catching-up processes in emerging markets like china and india , where the eu is heavily invested . "
economist hishow disagrees .
over time , he says , there will be a correction in the american trade balance and the dollar will improve .
moreover , he said he strongly believes the financial crisis and the falling euro are signals of deep underlying problems in the euro zone .
european integration at fault " this crisis is a proof of how incomplete european integration is , " he said .
" when there are hard times , there is no unified response . "
as examples he cites the vociferous controversy between germany and france on how to respond to the economic crisis , and points out that if anything , the euro zone countries are drifting apart economically . " they tend to act in self-interest first and foremost , " he said .
he predicts the dollar 's dominance as a reserve currency will continue unless europe manages to find a way to boost the process of integration .
" i know many europeans do n't like this conclusion , but it is the reality , " hishow said .
" so we have to accept it . " jennifer abramsohn send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de music -pipe- 29.10.2008 bayreuth festival orchestra takes wagner to the gulf großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the orchestra played to a packed house the bayreuth festival orchestra played outside of europe for the first time in two decades at the weekend , kicking off a series of concerts in the gulf states called the abu dhabi classics . as the orchestra started up at the seven-star emirates palace hotel , the ceiling seemed to bend under the weight of gold stucco and the spectators sank into plush seats .
looking more like something out of thousand and one nights than ring of the nibelung , the venue was hardly evocative of the hard seats filled by worshipful wagnerians at the german composer 's opera house in the bavarian town of bayreuth .
when the final tones of twilight of the gods faded on saturday evening - part of a wagner gala by the bayreuth festival orchestra under conductor christian thielemann - the minor sensation was complete : the emirate had inaugurated the abu dhabi classics , a first in the gulf states .
but what would richard wagner have thought ?
top acts the concert marked another step in abu dhabi 's mission to become a cultural capital .
a total of 22 concerts are scheduled until the season 's end in may 2009 .
among the guest artists will be top-flight stars dear to classical music fans : lang lang and cecilia bartoli , zubin mehta and lorin maazel , the vienna philharmonic and the philharmonic orchestra of london , the cellist misha maisky and pianist arcadi volodos , bobby mcferrin and till broenner .
the abu dhabi classics will run until 2012 at least , and its concerts will be integrated into the educational programm of schools in abu dhabi , the largest emirate of the united arab emirates -lrb- uae -rrb- .
new markets bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : katharina wagner on hand for the premiere was katharina wagner , who was recently named co-director of the annual bayreuth festival and is seeking new markets for bayreuth and her great-grandfather 's music .
she announced that the bayreuth festival orchestra would , in future , be performing away from home once a year .
" we intend to revive this tradition , " wagner said , adding that entire productions , such as the ring of the nibelung , might be exported .
she did not rule out directing a production herself in abu dhabi at some time .
building bridges abu dhabi 's new music event aims to " build bridges , " say culture officials in the emirate .
the fabulously rich oil producer sees the creation of a music scene modeled after those in the west as a way to secure its place in the globalised world .
following years of construction , " the new generation of rulers wants to take a further step , " remarked zaki nusseibeh , deputy chairman of the abu dhabi authority for culture and heritage -lrb- adach -rrb- .
the uae 's longtime ruler , sheik zayed bin sultan al nahyan , died four years ago and was succeeded by a son .
with 10 percent of the world 's oil reserves , abu dhabi looks as though it will enjoy oil income for some time to come .
it has a population of about 800,000 and is somewhat smaller than the german state of bavaria .
cultural diversity bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : abu dhabi is set to host a branch of the louvre museum abu dhabi already boasts a literature prize and film festival , and is currently having 100 books by western authors translated into arabic .
" we spend a lot of money on culture , " noted abdulla salim al amri , director of arts and culture at the adch .
he declined to specify a figure , saying that " any amount you name is ok . "
every day , abu dhabi produces oil valued at some 240 million euros .
off its coast , on saadiyat island , abu dhabi is developing a cultural district that will likely have no equal worldwide .
covering an area of 27 square kilometers and expected to be completed in 2018 , it will include four museums , a performing arts center , housing for 150,000 people , a golf course , and a marina .
one of the museums , an outpost of the paris-based louvre , is a shell flooded with light designed by french architect jean nouvel .
frank gehry , architect of the celebrated guggenheim museum bilbao , has designed an eighth branch of the new york-based museum for saadiyat island .
the performing arts center , a gigantic leaf-like structure of glass and concrete designed by zaha hadid , will contain an opera house , concert hall , and music hall for up to 6,300 spectators .
norman foster is contributing a national museum , and japan 's tadeo ando has designed a museum dedicated to the uae 's maritime past .
so it was probably only a matter of time until abu dhabi latched on to wagner , tchaikovsky and co .
the german connection bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the concert was held in the luxury emirates palace germany 's till janczukowicz , executive artistic director of the abu dhabi classics , presented the emirate with a plan and managed within a few months to sign top artists who are booked for years in advance .
curiosity , and not only money , attracted them to the gulf , he said .
abu dhabi had seen european orchestras before , most recently the dresden state orchestra of saxony .
the new york philharmonic will perform in the emirate next year .
the arab world has a special affinity for the romanticist wagner , nusseibeh noted .
in his opera " parsifal , " for instance , the german composer distilled his longing for the orient , he said .
arabs ' fondness for wagner has nothing to do with his " ideology , " nusseibeh added , referring to wagner 's strident anti-semitism .
" the arab world is n't part of this debate , " he said .
foreigners made up the bulk of the some 1,000 people who came to saturday evening 's premiere at the emirates palace hotel .
about 100 students also attended , prompting nusseibeh to remark that everyone could understand wagner 's music . dpa news agency -lrb- jp -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

yet , even the most ardent obama supporters can not answer a straightforward question of who he is or what he has ever accomplished , fewer still seem to know anything about the platform he is running on .
i have found many times that putting obama supporters to the test with these simple questions will inevitably result in vague repeated mantras of " change " and the " hope he offers . "
it is not unlike talking to brain-washed cult-members who always follow blindly a " revered leader . " - jeff , us bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : one reader says obama brings hope , another says his fans are blindly fanatical no doubt the us finds itself in a culture shift ; but make no mistake , the shift will occur with or without obama .
the biggest failure in the article is you appear to be clueless as to this us election .
this is more of a movement than a historical event .
and while there will be gains and losses depending on point of view , significant change will occur , and to a much larger extent if the 60-seat threshold is met .
we 'll all have to wait and see just what the us metamorphosis turns out to be over the next generation , but the us , for better or worse , is changing , and dramatically - brought on as much by economics as politics . - mike ball , us i hope that europeans will understand what it really means for the united states to elect barack obama .
its more than just a political step forward , its a glimpse of hope for a society in which people of color or of immigrant backgrounds can finally feel a sense of what this country should be about : the concept of the dream that all people are created equal and free .
it would not be just words on parchment anymore ; it would be the beginning of a generation of real tolerance , a realization of a vision that brings hope to a future where the us can finally take its place in the world 's village and not be just a castle on a hill .
it may sound idealistic but it 's how he makes us feel .
he is an inspiration to people that have become increasingly pessimistic .
in my mind -lrb- he is -rrb- intellectual humanitarian , strong , compassionate and unafraid of a journey that seems to be his destiny . - margaret , us compiled by dw staff -lrb- kjb -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?
dw-world.de us elections check out dw 's complete coverage of the us presidential election from the european perspective .
experts : obama presidency likely to disappoint foreign fans as the us presidential election enters its final week , the vast majority of the world is rooting for barack obama .
but analysts say that high global expectations of the democrat will lead to disappointment , if he wins .
-lrb- 28.10.2008 -rrb- russians prefer the more " approachable " obama both john mccain and barack obama have been critical of russia , particularly in light of the georgian crisis .
but moscow favors the young democrat over the cold war veteran .
-lrb- 27.10.2008 -rrb- german researcher : obama will get 52.2 percent of vote a german-american project with a new method for predicting the us election result says barack obama will win in november .
but are polls accurate ?
maybe the answer lies in another american pastime : baseball ! -lrb- 21.10.2008 -rrb- surveys do you think pope benedict xvi should reverse his decision to re-admit former bishop richard williamson , a holocaust denier , into the catholic church ?

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de us election -pipe- 29.10.2008 us readers divided by europe 's approval of obama großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the winds are changing in the united states , according to some readers most europeans would likely vote for barack obama if they could , but some dw readers in the us are divided on whether they 'd really like him . the following comments reflect the views of dw-world.de readers .
not all reader comments have been published .
dw-world.de reserves the right to edit for length and appropriateness of content . even if obama ca n't deliver 98 percent of the list of things that need to change and my taxes even go up , the altered tone and style of his presidency will be well worth it .
the world has to start somewhere .
obama has to be better than what we have now . - lorelei , us extensive research done on voting has long since come to the undeniable conclusion that the majority of people vote for very superficial reasons .
case in point is the almost unbelievable fanatic support for barack obama , who is almost seen as a messianic figure worldwide .
yet , even the most ardent obama supporters can not answer a straightforward question of who he is or what he has ever accomplished , fewer still seem to know anything about the platform he is running on .
i have found many times that putting obama supporters to the test with these simple questions will inevitably result in vague repeated mantras of " change " and the " hope he offers . "
it is not unlike talking to brain-washed cult-members who always follow blindly a " revered leader . " - jeff , us bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : one reader says obama brings hope , another says his fans are blindly fanatical no doubt the us finds itself in a culture shift ; but make no mistake , the shift will occur with or without obama .
the biggest failure in the article is you appear to be clueless as to this us election .
this is more of a movement than a historical event .
and while there will be gains and losses depending on point of view , significant change will occur , and to a much larger extent if the 60-seat threshold is met .
we 'll all have to wait and see just what the us metamorphosis turns out to be over the next generation , but the us , for better or worse , is changing , and dramatically - brought on as much by economics as politics . - mike ball , us i hope that europeans will understand what it really means for the united states to elect barack obama .
its more than just a political step forward , its a glimpse of hope for a society in which people of color or of immigrant backgrounds can finally feel a sense of what this country should be about : the concept of the dream that all people are created equal and free .
it would not be just words on parchment anymore ; it would be the beginning of a generation of real tolerance , a realization of a vision that brings hope to a future where the us can finally take its place in the world 's village and not be just a castle on a hill .
it may sound idealistic but it 's how he makes us feel .
he is an inspiration to people that have become increasingly pessimistic .
in my mind -lrb- he is -rrb- intellectual humanitarian , strong , compassionate and unafraid of a journey that seems to be his destiny . - margaret , us compiled by dw staff -lrb- kjb -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?
dw-world.de us elections check out dw 's complete coverage of the us presidential election from the european perspective .
experts : obama presidency likely to disappoint foreign fans as the us presidential election enters its final week , the vast majority of the world is rooting for barack obama .
but analysts say that high global expectations of the democrat will lead to disappointment , if he wins .
-lrb- 28.10.2008 -rrb- russians prefer the more " approachable " obama both john mccain and barack obama have been critical of russia , particularly in light of the georgian crisis .

high fuel prices earlier this year and a looming recession have put heavy pressure on smaller , weaker airlines in recent weeks , speeding up consolidation in the aviation industry . in frankfurt , lufthansa said on wednesday , oct .
29 , that it had received an offer from another eurowings shareholder , ak industriebeteiligung , for 50.9 percent of the airline and this would be acquired by the end of the year . earlier plans to merge eurowings , which mainly flies routes within europe , with an airline run by german travel company tui failed . control of bmi is to be acquired from businessman michael bishop , lufthansa said .
the british airline 's landing and takeoff slots at heathrow airport , the principal london airport , add to its value to lufthansa . in a third possible merger , lufthansa was also the only company to put in a binding bid for austrian airlines earlier this week . financial crisis bites into lufthansa profits the pair of lufthansa takeovers comes on the heels of a profit warning issued by the company tuesday . lufthansa said that it expects operational earnings this year to total just 1.1 billion euros -lrb- $ 1.4 billion -rrb- , down from its past forecast of 1.4 billion euros and blamed the drop on high fuel costs and weakened sales due to the global financial crisis . the airline posted 149 million euros in net profit between july and september , while operating profit in the third quarter plunged by 53.4 percent to 279 million euros , the company said in a statement . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : mayrhuber is confident that lufthansa has the tools to survive " this is a respectable result taking into consideration the considerable strains being felt as a result of the ongoing crisis in the financial markets and the overall economic situation , " chairman wolfgang mayrhuber said .
" in addition , we are working on our productivity , our measures to improve fuel consumption and the reduction of external costs . " in the first nine months of the year , operating profit fell by 9.3 percent to 984 million euros .
net profit during the same period plummeted by 65.1 percent to 551 million euros . the company 's results had been inflated in 2007 by lufthansa 's acquisition of the airline swiss and the sale of its stake in the british travel group thomas cook . swiss suffered heavy losses during the third quarter , with operating profit sinking by 76 percent to 112 million euros . lufthansa forecast only minor growth in passenger numbers due to market turmoil , expecting them to rise by just 0.8 percent in 2009 versus 5.2 percent this year . degrees of suffering the lufthansa figures follow on from seemingly endless bad news coming from europe 's airline industry . the denmark-based low-cost carrier sterling airways filed for bankruptcy on tuesday while air france-klm last week said it would struggle to meet its billion-euro earnings target and that it would trim its investment plans . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : alitalia is one european airline currently suffering the future of ailing italian carrier alitalia also remained uncertain .
the airline , which is 49.9 percent state-owned , is losing about three million euros a day and has debts totaling some 1.2 billion euros , which will have to be shouldered by the italian taxpayer .
however , it could be saved by british airways which earlier this month reiterated the company 's interest in a partnership with alitalia . non-european airlines were feeling the strain too , with carriers worldwide expected to lose around $ 5.2 billion this year owing to sharply higher oil prices and declining demand , the industry association iata said on october 17 , with losses expected to continue next year . dw staff -lrb- nda -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

" it is just a stone 's throw away from a former paintbrush-making factory , where anti-nazi activist otto weidt illegally gave deaf and blind jews shelter and an opportunity to work during hitler 's reign , " he told the daily berliner zeitung .
" this house is the only authentic location in germany in which to remember these silent heroes . " a " tiny minority " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : a small number of germans hid jews from the nazis the term is used by historians to describe the germans who opposed hitler 's racist policies and helped jews escape nazi persecution .
the names of just 3,000 " silent heroes " are officially known , but historians believe more cases remain unrecorded . according to some estimates , 20,000 people across the country are thought to have offered their jewish fellow citizens some form of support and refuge during the nazi years .
the german population numbered some 70 million at the time . by end of world war ii , approximately 6 million european jews were killed as part of the nazi program of deliberate extermination led by adolf hitler . compared to the number of people who allowed nazi atrocities to happen or even took part in them , the people who shielded jews were " a tiny minority , " stressed berlin mayor klaus wowereit , who attended the opening . " but it is this minority that gives us direction , " he said .
" by commemorating these courageous people we are ensuring that attacks on human dignity will not be tolerated . " a sensitive issue bildunterschrift : the exhibition is one of a kind the exhibition consists of photographs , letters and other documents from 250 germans who risked their lives giving jews food , shelter or a place to work from 1938 to 1945 . " there are many memorial sites dedicated to those targeted by the nazis , but there has never been one which is solely dedicated to these heroes , " said johannes tuchel , director of an umbrella organization for memorials of resistance to the nazis , which put the exhibition together . tuchel said the " silent heroes " exhibition had not opened sooner because the issue of resistance to the nazis was still sensitive in germany . " we are still in the early stages of our research , " he told the daily tagesspiegel .
he and his organization now plan to begin cooperating with eastern european archivists as well as colleagues at the yad vashem memorial in israel to extend the project . dw staff -lrb- jp -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

" it is just a stone 's throw away from a former paintbrush-making factory , where anti-nazi activist otto weidt illegally gave deaf and blind jews shelter and an opportunity to work during hitler 's reign , " he told the daily berliner zeitung .
" this house is the only authentic location in germany in which to remember these silent heroes . " a " tiny minority " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : a small number of germans hid jews from the nazis the term is used by historians to describe the germans who opposed hitler 's racist policies and helped jews escape nazi persecution .
the names of just 3,000 " silent heroes " are officially known , but historians believe more cases remain unrecorded . according to some estimates , 20,000 people across the country are thought to have offered their jewish fellow citizens some form of support and refuge during the nazi years .
the german population numbered some 70 million at the time . by end of world war ii , approximately 6 million european jews were killed as part of the nazi program of deliberate extermination led by adolf hitler . compared to the number of people who allowed nazi atrocities to happen or even took part in them , the people who shielded jews were " a tiny minority , " stressed berlin mayor klaus wowereit , who attended the opening . " but it is this minority that gives us direction , " he said .
" by commemorating these courageous people we are ensuring that attacks on human dignity will not be tolerated . " a sensitive issue bildunterschrift : the exhibition is one of a kind the exhibition consists of photographs , letters and other documents from 250 germans who risked their lives giving jews food , shelter or a place to work from 1938 to 1945 . " there are many memorial sites dedicated to those targeted by the nazis , but there has never been one which is solely dedicated to these heroes , " said johannes tuchel , director of an umbrella organization for memorials of resistance to the nazis , which put the exhibition together . tuchel said the " silent heroes " exhibition had not opened sooner because the issue of resistance to the nazis was still sensitive in germany . " we are still in the early stages of our research , " he told the daily tagesspiegel .
he and his organization now plan to begin cooperating with eastern european archivists as well as colleagues at the yad vashem memorial in israel to extend the project . dw staff -lrb- jp -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

but what would richard wagner have thought ?
top acts the concert marked another step in abu dhabi 's mission to become a cultural capital .
a total of 22 concerts are scheduled until the season 's end in may 2009 .
among the guest artists will be top-flight stars dear to classical music fans : lang lang and cecilia bartoli , zubin mehta and lorin maazel , the vienna philharmonic and the philharmonic orchestra of london , the cellist misha maisky and pianist arcadi volodos , bobby mcferrin and till broenner .

off its coast , on saadiyat island , abu dhabi is developing a cultural district that will likely have no equal worldwide .
covering an area of 27 square kilometers and expected to be completed in 2018 , it will include four museums , a performing arts center , housing for 150,000 people , a golf course , and a marina .

looking more like something out of thousand and one nights than ring of the nibelung , the venue was hardly evocative of the hard seats filled by worshipful wagnerians at the german composer 's opera house in the bavarian town of bayreuth .
when the final tones of twilight of the gods faded on saturday evening - part of a wagner gala by the bayreuth festival orchestra under conductor christian thielemann - the minor sensation was complete : the emirate had inaugurated the abu dhabi classics , a first in the gulf states .
but what would richard wagner have thought ?
top acts the concert marked another step in abu dhabi 's mission to become a cultural capital .
a total of 22 concerts are scheduled until the season 's end in may 2009 .
among the guest artists will be top-flight stars dear to classical music fans : lang lang and cecilia bartoli , zubin mehta and lorin maazel , the vienna philharmonic and the philharmonic orchestra of london , the cellist misha maisky and pianist arcadi volodos , bobby mcferrin and till broenner .
the abu dhabi classics will run until 2012 at least , and its concerts will be integrated into the educational programm of schools in abu dhabi , the largest emirate of the united arab emirates -lrb- uae -rrb- .
new markets bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : katharina wagner on hand for the premiere was katharina wagner , who was recently named co-director of the annual bayreuth festival and is seeking new markets for bayreuth and her great-grandfather 's music .
she announced that the bayreuth festival orchestra would , in future , be performing away from home once a year .
" we intend to revive this tradition , " wagner said , adding that entire productions , such as the ring of the nibelung , might be exported .
she did not rule out directing a production herself in abu dhabi at some time .
building bridges abu dhabi 's new music event aims to " build bridges , " say culture officials in the emirate .
the fabulously rich oil producer sees the creation of a music scene modeled after those in the west as a way to secure its place in the globalised world .
following years of construction , " the new generation of rulers wants to take a further step , " remarked zaki nusseibeh , deputy chairman of the abu dhabi authority for culture and heritage -lrb- adach -rrb- .
the uae 's longtime ruler , sheik zayed bin sultan al nahyan , died four years ago and was succeeded by a son .
with 10 percent of the world 's oil reserves , abu dhabi looks as though it will enjoy oil income for some time to come .
it has a population of about 800,000 and is somewhat smaller than the german state of bavaria .
cultural diversity bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : abu dhabi is set to host a branch of the louvre museum abu dhabi already boasts a literature prize and film festival , and is currently having 100 books by western authors translated into arabic .
" we spend a lot of money on culture , " noted abdulla salim al amri , director of arts and culture at the adch .
he declined to specify a figure , saying that " any amount you name is ok . "
every day , abu dhabi produces oil valued at some 240 million euros .
off its coast , on saadiyat island , abu dhabi is developing a cultural district that will likely have no equal worldwide .
covering an area of 27 square kilometers and expected to be completed in 2018 , it will include four museums , a performing arts center , housing for 150,000 people , a golf course , and a marina .
one of the museums , an outpost of the paris-based louvre , is a shell flooded with light designed by french architect jean nouvel .
frank gehry , architect of the celebrated guggenheim museum bilbao , has designed an eighth branch of the new york-based museum for saadiyat island .
the performing arts center , a gigantic leaf-like structure of glass and concrete designed by zaha hadid , will contain an opera house , concert hall , and music hall for up to 6,300 spectators .
norman foster is contributing a national museum , and japan 's tadeo ando has designed a museum dedicated to the uae 's maritime past .
so it was probably only a matter of time until abu dhabi latched on to wagner , tchaikovsky and co .
the german connection bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the concert was held in the luxury emirates palace germany 's till janczukowicz , executive artistic director of the abu dhabi classics , presented the emirate with a plan and managed within a few months to sign top artists who are booked for years in advance .
curiosity , and not only money , attracted them to the gulf , he said .
abu dhabi had seen european orchestras before , most recently the dresden state orchestra of saxony .
the new york philharmonic will perform in the emirate next year .
the arab world has a special affinity for the romanticist wagner , nusseibeh noted .
in his opera " parsifal , " for instance , the german composer distilled his longing for the orient , he said .
arabs ' fondness for wagner has nothing to do with his " ideology , " nusseibeh added , referring to wagner 's strident anti-semitism .

the summit comes in the wake of last week 's decision by the south- western dutch towns of roosendaal and bergen op zoom to gradually close their local " coffee shops " in an attempt to reduce drug-related crimes .
all dutch cities and towns close to the german or belgian borders are invited to the summit .
after the summit , the vng will present the cities ' common position to the government .
the goal , according to vng , is to get the government to negotiate an international soft drugs policy with belgium and germany .
the netherlands effectively decriminalized soft drugs a few decades ago when it introduced a policy of " non-enforcement . "
although possession and cultivation of cannabis remains technically illegal in holland , law enforcement has systematically turned a blind eye , and the courts usually rule in favor of individual defendants .
the sale and use of so-called soft drugs , such as marijuana , is legal in designated stores , usually referred to as " coffee shops . "

bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : a police officer talks to a french drug tourist in maastricht maastricht is one of the dutch cities suffering most from drug- related crime .
the city is visited by more than 1.5 million drugs tourists per year and has 16 " coffee shops , " 10 more than in dutch cities of comparable size not located close to the border .
police estimate maastricht also has more than 100 " soft drugs supermarkets , " illegal stores where one can purchase soft drugs in larger quantities than the 5 grams per person allowed under dutch law .
leers says police officers in his city deal with triple the amount of crime as their colleagues in the metropolitan area of the hague .
most of the crime in maastricht is drug-related , and the number of drug-related murders each year is increasing , according to police officials .
german cross-border smokers favor enschede bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : drug tourism could go up in smoke the town of enschede has been particularly problematic for local authorities , because of its immediate proximity to the german border .
thousands of drug tourists , mainly from germany , pour across the border each year for a taste of legal marijuana .
the netherlands have considered many ways in the past to deter drug tourism , such as restricting the sale of soft drugs to dutch nationals by demanding coffee shops ask to see passports while political pressure has led to a decline in the number of coffee shops .
the last official figures showed that the netherlands had 740 coffee shops in 2004 compared to 1,180 in 1997 .

28 that it will host a soft drugs summit in the third week of november in maastricht .
participants will seek ways to discourage tourists who visit the netherlands to take advantage of its liberal drug laws .
by extension , the summit also seeks to reduce drug-related crime .
the summit comes in the wake of last week 's decision by the south- western dutch towns of roosendaal and bergen op zoom to gradually close their local " coffee shops " in an attempt to reduce drug-related crimes .
all dutch cities and towns close to the german or belgian borders are invited to the summit .
after the summit , the vng will present the cities ' common position to the government .
the goal , according to vng , is to get the government to negotiate an international soft drugs policy with belgium and germany .
the netherlands effectively decriminalized soft drugs a few decades ago when it introduced a policy of " non-enforcement . "
although possession and cultivation of cannabis remains technically illegal in holland , law enforcement has systematically turned a blind eye , and the courts usually rule in favor of individual defendants .
the sale and use of so-called soft drugs , such as marijuana , is legal in designated stores , usually referred to as " coffee shops . "
maastricht suffering most from drug-related crime maastricht mayor gerd leers calls the current dutch drugs policy " hypocritical . "
he says it enables drug-related crime and also increases the sale and distribution of hard drugs , such as heroin .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : a police officer talks to a french drug tourist in maastricht maastricht is one of the dutch cities suffering most from drug- related crime .
the city is visited by more than 1.5 million drugs tourists per year and has 16 " coffee shops , " 10 more than in dutch cities of comparable size not located close to the border .
police estimate maastricht also has more than 100 " soft drugs supermarkets , " illegal stores where one can purchase soft drugs in larger quantities than the 5 grams per person allowed under dutch law .
leers says police officers in his city deal with triple the amount of crime as their colleagues in the metropolitan area of the hague .
most of the crime in maastricht is drug-related , and the number of drug-related murders each year is increasing , according to police officials .
german cross-border smokers favor enschede bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : drug tourism could go up in smoke the town of enschede has been particularly problematic for local authorities , because of its immediate proximity to the german border .
thousands of drug tourists , mainly from germany , pour across the border each year for a taste of legal marijuana .
the netherlands have considered many ways in the past to deter drug tourism , such as restricting the sale of soft drugs to dutch nationals by demanding coffee shops ask to see passports while political pressure has led to a decline in the number of coffee shops .
the last official figures showed that the netherlands had 740 coffee shops in 2004 compared to 1,180 in 1997 .
but it is unclear whether the reduction in the number of coffee shops has actually resulted in a decrease in drug consumption and drug tourism . dw staff -lrb- nda -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

the plan may face some low-key opposition from some member states who claim the eu mission is an unnecessary one due to the current nato deployment and who believe the aggressive support for the mission by the french eu presidency masks france 's desire for a stronger european military profile .
eu force to coordinate international anti-piracy efforts a total of 10 eu nations have agreed to contribute to the mission .
several eu ships are already taking part in the nato operation .
two french frigates , a dutch warship and a spanish aircraft have also been involved in anti-piracy duties .
the eu said the force could include some of the european ships which are already taking part in the nato anti-piracy operation .
the eu mission would also take on responsibility for coordinating efforts with third-country warships , including from russia , asia and the gulf states to avoid duplication of efforts , the officials said .

looking more like something out of thousand and one nights than ring of the nibelung , the venue was hardly evocative of the hard seats filled by worshipful wagnerians at the german composer 's opera house in the bavarian town of bayreuth .
when the final tones of twilight of the gods faded on saturday evening - part of a wagner gala by the bayreuth festival orchestra under conductor christian thielemann - the minor sensation was complete : the emirate had inaugurated the abu dhabi classics , a first in the gulf states .
but what would richard wagner have thought ?
top acts the concert marked another step in abu dhabi 's mission to become a cultural capital .
a total of 22 concerts are scheduled until the season 's end in may 2009 .
among the guest artists will be top-flight stars dear to classical music fans : lang lang and cecilia bartoli , zubin mehta and lorin maazel , the vienna philharmonic and the philharmonic orchestra of london , the cellist misha maisky and pianist arcadi volodos , bobby mcferrin and till broenner .
the abu dhabi classics will run until 2012 at least , and its concerts will be integrated into the educational programm of schools in abu dhabi , the largest emirate of the united arab emirates -lrb- uae -rrb- .
new markets bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : katharina wagner on hand for the premiere was katharina wagner , who was recently named co-director of the annual bayreuth festival and is seeking new markets for bayreuth and her great-grandfather 's music .
she announced that the bayreuth festival orchestra would , in future , be performing away from home once a year .
" we intend to revive this tradition , " wagner said , adding that entire productions , such as the ring of the nibelung , might be exported .
she did not rule out directing a production herself in abu dhabi at some time .
building bridges abu dhabi 's new music event aims to " build bridges , " say culture officials in the emirate .
the fabulously rich oil producer sees the creation of a music scene modeled after those in the west as a way to secure its place in the globalised world .
following years of construction , " the new generation of rulers wants to take a further step , " remarked zaki nusseibeh , deputy chairman of the abu dhabi authority for culture and heritage -lrb- adach -rrb- .
the uae 's longtime ruler , sheik zayed bin sultan al nahyan , died four years ago and was succeeded by a son .
with 10 percent of the world 's oil reserves , abu dhabi looks as though it will enjoy oil income for some time to come .
it has a population of about 800,000 and is somewhat smaller than the german state of bavaria .
cultural diversity bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : abu dhabi is set to host a branch of the louvre museum abu dhabi already boasts a literature prize and film festival , and is currently having 100 books by western authors translated into arabic .
" we spend a lot of money on culture , " noted abdulla salim al amri , director of arts and culture at the adch .
he declined to specify a figure , saying that " any amount you name is ok . "
every day , abu dhabi produces oil valued at some 240 million euros .
off its coast , on saadiyat island , abu dhabi is developing a cultural district that will likely have no equal worldwide .
covering an area of 27 square kilometers and expected to be completed in 2018 , it will include four museums , a performing arts center , housing for 150,000 people , a golf course , and a marina .
one of the museums , an outpost of the paris-based louvre , is a shell flooded with light designed by french architect jean nouvel .
frank gehry , architect of the celebrated guggenheim museum bilbao , has designed an eighth branch of the new york-based museum for saadiyat island .
the performing arts center , a gigantic leaf-like structure of glass and concrete designed by zaha hadid , will contain an opera house , concert hall , and music hall for up to 6,300 spectators .
norman foster is contributing a national museum , and japan 's tadeo ando has designed a museum dedicated to the uae 's maritime past .
so it was probably only a matter of time until abu dhabi latched on to wagner , tchaikovsky and co .
the german connection bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the concert was held in the luxury emirates palace germany 's till janczukowicz , executive artistic director of the abu dhabi classics , presented the emirate with a plan and managed within a few months to sign top artists who are booked for years in advance .
curiosity , and not only money , attracted them to the gulf , he said .
abu dhabi had seen european orchestras before , most recently the dresden state orchestra of saxony .
the new york philharmonic will perform in the emirate next year .
the arab world has a special affinity for the romanticist wagner , nusseibeh noted .
in his opera " parsifal , " for instance , the german composer distilled his longing for the orient , he said .
arabs ' fondness for wagner has nothing to do with his " ideology , " nusseibeh added , referring to wagner 's strident anti-semitism .
" the arab world is n't part of this debate , " he said .
foreigners made up the bulk of the some 1,000 people who came to saturday evening 's premiere at the emirates palace hotel .
about 100 students also attended , prompting nusseibeh to remark that everyone could understand wagner 's music . dpa news agency -lrb- jp -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

frank gehry , architect of the celebrated guggenheim museum bilbao , has designed an eighth branch of the new york-based museum for saadiyat island .

looking more like something out of thousand and one nights than ring of the nibelung , the venue was hardly evocative of the hard seats filled by worshipful wagnerians at the german composer 's opera house in the bavarian town of bayreuth .
when the final tones of twilight of the gods faded on saturday evening - part of a wagner gala by the bayreuth festival orchestra under conductor christian thielemann - the minor sensation was complete : the emirate had inaugurated the abu dhabi classics , a first in the gulf states .
but what would richard wagner have thought ?
top acts the concert marked another step in abu dhabi 's mission to become a cultural capital .
a total of 22 concerts are scheduled until the season 's end in may 2009 .
among the guest artists will be top-flight stars dear to classical music fans : lang lang and cecilia bartoli , zubin mehta and lorin maazel , the vienna philharmonic and the philharmonic orchestra of london , the cellist misha maisky and pianist arcadi volodos , bobby mcferrin and till broenner .
the abu dhabi classics will run until 2012 at least , and its concerts will be integrated into the educational programm of schools in abu dhabi , the largest emirate of the united arab emirates -lrb- uae -rrb- .
new markets bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : katharina wagner on hand for the premiere was katharina wagner , who was recently named co-director of the annual bayreuth festival and is seeking new markets for bayreuth and her great-grandfather 's music .
she announced that the bayreuth festival orchestra would , in future , be performing away from home once a year .
" we intend to revive this tradition , " wagner said , adding that entire productions , such as the ring of the nibelung , might be exported .
she did not rule out directing a production herself in abu dhabi at some time .
building bridges abu dhabi 's new music event aims to " build bridges , " say culture officials in the emirate .
the fabulously rich oil producer sees the creation of a music scene modeled after those in the west as a way to secure its place in the globalised world .
following years of construction , " the new generation of rulers wants to take a further step , " remarked zaki nusseibeh , deputy chairman of the abu dhabi authority for culture and heritage -lrb- adach -rrb- .
the uae 's longtime ruler , sheik zayed bin sultan al nahyan , died four years ago and was succeeded by a son .
with 10 percent of the world 's oil reserves , abu dhabi looks as though it will enjoy oil income for some time to come .
it has a population of about 800,000 and is somewhat smaller than the german state of bavaria .
cultural diversity bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : abu dhabi is set to host a branch of the louvre museum abu dhabi already boasts a literature prize and film festival , and is currently having 100 books by western authors translated into arabic .
" we spend a lot of money on culture , " noted abdulla salim al amri , director of arts and culture at the adch .
he declined to specify a figure , saying that " any amount you name is ok . "
every day , abu dhabi produces oil valued at some 240 million euros .
off its coast , on saadiyat island , abu dhabi is developing a cultural district that will likely have no equal worldwide .
covering an area of 27 square kilometers and expected to be completed in 2018 , it will include four museums , a performing arts center , housing for 150,000 people , a golf course , and a marina .
one of the museums , an outpost of the paris-based louvre , is a shell flooded with light designed by french architect jean nouvel .
frank gehry , architect of the celebrated guggenheim museum bilbao , has designed an eighth branch of the new york-based museum for saadiyat island .
the performing arts center , a gigantic leaf-like structure of glass and concrete designed by zaha hadid , will contain an opera house , concert hall , and music hall for up to 6,300 spectators .
norman foster is contributing a national museum , and japan 's tadeo ando has designed a museum dedicated to the uae 's maritime past .
so it was probably only a matter of time until abu dhabi latched on to wagner , tchaikovsky and co .
the german connection bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the concert was held in the luxury emirates palace germany 's till janczukowicz , executive artistic director of the abu dhabi classics , presented the emirate with a plan and managed within a few months to sign top artists who are booked for years in advance .
curiosity , and not only money , attracted them to the gulf , he said .
abu dhabi had seen european orchestras before , most recently the dresden state orchestra of saxony .
the new york philharmonic will perform in the emirate next year .
the arab world has a special affinity for the romanticist wagner , nusseibeh noted .
in his opera " parsifal , " for instance , the german composer distilled his longing for the orient , he said .
arabs ' fondness for wagner has nothing to do with his " ideology , " nusseibeh added , referring to wagner 's strident anti-semitism .
" the arab world is n't part of this debate , " he said .

28 that it will host a soft drugs summit in the third week of november in maastricht .
participants will seek ways to discourage tourists who visit the netherlands to take advantage of its liberal drug laws .
by extension , the summit also seeks to reduce drug-related crime .
the summit comes in the wake of last week 's decision by the south- western dutch towns of roosendaal and bergen op zoom to gradually close their local " coffee shops " in an attempt to reduce drug-related crimes .
all dutch cities and towns close to the german or belgian borders are invited to the summit .
after the summit , the vng will present the cities ' common position to the government .
the goal , according to vng , is to get the government to negotiate an international soft drugs policy with belgium and germany .
the netherlands effectively decriminalized soft drugs a few decades ago when it introduced a policy of " non-enforcement . "
although possession and cultivation of cannabis remains technically illegal in holland , law enforcement has systematically turned a blind eye , and the courts usually rule in favor of individual defendants .
the sale and use of so-called soft drugs , such as marijuana , is legal in designated stores , usually referred to as " coffee shops . "
maastricht suffering most from drug-related crime maastricht mayor gerd leers calls the current dutch drugs policy " hypocritical . "
he says it enables drug-related crime and also increases the sale and distribution of hard drugs , such as heroin .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : a police officer talks to a french drug tourist in maastricht maastricht is one of the dutch cities suffering most from drug- related crime .
the city is visited by more than 1.5 million drugs tourists per year and has 16 " coffee shops , " 10 more than in dutch cities of comparable size not located close to the border .
police estimate maastricht also has more than 100 " soft drugs supermarkets , " illegal stores where one can purchase soft drugs in larger quantities than the 5 grams per person allowed under dutch law .
leers says police officers in his city deal with triple the amount of crime as their colleagues in the metropolitan area of the hague .
most of the crime in maastricht is drug-related , and the number of drug-related murders each year is increasing , according to police officials .
german cross-border smokers favor enschede bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : drug tourism could go up in smoke the town of enschede has been particularly problematic for local authorities , because of its immediate proximity to the german border .
thousands of drug tourists , mainly from germany , pour across the border each year for a taste of legal marijuana .
the netherlands have considered many ways in the past to deter drug tourism , such as restricting the sale of soft drugs to dutch nationals by demanding coffee shops ask to see passports while political pressure has led to a decline in the number of coffee shops .
the last official figures showed that the netherlands had 740 coffee shops in 2004 compared to 1,180 in 1997 .

28 that it will host a soft drugs summit in the third week of november in maastricht .
participants will seek ways to discourage tourists who visit the netherlands to take advantage of its liberal drug laws .
by extension , the summit also seeks to reduce drug-related crime .
the summit comes in the wake of last week 's decision by the south- western dutch towns of roosendaal and bergen op zoom to gradually close their local " coffee shops " in an attempt to reduce drug-related crimes .
all dutch cities and towns close to the german or belgian borders are invited to the summit .
after the summit , the vng will present the cities ' common position to the government .
the goal , according to vng , is to get the government to negotiate an international soft drugs policy with belgium and germany .
the netherlands effectively decriminalized soft drugs a few decades ago when it introduced a policy of " non-enforcement . "
although possession and cultivation of cannabis remains technically illegal in holland , law enforcement has systematically turned a blind eye , and the courts usually rule in favor of individual defendants .
the sale and use of so-called soft drugs , such as marijuana , is legal in designated stores , usually referred to as " coffee shops . "
maastricht suffering most from drug-related crime maastricht mayor gerd leers calls the current dutch drugs policy " hypocritical . "
he says it enables drug-related crime and also increases the sale and distribution of hard drugs , such as heroin .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : a police officer talks to a french drug tourist in maastricht maastricht is one of the dutch cities suffering most from drug- related crime .
the city is visited by more than 1.5 million drugs tourists per year and has 16 " coffee shops , " 10 more than in dutch cities of comparable size not located close to the border .
police estimate maastricht also has more than 100 " soft drugs supermarkets , " illegal stores where one can purchase soft drugs in larger quantities than the 5 grams per person allowed under dutch law .
leers says police officers in his city deal with triple the amount of crime as their colleagues in the metropolitan area of the hague .
most of the crime in maastricht is drug-related , and the number of drug-related murders each year is increasing , according to police officials .
german cross-border smokers favor enschede bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : drug tourism could go up in smoke the town of enschede has been particularly problematic for local authorities , because of its immediate proximity to the german border .
thousands of drug tourists , mainly from germany , pour across the border each year for a taste of legal marijuana .
the netherlands have considered many ways in the past to deter drug tourism , such as restricting the sale of soft drugs to dutch nationals by demanding coffee shops ask to see passports while political pressure has led to a decline in the number of coffee shops .
the last official figures showed that the netherlands had 740 coffee shops in 2004 compared to 1,180 in 1997 .
but it is unclear whether the reduction in the number of coffee shops has actually resulted in a decrease in drug consumption and drug tourism . dw staff -lrb- nda -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de investment -pipe- 29.10.2008 porsche liquidity action reins in vw stock prices großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : vw shares gained 240 percent in 2 days - now they 're coming back to earth by releasing some of its options to the market , porsche sent volkswagen shares plummeting on wednesday from their over-inflated heights .
but the luxury carmaker now also has to counter suspicions of manipulation . what goes up must come down - that was the motto of porsche 's share liquidity initiative on the german stock exchange , the dax , on wednesday , oct .
29 .
porsche 's willingness to make vw stocks available to investors immediately caused prices , which had zoomed up to over 1,000 euros -lrb- $ 1,250 -rrb- on tuesday , to tumble .
by midday , vw shares had lost 38 percent , having fallen from their opening level of 945 euros to 588 .
porsche representatives said the action was necessary to restore a measure of stability to vw share prices .
and they denied that their company was profiting from the rollercoaster ride .
" we want to ensure that prices return to a sensible level , " a porsche spokesman told the online portal of the german financial periodical manager-magazin .
" we do n't want to cash in on vw .
calming things down is what 's in our interest . "
ironically , the action became necessary precisely because porsche ambitions vis-a-vis vw had created an emergency shortage of the latter carmaker 's stock .
larger goal remains bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : porsche says it still intends to move in on vw vw share prices skyrocketed because investors underestimated the extent to which porsche had acquired volkswagen stocks and options .
last weekend , porsche announced that it controlled 74 percent of vw shares .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de exchange rates -pipe- 29.10.2008 falling euro may signal deeper eu woes großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : a dollar will buy more euros these days euro zone members have watched their currency fall sharply against the dollar in recent days , as forex markets react to the complex global financial crisis .
but observers disagree on the possible effects of the decline . analysts took conflicting lessons from the euro 's fall to two-and-a-half-year lows , with some saying the fall is a short-term problem that could help boost exports , while others saw it as a sign of serious policy discord in the 15-nation euro zone .
in european trading on tuesday , oct .
28 , the euro touched a low of $ 1.23 - the last time it was so weak was in april , 2006 - before reaching $ 1.25 in asian trading .
the currency fell even farther against the yen ; in all it weakened against 14 of the 16 most active currencies .
analysts attributed the drop to a number of factors , including the widespread perception that europe 's economy is on the brink of a recession and the expectation that european central bank president jean-claude trichet may soon lower interest rates .
' a question of politics ' exchanges rates are n't just a question of economics , " it is a question of politics , " said ognian hishow , a german economist who is currently a visiting professor at the university of rochester .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the last time the euro fell so low was in april , 2006 " once the world starts to get suspicious of a given player - like the euro zone now - then they will look for an alternative for where to put their money , " he said .
" right now , the only good alternative is the us dollar . "
alexandra boehne , a finance expert for the german chamber of commerce , noted that the falling euro reflects the growing concern over the extent of the european financial crisis .
" no one knows how the financial-market crisis will develop , how long it will continue and how bad the economy will get , " she said .
financial players have known about the economic crisis in the us since last year , but the news that europe is heavily affected is new to the market .

but observers disagree on the possible effects of the decline . analysts took conflicting lessons from the euro 's fall to two-and-a-half-year lows , with some saying the fall is a short-term problem that could help boost exports , while others saw it as a sign of serious policy discord in the 15-nation euro zone .
in european trading on tuesday , oct .
28 , the euro touched a low of $ 1.23 - the last time it was so weak was in april , 2006 - before reaching $ 1.25 in asian trading .
the currency fell even farther against the yen ; in all it weakened against 14 of the 16 most active currencies .
analysts attributed the drop to a number of factors , including the widespread perception that europe 's economy is on the brink of a recession and the expectation that european central bank president jean-claude trichet may soon lower interest rates .
' a question of politics ' exchanges rates are n't just a question of economics , " it is a question of politics , " said ognian hishow , a german economist who is currently a visiting professor at the university of rochester .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the last time the euro fell so low was in april , 2006 " once the world starts to get suspicious of a given player - like the euro zone now - then they will look for an alternative for where to put their money , " he said .
" right now , the only good alternative is the us dollar . "
alexandra boehne , a finance expert for the german chamber of commerce , noted that the falling euro reflects the growing concern over the extent of the european financial crisis .
" no one knows how the financial-market crisis will develop , how long it will continue and how bad the economy will get , " she said .
financial players have known about the economic crisis in the us since last year , but the news that europe is heavily affected is new to the market .
' the markets are insecure ' " people have only been aware of a problem in europe since the autumn of 2008 , " she said .
" the markets are very insecure right now . "
some analysts say european banks ' heavy exposure to credit-soaked emerging markets , particularly in eastern europe , has left the currency vulnerable .
bloomberg news service cited a report on tuesday that showed european banks ' lending to emerging markets is around 21 percent of europe 's gross domestic product , compared with 4 percent for the us and 5 percent for japan .
meanwhile there are other indicators that recession may be around the corner - including a ground-shaking report on monday that german consumer confidence had plunged to five-year lows . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the financial crisis : a game of dominos in the end , " investors conclude that america is still the most reliable destination when it comes to where to put your money in such rainy days , " hishow said .
not all analysts agree about the extent of the euro problem .
the chamber of commerce 's boehme said it could actually give germany 's giant export economy a boost by making things " made in germany , " like automobiles and chemicals , cheaper .
pessimism on export growth according to hishow , however , this would be the case if it were n't for the fact that germany 's main export markets - the us and the rest of europe - are stagnating .
" where can german companies sell their goods ?
in america ?
in latin america ? "
hishow asks rhetorically .
" in the dollar area it is impossible because of the downsizing there , and china , while its currency is pegged to the dollar , is facing hard times too , so there 's not enough help there , " he said .
" i 'm not optimistic . "
meanwhile christian dreger , an economist at the german institute for economics research -lrb- diw -rrb- , argues that the drop in the euro is merely a temporary blip .
compared to the 80 us cents that the euro was trading for in 2002 , the european currency is still strong , he notes .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : ecb head trichet : plans to cut rates ?
he expects the euro 's " short term drop " to reverse itself .
he calls the bout of euro-selling an " adjustment " to issues of monetary policy , namely " pressure on the euro because of potential for further interest rate cuts . "
upside for the dollar ?
dreger says he disagrees with the investors who are betting that europe will recover more slowly than the us .
he thinks they are overreacting to possible weakness in central european economies , and believes the euro will appreciate because " it will benefit more from catching-up processes in emerging markets like china and india , where the eu is heavily invested . "
economist hishow disagrees .
over time , he says , there will be a correction in the american trade balance and the dollar will improve .
moreover , he said he strongly believes the financial crisis and the falling euro are signals of deep underlying problems in the euro zone .
european integration at fault " this crisis is a proof of how incomplete european integration is , " he said .

as examples he cites the vociferous controversy between germany and france on how to respond to the economic crisis , and points out that if anything , the euro zone countries are drifting apart economically . " they tend to act in self-interest first and foremost , " he said .
he predicts the dollar 's dominance as a reserve currency will continue unless europe manages to find a way to boost the process of integration .

as unemployment rises , some countries look to restrict visas , which could push more people to enter europe illegally . spain 's building boom drew africans to the southern european country by the hundreds of thousands in recent years .
many of these workers were the first to be laid off when spain 's real estate market cooled earlier this year .
spain , a country which welcomed 1 million immigrants in 2007 , now finds itself with 11.3 percent unemployment , the euro zone 's highest .
this has lead spain to slam the door on further immigration with laws aimed at cutting the number of work permits , restricting family reunion visas , and offering money to unemployed foreigners to go home .
spain is not alone in grappling with how to deal with migrant workers .
the international labor organization predicts that 20 million jobs will disappear worldwide by the end of next year .
countries across europe are considering more restrictive immigration measures .
europe warns against ejecting workers yet simply sending workers home wo n't help the situation , the united nations has warned .
it will simply decrease the number of legal immigrants and increase the number of illegal immigration .
to try and prevent that , the european union launched a 15 million euro -lrb- $ 18.70 million -rrb- initiative on tuesday , oct .

not all reader comments have been published .
dw-world.de reserves the right to edit for length and appropriateness of content . even if obama ca n't deliver 98 percent of the list of things that need to change and my taxes even go up , the altered tone and style of his presidency will be well worth it .
the world has to start somewhere .
obama has to be better than what we have now . - lorelei , us extensive research done on voting has long since come to the undeniable conclusion that the majority of people vote for very superficial reasons .
case in point is the almost unbelievable fanatic support for barack obama , who is almost seen as a messianic figure worldwide .
yet , even the most ardent obama supporters can not answer a straightforward question of who he is or what he has ever accomplished , fewer still seem to know anything about the platform he is running on .
i have found many times that putting obama supporters to the test with these simple questions will inevitably result in vague repeated mantras of " change " and the " hope he offers . "
it is not unlike talking to brain-washed cult-members who always follow blindly a " revered leader . " - jeff , us bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : one reader says obama brings hope , another says his fans are blindly fanatical no doubt the us finds itself in a culture shift ; but make no mistake , the shift will occur with or without obama .
the biggest failure in the article is you appear to be clueless as to this us election .
this is more of a movement than a historical event .
and while there will be gains and losses depending on point of view , significant change will occur , and to a much larger extent if the 60-seat threshold is met .
we 'll all have to wait and see just what the us metamorphosis turns out to be over the next generation , but the us , for better or worse , is changing , and dramatically - brought on as much by economics as politics . - mike ball , us i hope that europeans will understand what it really means for the united states to elect barack obama .
its more than just a political step forward , its a glimpse of hope for a society in which people of color or of immigrant backgrounds can finally feel a sense of what this country should be about : the concept of the dream that all people are created equal and free .
it would not be just words on parchment anymore ; it would be the beginning of a generation of real tolerance , a realization of a vision that brings hope to a future where the us can finally take its place in the world 's village and not be just a castle on a hill .
it may sound idealistic but it 's how he makes us feel .
he is an inspiration to people that have become increasingly pessimistic .
in my mind -lrb- he is -rrb- intellectual humanitarian , strong , compassionate and unafraid of a journey that seems to be his destiny . - margaret , us compiled by dw staff -lrb- kjb -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?
dw-world.de us elections check out dw 's complete coverage of the us presidential election from the european perspective .
experts : obama presidency likely to disappoint foreign fans as the us presidential election enters its final week , the vast majority of the world is rooting for barack obama .
but analysts say that high global expectations of the democrat will lead to disappointment , if he wins .
-lrb- 28.10.2008 -rrb- russians prefer the more " approachable " obama both john mccain and barack obama have been critical of russia , particularly in light of the georgian crisis .

as unemployment rises , some countries look to restrict visas , which could push more people to enter europe illegally . spain 's building boom drew africans to the southern european country by the hundreds of thousands in recent years .
many of these workers were the first to be laid off when spain 's real estate market cooled earlier this year .
spain , a country which welcomed 1 million immigrants in 2007 , now finds itself with 11.3 percent unemployment , the euro zone 's highest .
this has lead spain to slam the door on further immigration with laws aimed at cutting the number of work permits , restricting family reunion visas , and offering money to unemployed foreigners to go home .
spain is not alone in grappling with how to deal with migrant workers .
the international labor organization predicts that 20 million jobs will disappear worldwide by the end of next year .
countries across europe are considering more restrictive immigration measures .
europe warns against ejecting workers yet simply sending workers home wo n't help the situation , the united nations has warned .
it will simply decrease the number of legal immigrants and increase the number of illegal immigration .
to try and prevent that , the european union launched a 15 million euro -lrb- $ 18.70 million -rrb- initiative on tuesday , oct .
28 together with the un to try and protect migrant workers during the current economic crisis .
the program was launched on the sidelines of the global forum on migration and development in manila .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : many people migrate looking for job opportunities rich countries should not try to restrict migration from poor countries , even during the economic slowdown , peter sutherland , the un secretary general 's special representative on migration , warned .
" we 've seen how ineffective simple prohibition policies in regard to migration actually are , " he said .
" they do n't really work .
migrants migrate .
they will find a way , one way or another to do it . "
the number of migrants in the world is now estimated to be 40 million , 25 percent of whom are illegal , with the united states having the most migrants , according to sharan burrow , president of the international trade union confederation .
" our fear is that those numbers will increase , " burrow said at the opening of the four-day migration forum in manila .
britain looks to tighten immigration rising unemployment in the uk means that the country needs to consider restricting immigration , british immigration minister phil woolas recently told the times newspaper .
" if people are being made unemployed , the question of immigration becomes extremely thorny ... it 's been too easy to get into this country in the past and it 's going to get harder , " woolas said .
many european migrants from new eu member countries have come to britain in the past four years .
but there are some signs that many are heading home as the crisis hits , reuters recently reported .
the british government has considerred immigration reform which would have put into place an australian-style point system to let in highly-skilled workers but restrict access for unskilled migrants .
europe remains under pressure bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : many polish workers have headed west in search of work while officias say that they have not yet seen numbers of illegal immigrants spike globally , there are signs that european countries continue to be under pressure from illegal immigrants .
on monday , about 400 illegal immigrants were detained by italians as they tried to land on the italian island of lampedusa .
an additional 280 illegal immigrants had made landfall on the island over the weekend , according to the coast guard .
there has been a sharp increase in the number of people trying to enter italy by sea , according to figures from the interior ministry , which so far this year totals 23,600 .
afp news agency puts the number of immigrants who have tried to reach italy in october at 2,800 .
in greece , 10,000 would-be immigrants have been arrested trying to enter the country illegally during the first nine months of this year , compared to 9,240 last year , according to afp . dw staff -lrb- th -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

" it is just a stone 's throw away from a former paintbrush-making factory , where anti-nazi activist otto weidt illegally gave deaf and blind jews shelter and an opportunity to work during hitler 's reign , " he told the daily berliner zeitung .
" this house is the only authentic location in germany in which to remember these silent heroes . " a " tiny minority " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : a small number of germans hid jews from the nazis the term is used by historians to describe the germans who opposed hitler 's racist policies and helped jews escape nazi persecution .
the names of just 3,000 " silent heroes " are officially known , but historians believe more cases remain unrecorded . according to some estimates , 20,000 people across the country are thought to have offered their jewish fellow citizens some form of support and refuge during the nazi years .
the german population numbered some 70 million at the time . by end of world war ii , approximately 6 million european jews were killed as part of the nazi program of deliberate extermination led by adolf hitler . compared to the number of people who allowed nazi atrocities to happen or even took part in them , the people who shielded jews were " a tiny minority , " stressed berlin mayor klaus wowereit , who attended the opening . " but it is this minority that gives us direction , " he said .
" by commemorating these courageous people we are ensuring that attacks on human dignity will not be tolerated . " a sensitive issue bildunterschrift : the exhibition is one of a kind the exhibition consists of photographs , letters and other documents from 250 germans who risked their lives giving jews food , shelter or a place to work from 1938 to 1945 . " there are many memorial sites dedicated to those targeted by the nazis , but there has never been one which is solely dedicated to these heroes , " said johannes tuchel , director of an umbrella organization for memorials of resistance to the nazis , which put the exhibition together . tuchel said the " silent heroes " exhibition had not opened sooner because the issue of resistance to the nazis was still sensitive in germany . " we are still in the early stages of our research , " he told the daily tagesspiegel .
he and his organization now plan to begin cooperating with eastern european archivists as well as colleagues at the yad vashem memorial in israel to extend the project . dw staff -lrb- jp -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

as unemployment rises , some countries look to restrict visas , which could push more people to enter europe illegally . spain 's building boom drew africans to the southern european country by the hundreds of thousands in recent years .
many of these workers were the first to be laid off when spain 's real estate market cooled earlier this year .
spain , a country which welcomed 1 million immigrants in 2007 , now finds itself with 11.3 percent unemployment , the euro zone 's highest .
this has lead spain to slam the door on further immigration with laws aimed at cutting the number of work permits , restricting family reunion visas , and offering money to unemployed foreigners to go home .
spain is not alone in grappling with how to deal with migrant workers .
the international labor organization predicts that 20 million jobs will disappear worldwide by the end of next year .
countries across europe are considering more restrictive immigration measures .
europe warns against ejecting workers yet simply sending workers home wo n't help the situation , the united nations has warned .
it will simply decrease the number of legal immigrants and increase the number of illegal immigration .
to try and prevent that , the european union launched a 15 million euro -lrb- $ 18.70 million -rrb- initiative on tuesday , oct .
28 together with the un to try and protect migrant workers during the current economic crisis .
the program was launched on the sidelines of the global forum on migration and development in manila .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : many people migrate looking for job opportunities rich countries should not try to restrict migration from poor countries , even during the economic slowdown , peter sutherland , the un secretary general 's special representative on migration , warned .
" we 've seen how ineffective simple prohibition policies in regard to migration actually are , " he said .
" they do n't really work .
migrants migrate .
they will find a way , one way or another to do it . "
the number of migrants in the world is now estimated to be 40 million , 25 percent of whom are illegal , with the united states having the most migrants , according to sharan burrow , president of the international trade union confederation .
" our fear is that those numbers will increase , " burrow said at the opening of the four-day migration forum in manila .
britain looks to tighten immigration rising unemployment in the uk means that the country needs to consider restricting immigration , british immigration minister phil woolas recently told the times newspaper .
" if people are being made unemployed , the question of immigration becomes extremely thorny ... it 's been too easy to get into this country in the past and it 's going to get harder , " woolas said .
many european migrants from new eu member countries have come to britain in the past four years .
but there are some signs that many are heading home as the crisis hits , reuters recently reported .
the british government has considerred immigration reform which would have put into place an australian-style point system to let in highly-skilled workers but restrict access for unskilled migrants .
europe remains under pressure bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : many polish workers have headed west in search of work while officias say that they have not yet seen numbers of illegal immigrants spike globally , there are signs that european countries continue to be under pressure from illegal immigrants .
on monday , about 400 illegal immigrants were detained by italians as they tried to land on the italian island of lampedusa .
an additional 280 illegal immigrants had made landfall on the island over the weekend , according to the coast guard .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de exchange rates -pipe- 29.10.2008 falling euro may signal deeper eu woes großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : a dollar will buy more euros these days euro zone members have watched their currency fall sharply against the dollar in recent days , as forex markets react to the complex global financial crisis .
but observers disagree on the possible effects of the decline . analysts took conflicting lessons from the euro 's fall to two-and-a-half-year lows , with some saying the fall is a short-term problem that could help boost exports , while others saw it as a sign of serious policy discord in the 15-nation euro zone .
in european trading on tuesday , oct .
28 , the euro touched a low of $ 1.23 - the last time it was so weak was in april , 2006 - before reaching $ 1.25 in asian trading .
the currency fell even farther against the yen ; in all it weakened against 14 of the 16 most active currencies .
analysts attributed the drop to a number of factors , including the widespread perception that europe 's economy is on the brink of a recession and the expectation that european central bank president jean-claude trichet may soon lower interest rates .
' a question of politics ' exchanges rates are n't just a question of economics , " it is a question of politics , " said ognian hishow , a german economist who is currently a visiting professor at the university of rochester .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the last time the euro fell so low was in april , 2006 " once the world starts to get suspicious of a given player - like the euro zone now - then they will look for an alternative for where to put their money , " he said .
" right now , the only good alternative is the us dollar . "
alexandra boehne , a finance expert for the german chamber of commerce , noted that the falling euro reflects the growing concern over the extent of the european financial crisis .
" no one knows how the financial-market crisis will develop , how long it will continue and how bad the economy will get , " she said .
financial players have known about the economic crisis in the us since last year , but the news that europe is heavily affected is new to the market .
' the markets are insecure ' " people have only been aware of a problem in europe since the autumn of 2008 , " she said .
" the markets are very insecure right now . "
some analysts say european banks ' heavy exposure to credit-soaked emerging markets , particularly in eastern europe , has left the currency vulnerable .
bloomberg news service cited a report on tuesday that showed european banks ' lending to emerging markets is around 21 percent of europe 's gross domestic product , compared with 4 percent for the us and 5 percent for japan .
meanwhile there are other indicators that recession may be around the corner - including a ground-shaking report on monday that german consumer confidence had plunged to five-year lows . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the financial crisis : a game of dominos in the end , " investors conclude that america is still the most reliable destination when it comes to where to put your money in such rainy days , " hishow said .
not all analysts agree about the extent of the euro problem .
the chamber of commerce 's boehme said it could actually give germany 's giant export economy a boost by making things " made in germany , " like automobiles and chemicals , cheaper .
pessimism on export growth according to hishow , however , this would be the case if it were n't for the fact that germany 's main export markets - the us and the rest of europe - are stagnating .
" where can german companies sell their goods ?
in america ?
in latin america ? "
hishow asks rhetorically .
" in the dollar area it is impossible because of the downsizing there , and china , while its currency is pegged to the dollar , is facing hard times too , so there 's not enough help there , " he said .
" i 'm not optimistic . "

he expects the euro 's " short term drop " to reverse itself .
he calls the bout of euro-selling an " adjustment " to issues of monetary policy , namely " pressure on the euro because of potential for further interest rate cuts . "

dreger says he disagrees with the investors who are betting that europe will recover more slowly than the us .
he thinks they are overreacting to possible weakness in central european economies , and believes the euro will appreciate because " it will benefit more from catching-up processes in emerging markets like china and india , where the eu is heavily invested . "

but observers disagree on the possible effects of the decline . analysts took conflicting lessons from the euro 's fall to two-and-a-half-year lows , with some saying the fall is a short-term problem that could help boost exports , while others saw it as a sign of serious policy discord in the 15-nation euro zone .
in european trading on tuesday , oct .
28 , the euro touched a low of $ 1.23 - the last time it was so weak was in april , 2006 - before reaching $ 1.25 in asian trading .
the currency fell even farther against the yen ; in all it weakened against 14 of the 16 most active currencies .
analysts attributed the drop to a number of factors , including the widespread perception that europe 's economy is on the brink of a recession and the expectation that european central bank president jean-claude trichet may soon lower interest rates .
' a question of politics ' exchanges rates are n't just a question of economics , " it is a question of politics , " said ognian hishow , a german economist who is currently a visiting professor at the university of rochester .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the last time the euro fell so low was in april , 2006 " once the world starts to get suspicious of a given player - like the euro zone now - then they will look for an alternative for where to put their money , " he said .
" right now , the only good alternative is the us dollar . "
alexandra boehne , a finance expert for the german chamber of commerce , noted that the falling euro reflects the growing concern over the extent of the european financial crisis .
" no one knows how the financial-market crisis will develop , how long it will continue and how bad the economy will get , " she said .
financial players have known about the economic crisis in the us since last year , but the news that europe is heavily affected is new to the market .
' the markets are insecure ' " people have only been aware of a problem in europe since the autumn of 2008 , " she said .
" the markets are very insecure right now . "
some analysts say european banks ' heavy exposure to credit-soaked emerging markets , particularly in eastern europe , has left the currency vulnerable .
bloomberg news service cited a report on tuesday that showed european banks ' lending to emerging markets is around 21 percent of europe 's gross domestic product , compared with 4 percent for the us and 5 percent for japan .
meanwhile there are other indicators that recession may be around the corner - including a ground-shaking report on monday that german consumer confidence had plunged to five-year lows . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the financial crisis : a game of dominos in the end , " investors conclude that america is still the most reliable destination when it comes to where to put your money in such rainy days , " hishow said .
not all analysts agree about the extent of the euro problem .
the chamber of commerce 's boehme said it could actually give germany 's giant export economy a boost by making things " made in germany , " like automobiles and chemicals , cheaper .
pessimism on export growth according to hishow , however , this would be the case if it were n't for the fact that germany 's main export markets - the us and the rest of europe - are stagnating .
" where can german companies sell their goods ?
in america ?
in latin america ? "
hishow asks rhetorically .
" in the dollar area it is impossible because of the downsizing there , and china , while its currency is pegged to the dollar , is facing hard times too , so there 's not enough help there , " he said .
" i 'm not optimistic . "

but observers disagree on the possible effects of the decline . analysts took conflicting lessons from the euro 's fall to two-and-a-half-year lows , with some saying the fall is a short-term problem that could help boost exports , while others saw it as a sign of serious policy discord in the 15-nation euro zone .
in european trading on tuesday , oct .
28 , the euro touched a low of $ 1.23 - the last time it was so weak was in april , 2006 - before reaching $ 1.25 in asian trading .
the currency fell even farther against the yen ; in all it weakened against 14 of the 16 most active currencies .
analysts attributed the drop to a number of factors , including the widespread perception that europe 's economy is on the brink of a recession and the expectation that european central bank president jean-claude trichet may soon lower interest rates .
' a question of politics ' exchanges rates are n't just a question of economics , " it is a question of politics , " said ognian hishow , a german economist who is currently a visiting professor at the university of rochester .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the last time the euro fell so low was in april , 2006 " once the world starts to get suspicious of a given player - like the euro zone now - then they will look for an alternative for where to put their money , " he said .
" right now , the only good alternative is the us dollar . "
alexandra boehne , a finance expert for the german chamber of commerce , noted that the falling euro reflects the growing concern over the extent of the european financial crisis .
" no one knows how the financial-market crisis will develop , how long it will continue and how bad the economy will get , " she said .
financial players have known about the economic crisis in the us since last year , but the news that europe is heavily affected is new to the market .
' the markets are insecure ' " people have only been aware of a problem in europe since the autumn of 2008 , " she said .
" the markets are very insecure right now . "
some analysts say european banks ' heavy exposure to credit-soaked emerging markets , particularly in eastern europe , has left the currency vulnerable .
bloomberg news service cited a report on tuesday that showed european banks ' lending to emerging markets is around 21 percent of europe 's gross domestic product , compared with 4 percent for the us and 5 percent for japan .
meanwhile there are other indicators that recession may be around the corner - including a ground-shaking report on monday that german consumer confidence had plunged to five-year lows . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the financial crisis : a game of dominos in the end , " investors conclude that america is still the most reliable destination when it comes to where to put your money in such rainy days , " hishow said .
not all analysts agree about the extent of the euro problem .
the chamber of commerce 's boehme said it could actually give germany 's giant export economy a boost by making things " made in germany , " like automobiles and chemicals , cheaper .
pessimism on export growth according to hishow , however , this would be the case if it were n't for the fact that germany 's main export markets - the us and the rest of europe - are stagnating .
" where can german companies sell their goods ?
in america ?
in latin america ? "
hishow asks rhetorically .
" in the dollar area it is impossible because of the downsizing there , and china , while its currency is pegged to the dollar , is facing hard times too , so there 's not enough help there , " he said .
" i 'm not optimistic . "
meanwhile christian dreger , an economist at the german institute for economics research -lrb- diw -rrb- , argues that the drop in the euro is merely a temporary blip .
compared to the 80 us cents that the euro was trading for in 2002 , the european currency is still strong , he notes .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : ecb head trichet : plans to cut rates ?
he expects the euro 's " short term drop " to reverse itself .
he calls the bout of euro-selling an " adjustment " to issues of monetary policy , namely " pressure on the euro because of potential for further interest rate cuts . "
upside for the dollar ?
dreger says he disagrees with the investors who are betting that europe will recover more slowly than the us .
he thinks they are overreacting to possible weakness in central european economies , and believes the euro will appreciate because " it will benefit more from catching-up processes in emerging markets like china and india , where the eu is heavily invested . "
economist hishow disagrees .
over time , he says , there will be a correction in the american trade balance and the dollar will improve .
moreover , he said he strongly believes the financial crisis and the falling euro are signals of deep underlying problems in the euro zone .
european integration at fault " this crisis is a proof of how incomplete european integration is , " he said .
" when there are hard times , there is no unified response . "
as examples he cites the vociferous controversy between germany and france on how to respond to the economic crisis , and points out that if anything , the euro zone countries are drifting apart economically . " they tend to act in self-interest first and foremost , " he said .
he predicts the dollar 's dominance as a reserve currency will continue unless europe manages to find a way to boost the process of integration .
" i know many europeans do n't like this conclusion , but it is the reality , " hishow said .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de drugs -pipe- 29.10.2008 dutch municipalities plan new campaign against drug tourists großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : dutch municipalities are hoping to cooperate in a new initiative against drugs tourism municipal officials in the netherlands are taking another crack at stopping drug tourists flooding into their country to take advantage of the country 's soft drugs policy . the dutch association for municipalities , vng , announced tuesday , oct .
28 that it will host a soft drugs summit in the third week of november in maastricht .
participants will seek ways to discourage tourists who visit the netherlands to take advantage of its liberal drug laws .
by extension , the summit also seeks to reduce drug-related crime .
the summit comes in the wake of last week 's decision by the south- western dutch towns of roosendaal and bergen op zoom to gradually close their local " coffee shops " in an attempt to reduce drug-related crimes .
all dutch cities and towns close to the german or belgian borders are invited to the summit .
after the summit , the vng will present the cities ' common position to the government .
the goal , according to vng , is to get the government to negotiate an international soft drugs policy with belgium and germany .
the netherlands effectively decriminalized soft drugs a few decades ago when it introduced a policy of " non-enforcement . "
although possession and cultivation of cannabis remains technically illegal in holland , law enforcement has systematically turned a blind eye , and the courts usually rule in favor of individual defendants .
the sale and use of so-called soft drugs , such as marijuana , is legal in designated stores , usually referred to as " coffee shops . "
maastricht suffering most from drug-related crime maastricht mayor gerd leers calls the current dutch drugs policy " hypocritical . "
he says it enables drug-related crime and also increases the sale and distribution of hard drugs , such as heroin .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : a police officer talks to a french drug tourist in maastricht maastricht is one of the dutch cities suffering most from drug- related crime .
the city is visited by more than 1.5 million drugs tourists per year and has 16 " coffee shops , " 10 more than in dutch cities of comparable size not located close to the border .
police estimate maastricht also has more than 100 " soft drugs supermarkets , " illegal stores where one can purchase soft drugs in larger quantities than the 5 grams per person allowed under dutch law .
leers says police officers in his city deal with triple the amount of crime as their colleagues in the metropolitan area of the hague .

28 that it will host a soft drugs summit in the third week of november in maastricht .
participants will seek ways to discourage tourists who visit the netherlands to take advantage of its liberal drug laws .
by extension , the summit also seeks to reduce drug-related crime .
the summit comes in the wake of last week 's decision by the south- western dutch towns of roosendaal and bergen op zoom to gradually close their local " coffee shops " in an attempt to reduce drug-related crimes .
all dutch cities and towns close to the german or belgian borders are invited to the summit .
after the summit , the vng will present the cities ' common position to the government .
the goal , according to vng , is to get the government to negotiate an international soft drugs policy with belgium and germany .
the netherlands effectively decriminalized soft drugs a few decades ago when it introduced a policy of " non-enforcement . "
although possession and cultivation of cannabis remains technically illegal in holland , law enforcement has systematically turned a blind eye , and the courts usually rule in favor of individual defendants .
the sale and use of so-called soft drugs , such as marijuana , is legal in designated stores , usually referred to as " coffee shops . "

looking more like something out of thousand and one nights than ring of the nibelung , the venue was hardly evocative of the hard seats filled by worshipful wagnerians at the german composer 's opera house in the bavarian town of bayreuth .
when the final tones of twilight of the gods faded on saturday evening - part of a wagner gala by the bayreuth festival orchestra under conductor christian thielemann - the minor sensation was complete : the emirate had inaugurated the abu dhabi classics , a first in the gulf states .
but what would richard wagner have thought ?
top acts the concert marked another step in abu dhabi 's mission to become a cultural capital .
a total of 22 concerts are scheduled until the season 's end in may 2009 .
among the guest artists will be top-flight stars dear to classical music fans : lang lang and cecilia bartoli , zubin mehta and lorin maazel , the vienna philharmonic and the philharmonic orchestra of london , the cellist misha maisky and pianist arcadi volodos , bobby mcferrin and till broenner .
the abu dhabi classics will run until 2012 at least , and its concerts will be integrated into the educational programm of schools in abu dhabi , the largest emirate of the united arab emirates -lrb- uae -rrb- .
new markets bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : katharina wagner on hand for the premiere was katharina wagner , who was recently named co-director of the annual bayreuth festival and is seeking new markets for bayreuth and her great-grandfather 's music .
she announced that the bayreuth festival orchestra would , in future , be performing away from home once a year .
" we intend to revive this tradition , " wagner said , adding that entire productions , such as the ring of the nibelung , might be exported .
she did not rule out directing a production herself in abu dhabi at some time .
building bridges abu dhabi 's new music event aims to " build bridges , " say culture officials in the emirate .
the fabulously rich oil producer sees the creation of a music scene modeled after those in the west as a way to secure its place in the globalised world .
following years of construction , " the new generation of rulers wants to take a further step , " remarked zaki nusseibeh , deputy chairman of the abu dhabi authority for culture and heritage -lrb- adach -rrb- .
the uae 's longtime ruler , sheik zayed bin sultan al nahyan , died four years ago and was succeeded by a son .
with 10 percent of the world 's oil reserves , abu dhabi looks as though it will enjoy oil income for some time to come .
it has a population of about 800,000 and is somewhat smaller than the german state of bavaria .
cultural diversity bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : abu dhabi is set to host a branch of the louvre museum abu dhabi already boasts a literature prize and film festival , and is currently having 100 books by western authors translated into arabic .
" we spend a lot of money on culture , " noted abdulla salim al amri , director of arts and culture at the adch .
he declined to specify a figure , saying that " any amount you name is ok . "
every day , abu dhabi produces oil valued at some 240 million euros .
off its coast , on saadiyat island , abu dhabi is developing a cultural district that will likely have no equal worldwide .
covering an area of 27 square kilometers and expected to be completed in 2018 , it will include four museums , a performing arts center , housing for 150,000 people , a golf course , and a marina .
one of the museums , an outpost of the paris-based louvre , is a shell flooded with light designed by french architect jean nouvel .
frank gehry , architect of the celebrated guggenheim museum bilbao , has designed an eighth branch of the new york-based museum for saadiyat island .
the performing arts center , a gigantic leaf-like structure of glass and concrete designed by zaha hadid , will contain an opera house , concert hall , and music hall for up to 6,300 spectators .
norman foster is contributing a national museum , and japan 's tadeo ando has designed a museum dedicated to the uae 's maritime past .
so it was probably only a matter of time until abu dhabi latched on to wagner , tchaikovsky and co .

curiosity , and not only money , attracted them to the gulf , he said .
abu dhabi had seen european orchestras before , most recently the dresden state orchestra of saxony .
the new york philharmonic will perform in the emirate next year .
the arab world has a special affinity for the romanticist wagner , nusseibeh noted .
in his opera " parsifal , " for instance , the german composer distilled his longing for the orient , he said .
arabs ' fondness for wagner has nothing to do with his " ideology , " nusseibeh added , referring to wagner 's strident anti-semitism .

looking more like something out of thousand and one nights than ring of the nibelung , the venue was hardly evocative of the hard seats filled by worshipful wagnerians at the german composer 's opera house in the bavarian town of bayreuth .
when the final tones of twilight of the gods faded on saturday evening - part of a wagner gala by the bayreuth festival orchestra under conductor christian thielemann - the minor sensation was complete : the emirate had inaugurated the abu dhabi classics , a first in the gulf states .
but what would richard wagner have thought ?
top acts the concert marked another step in abu dhabi 's mission to become a cultural capital .
a total of 22 concerts are scheduled until the season 's end in may 2009 .
among the guest artists will be top-flight stars dear to classical music fans : lang lang and cecilia bartoli , zubin mehta and lorin maazel , the vienna philharmonic and the philharmonic orchestra of london , the cellist misha maisky and pianist arcadi volodos , bobby mcferrin and till broenner .
the abu dhabi classics will run until 2012 at least , and its concerts will be integrated into the educational programm of schools in abu dhabi , the largest emirate of the united arab emirates -lrb- uae -rrb- .
new markets bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : katharina wagner on hand for the premiere was katharina wagner , who was recently named co-director of the annual bayreuth festival and is seeking new markets for bayreuth and her great-grandfather 's music .
she announced that the bayreuth festival orchestra would , in future , be performing away from home once a year .
" we intend to revive this tradition , " wagner said , adding that entire productions , such as the ring of the nibelung , might be exported .
she did not rule out directing a production herself in abu dhabi at some time .
building bridges abu dhabi 's new music event aims to " build bridges , " say culture officials in the emirate .
the fabulously rich oil producer sees the creation of a music scene modeled after those in the west as a way to secure its place in the globalised world .
following years of construction , " the new generation of rulers wants to take a further step , " remarked zaki nusseibeh , deputy chairman of the abu dhabi authority for culture and heritage -lrb- adach -rrb- .
the uae 's longtime ruler , sheik zayed bin sultan al nahyan , died four years ago and was succeeded by a son .
with 10 percent of the world 's oil reserves , abu dhabi looks as though it will enjoy oil income for some time to come .
it has a population of about 800,000 and is somewhat smaller than the german state of bavaria .
cultural diversity bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : abu dhabi is set to host a branch of the louvre museum abu dhabi already boasts a literature prize and film festival , and is currently having 100 books by western authors translated into arabic .
" we spend a lot of money on culture , " noted abdulla salim al amri , director of arts and culture at the adch .
he declined to specify a figure , saying that " any amount you name is ok . "
every day , abu dhabi produces oil valued at some 240 million euros .
off its coast , on saadiyat island , abu dhabi is developing a cultural district that will likely have no equal worldwide .
covering an area of 27 square kilometers and expected to be completed in 2018 , it will include four museums , a performing arts center , housing for 150,000 people , a golf course , and a marina .
one of the museums , an outpost of the paris-based louvre , is a shell flooded with light designed by french architect jean nouvel .
frank gehry , architect of the celebrated guggenheim museum bilbao , has designed an eighth branch of the new york-based museum for saadiyat island .
the performing arts center , a gigantic leaf-like structure of glass and concrete designed by zaha hadid , will contain an opera house , concert hall , and music hall for up to 6,300 spectators .
norman foster is contributing a national museum , and japan 's tadeo ando has designed a museum dedicated to the uae 's maritime past .
so it was probably only a matter of time until abu dhabi latched on to wagner , tchaikovsky and co .
the german connection bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the concert was held in the luxury emirates palace germany 's till janczukowicz , executive artistic director of the abu dhabi classics , presented the emirate with a plan and managed within a few months to sign top artists who are booked for years in advance .
curiosity , and not only money , attracted them to the gulf , he said .
abu dhabi had seen european orchestras before , most recently the dresden state orchestra of saxony .
the new york philharmonic will perform in the emirate next year .
the arab world has a special affinity for the romanticist wagner , nusseibeh noted .
in his opera " parsifal , " for instance , the german composer distilled his longing for the orient , he said .
arabs ' fondness for wagner has nothing to do with his " ideology , " nusseibeh added , referring to wagner 's strident anti-semitism .

it may also become the owner of austrian airlines . lufthansa already holds minority stakes in both eurowings and bmi , which was formerly named british midland .
high fuel prices earlier this year and a looming recession have put heavy pressure on smaller , weaker airlines in recent weeks , speeding up consolidation in the aviation industry . in frankfurt , lufthansa said on wednesday , oct .
29 , that it had received an offer from another eurowings shareholder , ak industriebeteiligung , for 50.9 percent of the airline and this would be acquired by the end of the year . earlier plans to merge eurowings , which mainly flies routes within europe , with an airline run by german travel company tui failed . control of bmi is to be acquired from businessman michael bishop , lufthansa said .
the british airline 's landing and takeoff slots at heathrow airport , the principal london airport , add to its value to lufthansa . in a third possible merger , lufthansa was also the only company to put in a binding bid for austrian airlines earlier this week . financial crisis bites into lufthansa profits the pair of lufthansa takeovers comes on the heels of a profit warning issued by the company tuesday . lufthansa said that it expects operational earnings this year to total just 1.1 billion euros -lrb- $ 1.4 billion -rrb- , down from its past forecast of 1.4 billion euros and blamed the drop on high fuel costs and weakened sales due to the global financial crisis . the airline posted 149 million euros in net profit between july and september , while operating profit in the third quarter plunged by 53.4 percent to 279 million euros , the company said in a statement . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : mayrhuber is confident that lufthansa has the tools to survive " this is a respectable result taking into consideration the considerable strains being felt as a result of the ongoing crisis in the financial markets and the overall economic situation , " chairman wolfgang mayrhuber said .
" in addition , we are working on our productivity , our measures to improve fuel consumption and the reduction of external costs . " in the first nine months of the year , operating profit fell by 9.3 percent to 984 million euros .
net profit during the same period plummeted by 65.1 percent to 551 million euros . the company 's results had been inflated in 2007 by lufthansa 's acquisition of the airline swiss and the sale of its stake in the british travel group thomas cook . swiss suffered heavy losses during the third quarter , with operating profit sinking by 76 percent to 112 million euros . lufthansa forecast only minor growth in passenger numbers due to market turmoil , expecting them to rise by just 0.8 percent in 2009 versus 5.2 percent this year . degrees of suffering the lufthansa figures follow on from seemingly endless bad news coming from europe 's airline industry . the denmark-based low-cost carrier sterling airways filed for bankruptcy on tuesday while air france-klm last week said it would struggle to meet its billion-euro earnings target and that it would trim its investment plans . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : alitalia is one european airline currently suffering the future of ailing italian carrier alitalia also remained uncertain .
the airline , which is 49.9 percent state-owned , is losing about three million euros a day and has debts totaling some 1.2 billion euros , which will have to be shouldered by the italian taxpayer .
however , it could be saved by british airways which earlier this month reiterated the company 's interest in a partnership with alitalia . non-european airlines were feeling the strain too , with carriers worldwide expected to lose around $ 5.2 billion this year owing to sharply higher oil prices and declining demand , the industry association iata said on october 17 , with losses expected to continue next year . dw staff -lrb- nda -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

the airline , which is 49.9 percent state-owned , is losing about three million euros a day and has debts totaling some 1.2 billion euros , which will have to be shouldered by the italian taxpayer .
however , it could be saved by british airways which earlier this month reiterated the company 's interest in a partnership with alitalia . non-european airlines were feeling the strain too , with carriers worldwide expected to lose around $ 5.2 billion this year owing to sharply higher oil prices and declining demand , the industry association iata said on october 17 , with losses expected to continue next year . dw staff -lrb- nda -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

" it is just a stone 's throw away from a former paintbrush-making factory , where anti-nazi activist otto weidt illegally gave deaf and blind jews shelter and an opportunity to work during hitler 's reign , " he told the daily berliner zeitung .
" this house is the only authentic location in germany in which to remember these silent heroes . " a " tiny minority " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : a small number of germans hid jews from the nazis the term is used by historians to describe the germans who opposed hitler 's racist policies and helped jews escape nazi persecution .
the names of just 3,000 " silent heroes " are officially known , but historians believe more cases remain unrecorded . according to some estimates , 20,000 people across the country are thought to have offered their jewish fellow citizens some form of support and refuge during the nazi years .
the german population numbered some 70 million at the time . by end of world war ii , approximately 6 million european jews were killed as part of the nazi program of deliberate extermination led by adolf hitler . compared to the number of people who allowed nazi atrocities to happen or even took part in them , the people who shielded jews were " a tiny minority , " stressed berlin mayor klaus wowereit , who attended the opening . " but it is this minority that gives us direction , " he said .
" by commemorating these courageous people we are ensuring that attacks on human dignity will not be tolerated . " a sensitive issue bildunterschrift : the exhibition is one of a kind the exhibition consists of photographs , letters and other documents from 250 germans who risked their lives giving jews food , shelter or a place to work from 1938 to 1945 . " there are many memorial sites dedicated to those targeted by the nazis , but there has never been one which is solely dedicated to these heroes , " said johannes tuchel , director of an umbrella organization for memorials of resistance to the nazis , which put the exhibition together . tuchel said the " silent heroes " exhibition had not opened sooner because the issue of resistance to the nazis was still sensitive in germany . " we are still in the early stages of our research , " he told the daily tagesspiegel .
he and his organization now plan to begin cooperating with eastern european archivists as well as colleagues at the yad vashem memorial in israel to extend the project . dw staff -lrb- jp -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de immigration -pipe- 29.10.2008 illegal immigration spike expected in europe großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : experts warn that restricting work visas will increase illegal immigration europe is bracing for an increase in illegal immigration as the financial crisis continues .
as unemployment rises , some countries look to restrict visas , which could push more people to enter europe illegally . spain 's building boom drew africans to the southern european country by the hundreds of thousands in recent years .
many of these workers were the first to be laid off when spain 's real estate market cooled earlier this year .
spain , a country which welcomed 1 million immigrants in 2007 , now finds itself with 11.3 percent unemployment , the euro zone 's highest .
this has lead spain to slam the door on further immigration with laws aimed at cutting the number of work permits , restricting family reunion visas , and offering money to unemployed foreigners to go home .
spain is not alone in grappling with how to deal with migrant workers .
the international labor organization predicts that 20 million jobs will disappear worldwide by the end of next year .
countries across europe are considering more restrictive immigration measures .
europe warns against ejecting workers yet simply sending workers home wo n't help the situation , the united nations has warned .
it will simply decrease the number of legal immigrants and increase the number of illegal immigration .
to try and prevent that , the european union launched a 15 million euro -lrb- $ 18.70 million -rrb- initiative on tuesday , oct .
28 together with the un to try and protect migrant workers during the current economic crisis .
the program was launched on the sidelines of the global forum on migration and development in manila .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : many people migrate looking for job opportunities rich countries should not try to restrict migration from poor countries , even during the economic slowdown , peter sutherland , the un secretary general 's special representative on migration , warned .
" we 've seen how ineffective simple prohibition policies in regard to migration actually are , " he said .
" they do n't really work .
migrants migrate .
they will find a way , one way or another to do it . "
the number of migrants in the world is now estimated to be 40 million , 25 percent of whom are illegal , with the united states having the most migrants , according to sharan burrow , president of the international trade union confederation .
" our fear is that those numbers will increase , " burrow said at the opening of the four-day migration forum in manila .
britain looks to tighten immigration rising unemployment in the uk means that the country needs to consider restricting immigration , british immigration minister phil woolas recently told the times newspaper .
" if people are being made unemployed , the question of immigration becomes extremely thorny ... it 's been too easy to get into this country in the past and it 's going to get harder , " woolas said .
many european migrants from new eu member countries have come to britain in the past four years .
but there are some signs that many are heading home as the crisis hits , reuters recently reported .
the british government has considerred immigration reform which would have put into place an australian-style point system to let in highly-skilled workers but restrict access for unskilled migrants .
europe remains under pressure bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : many polish workers have headed west in search of work while officias say that they have not yet seen numbers of illegal immigrants spike globally , there are signs that european countries continue to be under pressure from illegal immigrants .
on monday , about 400 illegal immigrants were detained by italians as they tried to land on the italian island of lampedusa .
an additional 280 illegal immigrants had made landfall on the island over the weekend , according to the coast guard .
there has been a sharp increase in the number of people trying to enter italy by sea , according to figures from the interior ministry , which so far this year totals 23,600 .
afp news agency puts the number of immigrants who have tried to reach italy in october at 2,800 .
in greece , 10,000 would-be immigrants have been arrested trying to enter the country illegally during the first nine months of this year , compared to 9,240 last year , according to afp . dw staff -lrb- th -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

looking more like something out of thousand and one nights than ring of the nibelung , the venue was hardly evocative of the hard seats filled by worshipful wagnerians at the german composer 's opera house in the bavarian town of bayreuth .
when the final tones of twilight of the gods faded on saturday evening - part of a wagner gala by the bayreuth festival orchestra under conductor christian thielemann - the minor sensation was complete : the emirate had inaugurated the abu dhabi classics , a first in the gulf states .
but what would richard wagner have thought ?
top acts the concert marked another step in abu dhabi 's mission to become a cultural capital .
a total of 22 concerts are scheduled until the season 's end in may 2009 .
among the guest artists will be top-flight stars dear to classical music fans : lang lang and cecilia bartoli , zubin mehta and lorin maazel , the vienna philharmonic and the philharmonic orchestra of london , the cellist misha maisky and pianist arcadi volodos , bobby mcferrin and till broenner .
the abu dhabi classics will run until 2012 at least , and its concerts will be integrated into the educational programm of schools in abu dhabi , the largest emirate of the united arab emirates -lrb- uae -rrb- .
new markets bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : katharina wagner on hand for the premiere was katharina wagner , who was recently named co-director of the annual bayreuth festival and is seeking new markets for bayreuth and her great-grandfather 's music .
she announced that the bayreuth festival orchestra would , in future , be performing away from home once a year .
" we intend to revive this tradition , " wagner said , adding that entire productions , such as the ring of the nibelung , might be exported .
she did not rule out directing a production herself in abu dhabi at some time .
building bridges abu dhabi 's new music event aims to " build bridges , " say culture officials in the emirate .
the fabulously rich oil producer sees the creation of a music scene modeled after those in the west as a way to secure its place in the globalised world .
following years of construction , " the new generation of rulers wants to take a further step , " remarked zaki nusseibeh , deputy chairman of the abu dhabi authority for culture and heritage -lrb- adach -rrb- .
the uae 's longtime ruler , sheik zayed bin sultan al nahyan , died four years ago and was succeeded by a son .
with 10 percent of the world 's oil reserves , abu dhabi looks as though it will enjoy oil income for some time to come .
it has a population of about 800,000 and is somewhat smaller than the german state of bavaria .
cultural diversity bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : abu dhabi is set to host a branch of the louvre museum abu dhabi already boasts a literature prize and film festival , and is currently having 100 books by western authors translated into arabic .
" we spend a lot of money on culture , " noted abdulla salim al amri , director of arts and culture at the adch .
he declined to specify a figure , saying that " any amount you name is ok . "
every day , abu dhabi produces oil valued at some 240 million euros .
off its coast , on saadiyat island , abu dhabi is developing a cultural district that will likely have no equal worldwide .
covering an area of 27 square kilometers and expected to be completed in 2018 , it will include four museums , a performing arts center , housing for 150,000 people , a golf course , and a marina .
one of the museums , an outpost of the paris-based louvre , is a shell flooded with light designed by french architect jean nouvel .
frank gehry , architect of the celebrated guggenheim museum bilbao , has designed an eighth branch of the new york-based museum for saadiyat island .
the performing arts center , a gigantic leaf-like structure of glass and concrete designed by zaha hadid , will contain an opera house , concert hall , and music hall for up to 6,300 spectators .
norman foster is contributing a national museum , and japan 's tadeo ando has designed a museum dedicated to the uae 's maritime past .
so it was probably only a matter of time until abu dhabi latched on to wagner , tchaikovsky and co .
the german connection bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the concert was held in the luxury emirates palace germany 's till janczukowicz , executive artistic director of the abu dhabi classics , presented the emirate with a plan and managed within a few months to sign top artists who are booked for years in advance .
curiosity , and not only money , attracted them to the gulf , he said .
abu dhabi had seen european orchestras before , most recently the dresden state orchestra of saxony .
the new york philharmonic will perform in the emirate next year .
the arab world has a special affinity for the romanticist wagner , nusseibeh noted .
in his opera " parsifal , " for instance , the german composer distilled his longing for the orient , he said .
arabs ' fondness for wagner has nothing to do with his " ideology , " nusseibeh added , referring to wagner 's strident anti-semitism .
" the arab world is n't part of this debate , " he said .
foreigners made up the bulk of the some 1,000 people who came to saturday evening 's premiere at the emirates palace hotel .
about 100 students also attended , prompting nusseibeh to remark that everyone could understand wagner 's music . dpa news agency -lrb- jp -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

but the luxury carmaker now also has to counter suspicions of manipulation . what goes up must come down - that was the motto of porsche 's share liquidity initiative on the german stock exchange , the dax , on wednesday , oct .
29 .
porsche 's willingness to make vw stocks available to investors immediately caused prices , which had zoomed up to over 1,000 euros -lrb- $ 1,250 -rrb- on tuesday , to tumble .
by midday , vw shares had lost 38 percent , having fallen from their opening level of 945 euros to 588 .
porsche representatives said the action was necessary to restore a measure of stability to vw share prices .
and they denied that their company was profiting from the rollercoaster ride .
" we want to ensure that prices return to a sensible level , " a porsche spokesman told the online portal of the german financial periodical manager-magazin .
" we do n't want to cash in on vw .
calming things down is what 's in our interest . "
ironically , the action became necessary precisely because porsche ambitions vis-a-vis vw had created an emergency shortage of the latter carmaker 's stock .
larger goal remains bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : porsche says it still intends to move in on vw vw share prices skyrocketed because investors underestimated the extent to which porsche had acquired volkswagen stocks and options .
last weekend , porsche announced that it controlled 74 percent of vw shares .
that left speculators who had sold the stock short or borrowed it in a position of having to buy whatever shares were available at vastly inflated prices .
by law , the german state of lower saxony where volkswagen 's headquarters are located owns 20.1 percent of company 's shares .
porsche 's decision on wednesday to cancel up to five percent of its guarantees dramatically improves vw share availability , but it does not represent a fundamental change in porsche strategy .
porsche reaffirmed on wednesday its intention to acquire up to 75 percent of vw stock , either on exchange markets or by other means .

it may also become the owner of austrian airlines . lufthansa already holds minority stakes in both eurowings and bmi , which was formerly named british midland .
high fuel prices earlier this year and a looming recession have put heavy pressure on smaller , weaker airlines in recent weeks , speeding up consolidation in the aviation industry . in frankfurt , lufthansa said on wednesday , oct .
29 , that it had received an offer from another eurowings shareholder , ak industriebeteiligung , for 50.9 percent of the airline and this would be acquired by the end of the year . earlier plans to merge eurowings , which mainly flies routes within europe , with an airline run by german travel company tui failed . control of bmi is to be acquired from businessman michael bishop , lufthansa said .
the british airline 's landing and takeoff slots at heathrow airport , the principal london airport , add to its value to lufthansa . in a third possible merger , lufthansa was also the only company to put in a binding bid for austrian airlines earlier this week . financial crisis bites into lufthansa profits the pair of lufthansa takeovers comes on the heels of a profit warning issued by the company tuesday . lufthansa said that it expects operational earnings this year to total just 1.1 billion euros -lrb- $ 1.4 billion -rrb- , down from its past forecast of 1.4 billion euros and blamed the drop on high fuel costs and weakened sales due to the global financial crisis . the airline posted 149 million euros in net profit between july and september , while operating profit in the third quarter plunged by 53.4 percent to 279 million euros , the company said in a statement . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : mayrhuber is confident that lufthansa has the tools to survive " this is a respectable result taking into consideration the considerable strains being felt as a result of the ongoing crisis in the financial markets and the overall economic situation , " chairman wolfgang mayrhuber said .
" in addition , we are working on our productivity , our measures to improve fuel consumption and the reduction of external costs . " in the first nine months of the year , operating profit fell by 9.3 percent to 984 million euros .
net profit during the same period plummeted by 65.1 percent to 551 million euros . the company 's results had been inflated in 2007 by lufthansa 's acquisition of the airline swiss and the sale of its stake in the british travel group thomas cook . swiss suffered heavy losses during the third quarter , with operating profit sinking by 76 percent to 112 million euros . lufthansa forecast only minor growth in passenger numbers due to market turmoil , expecting them to rise by just 0.8 percent in 2009 versus 5.2 percent this year . degrees of suffering the lufthansa figures follow on from seemingly endless bad news coming from europe 's airline industry . the denmark-based low-cost carrier sterling airways filed for bankruptcy on tuesday while air france-klm last week said it would struggle to meet its billion-euro earnings target and that it would trim its investment plans . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : alitalia is one european airline currently suffering the future of ailing italian carrier alitalia also remained uncertain .
the airline , which is 49.9 percent state-owned , is losing about three million euros a day and has debts totaling some 1.2 billion euros , which will have to be shouldered by the italian taxpayer .
however , it could be saved by british airways which earlier this month reiterated the company 's interest in a partnership with alitalia . non-european airlines were feeling the strain too , with carriers worldwide expected to lose around $ 5.2 billion this year owing to sharply higher oil prices and declining demand , the industry association iata said on october 17 , with losses expected to continue next year . dw staff -lrb- nda -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

a comprehensive recovery plan is also in the works , but there 's no guarantee the moves will stave off recession . the european commission said on wednesday , oct .
29 , it was extending 6.5 billion euros -lrb- $ 8.4 billion -rrb- in emergency credit to hungary . the eastern european country , which does not have the euro , has run into liquidity problems due to the devaluation of its currency amidst the global economic crisis .
the hungarian forint has lost almost 20 percent of its value in the past month against the euro and the dollar . " we all know that some other eu member states and some neighbors of the eu are under stress in their financial and exchange-rate markets , and we are ready to act , " said eu economic and monetary affairs commissioner joaquin almunia . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the borders with neighboring eu states are gone , but hungary has yet to get the euro the eu also raised the amount available to non-euro member states for emergency balance-of-payments aid from 12 billion euros to 25 billion euros . eu commission chief jose manuel barroso said the increase demonstrated the solidarity among the bloc 's members .

barroso said the eu executive would present a " comprehensive european union recovery plan " on nov .
26 . that plan is set to include increasing funds available to the european investment bank to make loans to small and medium-sized businesses . other idea that have been suggested are to make it easier for unemployed people to access eu funds to start businesses and to ensure that other european funds available for public investment are being used effectively . another key , barroso said , was innovation .

but the commission chief warned against country-first , bloc-second economic policies .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de immigration -pipe- 29.10.2008 illegal immigration spike expected in europe großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : experts warn that restricting work visas will increase illegal immigration europe is bracing for an increase in illegal immigration as the financial crisis continues .
as unemployment rises , some countries look to restrict visas , which could push more people to enter europe illegally . spain 's building boom drew africans to the southern european country by the hundreds of thousands in recent years .
many of these workers were the first to be laid off when spain 's real estate market cooled earlier this year .
spain , a country which welcomed 1 million immigrants in 2007 , now finds itself with 11.3 percent unemployment , the euro zone 's highest .
this has lead spain to slam the door on further immigration with laws aimed at cutting the number of work permits , restricting family reunion visas , and offering money to unemployed foreigners to go home .
spain is not alone in grappling with how to deal with migrant workers .
the international labor organization predicts that 20 million jobs will disappear worldwide by the end of next year .
countries across europe are considering more restrictive immigration measures .
europe warns against ejecting workers yet simply sending workers home wo n't help the situation , the united nations has warned .
it will simply decrease the number of legal immigrants and increase the number of illegal immigration .
to try and prevent that , the european union launched a 15 million euro -lrb- $ 18.70 million -rrb- initiative on tuesday , oct .
28 together with the un to try and protect migrant workers during the current economic crisis .
the program was launched on the sidelines of the global forum on migration and development in manila .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : many people migrate looking for job opportunities rich countries should not try to restrict migration from poor countries , even during the economic slowdown , peter sutherland , the un secretary general 's special representative on migration , warned .
" we 've seen how ineffective simple prohibition policies in regard to migration actually are , " he said .
" they do n't really work .
migrants migrate .
they will find a way , one way or another to do it . "
the number of migrants in the world is now estimated to be 40 million , 25 percent of whom are illegal , with the united states having the most migrants , according to sharan burrow , president of the international trade union confederation .
" our fear is that those numbers will increase , " burrow said at the opening of the four-day migration forum in manila .
britain looks to tighten immigration rising unemployment in the uk means that the country needs to consider restricting immigration , british immigration minister phil woolas recently told the times newspaper .
" if people are being made unemployed , the question of immigration becomes extremely thorny ... it 's been too easy to get into this country in the past and it 's going to get harder , " woolas said .
many european migrants from new eu member countries have come to britain in the past four years .
but there are some signs that many are heading home as the crisis hits , reuters recently reported .
the british government has considerred immigration reform which would have put into place an australian-style point system to let in highly-skilled workers but restrict access for unskilled migrants .
europe remains under pressure bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : many polish workers have headed west in search of work while officias say that they have not yet seen numbers of illegal immigrants spike globally , there are signs that european countries continue to be under pressure from illegal immigrants .
on monday , about 400 illegal immigrants were detained by italians as they tried to land on the italian island of lampedusa .
an additional 280 illegal immigrants had made landfall on the island over the weekend , according to the coast guard .
there has been a sharp increase in the number of people trying to enter italy by sea , according to figures from the interior ministry , which so far this year totals 23,600 .
afp news agency puts the number of immigrants who have tried to reach italy in october at 2,800 .
in greece , 10,000 would-be immigrants have been arrested trying to enter the country illegally during the first nine months of this year , compared to 9,240 last year , according to afp . dw staff -lrb- th -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

one proposal aims to support the struggling auto industry . addressing germany 's import-export federation bga in berlin on wednesday , oct .

" a quick flash in the pan can not truly help our economy . " she also stepped up pressure for next month 's g20 summit in washington to agree on a brief for negotiations on financial-market regulation .
those world negotiations ought not to take longer than a year , she said . to give direct help to small and medium-sized enterprises -lrb- smes -rrb- , the german economy ministry set up a hotline for smes having problems with financing because of the international crisis . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : business owners can call a finance ministry official during regular business hours " we do not want to leave smes to fend for themselves in this situation , and we will offer support where it is possible , " economy minister michael glos said in a statement . germany is to boost the ailing car industry by reducing its taxes on low-emission cars , merkel 's spokesman ulrich wilhelm said . the vehicle-tax changes to be adopted by merkel 's cabinet next week would be part of a program to boost the flagging economy . the disclosure follows days of debate in berlin about whether to increase government spending , cut taxes or both to ease the effects of an approaching slump . promoting cleaner cars wilhelm gave no details but said the package would be a " well-adjusted concept . " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the proposal would work to get heavily polluting cars off the road the proposal was " concretely " planned to alter the scale of vehicle tax , so tax rates were no longer keyed to a vehicle 's engine size but instead to the engine 's level of emissions , finance ministry spokesman torsten albig said . environmentalists have pressed for the change , saying it will encourage owners of polluting cars to scrap them and thus help reduce carbon dioxide emissions blamed for global warming . senior german officials have said berlin will also offer new soft loans and grants to improve building insulation , tax deductions for home-improvement work and changes in the amortization rule for taxes . eu on board eu industry commissioner guenter verheugen threw his weight wednesday behind a call to give the bloc 's carmakers cheap loans worth up to 40 billion euros to develop eco-friendly cars through the financial crisis . " we are in a situation where it is getting harder for big european businesses to get credit , " verheugen said .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de exchange rates -pipe- 29.10.2008 falling euro may signal deeper eu woes großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : a dollar will buy more euros these days euro zone members have watched their currency fall sharply against the dollar in recent days , as forex markets react to the complex global financial crisis .
but observers disagree on the possible effects of the decline . analysts took conflicting lessons from the euro 's fall to two-and-a-half-year lows , with some saying the fall is a short-term problem that could help boost exports , while others saw it as a sign of serious policy discord in the 15-nation euro zone .
in european trading on tuesday , oct .
28 , the euro touched a low of $ 1.23 - the last time it was so weak was in april , 2006 - before reaching $ 1.25 in asian trading .
the currency fell even farther against the yen ; in all it weakened against 14 of the 16 most active currencies .
analysts attributed the drop to a number of factors , including the widespread perception that europe 's economy is on the brink of a recession and the expectation that european central bank president jean-claude trichet may soon lower interest rates .
' a question of politics ' exchanges rates are n't just a question of economics , " it is a question of politics , " said ognian hishow , a german economist who is currently a visiting professor at the university of rochester .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the last time the euro fell so low was in april , 2006 " once the world starts to get suspicious of a given player - like the euro zone now - then they will look for an alternative for where to put their money , " he said .
" right now , the only good alternative is the us dollar . "
alexandra boehne , a finance expert for the german chamber of commerce , noted that the falling euro reflects the growing concern over the extent of the european financial crisis .
" no one knows how the financial-market crisis will develop , how long it will continue and how bad the economy will get , " she said .
financial players have known about the economic crisis in the us since last year , but the news that europe is heavily affected is new to the market .
' the markets are insecure ' " people have only been aware of a problem in europe since the autumn of 2008 , " she said .
" the markets are very insecure right now . "
some analysts say european banks ' heavy exposure to credit-soaked emerging markets , particularly in eastern europe , has left the currency vulnerable .
bloomberg news service cited a report on tuesday that showed european banks ' lending to emerging markets is around 21 percent of europe 's gross domestic product , compared with 4 percent for the us and 5 percent for japan .
meanwhile there are other indicators that recession may be around the corner - including a ground-shaking report on monday that german consumer confidence had plunged to five-year lows . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the financial crisis : a game of dominos in the end , " investors conclude that america is still the most reliable destination when it comes to where to put your money in such rainy days , " hishow said .
not all analysts agree about the extent of the euro problem .
the chamber of commerce 's boehme said it could actually give germany 's giant export economy a boost by making things " made in germany , " like automobiles and chemicals , cheaper .
pessimism on export growth according to hishow , however , this would be the case if it were n't for the fact that germany 's main export markets - the us and the rest of europe - are stagnating .
" where can german companies sell their goods ?
in america ?
in latin america ? "
hishow asks rhetorically .
" in the dollar area it is impossible because of the downsizing there , and china , while its currency is pegged to the dollar , is facing hard times too , so there 's not enough help there , " he said .
" i 'm not optimistic . "
meanwhile christian dreger , an economist at the german institute for economics research -lrb- diw -rrb- , argues that the drop in the euro is merely a temporary blip .
compared to the 80 us cents that the euro was trading for in 2002 , the european currency is still strong , he notes .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : ecb head trichet : plans to cut rates ?
he expects the euro 's " short term drop " to reverse itself .
he calls the bout of euro-selling an " adjustment " to issues of monetary policy , namely " pressure on the euro because of potential for further interest rate cuts . "
upside for the dollar ?
dreger says he disagrees with the investors who are betting that europe will recover more slowly than the us .
he thinks they are overreacting to possible weakness in central european economies , and believes the euro will appreciate because " it will benefit more from catching-up processes in emerging markets like china and india , where the eu is heavily invested . "
economist hishow disagrees .
over time , he says , there will be a correction in the american trade balance and the dollar will improve .
moreover , he said he strongly believes the financial crisis and the falling euro are signals of deep underlying problems in the euro zone .
european integration at fault " this crisis is a proof of how incomplete european integration is , " he said .
" when there are hard times , there is no unified response . "
as examples he cites the vociferous controversy between germany and france on how to respond to the economic crisis , and points out that if anything , the euro zone countries are drifting apart economically . " they tend to act in self-interest first and foremost , " he said .
he predicts the dollar 's dominance as a reserve currency will continue unless europe manages to find a way to boost the process of integration .
" i know many europeans do n't like this conclusion , but it is the reality , " hishow said .
" so we have to accept it . " jennifer abramsohn send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

28 that it will host a soft drugs summit in the third week of november in maastricht .
participants will seek ways to discourage tourists who visit the netherlands to take advantage of its liberal drug laws .
by extension , the summit also seeks to reduce drug-related crime .
the summit comes in the wake of last week 's decision by the south- western dutch towns of roosendaal and bergen op zoom to gradually close their local " coffee shops " in an attempt to reduce drug-related crimes .
all dutch cities and towns close to the german or belgian borders are invited to the summit .
after the summit , the vng will present the cities ' common position to the government .
the goal , according to vng , is to get the government to negotiate an international soft drugs policy with belgium and germany .
the netherlands effectively decriminalized soft drugs a few decades ago when it introduced a policy of " non-enforcement . "
although possession and cultivation of cannabis remains technically illegal in holland , law enforcement has systematically turned a blind eye , and the courts usually rule in favor of individual defendants .
the sale and use of so-called soft drugs , such as marijuana , is legal in designated stores , usually referred to as " coffee shops . "
maastricht suffering most from drug-related crime maastricht mayor gerd leers calls the current dutch drugs policy " hypocritical . "
he says it enables drug-related crime and also increases the sale and distribution of hard drugs , such as heroin .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : a police officer talks to a french drug tourist in maastricht maastricht is one of the dutch cities suffering most from drug- related crime .
the city is visited by more than 1.5 million drugs tourists per year and has 16 " coffee shops , " 10 more than in dutch cities of comparable size not located close to the border .
police estimate maastricht also has more than 100 " soft drugs supermarkets , " illegal stores where one can purchase soft drugs in larger quantities than the 5 grams per person allowed under dutch law .
leers says police officers in his city deal with triple the amount of crime as their colleagues in the metropolitan area of the hague .
most of the crime in maastricht is drug-related , and the number of drug-related murders each year is increasing , according to police officials .
german cross-border smokers favor enschede bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : drug tourism could go up in smoke the town of enschede has been particularly problematic for local authorities , because of its immediate proximity to the german border .
thousands of drug tourists , mainly from germany , pour across the border each year for a taste of legal marijuana .
the netherlands have considered many ways in the past to deter drug tourism , such as restricting the sale of soft drugs to dutch nationals by demanding coffee shops ask to see passports while political pressure has led to a decline in the number of coffee shops .
the last official figures showed that the netherlands had 740 coffee shops in 2004 compared to 1,180 in 1997 .
but it is unclear whether the reduction in the number of coffee shops has actually resulted in a decrease in drug consumption and drug tourism . dw staff -lrb- nda -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

as unemployment rises , some countries look to restrict visas , which could push more people to enter europe illegally . spain 's building boom drew africans to the southern european country by the hundreds of thousands in recent years .
many of these workers were the first to be laid off when spain 's real estate market cooled earlier this year .
spain , a country which welcomed 1 million immigrants in 2007 , now finds itself with 11.3 percent unemployment , the euro zone 's highest .
this has lead spain to slam the door on further immigration with laws aimed at cutting the number of work permits , restricting family reunion visas , and offering money to unemployed foreigners to go home .
spain is not alone in grappling with how to deal with migrant workers .
the international labor organization predicts that 20 million jobs will disappear worldwide by the end of next year .
countries across europe are considering more restrictive immigration measures .
europe warns against ejecting workers yet simply sending workers home wo n't help the situation , the united nations has warned .
it will simply decrease the number of legal immigrants and increase the number of illegal immigration .
to try and prevent that , the european union launched a 15 million euro -lrb- $ 18.70 million -rrb- initiative on tuesday , oct .
28 together with the un to try and protect migrant workers during the current economic crisis .
the program was launched on the sidelines of the global forum on migration and development in manila .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : many people migrate looking for job opportunities rich countries should not try to restrict migration from poor countries , even during the economic slowdown , peter sutherland , the un secretary general 's special representative on migration , warned .
" we 've seen how ineffective simple prohibition policies in regard to migration actually are , " he said .
" they do n't really work .
migrants migrate .
they will find a way , one way or another to do it . "
the number of migrants in the world is now estimated to be 40 million , 25 percent of whom are illegal , with the united states having the most migrants , according to sharan burrow , president of the international trade union confederation .
" our fear is that those numbers will increase , " burrow said at the opening of the four-day migration forum in manila .
britain looks to tighten immigration rising unemployment in the uk means that the country needs to consider restricting immigration , british immigration minister phil woolas recently told the times newspaper .
" if people are being made unemployed , the question of immigration becomes extremely thorny ... it 's been too easy to get into this country in the past and it 's going to get harder , " woolas said .
many european migrants from new eu member countries have come to britain in the past four years .
but there are some signs that many are heading home as the crisis hits , reuters recently reported .
the british government has considerred immigration reform which would have put into place an australian-style point system to let in highly-skilled workers but restrict access for unskilled migrants .
europe remains under pressure bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : many polish workers have headed west in search of work while officias say that they have not yet seen numbers of illegal immigrants spike globally , there are signs that european countries continue to be under pressure from illegal immigrants .
on monday , about 400 illegal immigrants were detained by italians as they tried to land on the italian island of lampedusa .
an additional 280 illegal immigrants had made landfall on the island over the weekend , according to the coast guard .
there has been a sharp increase in the number of people trying to enter italy by sea , according to figures from the interior ministry , which so far this year totals 23,600 .
afp news agency puts the number of immigrants who have tried to reach italy in october at 2,800 .
in greece , 10,000 would-be immigrants have been arrested trying to enter the country illegally during the first nine months of this year , compared to 9,240 last year , according to afp . dw staff -lrb- th -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

but observers disagree on the possible effects of the decline . analysts took conflicting lessons from the euro 's fall to two-and-a-half-year lows , with some saying the fall is a short-term problem that could help boost exports , while others saw it as a sign of serious policy discord in the 15-nation euro zone .
in european trading on tuesday , oct .
28 , the euro touched a low of $ 1.23 - the last time it was so weak was in april , 2006 - before reaching $ 1.25 in asian trading .
the currency fell even farther against the yen ; in all it weakened against 14 of the 16 most active currencies .
analysts attributed the drop to a number of factors , including the widespread perception that europe 's economy is on the brink of a recession and the expectation that european central bank president jean-claude trichet may soon lower interest rates .
' a question of politics ' exchanges rates are n't just a question of economics , " it is a question of politics , " said ognian hishow , a german economist who is currently a visiting professor at the university of rochester .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the last time the euro fell so low was in april , 2006 " once the world starts to get suspicious of a given player - like the euro zone now - then they will look for an alternative for where to put their money , " he said .
" right now , the only good alternative is the us dollar . "
alexandra boehne , a finance expert for the german chamber of commerce , noted that the falling euro reflects the growing concern over the extent of the european financial crisis .
" no one knows how the financial-market crisis will develop , how long it will continue and how bad the economy will get , " she said .
financial players have known about the economic crisis in the us since last year , but the news that europe is heavily affected is new to the market .
' the markets are insecure ' " people have only been aware of a problem in europe since the autumn of 2008 , " she said .
" the markets are very insecure right now . "
some analysts say european banks ' heavy exposure to credit-soaked emerging markets , particularly in eastern europe , has left the currency vulnerable .
bloomberg news service cited a report on tuesday that showed european banks ' lending to emerging markets is around 21 percent of europe 's gross domestic product , compared with 4 percent for the us and 5 percent for japan .
meanwhile there are other indicators that recession may be around the corner - including a ground-shaking report on monday that german consumer confidence had plunged to five-year lows . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the financial crisis : a game of dominos in the end , " investors conclude that america is still the most reliable destination when it comes to where to put your money in such rainy days , " hishow said .
not all analysts agree about the extent of the euro problem .
the chamber of commerce 's boehme said it could actually give germany 's giant export economy a boost by making things " made in germany , " like automobiles and chemicals , cheaper .
pessimism on export growth according to hishow , however , this would be the case if it were n't for the fact that germany 's main export markets - the us and the rest of europe - are stagnating .
" where can german companies sell their goods ?
in america ?
in latin america ? "
hishow asks rhetorically .
" in the dollar area it is impossible because of the downsizing there , and china , while its currency is pegged to the dollar , is facing hard times too , so there 's not enough help there , " he said .
" i 'm not optimistic . "
meanwhile christian dreger , an economist at the german institute for economics research -lrb- diw -rrb- , argues that the drop in the euro is merely a temporary blip .
compared to the 80 us cents that the euro was trading for in 2002 , the european currency is still strong , he notes .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : ecb head trichet : plans to cut rates ?
he expects the euro 's " short term drop " to reverse itself .
he calls the bout of euro-selling an " adjustment " to issues of monetary policy , namely " pressure on the euro because of potential for further interest rate cuts . "
upside for the dollar ?
dreger says he disagrees with the investors who are betting that europe will recover more slowly than the us .
he thinks they are overreacting to possible weakness in central european economies , and believes the euro will appreciate because " it will benefit more from catching-up processes in emerging markets like china and india , where the eu is heavily invested . "
economist hishow disagrees .
over time , he says , there will be a correction in the american trade balance and the dollar will improve .
moreover , he said he strongly believes the financial crisis and the falling euro are signals of deep underlying problems in the euro zone .
european integration at fault " this crisis is a proof of how incomplete european integration is , " he said .
" when there are hard times , there is no unified response . "
as examples he cites the vociferous controversy between germany and france on how to respond to the economic crisis , and points out that if anything , the euro zone countries are drifting apart economically . " they tend to act in self-interest first and foremost , " he said .
he predicts the dollar 's dominance as a reserve currency will continue unless europe manages to find a way to boost the process of integration .
" i know many europeans do n't like this conclusion , but it is the reality , " hishow said .
" so we have to accept it . " jennifer abramsohn send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

28 that it will host a soft drugs summit in the third week of november in maastricht .
participants will seek ways to discourage tourists who visit the netherlands to take advantage of its liberal drug laws .
by extension , the summit also seeks to reduce drug-related crime .
the summit comes in the wake of last week 's decision by the south- western dutch towns of roosendaal and bergen op zoom to gradually close their local " coffee shops " in an attempt to reduce drug-related crimes .
all dutch cities and towns close to the german or belgian borders are invited to the summit .
after the summit , the vng will present the cities ' common position to the government .
the goal , according to vng , is to get the government to negotiate an international soft drugs policy with belgium and germany .
the netherlands effectively decriminalized soft drugs a few decades ago when it introduced a policy of " non-enforcement . "
although possession and cultivation of cannabis remains technically illegal in holland , law enforcement has systematically turned a blind eye , and the courts usually rule in favor of individual defendants .
the sale and use of so-called soft drugs , such as marijuana , is legal in designated stores , usually referred to as " coffee shops . "

the city is visited by more than 1.5 million drugs tourists per year and has 16 " coffee shops , " 10 more than in dutch cities of comparable size not located close to the border .
police estimate maastricht also has more than 100 " soft drugs supermarkets , " illegal stores where one can purchase soft drugs in larger quantities than the 5 grams per person allowed under dutch law .
leers says police officers in his city deal with triple the amount of crime as their colleagues in the metropolitan area of the hague .
most of the crime in maastricht is drug-related , and the number of drug-related murders each year is increasing , according to police officials .

the netherlands have considered many ways in the past to deter drug tourism , such as restricting the sale of soft drugs to dutch nationals by demanding coffee shops ask to see passports while political pressure has led to a decline in the number of coffee shops .
the last official figures showed that the netherlands had 740 coffee shops in 2004 compared to 1,180 in 1997 .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de music -pipe- 29.10.2008 bayreuth festival orchestra takes wagner to the gulf großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the orchestra played to a packed house the bayreuth festival orchestra played outside of europe for the first time in two decades at the weekend , kicking off a series of concerts in the gulf states called the abu dhabi classics . as the orchestra started up at the seven-star emirates palace hotel , the ceiling seemed to bend under the weight of gold stucco and the spectators sank into plush seats .
looking more like something out of thousand and one nights than ring of the nibelung , the venue was hardly evocative of the hard seats filled by worshipful wagnerians at the german composer 's opera house in the bavarian town of bayreuth .
when the final tones of twilight of the gods faded on saturday evening - part of a wagner gala by the bayreuth festival orchestra under conductor christian thielemann - the minor sensation was complete : the emirate had inaugurated the abu dhabi classics , a first in the gulf states .
but what would richard wagner have thought ?
top acts the concert marked another step in abu dhabi 's mission to become a cultural capital .
a total of 22 concerts are scheduled until the season 's end in may 2009 .
among the guest artists will be top-flight stars dear to classical music fans : lang lang and cecilia bartoli , zubin mehta and lorin maazel , the vienna philharmonic and the philharmonic orchestra of london , the cellist misha maisky and pianist arcadi volodos , bobby mcferrin and till broenner .
the abu dhabi classics will run until 2012 at least , and its concerts will be integrated into the educational programm of schools in abu dhabi , the largest emirate of the united arab emirates -lrb- uae -rrb- .
new markets bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : katharina wagner on hand for the premiere was katharina wagner , who was recently named co-director of the annual bayreuth festival and is seeking new markets for bayreuth and her great-grandfather 's music .
she announced that the bayreuth festival orchestra would , in future , be performing away from home once a year .
" we intend to revive this tradition , " wagner said , adding that entire productions , such as the ring of the nibelung , might be exported .
she did not rule out directing a production herself in abu dhabi at some time .
building bridges abu dhabi 's new music event aims to " build bridges , " say culture officials in the emirate .
the fabulously rich oil producer sees the creation of a music scene modeled after those in the west as a way to secure its place in the globalised world .
following years of construction , " the new generation of rulers wants to take a further step , " remarked zaki nusseibeh , deputy chairman of the abu dhabi authority for culture and heritage -lrb- adach -rrb- .
the uae 's longtime ruler , sheik zayed bin sultan al nahyan , died four years ago and was succeeded by a son .
with 10 percent of the world 's oil reserves , abu dhabi looks as though it will enjoy oil income for some time to come .
it has a population of about 800,000 and is somewhat smaller than the german state of bavaria .
cultural diversity bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : abu dhabi is set to host a branch of the louvre museum abu dhabi already boasts a literature prize and film festival , and is currently having 100 books by western authors translated into arabic .
" we spend a lot of money on culture , " noted abdulla salim al amri , director of arts and culture at the adch .
he declined to specify a figure , saying that " any amount you name is ok . "
every day , abu dhabi produces oil valued at some 240 million euros .
off its coast , on saadiyat island , abu dhabi is developing a cultural district that will likely have no equal worldwide .
covering an area of 27 square kilometers and expected to be completed in 2018 , it will include four museums , a performing arts center , housing for 150,000 people , a golf course , and a marina .
one of the museums , an outpost of the paris-based louvre , is a shell flooded with light designed by french architect jean nouvel .
frank gehry , architect of the celebrated guggenheim museum bilbao , has designed an eighth branch of the new york-based museum for saadiyat island .
the performing arts center , a gigantic leaf-like structure of glass and concrete designed by zaha hadid , will contain an opera house , concert hall , and music hall for up to 6,300 spectators .
norman foster is contributing a national museum , and japan 's tadeo ando has designed a museum dedicated to the uae 's maritime past .
so it was probably only a matter of time until abu dhabi latched on to wagner , tchaikovsky and co .
the german connection bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the concert was held in the luxury emirates palace germany 's till janczukowicz , executive artistic director of the abu dhabi classics , presented the emirate with a plan and managed within a few months to sign top artists who are booked for years in advance .
curiosity , and not only money , attracted them to the gulf , he said .
abu dhabi had seen european orchestras before , most recently the dresden state orchestra of saxony .
the new york philharmonic will perform in the emirate next year .
the arab world has a special affinity for the romanticist wagner , nusseibeh noted .
in his opera " parsifal , " for instance , the german composer distilled his longing for the orient , he said .
arabs ' fondness for wagner has nothing to do with his " ideology , " nusseibeh added , referring to wagner 's strident anti-semitism .
" the arab world is n't part of this debate , " he said .
foreigners made up the bulk of the some 1,000 people who came to saturday evening 's premiere at the emirates palace hotel .
about 100 students also attended , prompting nusseibeh to remark that everyone could understand wagner 's music . dpa news agency -lrb- jp -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de music -pipe- 29.10.2008 bayreuth festival orchestra takes wagner to the gulf großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the orchestra played to a packed house the bayreuth festival orchestra played outside of europe for the first time in two decades at the weekend , kicking off a series of concerts in the gulf states called the abu dhabi classics . as the orchestra started up at the seven-star emirates palace hotel , the ceiling seemed to bend under the weight of gold stucco and the spectators sank into plush seats .
looking more like something out of thousand and one nights than ring of the nibelung , the venue was hardly evocative of the hard seats filled by worshipful wagnerians at the german composer 's opera house in the bavarian town of bayreuth .
when the final tones of twilight of the gods faded on saturday evening - part of a wagner gala by the bayreuth festival orchestra under conductor christian thielemann - the minor sensation was complete : the emirate had inaugurated the abu dhabi classics , a first in the gulf states .
but what would richard wagner have thought ?
top acts the concert marked another step in abu dhabi 's mission to become a cultural capital .
a total of 22 concerts are scheduled until the season 's end in may 2009 .
among the guest artists will be top-flight stars dear to classical music fans : lang lang and cecilia bartoli , zubin mehta and lorin maazel , the vienna philharmonic and the philharmonic orchestra of london , the cellist misha maisky and pianist arcadi volodos , bobby mcferrin and till broenner .
the abu dhabi classics will run until 2012 at least , and its concerts will be integrated into the educational programm of schools in abu dhabi , the largest emirate of the united arab emirates -lrb- uae -rrb- .
new markets bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : katharina wagner on hand for the premiere was katharina wagner , who was recently named co-director of the annual bayreuth festival and is seeking new markets for bayreuth and her great-grandfather 's music .
she announced that the bayreuth festival orchestra would , in future , be performing away from home once a year .
" we intend to revive this tradition , " wagner said , adding that entire productions , such as the ring of the nibelung , might be exported .
she did not rule out directing a production herself in abu dhabi at some time .
building bridges abu dhabi 's new music event aims to " build bridges , " say culture officials in the emirate .
the fabulously rich oil producer sees the creation of a music scene modeled after those in the west as a way to secure its place in the globalised world .
following years of construction , " the new generation of rulers wants to take a further step , " remarked zaki nusseibeh , deputy chairman of the abu dhabi authority for culture and heritage -lrb- adach -rrb- .
the uae 's longtime ruler , sheik zayed bin sultan al nahyan , died four years ago and was succeeded by a son .
with 10 percent of the world 's oil reserves , abu dhabi looks as though it will enjoy oil income for some time to come .
it has a population of about 800,000 and is somewhat smaller than the german state of bavaria .
cultural diversity bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : abu dhabi is set to host a branch of the louvre museum abu dhabi already boasts a literature prize and film festival , and is currently having 100 books by western authors translated into arabic .
" we spend a lot of money on culture , " noted abdulla salim al amri , director of arts and culture at the adch .
he declined to specify a figure , saying that " any amount you name is ok . "
every day , abu dhabi produces oil valued at some 240 million euros .
off its coast , on saadiyat island , abu dhabi is developing a cultural district that will likely have no equal worldwide .
covering an area of 27 square kilometers and expected to be completed in 2018 , it will include four museums , a performing arts center , housing for 150,000 people , a golf course , and a marina .
one of the museums , an outpost of the paris-based louvre , is a shell flooded with light designed by french architect jean nouvel .
frank gehry , architect of the celebrated guggenheim museum bilbao , has designed an eighth branch of the new york-based museum for saadiyat island .
the performing arts center , a gigantic leaf-like structure of glass and concrete designed by zaha hadid , will contain an opera house , concert hall , and music hall for up to 6,300 spectators .
norman foster is contributing a national museum , and japan 's tadeo ando has designed a museum dedicated to the uae 's maritime past .
so it was probably only a matter of time until abu dhabi latched on to wagner , tchaikovsky and co .
the german connection bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the concert was held in the luxury emirates palace germany 's till janczukowicz , executive artistic director of the abu dhabi classics , presented the emirate with a plan and managed within a few months to sign top artists who are booked for years in advance .
curiosity , and not only money , attracted them to the gulf , he said .
abu dhabi had seen european orchestras before , most recently the dresden state orchestra of saxony .
the new york philharmonic will perform in the emirate next year .
the arab world has a special affinity for the romanticist wagner , nusseibeh noted .
in his opera " parsifal , " for instance , the german composer distilled his longing for the orient , he said .
arabs ' fondness for wagner has nothing to do with his " ideology , " nusseibeh added , referring to wagner 's strident anti-semitism .
" the arab world is n't part of this debate , " he said .
foreigners made up the bulk of the some 1,000 people who came to saturday evening 's premiere at the emirates palace hotel .
about 100 students also attended , prompting nusseibeh to remark that everyone could understand wagner 's music . dpa news agency -lrb- jp -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

it may also become the owner of austrian airlines . lufthansa already holds minority stakes in both eurowings and bmi , which was formerly named british midland .
high fuel prices earlier this year and a looming recession have put heavy pressure on smaller , weaker airlines in recent weeks , speeding up consolidation in the aviation industry . in frankfurt , lufthansa said on wednesday , oct .
29 , that it had received an offer from another eurowings shareholder , ak industriebeteiligung , for 50.9 percent of the airline and this would be acquired by the end of the year . earlier plans to merge eurowings , which mainly flies routes within europe , with an airline run by german travel company tui failed . control of bmi is to be acquired from businessman michael bishop , lufthansa said .
the british airline 's landing and takeoff slots at heathrow airport , the principal london airport , add to its value to lufthansa . in a third possible merger , lufthansa was also the only company to put in a binding bid for austrian airlines earlier this week . financial crisis bites into lufthansa profits the pair of lufthansa takeovers comes on the heels of a profit warning issued by the company tuesday . lufthansa said that it expects operational earnings this year to total just 1.1 billion euros -lrb- $ 1.4 billion -rrb- , down from its past forecast of 1.4 billion euros and blamed the drop on high fuel costs and weakened sales due to the global financial crisis . the airline posted 149 million euros in net profit between july and september , while operating profit in the third quarter plunged by 53.4 percent to 279 million euros , the company said in a statement . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : mayrhuber is confident that lufthansa has the tools to survive " this is a respectable result taking into consideration the considerable strains being felt as a result of the ongoing crisis in the financial markets and the overall economic situation , " chairman wolfgang mayrhuber said .
" in addition , we are working on our productivity , our measures to improve fuel consumption and the reduction of external costs . " in the first nine months of the year , operating profit fell by 9.3 percent to 984 million euros .
net profit during the same period plummeted by 65.1 percent to 551 million euros . the company 's results had been inflated in 2007 by lufthansa 's acquisition of the airline swiss and the sale of its stake in the british travel group thomas cook . swiss suffered heavy losses during the third quarter , with operating profit sinking by 76 percent to 112 million euros . lufthansa forecast only minor growth in passenger numbers due to market turmoil , expecting them to rise by just 0.8 percent in 2009 versus 5.2 percent this year . degrees of suffering the lufthansa figures follow on from seemingly endless bad news coming from europe 's airline industry . the denmark-based low-cost carrier sterling airways filed for bankruptcy on tuesday while air france-klm last week said it would struggle to meet its billion-euro earnings target and that it would trim its investment plans . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : alitalia is one european airline currently suffering the future of ailing italian carrier alitalia also remained uncertain .
the airline , which is 49.9 percent state-owned , is losing about three million euros a day and has debts totaling some 1.2 billion euros , which will have to be shouldered by the italian taxpayer .

looking more like something out of thousand and one nights than ring of the nibelung , the venue was hardly evocative of the hard seats filled by worshipful wagnerians at the german composer 's opera house in the bavarian town of bayreuth .
when the final tones of twilight of the gods faded on saturday evening - part of a wagner gala by the bayreuth festival orchestra under conductor christian thielemann - the minor sensation was complete : the emirate had inaugurated the abu dhabi classics , a first in the gulf states .
but what would richard wagner have thought ?
top acts the concert marked another step in abu dhabi 's mission to become a cultural capital .
a total of 22 concerts are scheduled until the season 's end in may 2009 .
among the guest artists will be top-flight stars dear to classical music fans : lang lang and cecilia bartoli , zubin mehta and lorin maazel , the vienna philharmonic and the philharmonic orchestra of london , the cellist misha maisky and pianist arcadi volodos , bobby mcferrin and till broenner .
the abu dhabi classics will run until 2012 at least , and its concerts will be integrated into the educational programm of schools in abu dhabi , the largest emirate of the united arab emirates -lrb- uae -rrb- .
new markets bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : katharina wagner on hand for the premiere was katharina wagner , who was recently named co-director of the annual bayreuth festival and is seeking new markets for bayreuth and her great-grandfather 's music .
she announced that the bayreuth festival orchestra would , in future , be performing away from home once a year .
" we intend to revive this tradition , " wagner said , adding that entire productions , such as the ring of the nibelung , might be exported .
she did not rule out directing a production herself in abu dhabi at some time .
building bridges abu dhabi 's new music event aims to " build bridges , " say culture officials in the emirate .
the fabulously rich oil producer sees the creation of a music scene modeled after those in the west as a way to secure its place in the globalised world .
following years of construction , " the new generation of rulers wants to take a further step , " remarked zaki nusseibeh , deputy chairman of the abu dhabi authority for culture and heritage -lrb- adach -rrb- .
the uae 's longtime ruler , sheik zayed bin sultan al nahyan , died four years ago and was succeeded by a son .
with 10 percent of the world 's oil reserves , abu dhabi looks as though it will enjoy oil income for some time to come .
it has a population of about 800,000 and is somewhat smaller than the german state of bavaria .
cultural diversity bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : abu dhabi is set to host a branch of the louvre museum abu dhabi already boasts a literature prize and film festival , and is currently having 100 books by western authors translated into arabic .
" we spend a lot of money on culture , " noted abdulla salim al amri , director of arts and culture at the adch .
he declined to specify a figure , saying that " any amount you name is ok . "
every day , abu dhabi produces oil valued at some 240 million euros .
off its coast , on saadiyat island , abu dhabi is developing a cultural district that will likely have no equal worldwide .
covering an area of 27 square kilometers and expected to be completed in 2018 , it will include four museums , a performing arts center , housing for 150,000 people , a golf course , and a marina .
one of the museums , an outpost of the paris-based louvre , is a shell flooded with light designed by french architect jean nouvel .
frank gehry , architect of the celebrated guggenheim museum bilbao , has designed an eighth branch of the new york-based museum for saadiyat island .
the performing arts center , a gigantic leaf-like structure of glass and concrete designed by zaha hadid , will contain an opera house , concert hall , and music hall for up to 6,300 spectators .
norman foster is contributing a national museum , and japan 's tadeo ando has designed a museum dedicated to the uae 's maritime past .
so it was probably only a matter of time until abu dhabi latched on to wagner , tchaikovsky and co .
the german connection bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the concert was held in the luxury emirates palace germany 's till janczukowicz , executive artistic director of the abu dhabi classics , presented the emirate with a plan and managed within a few months to sign top artists who are booked for years in advance .
curiosity , and not only money , attracted them to the gulf , he said .
abu dhabi had seen european orchestras before , most recently the dresden state orchestra of saxony .
the new york philharmonic will perform in the emirate next year .
the arab world has a special affinity for the romanticist wagner , nusseibeh noted .
in his opera " parsifal , " for instance , the german composer distilled his longing for the orient , he said .
arabs ' fondness for wagner has nothing to do with his " ideology , " nusseibeh added , referring to wagner 's strident anti-semitism .
" the arab world is n't part of this debate , " he said .
foreigners made up the bulk of the some 1,000 people who came to saturday evening 's premiere at the emirates palace hotel .
about 100 students also attended , prompting nusseibeh to remark that everyone could understand wagner 's music . dpa news agency -lrb- jp -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

but observers disagree on the possible effects of the decline . analysts took conflicting lessons from the euro 's fall to two-and-a-half-year lows , with some saying the fall is a short-term problem that could help boost exports , while others saw it as a sign of serious policy discord in the 15-nation euro zone .
in european trading on tuesday , oct .
28 , the euro touched a low of $ 1.23 - the last time it was so weak was in april , 2006 - before reaching $ 1.25 in asian trading .
the currency fell even farther against the yen ; in all it weakened against 14 of the 16 most active currencies .
analysts attributed the drop to a number of factors , including the widespread perception that europe 's economy is on the brink of a recession and the expectation that european central bank president jean-claude trichet may soon lower interest rates .
' a question of politics ' exchanges rates are n't just a question of economics , " it is a question of politics , " said ognian hishow , a german economist who is currently a visiting professor at the university of rochester .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the last time the euro fell so low was in april , 2006 " once the world starts to get suspicious of a given player - like the euro zone now - then they will look for an alternative for where to put their money , " he said .
" right now , the only good alternative is the us dollar . "
alexandra boehne , a finance expert for the german chamber of commerce , noted that the falling euro reflects the growing concern over the extent of the european financial crisis .
" no one knows how the financial-market crisis will develop , how long it will continue and how bad the economy will get , " she said .
financial players have known about the economic crisis in the us since last year , but the news that europe is heavily affected is new to the market .
' the markets are insecure ' " people have only been aware of a problem in europe since the autumn of 2008 , " she said .
" the markets are very insecure right now . "
some analysts say european banks ' heavy exposure to credit-soaked emerging markets , particularly in eastern europe , has left the currency vulnerable .
bloomberg news service cited a report on tuesday that showed european banks ' lending to emerging markets is around 21 percent of europe 's gross domestic product , compared with 4 percent for the us and 5 percent for japan .
meanwhile there are other indicators that recession may be around the corner - including a ground-shaking report on monday that german consumer confidence had plunged to five-year lows . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the financial crisis : a game of dominos in the end , " investors conclude that america is still the most reliable destination when it comes to where to put your money in such rainy days , " hishow said .
not all analysts agree about the extent of the euro problem .
the chamber of commerce 's boehme said it could actually give germany 's giant export economy a boost by making things " made in germany , " like automobiles and chemicals , cheaper .
pessimism on export growth according to hishow , however , this would be the case if it were n't for the fact that germany 's main export markets - the us and the rest of europe - are stagnating .
" where can german companies sell their goods ?
in america ?
in latin america ? "
hishow asks rhetorically .
" in the dollar area it is impossible because of the downsizing there , and china , while its currency is pegged to the dollar , is facing hard times too , so there 's not enough help there , " he said .
" i 'm not optimistic . "
meanwhile christian dreger , an economist at the german institute for economics research -lrb- diw -rrb- , argues that the drop in the euro is merely a temporary blip .
compared to the 80 us cents that the euro was trading for in 2002 , the european currency is still strong , he notes .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : ecb head trichet : plans to cut rates ?
he expects the euro 's " short term drop " to reverse itself .
he calls the bout of euro-selling an " adjustment " to issues of monetary policy , namely " pressure on the euro because of potential for further interest rate cuts . "
upside for the dollar ?
dreger says he disagrees with the investors who are betting that europe will recover more slowly than the us .
he thinks they are overreacting to possible weakness in central european economies , and believes the euro will appreciate because " it will benefit more from catching-up processes in emerging markets like china and india , where the eu is heavily invested . "
economist hishow disagrees .
over time , he says , there will be a correction in the american trade balance and the dollar will improve .
moreover , he said he strongly believes the financial crisis and the falling euro are signals of deep underlying problems in the euro zone .
european integration at fault " this crisis is a proof of how incomplete european integration is , " he said .
" when there are hard times , there is no unified response . "
as examples he cites the vociferous controversy between germany and france on how to respond to the economic crisis , and points out that if anything , the euro zone countries are drifting apart economically . " they tend to act in self-interest first and foremost , " he said .
he predicts the dollar 's dominance as a reserve currency will continue unless europe manages to find a way to boost the process of integration .
" i know many europeans do n't like this conclusion , but it is the reality , " hishow said .
" so we have to accept it . " jennifer abramsohn send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

mr gayoom , asia 's longest-serving leader , congratulated mr nasheed after final results were confirmed .
mr nasheed said his victory , in the nation 's first democratic presidential poll , showed the people of the maldives were embracing the future .
president gayoom won the first round this month , but failed to secure the 50 % needed for outright victory .
with all the votes counted in the second round , mr nasheed , a former political prisoner , won 54 % to mr gayoom 's 46 % .
' close race ' " i congratulate anni -lsb- mr nasheed 's popular name -rsb- , " mr gayoom said in a radio address .
" i thank the people of the maldives for allowing me to serve them for 30 years .
profile : mohamed nasheed ' thirty years of repression ' ends he promised to ensure a smooth transition from his rule during a rare show of unity held later on wednesday with mr nasheed .
" i want this transition to be a smooth one .
i will do everything to work with him -lrb- nasheed -rrb- , " mr gayoom said , calling on his followers to co-operate with the new regime .
the two men jointly addressed the nation from the presidential office just hours after the results from the election were announced and agreed to work together for the good of the people .
" i wish to assure the public and the international community that the transition to democracy in the maldives will be smooth and uninterrupted in governance , " mr nasheed said as he shook hands with his former rival .
" a test of our democracy will be how we treat maumoon . "
the outgoing environment minister said the elections had been a " very close race " .
abdullah mausoom said the country 's first " multiparty elections have been held freely and fairly " .
the election was the culmination of reforms in the indian ocean islands that followed pro-democracy street protests and international pressure .
mr gayoom , 71 , has ruled the maldives uncontested since 1978 , elected back into office six times by referendums .
the bbc 's roland buerk in the capital , male , said mr gayoom 's supporters had credited him with overseeing an economic expansion fuelled by tourism .
but mr gayoom 's critics say he was a dictator who ruled like a sultan of old , says our correspondent .

president gayoom won the first round this month , but failed to secure the 50 % needed for outright victory .
with all the votes counted in the second round , mr nasheed , a former political prisoner , won 54 % to mr gayoom 's 46 % .

james spears was granted control of his daughter 's assets in february after she was admitted to a psychiatric ward .
the arrangement was due to expire on 31 december , but los angeles superior court commissioner reza goetz has now agreed to make it permanent .
ms spears had the situation explained to her and chose not to oppose it , a court-appointed lawyer said .
the 26-year-old could petition later to have the conservatorship removed , but the court 's order otherwise constitutes a lifetime arrangement , a court information officer said .
lawyers for james spears declined to comment after the hearing .
' susceptible ' the move may come as a surprise to the pop star 's fans , as she has recently seemed to be on the mend - appearing lucid and in control at an mtv awards show and showcasing a new slimline look in the video for her latest single , womanizer .
but ms goetz said she had granted permanent conservatorship based on recent medical evaluations and lawyers ' recommendations , which showed the singer was " susceptible to undue influence . "
she added that the ruling was " necessary and appropriate " given the complexity of ms spears ' financial situation .
one advantage of the ruling , as far as the pop star is concerned , is that it shields her from some legal action .
at her recent trial for driving without a valid licence , james spears testified on his daughter 's behalf , and refused to allow her to take the witness stand .
an outstanding trial , in which a former manager is suing the pop star for unpaid earnings , has also been delayed as ms spears has been deemed unfit to give sworn testimony .

she added that the ruling was " necessary and appropriate " given the complexity of ms spears ' financial situation .
one advantage of the ruling , as far as the pop star is concerned , is that it shields her from some legal action .

many did not understand the risks of storing personal data , said information commissioner richard thomas .
they had to realise that it could be a " toxic liability " as well as an asset to an organisation , he added .
mr thomas is currently investigating 30 " serious " breaches of data protection law by the government and other bodies .
but he said a lot of data losses went unreported and some organisations were not even aware that it had gone missing .
tighter policies " it 's often said that personal data is an asset for an organisation , we are saying it can be a toxic liability .
there are many risks associated with holding information , " he told bbc radio 4 's today programme .
" there has been too much sloppiness , too much lack of awareness , of the risks of holding information and we are saying , really this is a matter for the top board , the chief executive of an organisation .
holding huge collections of personal data brings significant risks richard thomas information commissioner " it 's no good saying the it boys are looking after this , it 's no good saying the lawyers are sorting out the policies , it 's no good saying human resources are doing the training - it 's right across the organisation .
" computing power is so strong these days that many bosses do n't simply understand what are the risks they are facing . "
he said organisations should tighten up their policies , encrypt laptops , improve supervision and buy software that prevented large amounts of data can not be downloaded " all at one time " .
" things will inevitably go wrong , therefore you should plan for things going wrong , " he told today .
giant databases he said progress was being made but added : " we are still long way from saying we have got a tighter grip on the management of personal data . "
in a speech to the royal society of arts in london , mr thomas urged companies and other organisations to hold the least amount of data possible and warn they should face tougher penalties when any is mishandled .
he also warned that creating giant databases of personal information would carry " significant risks " for the uk .
the government has recently defended a proposal to create a huge database recording all internet and telephone traffic .
opposition parties have criticised the plan which could see details of every phone call , e-mail and text message sent in the uk recorded and kept for two years .
' lose trust ' " the more databases that are set up and the more information exchanged from one place to another , the greater the risk of things going wrong , " he said .
" the more you centralise data collection , the greater the risk of multiple records going missing or wrong decisions about real people being made .
" the more you lose the trust and confidence of customers and the public , the more your prosperity and standing will suffer .
" put simply , holding huge collections of personal data brings significant risks . "
the speech comes as new figures show that reports of data loss are increasing .
about 100 incidents were reported to the commissioner 's office in the six months from november last year .
the total for the year to date is 277 .
the nhs is one of the worst offenders , reporting 65 incidents in total , including 27 computers lost or stolen .
however , the real figures are likely to be much higher , because there is currently no legal obligation to report data losses .
there have been a string of high-profile data losses in recent months .
earlier this month , a computer hard drive containing the personal details of about 100,000 members of the armed forces was reported missing during an audit carried out by it contractor eds .
and last year , hm revenue and customs lost a disc containing the names , addressees , dates of birth and bank account details of up to 25 million people claiming child benefit .

" there has been too much sloppiness , too much lack of awareness , of the risks of holding information and we are saying , really this is a matter for the top board , the chief executive of an organisation .
holding huge collections of personal data brings significant risks richard thomas information commissioner " it 's no good saying the it boys are looking after this , it 's no good saying the lawyers are sorting out the policies , it 's no good saying human resources are doing the training - it 's right across the organisation .
" computing power is so strong these days that many bosses do n't simply understand what are the risks they are facing . "
he said organisations should tighten up their policies , encrypt laptops , improve supervision and buy software that prevented large amounts of data can not be downloaded " all at one time " .
" things will inevitably go wrong , therefore you should plan for things going wrong , " he told today .
giant databases he said progress was being made but added : " we are still long way from saying we have got a tighter grip on the management of personal data . "
in a speech to the royal society of arts in london , mr thomas urged companies and other organisations to hold the least amount of data possible and warn they should face tougher penalties when any is mishandled .
he also warned that creating giant databases of personal information would carry " significant risks " for the uk .
the government has recently defended a proposal to create a huge database recording all internet and telephone traffic .
opposition parties have criticised the plan which could see details of every phone call , e-mail and text message sent in the uk recorded and kept for two years .
' lose trust ' " the more databases that are set up and the more information exchanged from one place to another , the greater the risk of things going wrong , " he said .
" the more you centralise data collection , the greater the risk of multiple records going missing or wrong decisions about real people being made .
" the more you lose the trust and confidence of customers and the public , the more your prosperity and standing will suffer .
" put simply , holding huge collections of personal data brings significant risks . "
the speech comes as new figures show that reports of data loss are increasing .
about 100 incidents were reported to the commissioner 's office in the six months from november last year .
the total for the year to date is 277 .
the nhs is one of the worst offenders , reporting 65 incidents in total , including 27 computers lost or stolen .
however , the real figures are likely to be much higher , because there is currently no legal obligation to report data losses .
there have been a string of high-profile data losses in recent months .
earlier this month , a computer hard drive containing the personal details of about 100,000 members of the armed forces was reported missing during an audit carried out by it contractor eds .
and last year , hm revenue and customs lost a disc containing the names , addressees , dates of birth and bank account details of up to 25 million people claiming child benefit .

petrofac chief executive ayman asfari said a potential drop in investment as a result of the collapse in oil prices could lead to serious accidents .
mr asfari said his company had seen installations which were in bad need of repair and fears firms will fail to spend enough on improvements .
industry body oil and gas uk said it disagreed with mr asfari 's comments .
petrofac owns or operates a number of north sea fields .
already warned speaking at the oil and money conference in london , mr asfari said he was concerned that the industry would end up in a situation where budgets were curtailed , leading to more risk of accidents .
he added that the safety regulator had already told the industry it needed to do more on installation integrity .
an oil and gas uk spokesman said that in this year alone the industry was spending more than £ 1.5bn on asset integrity .
however , jake molloy , from the offshore arm of the rmt union , said he was " delighted " to see a chief executive confirm what he had already warned about .
he told bbc scotland : " i just wish we could get a few more chief executives to line up behind this gentleman . "
