the announcement was hardly a surprise considering bayern 's recent struggles . " i informed the club about my decision to leave this summer three weeks ago , " hitzfeld told the german sports news agency sid on wednesday , jan .
2 .
" but i 'll still be trying to win as many titles as possible in the next half-year . " earlier bayern commercial manager uli hoeneß had offered a typically gruff remark to the daily bild newspaper . " you 'd be safe to assume that -lsb- hitzfeld -rsb- will not be staying , " hoeneß said .
" but he will be here until june . " the 58-year-old hitzfeld is a legend in his own time , the only coach ever to have won the champions league with two different clubs .
but his tactics have come in for criticism from some bayern potentates - most prominently chairman karl-heinz rummenigge - and his current spell in munich has n't lived up to expectations . disappointing returns bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : hitzfeld won the champions league with both dortmund and bayern hitzfeld was brought in last season to replace felix magath - the man who succeeded him at the end of his previous bayern tenure in 2004 .
but hitzfeld was unable to get munich back into the top three last year , and his won-lost record was much the same as his predecessor 's . that was supposed to change this season , after bayern went on a club-record spending spree to bring in stars like miroslav klose , franck ribery and luca toni .
bayern currently top the table but are level on points with bremen , a club with nowhere near munich 's financial resources . and bayern 's fortunes in the league are slipping .
the team scored only a single goal in their last three bundesliga matches in december - hardly a satisfactory return on summer investments topping 70 million euros -lrb- $ 100 million -rrb- . a team of two halves bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : hoeneß was one of hitzfeld 's few remaining allies in munich the squad is rumored to be split into a german faction around klose and a foreign one around ribery and toni , neither of whom seem particularly keen on learning the language of the country where they 're employed . and hitzfeld has failed to get very much out of young stars like bastian schweinsteiger and lukas podolski .
meanwhile veterans like valerian ismael and willy sagnol have left the club or said publicly that they 'd like to . there 's no clear indication of who might succeed hitzfeld , but dutch national coach marco van basten is rumored to have been put up for discussion . meanwhile , hitzfeld could take over as the national coach of his second-home , switzerland , or become a television commentator . dw staff -lrb- jc -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?
dw-world.de world class stars aiding bundesliga 's rehabilitation when bayern munich bought some of the world 's most wanted players , it looked like game over .
but those who rushed to crown bayern before a ball was even kicked forgot that the league already had its own superstars .

essen will be one in 2010 : a european capital of culture .
this year , the english city of liverpool shares the title with the norwegian town of stavanger . " love me do " could be the anthem of this british town known most famously as home to the fab four .
visitors to the city on the mersey river are confronted with beatlemania as soon as they arrive at the airport , which is named after john lennon . indeed , for many years , most visitors were drawn to liverpool due to the beatles ' fame .
" people all over the world have heard of this place , " tour guide phil hughes told dpa news agency . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the fab four remain the most famous musicians in the world the musical history alone could be reason enough to deem liverpool a " european capital of culture " in 2008 .
after all , other british music greats - the rolling stones , the kinks and the who among them - got their start in the cavern club in mathew street .
even american music stars such as chuck berry and bo diddley once played there . beatles ' fame not enough " the beatles legacy certainly helped the city , but that alone was n't all we wanted to show the world , " said paul newman , spokesman for the liverpool culture company .
the company has been the hub for the transformation of the seaport in northwestern england that was not long ago an example of urban decay . decades ago , liverpool was rutted in unemployment and a sense of hopelessness far longer than other industrial regions . the shipyards had been shut down , followed by massive redundancies in the region 's manufacturing sector . in the 1980s , british prime minister margaret thatcher introduced sweeping reforms throughout the country , but liverpool missed the boat . bildunterschrift : liverpool 's wealth now stems from culture rather than shipping pragmatism and economic expertise ultimately helped liverpool citizens to pull themselves up by the boot straps .
but culture also played a big part in the transformation of the city , with cultural institutions receiving massive financial support . " it brought us out of the crisis , " newman told dpa . " investing in art and culture was the right thing to do , especially during a very difficult period . " capitalizing on culture now , liverpool is second only to london in its vast array of cultural events , including an annual modern art fair , galleries with free admission , theater and concerts at the philharmonic hall . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the tate liverpool gallery at albert dock liverpool is also europe 's biggest building site .
cranes will dot the skyline throughout the year of culture in 2008 and longer , as the regeneration of entire districts is planned for well into 2010 . meanwhile , tourists can enjoy the sight of the " liver bird " - a cross between a cormorant , a griffin and an eagle that is the city 's mascot .
in addition to resting atop the liver building , the bird can also be seen on the jerseys of the city 's world-renowned soccer team . slavery history exposed a lively spot for tourists is the historic harbor area called albert dock .
the dock has undergone extensive renovation after years of neglect , with the waterfront district hosting everything from the " tate liverpool " - home of the national collection of modern art in the north of england and the largest gallery of modern and contemporary art outside london - to shops , cafes and the international slavery museum . the museum addresses liverpool 's history as the prime shipment point for " human cargo " between africa and america - a trade that contributed to the city 's former enormous wealth . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : a beatles ' creation : st. pepper 's lonely hearts club band though the slave trade was banned in britain in 1807 , a debate broke out about the issue last year .
penny lane , located in the harbor district and which a beatles song helped make one of the city 's most famous , was named after ship-owner james penny . mr. penny 's ships transported enslaved africans to britain 's colonies in america hundreds of years ago . last year , a local councilman proposed renaming the street , but many citizens protested , including liverpool 's black community , who spoke out against what they called the " silliness " of the matter . back on the map whether it 's exploring liverpool 's history as a " gateway to the world , " its rich architectural legacy or the haunts of rock ' n ' roll stars , visitors will find plenty to do in the city . and , if they 're still not satisfied , they can attend any of the more than 300 cultural events planned for 2008 , some led by such stellar liverpudlian sons as former beatles paul mccartney and ringo starr , as well as conductor sir simon rattle , who will take his berlin philharmonic to his hometown to perform . dw staff -lrb- als -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

essen will be one in 2010 : a european capital of culture .
this year , the english city of liverpool shares the title with the norwegian town of stavanger . " love me do " could be the anthem of this british town known most famously as home to the fab four .
visitors to the city on the mersey river are confronted with beatlemania as soon as they arrive at the airport , which is named after john lennon . indeed , for many years , most visitors were drawn to liverpool due to the beatles ' fame .
" people all over the world have heard of this place , " tour guide phil hughes told dpa news agency . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the fab four remain the most famous musicians in the world the musical history alone could be reason enough to deem liverpool a " european capital of culture " in 2008 .
after all , other british music greats - the rolling stones , the kinks and the who among them - got their start in the cavern club in mathew street .
even american music stars such as chuck berry and bo diddley once played there . beatles ' fame not enough " the beatles legacy certainly helped the city , but that alone was n't all we wanted to show the world , " said paul newman , spokesman for the liverpool culture company .
the company has been the hub for the transformation of the seaport in northwestern england that was not long ago an example of urban decay . decades ago , liverpool was rutted in unemployment and a sense of hopelessness far longer than other industrial regions . the shipyards had been shut down , followed by massive redundancies in the region 's manufacturing sector . in the 1980s , british prime minister margaret thatcher introduced sweeping reforms throughout the country , but liverpool missed the boat . bildunterschrift : liverpool 's wealth now stems from culture rather than shipping pragmatism and economic expertise ultimately helped liverpool citizens to pull themselves up by the boot straps .
but culture also played a big part in the transformation of the city , with cultural institutions receiving massive financial support . " it brought us out of the crisis , " newman told dpa . " investing in art and culture was the right thing to do , especially during a very difficult period . " capitalizing on culture now , liverpool is second only to london in its vast array of cultural events , including an annual modern art fair , galleries with free admission , theater and concerts at the philharmonic hall . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the tate liverpool gallery at albert dock liverpool is also europe 's biggest building site .
cranes will dot the skyline throughout the year of culture in 2008 and longer , as the regeneration of entire districts is planned for well into 2010 . meanwhile , tourists can enjoy the sight of the " liver bird " - a cross between a cormorant , a griffin and an eagle that is the city 's mascot .
in addition to resting atop the liver building , the bird can also be seen on the jerseys of the city 's world-renowned soccer team . slavery history exposed a lively spot for tourists is the historic harbor area called albert dock .
the dock has undergone extensive renovation after years of neglect , with the waterfront district hosting everything from the " tate liverpool " - home of the national collection of modern art in the north of england and the largest gallery of modern and contemporary art outside london - to shops , cafes and the international slavery museum . the museum addresses liverpool 's history as the prime shipment point for " human cargo " between africa and america - a trade that contributed to the city 's former enormous wealth . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : a beatles ' creation : st. pepper 's lonely hearts club band though the slave trade was banned in britain in 1807 , a debate broke out about the issue last year .
penny lane , located in the harbor district and which a beatles song helped make one of the city 's most famous , was named after ship-owner james penny . mr. penny 's ships transported enslaved africans to britain 's colonies in america hundreds of years ago . last year , a local councilman proposed renaming the street , but many citizens protested , including liverpool 's black community , who spoke out against what they called the " silliness " of the matter . back on the map whether it 's exploring liverpool 's history as a " gateway to the world , " its rich architectural legacy or the haunts of rock ' n ' roll stars , visitors will find plenty to do in the city . and , if they 're still not satisfied , they can attend any of the more than 300 cultural events planned for 2008 , some led by such stellar liverpudlian sons as former beatles paul mccartney and ringo starr , as well as conductor sir simon rattle , who will take his berlin philharmonic to his hometown to perform . dw staff -lrb- als -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

" kibaki must know that his government is illegitimate .

the presidential election in kenya - one of africa 's richest and most stable countries - has set the nation aflame .
hundreds of people have been killed in the clashes between president kibaki 's supporters and those of opposition candidate raila odinga .
all of the independent sources and reports , including those of a european union observer mission led by germany 's alexander graf lambsdorff , say very clearly : state powers pulled the necessary votes out of a hat to prevent a victory for odinga .
kenya has never really been home to a democracy . " germany 's süddeutsche zeitung commented on how the international community is dealing with the situation .
" as many rulers there have learned , in africa it does n't matter how election results come about ; the primary thing is that they are recognized internationally … that the united states has now - due to the violent protests in kenya - back-pedaled and , along with great britain , is demanding an independent investigation into the vote-counting may be embarrassing for president george w. bush 's administration , but it is not yet threatening to kibaki . " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : eu election observer head graf lambsdorff noted " extreme discrepencies " in vote-counting " but , what is perfectly clear is that the situation is so explosive that the country is now faced with its most crucial test since its independence .
every western country that seriously believes in democracy for africa is required to do everything it can to help deescalate the situation .
part of that is creating powerful scare tactics both for kibaki as well as for odinga .
any country , however , which recognizes the results of this election is contributing to the escalation , " the paper said . the german daily tageszeitung -lrb- taz -rrb- examined the context behind the violence in kenya .
" when kenyans voted for mwai kibaki five years ago , he promised to put an end to corruption and the state 's arbitrary ways and was celebrated like a pop star as a result .
nowadays , he ca n't even venture out on the street without fearing for his life … so , one ca n't really hold it against the kenyans that they feel betrayed … they wanted to vote him out of office , but were not allowed to do so .
frustration can particularly be felt among young unemployed people , whose last shimmer of hope has been stripped away .
while one may not agree with their actions , they 're understandable in such a context . " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : violence also broke out in nairobi 's slums vienna 's der standard commented that kibaki , through presumed vote-rigging , wanted to prevent a switch of power to the younger generation .
" kibaki , who during his first election presented himself as a champion of democracy , has dispelled his own powers of enchantment .
and he has shown more loyalty to his friends in the so-called ' mount kenya mafia ' than to his citizens .
kibaki , also a former finance minister and vice president , has been in politics for ages .
now he is trying to prevent the dissolution of his generation , which has anchored itself in the administration and economy since independence in 1963 and unscrupulously enriched itself .

internationally , the country takes second place - behind china . germany 's flourishing economy , the largest in europe , got a further boost in the new year with the publishing of a survey giving the country glowing marks for its competitiveness . in a study commissioned by german business daily handelsblatt , 59 percent of the 1,200 leading executives in europe polled rated germany 's competitiveness as " very good " or " good . " on a scale of one to five , they gave germany an average rate of 2.3 points , with one being the best possible score . in 2003 , only 13 percent of top executives surveyed in a similar poll in europe , shared such an optimistic outlook for germany .
since then , germany 's image has risen in the eyes of europe 's executive by 1 percent each year . on an international scale , only china is considered more competitive by european managers .
germany shared second place with switzerland . more foreign investors " the german economy has continually become more competitive in the past years thanks in particular to companies , but also thanks to parties negotiating collective wage agreements and politics , " said bert rürup , chairman of the " council of wise men " - five highly regarded academics who advise the government on economic policy . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : germany 's booming exports have helped it to profit from a global upswing german companies have consistently restructured and together with the unions negotiated moderate and flexible wage agreements , rürup told newspaper , handelsblatt . the daily reported that a further sign for economic revival lay in the fact that for the first time foreign investors own a majority share in germany 's top 30 publicly traded companies .
their share climbed from 20 percent in 2005 to 53 percent in 2007 , the paper said , adding it reflected a vote of confidence in the ability of german companies to profit from a global upswing thanks to their booming exports . " that shows - in the eyes of foreign investors - how competitive german companies have become , but also that there 's mistrust towards the dollar , " rürup said . good news for the labor market the good news from the survey was further bolstered by predictions that a decline in germany 's jobless total last year would continue in the new year despite recent signs of weakening economic growth . " employment will further rise in 2008 , " germany 's federal labor office said on wednesday , jan 2 , a day before official labor market figures were released for the month of december , 2007 . less than two years after spiking to 5 million , germany 's number of jobless fell in november to 3.278 million people .

in an interview with the mass-market bild newspaper , he added that he anticipated economic expansion to come in at just under 2 percent . germany emerged from a protracted period of stagnation in 2006 to report a growth rate of 2.9 percent with the economy expected to post an expansion rate last year of about 2.6 percent .
in november , a government report had predicted a drop in germany 's economic growth , slipping from a forecasted 2.6 percent in 2007 to 1.9 percent in 2008 . in an interview with berliner zeitung , dihk president ludwig georg braun said he was confident that 300,000 jobs could be created in 2008 despite the slight slowdown in gross domestic product growth .

german carmaker audi announced on wednesday that it intended to hire 800 additional engineers in 2008 . braun said that the optimism was due more to strong worldwide economic growth rather than to political decisions made in germany .

essen will be one in 2010 : a european capital of culture .
this year , the english city of liverpool shares the title with the norwegian town of stavanger . " love me do " could be the anthem of this british town known most famously as home to the fab four .
visitors to the city on the mersey river are confronted with beatlemania as soon as they arrive at the airport , which is named after john lennon . indeed , for many years , most visitors were drawn to liverpool due to the beatles ' fame .
" people all over the world have heard of this place , " tour guide phil hughes told dpa news agency . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the fab four remain the most famous musicians in the world the musical history alone could be reason enough to deem liverpool a " european capital of culture " in 2008 .
after all , other british music greats - the rolling stones , the kinks and the who among them - got their start in the cavern club in mathew street .
even american music stars such as chuck berry and bo diddley once played there . beatles ' fame not enough " the beatles legacy certainly helped the city , but that alone was n't all we wanted to show the world , " said paul newman , spokesman for the liverpool culture company .
the company has been the hub for the transformation of the seaport in northwestern england that was not long ago an example of urban decay . decades ago , liverpool was rutted in unemployment and a sense of hopelessness far longer than other industrial regions . the shipyards had been shut down , followed by massive redundancies in the region 's manufacturing sector . in the 1980s , british prime minister margaret thatcher introduced sweeping reforms throughout the country , but liverpool missed the boat . bildunterschrift : liverpool 's wealth now stems from culture rather than shipping pragmatism and economic expertise ultimately helped liverpool citizens to pull themselves up by the boot straps .
but culture also played a big part in the transformation of the city , with cultural institutions receiving massive financial support . " it brought us out of the crisis , " newman told dpa . " investing in art and culture was the right thing to do , especially during a very difficult period . " capitalizing on culture now , liverpool is second only to london in its vast array of cultural events , including an annual modern art fair , galleries with free admission , theater and concerts at the philharmonic hall . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the tate liverpool gallery at albert dock liverpool is also europe 's biggest building site .
cranes will dot the skyline throughout the year of culture in 2008 and longer , as the regeneration of entire districts is planned for well into 2010 . meanwhile , tourists can enjoy the sight of the " liver bird " - a cross between a cormorant , a griffin and an eagle that is the city 's mascot .
in addition to resting atop the liver building , the bird can also be seen on the jerseys of the city 's world-renowned soccer team . slavery history exposed a lively spot for tourists is the historic harbor area called albert dock .
the dock has undergone extensive renovation after years of neglect , with the waterfront district hosting everything from the " tate liverpool " - home of the national collection of modern art in the north of england and the largest gallery of modern and contemporary art outside london - to shops , cafes and the international slavery museum . the museum addresses liverpool 's history as the prime shipment point for " human cargo " between africa and america - a trade that contributed to the city 's former enormous wealth . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : a beatles ' creation : st. pepper 's lonely hearts club band though the slave trade was banned in britain in 1807 , a debate broke out about the issue last year .
penny lane , located in the harbor district and which a beatles song helped make one of the city 's most famous , was named after ship-owner james penny . mr. penny 's ships transported enslaved africans to britain 's colonies in america hundreds of years ago . last year , a local councilman proposed renaming the street , but many citizens protested , including liverpool 's black community , who spoke out against what they called the " silliness " of the matter . back on the map whether it 's exploring liverpool 's history as a " gateway to the world , " its rich architectural legacy or the haunts of rock ' n ' roll stars , visitors will find plenty to do in the city . and , if they 're still not satisfied , they can attend any of the more than 300 cultural events planned for 2008 , some led by such stellar liverpudlian sons as former beatles paul mccartney and ringo starr , as well as conductor sir simon rattle , who will take his berlin philharmonic to his hometown to perform . dw staff -lrb- als -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

the announcement was hardly a surprise considering bayern 's recent struggles . " i informed the club about my decision to leave this summer three weeks ago , " hitzfeld told the german sports news agency sid on wednesday , jan .
2 .
" but i 'll still be trying to win as many titles as possible in the next half-year . " earlier bayern commercial manager uli hoeneß had offered a typically gruff remark to the daily bild newspaper . " you 'd be safe to assume that -lsb- hitzfeld -rsb- will not be staying , " hoeneß said .
" but he will be here until june . " the 58-year-old hitzfeld is a legend in his own time , the only coach ever to have won the champions league with two different clubs .
but his tactics have come in for criticism from some bayern potentates - most prominently chairman karl-heinz rummenigge - and his current spell in munich has n't lived up to expectations . disappointing returns bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : hitzfeld won the champions league with both dortmund and bayern hitzfeld was brought in last season to replace felix magath - the man who succeeded him at the end of his previous bayern tenure in 2004 .
but hitzfeld was unable to get munich back into the top three last year , and his won-lost record was much the same as his predecessor 's . that was supposed to change this season , after bayern went on a club-record spending spree to bring in stars like miroslav klose , franck ribery and luca toni .
bayern currently top the table but are level on points with bremen , a club with nowhere near munich 's financial resources . and bayern 's fortunes in the league are slipping .
the team scored only a single goal in their last three bundesliga matches in december - hardly a satisfactory return on summer investments topping 70 million euros -lrb- $ 100 million -rrb- . a team of two halves bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : hoeneß was one of hitzfeld 's few remaining allies in munich the squad is rumored to be split into a german faction around klose and a foreign one around ribery and toni , neither of whom seem particularly keen on learning the language of the country where they 're employed . and hitzfeld has failed to get very much out of young stars like bastian schweinsteiger and lukas podolski .
meanwhile veterans like valerian ismael and willy sagnol have left the club or said publicly that they 'd like to . there 's no clear indication of who might succeed hitzfeld , but dutch national coach marco van basten is rumored to have been put up for discussion . meanwhile , hitzfeld could take over as the national coach of his second-home , switzerland , or become a television commentator . dw staff -lrb- jc -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

" but i 'll still be trying to win as many titles as possible in the next half-year . " earlier bayern commercial manager uli hoeneß had offered a typically gruff remark to the daily bild newspaper . " you 'd be safe to assume that -lsb- hitzfeld -rsb- will not be staying , " hoeneß said .
" but he will be here until june . " the 58-year-old hitzfeld is a legend in his own time , the only coach ever to have won the champions league with two different clubs .
but his tactics have come in for criticism from some bayern potentates - most prominently chairman karl-heinz rummenigge - and his current spell in munich has n't lived up to expectations . disappointing returns bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : hitzfeld won the champions league with both dortmund and bayern hitzfeld was brought in last season to replace felix magath - the man who succeeded him at the end of his previous bayern tenure in 2004 .
but hitzfeld was unable to get munich back into the top three last year , and his won-lost record was much the same as his predecessor 's . that was supposed to change this season , after bayern went on a club-record spending spree to bring in stars like miroslav klose , franck ribery and luca toni .
bayern currently top the table but are level on points with bremen , a club with nowhere near munich 's financial resources . and bayern 's fortunes in the league are slipping .
the team scored only a single goal in their last three bundesliga matches in december - hardly a satisfactory return on summer investments topping 70 million euros -lrb- $ 100 million -rrb- . a team of two halves bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : hoeneß was one of hitzfeld 's few remaining allies in munich the squad is rumored to be split into a german faction around klose and a foreign one around ribery and toni , neither of whom seem particularly keen on learning the language of the country where they 're employed . and hitzfeld has failed to get very much out of young stars like bastian schweinsteiger and lukas podolski .
meanwhile veterans like valerian ismael and willy sagnol have left the club or said publicly that they 'd like to . there 's no clear indication of who might succeed hitzfeld , but dutch national coach marco van basten is rumored to have been put up for discussion . meanwhile , hitzfeld could take over as the national coach of his second-home , switzerland , or become a television commentator . dw staff -lrb- jc -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?
dw-world.de world class stars aiding bundesliga 's rehabilitation when bayern munich bought some of the world 's most wanted players , it looked like game over .
but those who rushed to crown bayern before a ball was even kicked forgot that the league already had its own superstars .
-lrb- 24.12.2007 -rrb- lucio : a kaka or ronaldinho would n't come to munich defender lucimar ferreira da silva - lucio , for short - is captain of the brazilian national team and the anchor of bayern munich 's back four .
and that , he told dw-world , is all he wants from his german club .

by 2020 , seven of the world ’ s ten most populated cities will be located in asia alone .
in an effort to provide an adequate infrastructure for asia ’ s mega cities , german companies play a major role . in 2004 , hyderabad , the capital of the indian state of andhra pradesh , had 3.5 million inhabitants , not including the outskirts .
and the city continues to grow , explains german transport planner christopher walther : “ gigantic suburbs are emerging - massive economic zones which develop into towns .
over the last two years , we 've been able to see that the city has grown unbelievably fast .

essen will be one in 2010 : a european capital of culture .
this year , the english city of liverpool shares the title with the norwegian town of stavanger . " love me do " could be the anthem of this british town known most famously as home to the fab four .
visitors to the city on the mersey river are confronted with beatlemania as soon as they arrive at the airport , which is named after john lennon . indeed , for many years , most visitors were drawn to liverpool due to the beatles ' fame .
" people all over the world have heard of this place , " tour guide phil hughes told dpa news agency . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the fab four remain the most famous musicians in the world the musical history alone could be reason enough to deem liverpool a " european capital of culture " in 2008 .
after all , other british music greats - the rolling stones , the kinks and the who among them - got their start in the cavern club in mathew street .
even american music stars such as chuck berry and bo diddley once played there . beatles ' fame not enough " the beatles legacy certainly helped the city , but that alone was n't all we wanted to show the world , " said paul newman , spokesman for the liverpool culture company .
the company has been the hub for the transformation of the seaport in northwestern england that was not long ago an example of urban decay . decades ago , liverpool was rutted in unemployment and a sense of hopelessness far longer than other industrial regions . the shipyards had been shut down , followed by massive redundancies in the region 's manufacturing sector . in the 1980s , british prime minister margaret thatcher introduced sweeping reforms throughout the country , but liverpool missed the boat . bildunterschrift : liverpool 's wealth now stems from culture rather than shipping pragmatism and economic expertise ultimately helped liverpool citizens to pull themselves up by the boot straps .
but culture also played a big part in the transformation of the city , with cultural institutions receiving massive financial support . " it brought us out of the crisis , " newman told dpa . " investing in art and culture was the right thing to do , especially during a very difficult period . " capitalizing on culture now , liverpool is second only to london in its vast array of cultural events , including an annual modern art fair , galleries with free admission , theater and concerts at the philharmonic hall . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the tate liverpool gallery at albert dock liverpool is also europe 's biggest building site .
cranes will dot the skyline throughout the year of culture in 2008 and longer , as the regeneration of entire districts is planned for well into 2010 . meanwhile , tourists can enjoy the sight of the " liver bird " - a cross between a cormorant , a griffin and an eagle that is the city 's mascot .
in addition to resting atop the liver building , the bird can also be seen on the jerseys of the city 's world-renowned soccer team . slavery history exposed a lively spot for tourists is the historic harbor area called albert dock .
the dock has undergone extensive renovation after years of neglect , with the waterfront district hosting everything from the " tate liverpool " - home of the national collection of modern art in the north of england and the largest gallery of modern and contemporary art outside london - to shops , cafes and the international slavery museum . the museum addresses liverpool 's history as the prime shipment point for " human cargo " between africa and america - a trade that contributed to the city 's former enormous wealth . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : a beatles ' creation : st. pepper 's lonely hearts club band though the slave trade was banned in britain in 1807 , a debate broke out about the issue last year .
penny lane , located in the harbor district and which a beatles song helped make one of the city 's most famous , was named after ship-owner james penny . mr. penny 's ships transported enslaved africans to britain 's colonies in america hundreds of years ago . last year , a local councilman proposed renaming the street , but many citizens protested , including liverpool 's black community , who spoke out against what they called the " silliness " of the matter . back on the map whether it 's exploring liverpool 's history as a " gateway to the world , " its rich architectural legacy or the haunts of rock ' n ' roll stars , visitors will find plenty to do in the city . and , if they 're still not satisfied , they can attend any of the more than 300 cultural events planned for 2008 , some led by such stellar liverpudlian sons as former beatles paul mccartney and ringo starr , as well as conductor sir simon rattle , who will take his berlin philharmonic to his hometown to perform . dw staff -lrb- als -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de economy -pipe- 02.01.2008 top european executives praise german economy großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : germany 's economic upswing , boosted by falling jobless numbers , is expected to continue a survey of top managers and executives from six eu nations has found that germany tops the list of most competitive economies in europe .
internationally , the country takes second place - behind china . germany 's flourishing economy , the largest in europe , got a further boost in the new year with the publishing of a survey giving the country glowing marks for its competitiveness . in a study commissioned by german business daily handelsblatt , 59 percent of the 1,200 leading executives in europe polled rated germany 's competitiveness as " very good " or " good . " on a scale of one to five , they gave germany an average rate of 2.3 points , with one being the best possible score . in 2003 , only 13 percent of top executives surveyed in a similar poll in europe , shared such an optimistic outlook for germany .
since then , germany 's image has risen in the eyes of europe 's executive by 1 percent each year . on an international scale , only china is considered more competitive by european managers .
germany shared second place with switzerland . more foreign investors " the german economy has continually become more competitive in the past years thanks in particular to companies , but also thanks to parties negotiating collective wage agreements and politics , " said bert rürup , chairman of the " council of wise men " - five highly regarded academics who advise the government on economic policy . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : germany 's booming exports have helped it to profit from a global upswing german companies have consistently restructured and together with the unions negotiated moderate and flexible wage agreements , rürup told newspaper , handelsblatt . the daily reported that a further sign for economic revival lay in the fact that for the first time foreign investors own a majority share in germany 's top 30 publicly traded companies .
their share climbed from 20 percent in 2005 to 53 percent in 2007 , the paper said , adding it reflected a vote of confidence in the ability of german companies to profit from a global upswing thanks to their booming exports . " that shows - in the eyes of foreign investors - how competitive german companies have become , but also that there 's mistrust towards the dollar , " rürup said . good news for the labor market the good news from the survey was further bolstered by predictions that a decline in germany 's jobless total last year would continue in the new year despite recent signs of weakening economic growth . " employment will further rise in 2008 , " germany 's federal labor office said on wednesday , jan 2 , a day before official labor market figures were released for the month of december , 2007 . less than two years after spiking to 5 million , germany 's number of jobless fell in november to 3.278 million people .
it 's the lowest level in 15 years , according to figures released by the federal labor office earlier in december . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : economics minister glos is less optimistic than some financial institutes germany 's chambers of industry and commerce -lsb- dikh -rsb- also said german economic growth will slow only slightly in 2008 and will still expand by more than 2 percent . but german economics minister michael glos said wednesday that he anticipated growth to continue at a slower pace .

but european and us politicians say a un probe is n't necessary . french foreign minister bernhard kouchner said on wednesday , jan .
2 , that he was speaking formally on behalf of the 27-member bloc when he offered pakistan help in combating extremism and probing the killing of opposition leader benazir bhutto . kouchner was the first high-ranking foreign official to visit pakistan since the killing of bhutto , in a gun and bomb attack after a campaign rally last week . kouchner rules out un probe " today we proposed to president musharraf to provide french or european experts , " kouchner said after meeting the pakistani leader in rawalpindi , the garrison city where bhutto , 54 , was slain . " mr. musharraf responded that the idea was interesting . " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : bhutto in a photo taken in october 2007 koucher , however , stressed that he saw little prospect of a united nations investigation into bhutto 's killing .
officials in washington also said a un investigation into bhutto 's death was unnecessary . bhutto 's pakistan people 's party -lrb- ppp -rrb- had called for a probe similar to that into the death in 2005 of former lebanese premier rafiq hariri , where an international court in the hague will try suspects . " if you are talking about a group of international experts , why not , we will be happy to contribute , " kouchner told reporters in islamabad .
" if , though , you 're asking for an international investigation in the un sense of the term , there are conditions which , unfortunately , are not so easy to fulfill . " kouchner said a un investigation commission presupposes the involvement of a third party or country . " in the case of hariri , the presumption was that another country was implicated , whereas here , we ca n't say that with any clarity , " the french minister said .
" as a consequence , unless un rules were suddenly rewritten , it would appear to me to be difficult . " musharraf asks for british help pakistani government officials have so far rejected calls for an international investigation into bhutto 's killing .
but on wednesday , pervez musharraf said he had asked british police for help in the investigation into the assassination . " i am grateful to prime minister brown that ... he accepted my request , " musharraf said in a televised address to the nation , referring to british prime minister gordon brown . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : musharraf said scotland yard will help in the probe " this team will come immediately and will assist our team in the investigation , " musharraf added .
" i hope these investigations would be done properly with scotland yard and remove all doubts . " though musharraf 's administration has said that local groups linked to al qaeda were behind the assassination , bhutto 's party accuses the government of covering up events surrounding her death . eu eager to fight extremism kouchner also handed over a letter from french president nicolas sarkozy which he said expressed his country 's solidarity with pakistan in the wake of the " horrible crime . " he said the letter also underlined sarkozy 's " support for what must be democratic efforts in the continuation of the election process as well as the fight against terrorism and extremism . " koucher said his visit came specifically at the request of slovenia , which took over the rotating eu presidency on jan .
1 . " bhutto was assassinated by an extremism that we , france and the european union , have decided to fight , " he said .
" it would not be surprising if it was islamist terrorism since i know that it makes its bed in the tribal zone of pakistan . " election delayed pakistan 's election commission on wednesday postponed the general elections by six weeks , to feb .
18 , saying polling was not possible on the original date of jan .
8 because of disturbances following bhutto 's murder . the decision has been criticized by opposition parties .
they say the delay will benefit beleaguered musharraf and his ruling party , the pakistan muslim league-q . they also say a delay could provoke more unrest and violence . dw staff -lrb- sp -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

so , police arrested the rollicky collie near the central city of kassel . but rather than be angry , kassel cops were amused by the dog 's antics .
police said the collie jumped aboard the passenger rail-car at a stop in hümme , a tiny town near kassel , in the state of hesse . nabbing the collie bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : then again , some collies look clever enough to make a dash for the train the train driver , luckily , was adept at multi-tasking and managed to grab the canine beast and tie it up to his seat .
police in kassel later placed the dog in the city pound . the dog also committed a second big no-no in the german handbook of responsible living : not registering his identity to city officials . " it not only did n't have a ticket , " police told dpa .
" it did n't have an ownership tag either . " the kassel cops were still impressed by the scoundrel , though .

internationally , the country takes second place - behind china . germany 's flourishing economy , the largest in europe , got a further boost in the new year with the publishing of a survey giving the country glowing marks for its competitiveness . in a study commissioned by german business daily handelsblatt , 59 percent of the 1,200 leading executives in europe polled rated germany 's competitiveness as " very good " or " good . " on a scale of one to five , they gave germany an average rate of 2.3 points , with one being the best possible score . in 2003 , only 13 percent of top executives surveyed in a similar poll in europe , shared such an optimistic outlook for germany .
since then , germany 's image has risen in the eyes of europe 's executive by 1 percent each year . on an international scale , only china is considered more competitive by european managers .
germany shared second place with switzerland . more foreign investors " the german economy has continually become more competitive in the past years thanks in particular to companies , but also thanks to parties negotiating collective wage agreements and politics , " said bert rürup , chairman of the " council of wise men " - five highly regarded academics who advise the government on economic policy . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : germany 's booming exports have helped it to profit from a global upswing german companies have consistently restructured and together with the unions negotiated moderate and flexible wage agreements , rürup told newspaper , handelsblatt . the daily reported that a further sign for economic revival lay in the fact that for the first time foreign investors own a majority share in germany 's top 30 publicly traded companies .
their share climbed from 20 percent in 2005 to 53 percent in 2007 , the paper said , adding it reflected a vote of confidence in the ability of german companies to profit from a global upswing thanks to their booming exports . " that shows - in the eyes of foreign investors - how competitive german companies have become , but also that there 's mistrust towards the dollar , " rürup said . good news for the labor market the good news from the survey was further bolstered by predictions that a decline in germany 's jobless total last year would continue in the new year despite recent signs of weakening economic growth . " employment will further rise in 2008 , " germany 's federal labor office said on wednesday , jan 2 , a day before official labor market figures were released for the month of december , 2007 . less than two years after spiking to 5 million , germany 's number of jobless fell in november to 3.278 million people .
it 's the lowest level in 15 years , according to figures released by the federal labor office earlier in december . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : economics minister glos is less optimistic than some financial institutes germany 's chambers of industry and commerce -lsb- dikh -rsb- also said german economic growth will slow only slightly in 2008 and will still expand by more than 2 percent . but german economics minister michael glos said wednesday that he anticipated growth to continue at a slower pace .
in an interview with the mass-market bild newspaper , he added that he anticipated economic expansion to come in at just under 2 percent . germany emerged from a protracted period of stagnation in 2006 to report a growth rate of 2.9 percent with the economy expected to post an expansion rate last year of about 2.6 percent .
in november , a government report had predicted a drop in germany 's economic growth , slipping from a forecasted 2.6 percent in 2007 to 1.9 percent in 2008 . in an interview with berliner zeitung , dihk president ludwig georg braun said he was confident that 300,000 jobs could be created in 2008 despite the slight slowdown in gross domestic product growth . " the economy will slow only slightly in 2008 but the companies ' expectations remain good , " he said . shortage of highly skilled workers bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the dip in germany 's jobless rate is expected to continue in 2008 despite the flood of positive predictions , experts warn that germany 's labor market will not be able to maintain its current good form throughout 2008 .
german carmaker audi announced on wednesday that it intended to hire 800 additional engineers in 2008 . braun said that the optimism was due more to strong worldwide economic growth rather than to political decisions made in germany .
he added he was concerned about a worsening in the shortage of highly skilled workers . " that 's where political and industry leaders need to work together to change that , " he said .

some called for sanctions ; others noted the feeling of betrayal among the people . britain 's financial times took a hard stance toward the announced victory of kenya 's president mwai kibaki .
" kibaki must know that his government is illegitimate .
if he refuses to accept that , then western powers should halt aid programs and instead , use the money for emergency aid and provide it as well to the african union for it to use for a firm intervention .
visas should be denied not only to corrupt civil servants , but also to kibaki and his entire government team .
if odinga and his circle are caught stoking violence , then the same sanctions must also be applied to them .
whatever occurs , the outside world must prepare for the worst and , at the same time , fervently pray that both sides will come to their senses . " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : locals in front of a church where 46 people were trapped and killed tuesday spain 's el pais wrote : " seldom is something so obtuse and so lucid at the same time .
the presidential election in kenya - one of africa 's richest and most stable countries - has set the nation aflame .
hundreds of people have been killed in the clashes between president kibaki 's supporters and those of opposition candidate raila odinga .
all of the independent sources and reports , including those of a european union observer mission led by germany 's alexander graf lambsdorff , say very clearly : state powers pulled the necessary votes out of a hat to prevent a victory for odinga .
kenya has never really been home to a democracy . " germany 's süddeutsche zeitung commented on how the international community is dealing with the situation .
" as many rulers there have learned , in africa it does n't matter how election results come about ; the primary thing is that they are recognized internationally … that the united states has now - due to the violent protests in kenya - back-pedaled and , along with great britain , is demanding an independent investigation into the vote-counting may be embarrassing for president george w. bush 's administration , but it is not yet threatening to kibaki . " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : eu election observer head graf lambsdorff noted " extreme discrepencies " in vote-counting " but , what is perfectly clear is that the situation is so explosive that the country is now faced with its most crucial test since its independence .
every western country that seriously believes in democracy for africa is required to do everything it can to help deescalate the situation .
part of that is creating powerful scare tactics both for kibaki as well as for odinga .
any country , however , which recognizes the results of this election is contributing to the escalation , " the paper said . the german daily tageszeitung -lrb- taz -rrb- examined the context behind the violence in kenya .
" when kenyans voted for mwai kibaki five years ago , he promised to put an end to corruption and the state 's arbitrary ways and was celebrated like a pop star as a result .
nowadays , he ca n't even venture out on the street without fearing for his life … so , one ca n't really hold it against the kenyans that they feel betrayed … they wanted to vote him out of office , but were not allowed to do so .
frustration can particularly be felt among young unemployed people , whose last shimmer of hope has been stripped away .
while one may not agree with their actions , they 're understandable in such a context . " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : violence also broke out in nairobi 's slums vienna 's der standard commented that kibaki , through presumed vote-rigging , wanted to prevent a switch of power to the younger generation .
" kibaki , who during his first election presented himself as a champion of democracy , has dispelled his own powers of enchantment .
and he has shown more loyalty to his friends in the so-called ' mount kenya mafia ' than to his citizens .
kibaki , also a former finance minister and vice president , has been in politics for ages .
now he is trying to prevent the dissolution of his generation , which has anchored itself in the administration and economy since independence in 1963 and unscrupulously enriched itself .
but kenyans wanted the exact opposite , as shown in all the opinion polls before the election .
the open criticism of kibaki testifies to a new confidence in a country which is enjoying five-percent economic growth and a truly free press . " dw staff -lrb- als -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

some called for sanctions ; others noted the feeling of betrayal among the people . britain 's financial times took a hard stance toward the announced victory of kenya 's president mwai kibaki .
" kibaki must know that his government is illegitimate .
if he refuses to accept that , then western powers should halt aid programs and instead , use the money for emergency aid and provide it as well to the african union for it to use for a firm intervention .
visas should be denied not only to corrupt civil servants , but also to kibaki and his entire government team .
if odinga and his circle are caught stoking violence , then the same sanctions must also be applied to them .
whatever occurs , the outside world must prepare for the worst and , at the same time , fervently pray that both sides will come to their senses .

internationally , the country takes second place - behind china . germany 's flourishing economy , the largest in europe , got a further boost in the new year with the publishing of a survey giving the country glowing marks for its competitiveness . in a study commissioned by german business daily handelsblatt , 59 percent of the 1,200 leading executives in europe polled rated germany 's competitiveness as " very good " or " good . " on a scale of one to five , they gave germany an average rate of 2.3 points , with one being the best possible score . in 2003 , only 13 percent of top executives surveyed in a similar poll in europe , shared such an optimistic outlook for germany .
since then , germany 's image has risen in the eyes of europe 's executive by 1 percent each year . on an international scale , only china is considered more competitive by european managers .
germany shared second place with switzerland . more foreign investors " the german economy has continually become more competitive in the past years thanks in particular to companies , but also thanks to parties negotiating collective wage agreements and politics , " said bert rürup , chairman of the " council of wise men " - five highly regarded academics who advise the government on economic policy . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : germany 's booming exports have helped it to profit from a global upswing german companies have consistently restructured and together with the unions negotiated moderate and flexible wage agreements , rürup told newspaper , handelsblatt . the daily reported that a further sign for economic revival lay in the fact that for the first time foreign investors own a majority share in germany 's top 30 publicly traded companies .
their share climbed from 20 percent in 2005 to 53 percent in 2007 , the paper said , adding it reflected a vote of confidence in the ability of german companies to profit from a global upswing thanks to their booming exports . " that shows - in the eyes of foreign investors - how competitive german companies have become , but also that there 's mistrust towards the dollar , " rürup said . good news for the labor market the good news from the survey was further bolstered by predictions that a decline in germany 's jobless total last year would continue in the new year despite recent signs of weakening economic growth . " employment will further rise in 2008 , " germany 's federal labor office said on wednesday , jan 2 , a day before official labor market figures were released for the month of december , 2007 . less than two years after spiking to 5 million , germany 's number of jobless fell in november to 3.278 million people .
it 's the lowest level in 15 years , according to figures released by the federal labor office earlier in december . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : economics minister glos is less optimistic than some financial institutes germany 's chambers of industry and commerce -lsb- dikh -rsb- also said german economic growth will slow only slightly in 2008 and will still expand by more than 2 percent . but german economics minister michael glos said wednesday that he anticipated growth to continue at a slower pace .
in an interview with the mass-market bild newspaper , he added that he anticipated economic expansion to come in at just under 2 percent . germany emerged from a protracted period of stagnation in 2006 to report a growth rate of 2.9 percent with the economy expected to post an expansion rate last year of about 2.6 percent .
in november , a government report had predicted a drop in germany 's economic growth , slipping from a forecasted 2.6 percent in 2007 to 1.9 percent in 2008 . in an interview with berliner zeitung , dihk president ludwig georg braun said he was confident that 300,000 jobs could be created in 2008 despite the slight slowdown in gross domestic product growth . " the economy will slow only slightly in 2008 but the companies ' expectations remain good , " he said . shortage of highly skilled workers bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the dip in germany 's jobless rate is expected to continue in 2008 despite the flood of positive predictions , experts warn that germany 's labor market will not be able to maintain its current good form throughout 2008 .
german carmaker audi announced on wednesday that it intended to hire 800 additional engineers in 2008 . braun said that the optimism was due more to strong worldwide economic growth rather than to political decisions made in germany .
he added he was concerned about a worsening in the shortage of highly skilled workers . " that 's where political and industry leaders need to work together to change that , " he said .

essen will be one in 2010 : a european capital of culture .
this year , the english city of liverpool shares the title with the norwegian town of stavanger . " love me do " could be the anthem of this british town known most famously as home to the fab four .
visitors to the city on the mersey river are confronted with beatlemania as soon as they arrive at the airport , which is named after john lennon . indeed , for many years , most visitors were drawn to liverpool due to the beatles ' fame .
" people all over the world have heard of this place , " tour guide phil hughes told dpa news agency . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the fab four remain the most famous musicians in the world the musical history alone could be reason enough to deem liverpool a " european capital of culture " in 2008 .
after all , other british music greats - the rolling stones , the kinks and the who among them - got their start in the cavern club in mathew street .
even american music stars such as chuck berry and bo diddley once played there . beatles ' fame not enough " the beatles legacy certainly helped the city , but that alone was n't all we wanted to show the world , " said paul newman , spokesman for the liverpool culture company .
the company has been the hub for the transformation of the seaport in northwestern england that was not long ago an example of urban decay . decades ago , liverpool was rutted in unemployment and a sense of hopelessness far longer than other industrial regions . the shipyards had been shut down , followed by massive redundancies in the region 's manufacturing sector . in the 1980s , british prime minister margaret thatcher introduced sweeping reforms throughout the country , but liverpool missed the boat . bildunterschrift : liverpool 's wealth now stems from culture rather than shipping pragmatism and economic expertise ultimately helped liverpool citizens to pull themselves up by the boot straps .
but culture also played a big part in the transformation of the city , with cultural institutions receiving massive financial support . " it brought us out of the crisis , " newman told dpa . " investing in art and culture was the right thing to do , especially during a very difficult period . " capitalizing on culture now , liverpool is second only to london in its vast array of cultural events , including an annual modern art fair , galleries with free admission , theater and concerts at the philharmonic hall . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the tate liverpool gallery at albert dock liverpool is also europe 's biggest building site .
cranes will dot the skyline throughout the year of culture in 2008 and longer , as the regeneration of entire districts is planned for well into 2010 . meanwhile , tourists can enjoy the sight of the " liver bird " - a cross between a cormorant , a griffin and an eagle that is the city 's mascot .
in addition to resting atop the liver building , the bird can also be seen on the jerseys of the city 's world-renowned soccer team . slavery history exposed a lively spot for tourists is the historic harbor area called albert dock .
the dock has undergone extensive renovation after years of neglect , with the waterfront district hosting everything from the " tate liverpool " - home of the national collection of modern art in the north of england and the largest gallery of modern and contemporary art outside london - to shops , cafes and the international slavery museum . the museum addresses liverpool 's history as the prime shipment point for " human cargo " between africa and america - a trade that contributed to the city 's former enormous wealth . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : a beatles ' creation : st. pepper 's lonely hearts club band though the slave trade was banned in britain in 1807 , a debate broke out about the issue last year .
penny lane , located in the harbor district and which a beatles song helped make one of the city 's most famous , was named after ship-owner james penny . mr. penny 's ships transported enslaved africans to britain 's colonies in america hundreds of years ago . last year , a local councilman proposed renaming the street , but many citizens protested , including liverpool 's black community , who spoke out against what they called the " silliness " of the matter . back on the map whether it 's exploring liverpool 's history as a " gateway to the world , " its rich architectural legacy or the haunts of rock ' n ' roll stars , visitors will find plenty to do in the city . and , if they 're still not satisfied , they can attend any of the more than 300 cultural events planned for 2008 , some led by such stellar liverpudlian sons as former beatles paul mccartney and ringo starr , as well as conductor sir simon rattle , who will take his berlin philharmonic to his hometown to perform . dw staff -lrb- als -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

essen will be one in 2010 : a european capital of culture .
this year , the english city of liverpool shares the title with the norwegian town of stavanger . " love me do " could be the anthem of this british town known most famously as home to the fab four .
visitors to the city on the mersey river are confronted with beatlemania as soon as they arrive at the airport , which is named after john lennon . indeed , for many years , most visitors were drawn to liverpool due to the beatles ' fame .
" people all over the world have heard of this place , " tour guide phil hughes told dpa news agency . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the fab four remain the most famous musicians in the world the musical history alone could be reason enough to deem liverpool a " european capital of culture " in 2008 .
after all , other british music greats - the rolling stones , the kinks and the who among them - got their start in the cavern club in mathew street .
even american music stars such as chuck berry and bo diddley once played there . beatles ' fame not enough " the beatles legacy certainly helped the city , but that alone was n't all we wanted to show the world , " said paul newman , spokesman for the liverpool culture company .
the company has been the hub for the transformation of the seaport in northwestern england that was not long ago an example of urban decay . decades ago , liverpool was rutted in unemployment and a sense of hopelessness far longer than other industrial regions . the shipyards had been shut down , followed by massive redundancies in the region 's manufacturing sector . in the 1980s , british prime minister margaret thatcher introduced sweeping reforms throughout the country , but liverpool missed the boat . bildunterschrift : liverpool 's wealth now stems from culture rather than shipping pragmatism and economic expertise ultimately helped liverpool citizens to pull themselves up by the boot straps .
but culture also played a big part in the transformation of the city , with cultural institutions receiving massive financial support . " it brought us out of the crisis , " newman told dpa . " investing in art and culture was the right thing to do , especially during a very difficult period . " capitalizing on culture now , liverpool is second only to london in its vast array of cultural events , including an annual modern art fair , galleries with free admission , theater and concerts at the philharmonic hall . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the tate liverpool gallery at albert dock liverpool is also europe 's biggest building site .
cranes will dot the skyline throughout the year of culture in 2008 and longer , as the regeneration of entire districts is planned for well into 2010 . meanwhile , tourists can enjoy the sight of the " liver bird " - a cross between a cormorant , a griffin and an eagle that is the city 's mascot .
in addition to resting atop the liver building , the bird can also be seen on the jerseys of the city 's world-renowned soccer team . slavery history exposed a lively spot for tourists is the historic harbor area called albert dock .
the dock has undergone extensive renovation after years of neglect , with the waterfront district hosting everything from the " tate liverpool " - home of the national collection of modern art in the north of england and the largest gallery of modern and contemporary art outside london - to shops , cafes and the international slavery museum . the museum addresses liverpool 's history as the prime shipment point for " human cargo " between africa and america - a trade that contributed to the city 's former enormous wealth . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : a beatles ' creation : st. pepper 's lonely hearts club band though the slave trade was banned in britain in 1807 , a debate broke out about the issue last year .
penny lane , located in the harbor district and which a beatles song helped make one of the city 's most famous , was named after ship-owner james penny . mr. penny 's ships transported enslaved africans to britain 's colonies in america hundreds of years ago . last year , a local councilman proposed renaming the street , but many citizens protested , including liverpool 's black community , who spoke out against what they called the " silliness " of the matter . back on the map whether it 's exploring liverpool 's history as a " gateway to the world , " its rich architectural legacy or the haunts of rock ' n ' roll stars , visitors will find plenty to do in the city . and , if they 're still not satisfied , they can attend any of the more than 300 cultural events planned for 2008 , some led by such stellar liverpudlian sons as former beatles paul mccartney and ringo starr , as well as conductor sir simon rattle , who will take his berlin philharmonic to his hometown to perform . dw staff -lrb- als -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

but that was before a 17-year-old greek national and a 20-year-old turkish national brutally attacked a pensioner who asked them to stop smoking in a munich subway station .
the pre-christmas attack prompted a national debate about how to deal with youth violence - particulary when the offenders are of non-german origin .
spotting a prime election opportunity , hesse 's embattled christian democrat state premier , roland koch , is now trying to pre-empt the social democrat 's minimum wage campaign by launching a broadside against crime perpetrated by young foreigners .

" in the name of multi-cultural tolerance , we 've been blinded to accept behavior that can lead to dangerous aggression .
we 've got to put an end to the grand delusion . "
on wednesday , koch will meet with his interior minister to discuss a new anti-crime campaign for the january 27 election .
spd fights back the social democrat leader in hesse , andrea ypsilanti , has hit back at koch , telling the süddeutsche zeitung newspaper : " he 's leading a dirty campaign again … that 's his style . "
other spd leaders have accused koch of trying to score points by stirring anti-foreigner sentiment - a sensitive issue in germany .
vice chancellor frank-walter steinmeier said it showed that koch " was nervous " about losing the election to the social democrats .

steinmeier asked .

so , police arrested the rollicky collie near the central city of kassel . but rather than be angry , kassel cops were amused by the dog 's antics .
police said the collie jumped aboard the passenger rail-car at a stop in hümme , a tiny town near kassel , in the state of hesse . nabbing the collie bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : then again , some collies look clever enough to make a dash for the train the train driver , luckily , was adept at multi-tasking and managed to grab the canine beast and tie it up to his seat .
police in kassel later placed the dog in the city pound . the dog also committed a second big no-no in the german handbook of responsible living : not registering his identity to city officials . " it not only did n't have a ticket , " police told dpa .
" it did n't have an ownership tag either . " the kassel cops were still impressed by the scoundrel , though .

but european and us politicians say a un probe is n't necessary . french foreign minister bernhard kouchner said on wednesday , jan .
2 , that he was speaking formally on behalf of the 27-member bloc when he offered pakistan help in combating extremism and probing the killing of opposition leader benazir bhutto . kouchner was the first high-ranking foreign official to visit pakistan since the killing of bhutto , in a gun and bomb attack after a campaign rally last week . kouchner rules out un probe " today we proposed to president musharraf to provide french or european experts , " kouchner said after meeting the pakistani leader in rawalpindi , the garrison city where bhutto , 54 , was slain . " mr. musharraf responded that the idea was interesting . " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : bhutto in a photo taken in october 2007 koucher , however , stressed that he saw little prospect of a united nations investigation into bhutto 's killing .
officials in washington also said a un investigation into bhutto 's death was unnecessary . bhutto 's pakistan people 's party -lrb- ppp -rrb- had called for a probe similar to that into the death in 2005 of former lebanese premier rafiq hariri , where an international court in the hague will try suspects . " if you are talking about a group of international experts , why not , we will be happy to contribute , " kouchner told reporters in islamabad .
" if , though , you 're asking for an international investigation in the un sense of the term , there are conditions which , unfortunately , are not so easy to fulfill . " kouchner said a un investigation commission presupposes the involvement of a third party or country . " in the case of hariri , the presumption was that another country was implicated , whereas here , we ca n't say that with any clarity , " the french minister said .
" as a consequence , unless un rules were suddenly rewritten , it would appear to me to be difficult . " musharraf asks for british help pakistani government officials have so far rejected calls for an international investigation into bhutto 's killing .
but on wednesday , pervez musharraf said he had asked british police for help in the investigation into the assassination . " i am grateful to prime minister brown that ... he accepted my request , " musharraf said in a televised address to the nation , referring to british prime minister gordon brown . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : musharraf said scotland yard will help in the probe " this team will come immediately and will assist our team in the investigation , " musharraf added .
" i hope these investigations would be done properly with scotland yard and remove all doubts . " though musharraf 's administration has said that local groups linked to al qaeda were behind the assassination , bhutto 's party accuses the government of covering up events surrounding her death . eu eager to fight extremism kouchner also handed over a letter from french president nicolas sarkozy which he said expressed his country 's solidarity with pakistan in the wake of the " horrible crime . " he said the letter also underlined sarkozy 's " support for what must be democratic efforts in the continuation of the election process as well as the fight against terrorism and extremism . " koucher said his visit came specifically at the request of slovenia , which took over the rotating eu presidency on jan .

but european and us politicians say a un probe is n't necessary . french foreign minister bernhard kouchner said on wednesday , jan .
2 , that he was speaking formally on behalf of the 27-member bloc when he offered pakistan help in combating extremism and probing the killing of opposition leader benazir bhutto . kouchner was the first high-ranking foreign official to visit pakistan since the killing of bhutto , in a gun and bomb attack after a campaign rally last week . kouchner rules out un probe " today we proposed to president musharraf to provide french or european experts , " kouchner said after meeting the pakistani leader in rawalpindi , the garrison city where bhutto , 54 , was slain . " mr. musharraf responded that the idea was interesting . " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : bhutto in a photo taken in october 2007 koucher , however , stressed that he saw little prospect of a united nations investigation into bhutto 's killing .
officials in washington also said a un investigation into bhutto 's death was unnecessary . bhutto 's pakistan people 's party -lrb- ppp -rrb- had called for a probe similar to that into the death in 2005 of former lebanese premier rafiq hariri , where an international court in the hague will try suspects . " if you are talking about a group of international experts , why not , we will be happy to contribute , " kouchner told reporters in islamabad .
" if , though , you 're asking for an international investigation in the un sense of the term , there are conditions which , unfortunately , are not so easy to fulfill . " kouchner said a un investigation commission presupposes the involvement of a third party or country . " in the case of hariri , the presumption was that another country was implicated , whereas here , we ca n't say that with any clarity , " the french minister said .
" as a consequence , unless un rules were suddenly rewritten , it would appear to me to be difficult . " musharraf asks for british help pakistani government officials have so far rejected calls for an international investigation into bhutto 's killing .
but on wednesday , pervez musharraf said he had asked british police for help in the investigation into the assassination . " i am grateful to prime minister brown that ... he accepted my request , " musharraf said in a televised address to the nation , referring to british prime minister gordon brown . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : musharraf said scotland yard will help in the probe " this team will come immediately and will assist our team in the investigation , " musharraf added .
" i hope these investigations would be done properly with scotland yard and remove all doubts . " though musharraf 's administration has said that local groups linked to al qaeda were behind the assassination , bhutto 's party accuses the government of covering up events surrounding her death . eu eager to fight extremism kouchner also handed over a letter from french president nicolas sarkozy which he said expressed his country 's solidarity with pakistan in the wake of the " horrible crime . " he said the letter also underlined sarkozy 's " support for what must be democratic efforts in the continuation of the election process as well as the fight against terrorism and extremism . " koucher said his visit came specifically at the request of slovenia , which took over the rotating eu presidency on jan .
1 . " bhutto was assassinated by an extremism that we , france and the european union , have decided to fight , " he said .
" it would not be surprising if it was islamist terrorism since i know that it makes its bed in the tribal zone of pakistan . " election delayed pakistan 's election commission on wednesday postponed the general elections by six weeks , to feb .

it 's the worst figure in over a decade , and another sign of the increasing perils of the profession . the report said the most dangerous part of the world for reporters was iraq , where 47 journalists were killed there last year - all but one were iraqis .
somalia was a distant second on the list with eight journalists killed . the report also pointed out that 207 media workers had died in iraq since the us-led invasion in 2003 , making it the deadliest recent conflict for journalists . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : over 100 journalists have been killed in iraq since the us-led war began there in in 2003 " no country has ever seen more journalists killed than iraq , " reporters without borders said .
" -lsb- that 's -rsb- more than in the vietnam war , the fighting in ex-yugoslavia , the massacres in algeria or the rwandan genocide . " the list includes only clearly work-related deaths .
the paris-based press freedom organization said 103 journalists were killed in 1994 , nearly half of them in rwanda . a separate report released wednesday , jan .
2 , by the international federation of journalists put the overall toll much higher , listing 171 journalists and other media workers killed by violence or in accidents throughout the year . " violence against journalists remains at extremely high levels for the third year in a row , " ifj president jim boumelha said in a statement .

it orbits its mother star every 3.65 days . a mere 10 million years old bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : jupiter and its four large moons the astronomers believe the new planetary system is only around 10 million years old , which is only about 0.2 percent of the age of the solar system . the earth is believed to be about 4.5 billion years old , and the sun around 100 million years older . planets are said to take shape within disks of dust and gas surrounding newly born stars .
by researching planets , scientists can glean information about how their planetary systems were formed . the young planet orbiting the young star provides observational evidence to the long-held theory that planets form within the first 10 million years of a parent star 's life , according to the study .
until the recent finding , all of the 250-plus planets discovered outside our solar system have been found around stars 100 million years of age or more . the research team , led by johny setiawan , estimated that the mother star is between 8 million and 10 million years old , which makes the newborn extrasolar planet even younger .
the planet is still linked to the dusty disk of dust and gas , the raw materials which make a solar system . these so-called protoplanetary disks have lived up to their name , setiawan said . " it is very exciting to know that things we called protoplanetary disks are indeed protoplanetary , " he said .

internationally , the country takes second place - behind china . germany 's flourishing economy , the largest in europe , got a further boost in the new year with the publishing of a survey giving the country glowing marks for its competitiveness . in a study commissioned by german business daily handelsblatt , 59 percent of the 1,200 leading executives in europe polled rated germany 's competitiveness as " very good " or " good . " on a scale of one to five , they gave germany an average rate of 2.3 points , with one being the best possible score . in 2003 , only 13 percent of top executives surveyed in a similar poll in europe , shared such an optimistic outlook for germany .
since then , germany 's image has risen in the eyes of europe 's executive by 1 percent each year . on an international scale , only china is considered more competitive by european managers .
germany shared second place with switzerland . more foreign investors " the german economy has continually become more competitive in the past years thanks in particular to companies , but also thanks to parties negotiating collective wage agreements and politics , " said bert rürup , chairman of the " council of wise men " - five highly regarded academics who advise the government on economic policy . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : germany 's booming exports have helped it to profit from a global upswing german companies have consistently restructured and together with the unions negotiated moderate and flexible wage agreements , rürup told newspaper , handelsblatt . the daily reported that a further sign for economic revival lay in the fact that for the first time foreign investors own a majority share in germany 's top 30 publicly traded companies .
their share climbed from 20 percent in 2005 to 53 percent in 2007 , the paper said , adding it reflected a vote of confidence in the ability of german companies to profit from a global upswing thanks to their booming exports . " that shows - in the eyes of foreign investors - how competitive german companies have become , but also that there 's mistrust towards the dollar , " rürup said . good news for the labor market the good news from the survey was further bolstered by predictions that a decline in germany 's jobless total last year would continue in the new year despite recent signs of weakening economic growth . " employment will further rise in 2008 , " germany 's federal labor office said on wednesday , jan 2 , a day before official labor market figures were released for the month of december , 2007 . less than two years after spiking to 5 million , germany 's number of jobless fell in november to 3.278 million people .
it 's the lowest level in 15 years , according to figures released by the federal labor office earlier in december . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : economics minister glos is less optimistic than some financial institutes germany 's chambers of industry and commerce -lsb- dikh -rsb- also said german economic growth will slow only slightly in 2008 and will still expand by more than 2 percent . but german economics minister michael glos said wednesday that he anticipated growth to continue at a slower pace .
in an interview with the mass-market bild newspaper , he added that he anticipated economic expansion to come in at just under 2 percent . germany emerged from a protracted period of stagnation in 2006 to report a growth rate of 2.9 percent with the economy expected to post an expansion rate last year of about 2.6 percent .
in november , a government report had predicted a drop in germany 's economic growth , slipping from a forecasted 2.6 percent in 2007 to 1.9 percent in 2008 . in an interview with berliner zeitung , dihk president ludwig georg braun said he was confident that 300,000 jobs could be created in 2008 despite the slight slowdown in gross domestic product growth . " the economy will slow only slightly in 2008 but the companies ' expectations remain good , " he said . shortage of highly skilled workers bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the dip in germany 's jobless rate is expected to continue in 2008 despite the flood of positive predictions , experts warn that germany 's labor market will not be able to maintain its current good form throughout 2008 .
german carmaker audi announced on wednesday that it intended to hire 800 additional engineers in 2008 . braun said that the optimism was due more to strong worldwide economic growth rather than to political decisions made in germany .
he added he was concerned about a worsening in the shortage of highly skilled workers . " that 's where political and industry leaders need to work together to change that , " he said .

but european and us politicians say a un probe is n't necessary . french foreign minister bernhard kouchner said on wednesday , jan .
2 , that he was speaking formally on behalf of the 27-member bloc when he offered pakistan help in combating extremism and probing the killing of opposition leader benazir bhutto . kouchner was the first high-ranking foreign official to visit pakistan since the killing of bhutto , in a gun and bomb attack after a campaign rally last week . kouchner rules out un probe " today we proposed to president musharraf to provide french or european experts , " kouchner said after meeting the pakistani leader in rawalpindi , the garrison city where bhutto , 54 , was slain . " mr. musharraf responded that the idea was interesting . " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : bhutto in a photo taken in october 2007 koucher , however , stressed that he saw little prospect of a united nations investigation into bhutto 's killing .
officials in washington also said a un investigation into bhutto 's death was unnecessary . bhutto 's pakistan people 's party -lrb- ppp -rrb- had called for a probe similar to that into the death in 2005 of former lebanese premier rafiq hariri , where an international court in the hague will try suspects . " if you are talking about a group of international experts , why not , we will be happy to contribute , " kouchner told reporters in islamabad .
" if , though , you 're asking for an international investigation in the un sense of the term , there are conditions which , unfortunately , are not so easy to fulfill . " kouchner said a un investigation commission presupposes the involvement of a third party or country . " in the case of hariri , the presumption was that another country was implicated , whereas here , we ca n't say that with any clarity , " the french minister said .
" as a consequence , unless un rules were suddenly rewritten , it would appear to me to be difficult . " musharraf asks for british help pakistani government officials have so far rejected calls for an international investigation into bhutto 's killing .
but on wednesday , pervez musharraf said he had asked british police for help in the investigation into the assassination . " i am grateful to prime minister brown that ... he accepted my request , " musharraf said in a televised address to the nation , referring to british prime minister gordon brown . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : musharraf said scotland yard will help in the probe " this team will come immediately and will assist our team in the investigation , " musharraf added .
" i hope these investigations would be done properly with scotland yard and remove all doubts . " though musharraf 's administration has said that local groups linked to al qaeda were behind the assassination , bhutto 's party accuses the government of covering up events surrounding her death . eu eager to fight extremism kouchner also handed over a letter from french president nicolas sarkozy which he said expressed his country 's solidarity with pakistan in the wake of the " horrible crime . " he said the letter also underlined sarkozy 's " support for what must be democratic efforts in the continuation of the election process as well as the fight against terrorism and extremism . " koucher said his visit came specifically at the request of slovenia , which took over the rotating eu presidency on jan .
1 . " bhutto was assassinated by an extremism that we , france and the european union , have decided to fight , " he said .
" it would not be surprising if it was islamist terrorism since i know that it makes its bed in the tribal zone of pakistan . " election delayed pakistan 's election commission on wednesday postponed the general elections by six weeks , to feb .
18 , saying polling was not possible on the original date of jan .
8 because of disturbances following bhutto 's murder . the decision has been criticized by opposition parties .
they say the delay will benefit beleaguered musharraf and his ruling party , the pakistan muslim league-q . they also say a delay could provoke more unrest and violence . dw staff -lrb- sp -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

the presidential election in kenya - one of africa 's richest and most stable countries - has set the nation aflame .
hundreds of people have been killed in the clashes between president kibaki 's supporters and those of opposition candidate raila odinga .
all of the independent sources and reports , including those of a european union observer mission led by germany 's alexander graf lambsdorff , say very clearly : state powers pulled the necessary votes out of a hat to prevent a victory for odinga .
kenya has never really been home to a democracy . " germany 's süddeutsche zeitung commented on how the international community is dealing with the situation .
" as many rulers there have learned , in africa it does n't matter how election results come about ; the primary thing is that they are recognized internationally … that the united states has now - due to the violent protests in kenya - back-pedaled and , along with great britain , is demanding an independent investigation into the vote-counting may be embarrassing for president george w. bush 's administration , but it is not yet threatening to kibaki . " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : eu election observer head graf lambsdorff noted " extreme discrepencies " in vote-counting " but , what is perfectly clear is that the situation is so explosive that the country is now faced with its most crucial test since its independence .
every western country that seriously believes in democracy for africa is required to do everything it can to help deescalate the situation .
part of that is creating powerful scare tactics both for kibaki as well as for odinga .
any country , however , which recognizes the results of this election is contributing to the escalation , " the paper said . the german daily tageszeitung -lrb- taz -rrb- examined the context behind the violence in kenya .
" when kenyans voted for mwai kibaki five years ago , he promised to put an end to corruption and the state 's arbitrary ways and was celebrated like a pop star as a result .
nowadays , he ca n't even venture out on the street without fearing for his life … so , one ca n't really hold it against the kenyans that they feel betrayed … they wanted to vote him out of office , but were not allowed to do so .
frustration can particularly be felt among young unemployed people , whose last shimmer of hope has been stripped away .
while one may not agree with their actions , they 're understandable in such a context . " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : violence also broke out in nairobi 's slums vienna 's der standard commented that kibaki , through presumed vote-rigging , wanted to prevent a switch of power to the younger generation .
" kibaki , who during his first election presented himself as a champion of democracy , has dispelled his own powers of enchantment .
and he has shown more loyalty to his friends in the so-called ' mount kenya mafia ' than to his citizens .
kibaki , also a former finance minister and vice president , has been in politics for ages .
now he is trying to prevent the dissolution of his generation , which has anchored itself in the administration and economy since independence in 1963 and unscrupulously enriched itself .
but kenyans wanted the exact opposite , as shown in all the opinion polls before the election .
the open criticism of kibaki testifies to a new confidence in a country which is enjoying five-percent economic growth and a truly free press . " dw staff -lrb- als -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

but european and us politicians say a un probe is n't necessary . french foreign minister bernhard kouchner said on wednesday , jan .
2 , that he was speaking formally on behalf of the 27-member bloc when he offered pakistan help in combating extremism and probing the killing of opposition leader benazir bhutto . kouchner was the first high-ranking foreign official to visit pakistan since the killing of bhutto , in a gun and bomb attack after a campaign rally last week . kouchner rules out un probe " today we proposed to president musharraf to provide french or european experts , " kouchner said after meeting the pakistani leader in rawalpindi , the garrison city where bhutto , 54 , was slain . " mr. musharraf responded that the idea was interesting . " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : bhutto in a photo taken in october 2007 koucher , however , stressed that he saw little prospect of a united nations investigation into bhutto 's killing .
officials in washington also said a un investigation into bhutto 's death was unnecessary . bhutto 's pakistan people 's party -lrb- ppp -rrb- had called for a probe similar to that into the death in 2005 of former lebanese premier rafiq hariri , where an international court in the hague will try suspects . " if you are talking about a group of international experts , why not , we will be happy to contribute , " kouchner told reporters in islamabad .
" if , though , you 're asking for an international investigation in the un sense of the term , there are conditions which , unfortunately , are not so easy to fulfill . " kouchner said a un investigation commission presupposes the involvement of a third party or country . " in the case of hariri , the presumption was that another country was implicated , whereas here , we ca n't say that with any clarity , " the french minister said .
" as a consequence , unless un rules were suddenly rewritten , it would appear to me to be difficult . " musharraf asks for british help pakistani government officials have so far rejected calls for an international investigation into bhutto 's killing .
but on wednesday , pervez musharraf said he had asked british police for help in the investigation into the assassination . " i am grateful to prime minister brown that ... he accepted my request , " musharraf said in a televised address to the nation , referring to british prime minister gordon brown . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : musharraf said scotland yard will help in the probe " this team will come immediately and will assist our team in the investigation , " musharraf added .
" i hope these investigations would be done properly with scotland yard and remove all doubts . " though musharraf 's administration has said that local groups linked to al qaeda were behind the assassination , bhutto 's party accuses the government of covering up events surrounding her death . eu eager to fight extremism kouchner also handed over a letter from french president nicolas sarkozy which he said expressed his country 's solidarity with pakistan in the wake of the " horrible crime . " he said the letter also underlined sarkozy 's " support for what must be democratic efforts in the continuation of the election process as well as the fight against terrorism and extremism . " koucher said his visit came specifically at the request of slovenia , which took over the rotating eu presidency on jan .

internationally , the country takes second place - behind china . germany 's flourishing economy , the largest in europe , got a further boost in the new year with the publishing of a survey giving the country glowing marks for its competitiveness . in a study commissioned by german business daily handelsblatt , 59 percent of the 1,200 leading executives in europe polled rated germany 's competitiveness as " very good " or " good . " on a scale of one to five , they gave germany an average rate of 2.3 points , with one being the best possible score . in 2003 , only 13 percent of top executives surveyed in a similar poll in europe , shared such an optimistic outlook for germany .
since then , germany 's image has risen in the eyes of europe 's executive by 1 percent each year . on an international scale , only china is considered more competitive by european managers .
germany shared second place with switzerland . more foreign investors " the german economy has continually become more competitive in the past years thanks in particular to companies , but also thanks to parties negotiating collective wage agreements and politics , " said bert rürup , chairman of the " council of wise men " - five highly regarded academics who advise the government on economic policy . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : germany 's booming exports have helped it to profit from a global upswing german companies have consistently restructured and together with the unions negotiated moderate and flexible wage agreements , rürup told newspaper , handelsblatt . the daily reported that a further sign for economic revival lay in the fact that for the first time foreign investors own a majority share in germany 's top 30 publicly traded companies .
their share climbed from 20 percent in 2005 to 53 percent in 2007 , the paper said , adding it reflected a vote of confidence in the ability of german companies to profit from a global upswing thanks to their booming exports . " that shows - in the eyes of foreign investors - how competitive german companies have become , but also that there 's mistrust towards the dollar , " rürup said . good news for the labor market the good news from the survey was further bolstered by predictions that a decline in germany 's jobless total last year would continue in the new year despite recent signs of weakening economic growth . " employment will further rise in 2008 , " germany 's federal labor office said on wednesday , jan 2 , a day before official labor market figures were released for the month of december , 2007 . less than two years after spiking to 5 million , germany 's number of jobless fell in november to 3.278 million people .
it 's the lowest level in 15 years , according to figures released by the federal labor office earlier in december . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : economics minister glos is less optimistic than some financial institutes germany 's chambers of industry and commerce -lsb- dikh -rsb- also said german economic growth will slow only slightly in 2008 and will still expand by more than 2 percent . but german economics minister michael glos said wednesday that he anticipated growth to continue at a slower pace .
in an interview with the mass-market bild newspaper , he added that he anticipated economic expansion to come in at just under 2 percent . germany emerged from a protracted period of stagnation in 2006 to report a growth rate of 2.9 percent with the economy expected to post an expansion rate last year of about 2.6 percent .
in november , a government report had predicted a drop in germany 's economic growth , slipping from a forecasted 2.6 percent in 2007 to 1.9 percent in 2008 . in an interview with berliner zeitung , dihk president ludwig georg braun said he was confident that 300,000 jobs could be created in 2008 despite the slight slowdown in gross domestic product growth .

german carmaker audi announced on wednesday that it intended to hire 800 additional engineers in 2008 . braun said that the optimism was due more to strong worldwide economic growth rather than to political decisions made in germany .
he added he was concerned about a worsening in the shortage of highly skilled workers . " that 's where political and industry leaders need to work together to change that , " he said .

internationally , the country takes second place - behind china . germany 's flourishing economy , the largest in europe , got a further boost in the new year with the publishing of a survey giving the country glowing marks for its competitiveness . in a study commissioned by german business daily handelsblatt , 59 percent of the 1,200 leading executives in europe polled rated germany 's competitiveness as " very good " or " good . " on a scale of one to five , they gave germany an average rate of 2.3 points , with one being the best possible score . in 2003 , only 13 percent of top executives surveyed in a similar poll in europe , shared such an optimistic outlook for germany .
since then , germany 's image has risen in the eyes of europe 's executive by 1 percent each year . on an international scale , only china is considered more competitive by european managers .
germany shared second place with switzerland . more foreign investors " the german economy has continually become more competitive in the past years thanks in particular to companies , but also thanks to parties negotiating collective wage agreements and politics , " said bert rürup , chairman of the " council of wise men " - five highly regarded academics who advise the government on economic policy . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : germany 's booming exports have helped it to profit from a global upswing german companies have consistently restructured and together with the unions negotiated moderate and flexible wage agreements , rürup told newspaper , handelsblatt . the daily reported that a further sign for economic revival lay in the fact that for the first time foreign investors own a majority share in germany 's top 30 publicly traded companies .
their share climbed from 20 percent in 2005 to 53 percent in 2007 , the paper said , adding it reflected a vote of confidence in the ability of german companies to profit from a global upswing thanks to their booming exports . " that shows - in the eyes of foreign investors - how competitive german companies have become , but also that there 's mistrust towards the dollar , " rürup said . good news for the labor market the good news from the survey was further bolstered by predictions that a decline in germany 's jobless total last year would continue in the new year despite recent signs of weakening economic growth . " employment will further rise in 2008 , " germany 's federal labor office said on wednesday , jan 2 , a day before official labor market figures were released for the month of december , 2007 . less than two years after spiking to 5 million , germany 's number of jobless fell in november to 3.278 million people .
it 's the lowest level in 15 years , according to figures released by the federal labor office earlier in december . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : economics minister glos is less optimistic than some financial institutes germany 's chambers of industry and commerce -lsb- dikh -rsb- also said german economic growth will slow only slightly in 2008 and will still expand by more than 2 percent . but german economics minister michael glos said wednesday that he anticipated growth to continue at a slower pace .
in an interview with the mass-market bild newspaper , he added that he anticipated economic expansion to come in at just under 2 percent . germany emerged from a protracted period of stagnation in 2006 to report a growth rate of 2.9 percent with the economy expected to post an expansion rate last year of about 2.6 percent .
in november , a government report had predicted a drop in germany 's economic growth , slipping from a forecasted 2.6 percent in 2007 to 1.9 percent in 2008 . in an interview with berliner zeitung , dihk president ludwig georg braun said he was confident that 300,000 jobs could be created in 2008 despite the slight slowdown in gross domestic product growth . " the economy will slow only slightly in 2008 but the companies ' expectations remain good , " he said . shortage of highly skilled workers bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the dip in germany 's jobless rate is expected to continue in 2008 despite the flood of positive predictions , experts warn that germany 's labor market will not be able to maintain its current good form throughout 2008 .
german carmaker audi announced on wednesday that it intended to hire 800 additional engineers in 2008 . braun said that the optimism was due more to strong worldwide economic growth rather than to political decisions made in germany .
he added he was concerned about a worsening in the shortage of highly skilled workers . " that 's where political and industry leaders need to work together to change that , " he said .
" we need better training but also we need to open the country more to highly qualified foreign workers . " dw staff -lrb- sp -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

only in germany would police arrest a dog .
but arrest a collie they did , for a major canine " faux-paw : " trying to get a free ride on one of the country 's most treasured modes of transport . lovers of law and order that they are , germans just could n't have it that a dog would dare to ride the train without a ticket .
so , police arrested the rollicky collie near the central city of kassel . but rather than be angry , kassel cops were amused by the dog 's antics .
police said the collie jumped aboard the passenger rail-car at a stop in hümme , a tiny town near kassel , in the state of hesse . nabbing the collie bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : then again , some collies look clever enough to make a dash for the train the train driver , luckily , was adept at multi-tasking and managed to grab the canine beast and tie it up to his seat .
police in kassel later placed the dog in the city pound . the dog also committed a second big no-no in the german handbook of responsible living : not registering his identity to city officials . " it not only did n't have a ticket , " police told dpa .
" it did n't have an ownership tag either . " the kassel cops were still impressed by the scoundrel , though .

only in germany would police arrest a dog .
but arrest a collie they did , for a major canine " faux-paw : " trying to get a free ride on one of the country 's most treasured modes of transport . lovers of law and order that they are , germans just could n't have it that a dog would dare to ride the train without a ticket .
so , police arrested the rollicky collie near the central city of kassel . but rather than be angry , kassel cops were amused by the dog 's antics .
police said the collie jumped aboard the passenger rail-car at a stop in hümme , a tiny town near kassel , in the state of hesse . nabbing the collie bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : then again , some collies look clever enough to make a dash for the train the train driver , luckily , was adept at multi-tasking and managed to grab the canine beast and tie it up to his seat .
police in kassel later placed the dog in the city pound . the dog also committed a second big no-no in the german handbook of responsible living : not registering his identity to city officials . " it not only did n't have a ticket , " police told dpa .
" it did n't have an ownership tag either . " the kassel cops were still impressed by the scoundrel , though .
they said it reminded them of canine screen star lassie , who always managed to make the cross-country journey home to its owners - without a train ticket . dw staff -lrb- als -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

essen will be one in 2010 : a european capital of culture .
this year , the english city of liverpool shares the title with the norwegian town of stavanger . " love me do " could be the anthem of this british town known most famously as home to the fab four .
visitors to the city on the mersey river are confronted with beatlemania as soon as they arrive at the airport , which is named after john lennon . indeed , for many years , most visitors were drawn to liverpool due to the beatles ' fame .
" people all over the world have heard of this place , " tour guide phil hughes told dpa news agency . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the fab four remain the most famous musicians in the world the musical history alone could be reason enough to deem liverpool a " european capital of culture " in 2008 .
after all , other british music greats - the rolling stones , the kinks and the who among them - got their start in the cavern club in mathew street .
even american music stars such as chuck berry and bo diddley once played there . beatles ' fame not enough " the beatles legacy certainly helped the city , but that alone was n't all we wanted to show the world , " said paul newman , spokesman for the liverpool culture company .
the company has been the hub for the transformation of the seaport in northwestern england that was not long ago an example of urban decay . decades ago , liverpool was rutted in unemployment and a sense of hopelessness far longer than other industrial regions . the shipyards had been shut down , followed by massive redundancies in the region 's manufacturing sector . in the 1980s , british prime minister margaret thatcher introduced sweeping reforms throughout the country , but liverpool missed the boat . bildunterschrift : liverpool 's wealth now stems from culture rather than shipping pragmatism and economic expertise ultimately helped liverpool citizens to pull themselves up by the boot straps .
but culture also played a big part in the transformation of the city , with cultural institutions receiving massive financial support . " it brought us out of the crisis , " newman told dpa . " investing in art and culture was the right thing to do , especially during a very difficult period . " capitalizing on culture now , liverpool is second only to london in its vast array of cultural events , including an annual modern art fair , galleries with free admission , theater and concerts at the philharmonic hall . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the tate liverpool gallery at albert dock liverpool is also europe 's biggest building site .
cranes will dot the skyline throughout the year of culture in 2008 and longer , as the regeneration of entire districts is planned for well into 2010 . meanwhile , tourists can enjoy the sight of the " liver bird " - a cross between a cormorant , a griffin and an eagle that is the city 's mascot .
in addition to resting atop the liver building , the bird can also be seen on the jerseys of the city 's world-renowned soccer team . slavery history exposed a lively spot for tourists is the historic harbor area called albert dock .
the dock has undergone extensive renovation after years of neglect , with the waterfront district hosting everything from the " tate liverpool " - home of the national collection of modern art in the north of england and the largest gallery of modern and contemporary art outside london - to shops , cafes and the international slavery museum . the museum addresses liverpool 's history as the prime shipment point for " human cargo " between africa and america - a trade that contributed to the city 's former enormous wealth . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : a beatles ' creation : st. pepper 's lonely hearts club band though the slave trade was banned in britain in 1807 , a debate broke out about the issue last year .

essen will be one in 2010 : a european capital of culture .
this year , the english city of liverpool shares the title with the norwegian town of stavanger . " love me do " could be the anthem of this british town known most famously as home to the fab four .
visitors to the city on the mersey river are confronted with beatlemania as soon as they arrive at the airport , which is named after john lennon . indeed , for many years , most visitors were drawn to liverpool due to the beatles ' fame .
" people all over the world have heard of this place , " tour guide phil hughes told dpa news agency . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the fab four remain the most famous musicians in the world the musical history alone could be reason enough to deem liverpool a " european capital of culture " in 2008 .
after all , other british music greats - the rolling stones , the kinks and the who among them - got their start in the cavern club in mathew street .
even american music stars such as chuck berry and bo diddley once played there . beatles ' fame not enough " the beatles legacy certainly helped the city , but that alone was n't all we wanted to show the world , " said paul newman , spokesman for the liverpool culture company .
the company has been the hub for the transformation of the seaport in northwestern england that was not long ago an example of urban decay . decades ago , liverpool was rutted in unemployment and a sense of hopelessness far longer than other industrial regions . the shipyards had been shut down , followed by massive redundancies in the region 's manufacturing sector . in the 1980s , british prime minister margaret thatcher introduced sweeping reforms throughout the country , but liverpool missed the boat . bildunterschrift : liverpool 's wealth now stems from culture rather than shipping pragmatism and economic expertise ultimately helped liverpool citizens to pull themselves up by the boot straps .
but culture also played a big part in the transformation of the city , with cultural institutions receiving massive financial support . " it brought us out of the crisis , " newman told dpa . " investing in art and culture was the right thing to do , especially during a very difficult period . " capitalizing on culture now , liverpool is second only to london in its vast array of cultural events , including an annual modern art fair , galleries with free admission , theater and concerts at the philharmonic hall . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the tate liverpool gallery at albert dock liverpool is also europe 's biggest building site .
cranes will dot the skyline throughout the year of culture in 2008 and longer , as the regeneration of entire districts is planned for well into 2010 . meanwhile , tourists can enjoy the sight of the " liver bird " - a cross between a cormorant , a griffin and an eagle that is the city 's mascot .
in addition to resting atop the liver building , the bird can also be seen on the jerseys of the city 's world-renowned soccer team . slavery history exposed a lively spot for tourists is the historic harbor area called albert dock .
the dock has undergone extensive renovation after years of neglect , with the waterfront district hosting everything from the " tate liverpool " - home of the national collection of modern art in the north of england and the largest gallery of modern and contemporary art outside london - to shops , cafes and the international slavery museum . the museum addresses liverpool 's history as the prime shipment point for " human cargo " between africa and america - a trade that contributed to the city 's former enormous wealth . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : a beatles ' creation : st. pepper 's lonely hearts club band though the slave trade was banned in britain in 1807 , a debate broke out about the issue last year .
penny lane , located in the harbor district and which a beatles song helped make one of the city 's most famous , was named after ship-owner james penny . mr. penny 's ships transported enslaved africans to britain 's colonies in america hundreds of years ago . last year , a local councilman proposed renaming the street , but many citizens protested , including liverpool 's black community , who spoke out against what they called the " silliness " of the matter . back on the map whether it 's exploring liverpool 's history as a " gateway to the world , " its rich architectural legacy or the haunts of rock ' n ' roll stars , visitors will find plenty to do in the city . and , if they 're still not satisfied , they can attend any of the more than 300 cultural events planned for 2008 , some led by such stellar liverpudlian sons as former beatles paul mccartney and ringo starr , as well as conductor sir simon rattle , who will take his berlin philharmonic to his hometown to perform . dw staff -lrb- als -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

but that was before a 17-year-old greek national and a 20-year-old turkish national brutally attacked a pensioner who asked them to stop smoking in a munich subway station .
the pre-christmas attack prompted a national debate about how to deal with youth violence - particulary when the offenders are of non-german origin .
spotting a prime election opportunity , hesse 's embattled christian democrat state premier , roland koch , is now trying to pre-empt the social democrat 's minimum wage campaign by launching a broadside against crime perpetrated by young foreigners .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : according to cdu politicians , around half of germany 's young offenders are foreigners " we have too many criminal foreigner juveniles in germany , " koch said .
" in the name of multi-cultural tolerance , we 've been blinded to accept behavior that can lead to dangerous aggression .
we 've got to put an end to the grand delusion . "
on wednesday , koch will meet with his interior minister to discuss a new anti-crime campaign for the january 27 election .
spd fights back the social democrat leader in hesse , andrea ypsilanti , has hit back at koch , telling the süddeutsche zeitung newspaper : " he 's leading a dirty campaign again … that 's his style . "
other spd leaders have accused koch of trying to score points by stirring anti-foreigner sentiment - a sensitive issue in germany .
vice chancellor frank-walter steinmeier said it showed that koch " was nervous " about losing the election to the social democrats .
" herr koch , why do n't you come up with some concrete ideas on integration instead of whipping the people up against each other ? "
steinmeier asked .

essen will be one in 2010 : a european capital of culture .
this year , the english city of liverpool shares the title with the norwegian town of stavanger . " love me do " could be the anthem of this british town known most famously as home to the fab four .
visitors to the city on the mersey river are confronted with beatlemania as soon as they arrive at the airport , which is named after john lennon . indeed , for many years , most visitors were drawn to liverpool due to the beatles ' fame .
" people all over the world have heard of this place , " tour guide phil hughes told dpa news agency . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the fab four remain the most famous musicians in the world the musical history alone could be reason enough to deem liverpool a " european capital of culture " in 2008 .
after all , other british music greats - the rolling stones , the kinks and the who among them - got their start in the cavern club in mathew street .
even american music stars such as chuck berry and bo diddley once played there . beatles ' fame not enough " the beatles legacy certainly helped the city , but that alone was n't all we wanted to show the world , " said paul newman , spokesman for the liverpool culture company .
the company has been the hub for the transformation of the seaport in northwestern england that was not long ago an example of urban decay . decades ago , liverpool was rutted in unemployment and a sense of hopelessness far longer than other industrial regions . the shipyards had been shut down , followed by massive redundancies in the region 's manufacturing sector . in the 1980s , british prime minister margaret thatcher introduced sweeping reforms throughout the country , but liverpool missed the boat . bildunterschrift : liverpool 's wealth now stems from culture rather than shipping pragmatism and economic expertise ultimately helped liverpool citizens to pull themselves up by the boot straps .
but culture also played a big part in the transformation of the city , with cultural institutions receiving massive financial support . " it brought us out of the crisis , " newman told dpa . " investing in art and culture was the right thing to do , especially during a very difficult period . " capitalizing on culture now , liverpool is second only to london in its vast array of cultural events , including an annual modern art fair , galleries with free admission , theater and concerts at the philharmonic hall . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the tate liverpool gallery at albert dock liverpool is also europe 's biggest building site .
cranes will dot the skyline throughout the year of culture in 2008 and longer , as the regeneration of entire districts is planned for well into 2010 . meanwhile , tourists can enjoy the sight of the " liver bird " - a cross between a cormorant , a griffin and an eagle that is the city 's mascot .
in addition to resting atop the liver building , the bird can also be seen on the jerseys of the city 's world-renowned soccer team . slavery history exposed a lively spot for tourists is the historic harbor area called albert dock .
the dock has undergone extensive renovation after years of neglect , with the waterfront district hosting everything from the " tate liverpool " - home of the national collection of modern art in the north of england and the largest gallery of modern and contemporary art outside london - to shops , cafes and the international slavery museum . the museum addresses liverpool 's history as the prime shipment point for " human cargo " between africa and america - a trade that contributed to the city 's former enormous wealth . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : a beatles ' creation : st. pepper 's lonely hearts club band though the slave trade was banned in britain in 1807 , a debate broke out about the issue last year .
penny lane , located in the harbor district and which a beatles song helped make one of the city 's most famous , was named after ship-owner james penny . mr. penny 's ships transported enslaved africans to britain 's colonies in america hundreds of years ago . last year , a local councilman proposed renaming the street , but many citizens protested , including liverpool 's black community , who spoke out against what they called the " silliness " of the matter . back on the map whether it 's exploring liverpool 's history as a " gateway to the world , " its rich architectural legacy or the haunts of rock ' n ' roll stars , visitors will find plenty to do in the city . and , if they 're still not satisfied , they can attend any of the more than 300 cultural events planned for 2008 , some led by such stellar liverpudlian sons as former beatles paul mccartney and ringo starr , as well as conductor sir simon rattle , who will take his berlin philharmonic to his hometown to perform . dw staff -lrb- als -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

only in germany would police arrest a dog .

so , police arrested the rollicky collie near the central city of kassel . but rather than be angry , kassel cops were amused by the dog 's antics .
police said the collie jumped aboard the passenger rail-car at a stop in hümme , a tiny town near kassel , in the state of hesse . nabbing the collie bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : then again , some collies look clever enough to make a dash for the train the train driver , luckily , was adept at multi-tasking and managed to grab the canine beast and tie it up to his seat .

" it did n't have an ownership tag either . " the kassel cops were still impressed by the scoundrel , though .

the announcement was hardly a surprise considering bayern 's recent struggles . " i informed the club about my decision to leave this summer three weeks ago , " hitzfeld told the german sports news agency sid on wednesday , jan .
2 .
" but i 'll still be trying to win as many titles as possible in the next half-year . " earlier bayern commercial manager uli hoeneß had offered a typically gruff remark to the daily bild newspaper . " you 'd be safe to assume that -lsb- hitzfeld -rsb- will not be staying , " hoeneß said .
" but he will be here until june . " the 58-year-old hitzfeld is a legend in his own time , the only coach ever to have won the champions league with two different clubs .
but his tactics have come in for criticism from some bayern potentates - most prominently chairman karl-heinz rummenigge - and his current spell in munich has n't lived up to expectations . disappointing returns bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : hitzfeld won the champions league with both dortmund and bayern hitzfeld was brought in last season to replace felix magath - the man who succeeded him at the end of his previous bayern tenure in 2004 .
but hitzfeld was unable to get munich back into the top three last year , and his won-lost record was much the same as his predecessor 's . that was supposed to change this season , after bayern went on a club-record spending spree to bring in stars like miroslav klose , franck ribery and luca toni .
bayern currently top the table but are level on points with bremen , a club with nowhere near munich 's financial resources . and bayern 's fortunes in the league are slipping .
the team scored only a single goal in their last three bundesliga matches in december - hardly a satisfactory return on summer investments topping 70 million euros -lrb- $ 100 million -rrb- . a team of two halves bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : hoeneß was one of hitzfeld 's few remaining allies in munich the squad is rumored to be split into a german faction around klose and a foreign one around ribery and toni , neither of whom seem particularly keen on learning the language of the country where they 're employed . and hitzfeld has failed to get very much out of young stars like bastian schweinsteiger and lukas podolski .
meanwhile veterans like valerian ismael and willy sagnol have left the club or said publicly that they 'd like to . there 's no clear indication of who might succeed hitzfeld , but dutch national coach marco van basten is rumored to have been put up for discussion . meanwhile , hitzfeld could take over as the national coach of his second-home , switzerland , or become a television commentator . dw staff -lrb- jc -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

it 's the worst figure in over a decade , and another sign of the increasing perils of the profession . the report said the most dangerous part of the world for reporters was iraq , where 47 journalists were killed there last year - all but one were iraqis .
somalia was a distant second on the list with eight journalists killed . the report also pointed out that 207 media workers had died in iraq since the us-led invasion in 2003 , making it the deadliest recent conflict for journalists . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : over 100 journalists have been killed in iraq since the us-led war began there in in 2003 " no country has ever seen more journalists killed than iraq , " reporters without borders said .
" -lsb- that 's -rsb- more than in the vietnam war , the fighting in ex-yugoslavia , the massacres in algeria or the rwandan genocide . " the list includes only clearly work-related deaths .
the paris-based press freedom organization said 103 journalists were killed in 1994 , nearly half of them in rwanda . a separate report released wednesday , jan .
2 , by the international federation of journalists put the overall toll much higher , listing 171 journalists and other media workers killed by violence or in accidents throughout the year .

only in germany would police arrest a dog .
but arrest a collie they did , for a major canine " faux-paw : " trying to get a free ride on one of the country 's most treasured modes of transport . lovers of law and order that they are , germans just could n't have it that a dog would dare to ride the train without a ticket .
so , police arrested the rollicky collie near the central city of kassel . but rather than be angry , kassel cops were amused by the dog 's antics .
police said the collie jumped aboard the passenger rail-car at a stop in hümme , a tiny town near kassel , in the state of hesse . nabbing the collie bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : then again , some collies look clever enough to make a dash for the train the train driver , luckily , was adept at multi-tasking and managed to grab the canine beast and tie it up to his seat .

by 2020 , seven of the world ’ s ten most populated cities will be located in asia alone .
in an effort to provide an adequate infrastructure for asia ’ s mega cities , german companies play a major role . in 2004 , hyderabad , the capital of the indian state of andhra pradesh , had 3.5 million inhabitants , not including the outskirts .
and the city continues to grow , explains german transport planner christopher walther : “ gigantic suburbs are emerging - massive economic zones which develop into towns .
over the last two years , we 've been able to see that the city has grown unbelievably fast .
“ walther works for ptv ag - a transportation planning firm based in southern germany .
the firm 's 700 employees develop innovative transport solutions .
in hyderabad , this means setting up systems , including online ones , for dealing with traffic and urbanisation-related problems .
urban planning but the question is whether it is even possible to plan considering the uncontrollably rapid pace of growth .
this goes for infrastructure in several asian cities .
according to the un 's estimates , over six billion people will be living in cities by 2050 - the equivalent of today 's global population .
half of them will be living in asian cities , says franz marré from the german ministry for economic cooperation and development who paints a frightening picture of the future based on today 's reality : “ the cities are collapsing .
the health indicators show this clearly .
two out of three children have respiratory diseases caused by pollution . ”
he also points out at the problem of growing slums .
“ in asia , 600 million people live in slums .
this figure is growing fast and disproportionately . ”
the asian development bank estimates that 60 billion us dollars a year will have to be invested into the basic infrastructure of asia 's rapidly growing cities .
this offers many investment possibilities to german companies , especially in areas such as water and power supply and waste disposal and management .
german initiatives german development institutions and the asian development bank have founded the ‘ cities development initiative for asia ’ , or cdia .
as hannes cassens from the german international development agency gtz points out , many cities find it difficult to implement an urban development plan : “ usually there might be something saying new bus networks have to be set up by 2010 but that 's not enough to get any funding from banks .
so the cities can turn to the cdia and apply for funding and advice .
we then provide our experts who go to the cities and help them improve local transport or set up a waste disposal system and so on .
so the plan is broken down into concrete projects . ”
social and ecological criteria determine whether a city might be considered by the cdia as an important investment .
for german companies , which often have a good chance of winning the contracts , the emerging mega-cities represent a huge market . dw staff send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic audios and videos on the topic germany helps solve problems of asian mega cities 9799 kashmir the indian security forces have arrested kashmir separatist leader syed ali shah geelani prof. javeed alam , expert on kashmir talks about the impact of the arrest on the kashmir issue september asia quiz quiz of the month pakistan floods in pakistan click here to find out more about pakistan 's flood situation and relief work .

he also points out at the problem of growing slums .
“ in asia , 600 million people live in slums .
this figure is growing fast and disproportionately . ”
the asian development bank estimates that 60 billion us dollars a year will have to be invested into the basic infrastructure of asia 's rapidly growing cities .
this offers many investment possibilities to german companies , especially in areas such as water and power supply and waste disposal and management .
german initiatives german development institutions and the asian development bank have founded the ‘ cities development initiative for asia ’ , or cdia .
as hannes cassens from the german international development agency gtz points out , many cities find it difficult to implement an urban development plan : “ usually there might be something saying new bus networks have to be set up by 2010 but that 's not enough to get any funding from banks .
so the cities can turn to the cdia and apply for funding and advice .
we then provide our experts who go to the cities and help them improve local transport or set up a waste disposal system and so on .
so the plan is broken down into concrete projects . ”
social and ecological criteria determine whether a city might be considered by the cdia as an important investment .
for german companies , which often have a good chance of winning the contracts , the emerging mega-cities represent a huge market . dw staff send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic audios and videos on the topic germany helps solve problems of asian mega cities 9798 reader response feedback our readers and asia compact listeners love to send in their views .

the presidential election in kenya - one of africa 's richest and most stable countries - has set the nation aflame .
hundreds of people have been killed in the clashes between president kibaki 's supporters and those of opposition candidate raila odinga .
all of the independent sources and reports , including those of a european union observer mission led by germany 's alexander graf lambsdorff , say very clearly : state powers pulled the necessary votes out of a hat to prevent a victory for odinga .
kenya has never really been home to a democracy . " germany 's süddeutsche zeitung commented on how the international community is dealing with the situation .
" as many rulers there have learned , in africa it does n't matter how election results come about ; the primary thing is that they are recognized internationally … that the united states has now - due to the violent protests in kenya - back-pedaled and , along with great britain , is demanding an independent investigation into the vote-counting may be embarrassing for president george w. bush 's administration , but it is not yet threatening to kibaki . " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : eu election observer head graf lambsdorff noted " extreme discrepencies " in vote-counting " but , what is perfectly clear is that the situation is so explosive that the country is now faced with its most crucial test since its independence .
every western country that seriously believes in democracy for africa is required to do everything it can to help deescalate the situation .
part of that is creating powerful scare tactics both for kibaki as well as for odinga .
any country , however , which recognizes the results of this election is contributing to the escalation , " the paper said . the german daily tageszeitung -lrb- taz -rrb- examined the context behind the violence in kenya .
" when kenyans voted for mwai kibaki five years ago , he promised to put an end to corruption and the state 's arbitrary ways and was celebrated like a pop star as a result .
nowadays , he ca n't even venture out on the street without fearing for his life … so , one ca n't really hold it against the kenyans that they feel betrayed … they wanted to vote him out of office , but were not allowed to do so .
frustration can particularly be felt among young unemployed people , whose last shimmer of hope has been stripped away .
while one may not agree with their actions , they 're understandable in such a context . " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : violence also broke out in nairobi 's slums vienna 's der standard commented that kibaki , through presumed vote-rigging , wanted to prevent a switch of power to the younger generation .
" kibaki , who during his first election presented himself as a champion of democracy , has dispelled his own powers of enchantment .
and he has shown more loyalty to his friends in the so-called ' mount kenya mafia ' than to his citizens .
kibaki , also a former finance minister and vice president , has been in politics for ages .
now he is trying to prevent the dissolution of his generation , which has anchored itself in the administration and economy since independence in 1963 and unscrupulously enriched itself .
but kenyans wanted the exact opposite , as shown in all the opinion polls before the election .

the announcement was hardly a surprise considering bayern 's recent struggles . " i informed the club about my decision to leave this summer three weeks ago , " hitzfeld told the german sports news agency sid on wednesday , jan .
2 .
" but i 'll still be trying to win as many titles as possible in the next half-year . " earlier bayern commercial manager uli hoeneß had offered a typically gruff remark to the daily bild newspaper . " you 'd be safe to assume that -lsb- hitzfeld -rsb- will not be staying , " hoeneß said .
" but he will be here until june . " the 58-year-old hitzfeld is a legend in his own time , the only coach ever to have won the champions league with two different clubs .
but his tactics have come in for criticism from some bayern potentates - most prominently chairman karl-heinz rummenigge - and his current spell in munich has n't lived up to expectations . disappointing returns bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : hitzfeld won the champions league with both dortmund and bayern hitzfeld was brought in last season to replace felix magath - the man who succeeded him at the end of his previous bayern tenure in 2004 .
but hitzfeld was unable to get munich back into the top three last year , and his won-lost record was much the same as his predecessor 's . that was supposed to change this season , after bayern went on a club-record spending spree to bring in stars like miroslav klose , franck ribery and luca toni .
bayern currently top the table but are level on points with bremen , a club with nowhere near munich 's financial resources . and bayern 's fortunes in the league are slipping .
the team scored only a single goal in their last three bundesliga matches in december - hardly a satisfactory return on summer investments topping 70 million euros -lrb- $ 100 million -rrb- . a team of two halves bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : hoeneß was one of hitzfeld 's few remaining allies in munich the squad is rumored to be split into a german faction around klose and a foreign one around ribery and toni , neither of whom seem particularly keen on learning the language of the country where they 're employed . and hitzfeld has failed to get very much out of young stars like bastian schweinsteiger and lukas podolski .
meanwhile veterans like valerian ismael and willy sagnol have left the club or said publicly that they 'd like to . there 's no clear indication of who might succeed hitzfeld , but dutch national coach marco van basten is rumored to have been put up for discussion . meanwhile , hitzfeld could take over as the national coach of his second-home , switzerland , or become a television commentator . dw staff -lrb- jc -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

visitors to the city on the mersey river are confronted with beatlemania as soon as they arrive at the airport , which is named after john lennon . indeed , for many years , most visitors were drawn to liverpool due to the beatles ' fame .
" people all over the world have heard of this place , " tour guide phil hughes told dpa news agency . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the fab four remain the most famous musicians in the world the musical history alone could be reason enough to deem liverpool a " european capital of culture " in 2008 .

even american music stars such as chuck berry and bo diddley once played there . beatles ' fame not enough " the beatles legacy certainly helped the city , but that alone was n't all we wanted to show the world , " said paul newman , spokesman for the liverpool culture company .
the company has been the hub for the transformation of the seaport in northwestern england that was not long ago an example of urban decay . decades ago , liverpool was rutted in unemployment and a sense of hopelessness far longer than other industrial regions . the shipyards had been shut down , followed by massive redundancies in the region 's manufacturing sector . in the 1980s , british prime minister margaret thatcher introduced sweeping reforms throughout the country , but liverpool missed the boat . bildunterschrift : liverpool 's wealth now stems from culture rather than shipping pragmatism and economic expertise ultimately helped liverpool citizens to pull themselves up by the boot straps .
but culture also played a big part in the transformation of the city , with cultural institutions receiving massive financial support . " it brought us out of the crisis , " newman told dpa . " investing in art and culture was the right thing to do , especially during a very difficult period . " capitalizing on culture now , liverpool is second only to london in its vast array of cultural events , including an annual modern art fair , galleries with free admission , theater and concerts at the philharmonic hall . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the tate liverpool gallery at albert dock liverpool is also europe 's biggest building site .
cranes will dot the skyline throughout the year of culture in 2008 and longer , as the regeneration of entire districts is planned for well into 2010 . meanwhile , tourists can enjoy the sight of the " liver bird " - a cross between a cormorant , a griffin and an eagle that is the city 's mascot .
in addition to resting atop the liver building , the bird can also be seen on the jerseys of the city 's world-renowned soccer team . slavery history exposed a lively spot for tourists is the historic harbor area called albert dock .
the dock has undergone extensive renovation after years of neglect , with the waterfront district hosting everything from the " tate liverpool " - home of the national collection of modern art in the north of england and the largest gallery of modern and contemporary art outside london - to shops , cafes and the international slavery museum . the museum addresses liverpool 's history as the prime shipment point for " human cargo " between africa and america - a trade that contributed to the city 's former enormous wealth . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : a beatles ' creation : st. pepper 's lonely hearts club band though the slave trade was banned in britain in 1807 , a debate broke out about the issue last year .

essen will be one in 2010 : a european capital of culture .
this year , the english city of liverpool shares the title with the norwegian town of stavanger . " love me do " could be the anthem of this british town known most famously as home to the fab four .
visitors to the city on the mersey river are confronted with beatlemania as soon as they arrive at the airport , which is named after john lennon . indeed , for many years , most visitors were drawn to liverpool due to the beatles ' fame .
" people all over the world have heard of this place , " tour guide phil hughes told dpa news agency . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the fab four remain the most famous musicians in the world the musical history alone could be reason enough to deem liverpool a " european capital of culture " in 2008 .
after all , other british music greats - the rolling stones , the kinks and the who among them - got their start in the cavern club in mathew street .
even american music stars such as chuck berry and bo diddley once played there . beatles ' fame not enough " the beatles legacy certainly helped the city , but that alone was n't all we wanted to show the world , " said paul newman , spokesman for the liverpool culture company .
the company has been the hub for the transformation of the seaport in northwestern england that was not long ago an example of urban decay . decades ago , liverpool was rutted in unemployment and a sense of hopelessness far longer than other industrial regions . the shipyards had been shut down , followed by massive redundancies in the region 's manufacturing sector . in the 1980s , british prime minister margaret thatcher introduced sweeping reforms throughout the country , but liverpool missed the boat . bildunterschrift : liverpool 's wealth now stems from culture rather than shipping pragmatism and economic expertise ultimately helped liverpool citizens to pull themselves up by the boot straps .
but culture also played a big part in the transformation of the city , with cultural institutions receiving massive financial support . " it brought us out of the crisis , " newman told dpa . " investing in art and culture was the right thing to do , especially during a very difficult period . " capitalizing on culture now , liverpool is second only to london in its vast array of cultural events , including an annual modern art fair , galleries with free admission , theater and concerts at the philharmonic hall . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the tate liverpool gallery at albert dock liverpool is also europe 's biggest building site .
cranes will dot the skyline throughout the year of culture in 2008 and longer , as the regeneration of entire districts is planned for well into 2010 . meanwhile , tourists can enjoy the sight of the " liver bird " - a cross between a cormorant , a griffin and an eagle that is the city 's mascot .
in addition to resting atop the liver building , the bird can also be seen on the jerseys of the city 's world-renowned soccer team . slavery history exposed a lively spot for tourists is the historic harbor area called albert dock .
the dock has undergone extensive renovation after years of neglect , with the waterfront district hosting everything from the " tate liverpool " - home of the national collection of modern art in the north of england and the largest gallery of modern and contemporary art outside london - to shops , cafes and the international slavery museum . the museum addresses liverpool 's history as the prime shipment point for " human cargo " between africa and america - a trade that contributed to the city 's former enormous wealth . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : a beatles ' creation : st. pepper 's lonely hearts club band though the slave trade was banned in britain in 1807 , a debate broke out about the issue last year .
penny lane , located in the harbor district and which a beatles song helped make one of the city 's most famous , was named after ship-owner james penny . mr. penny 's ships transported enslaved africans to britain 's colonies in america hundreds of years ago . last year , a local councilman proposed renaming the street , but many citizens protested , including liverpool 's black community , who spoke out against what they called the " silliness " of the matter . back on the map whether it 's exploring liverpool 's history as a " gateway to the world , " its rich architectural legacy or the haunts of rock ' n ' roll stars , visitors will find plenty to do in the city . and , if they 're still not satisfied , they can attend any of the more than 300 cultural events planned for 2008 , some led by such stellar liverpudlian sons as former beatles paul mccartney and ringo starr , as well as conductor sir simon rattle , who will take his berlin philharmonic to his hometown to perform . dw staff -lrb- als -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

internationally , the country takes second place - behind china . germany 's flourishing economy , the largest in europe , got a further boost in the new year with the publishing of a survey giving the country glowing marks for its competitiveness . in a study commissioned by german business daily handelsblatt , 59 percent of the 1,200 leading executives in europe polled rated germany 's competitiveness as " very good " or " good . " on a scale of one to five , they gave germany an average rate of 2.3 points , with one being the best possible score . in 2003 , only 13 percent of top executives surveyed in a similar poll in europe , shared such an optimistic outlook for germany .

their share climbed from 20 percent in 2005 to 53 percent in 2007 , the paper said , adding it reflected a vote of confidence in the ability of german companies to profit from a global upswing thanks to their booming exports .

" employment will further rise in 2008 , " germany 's federal labor office said on wednesday , jan 2 , a day before official labor market figures were released for the month of december , 2007 . less than two years after spiking to 5 million , germany 's number of jobless fell in november to 3.278 million people .

germany shared second place with switzerland . more foreign investors " the german economy has continually become more competitive in the past years thanks in particular to companies , but also thanks to parties negotiating collective wage agreements and politics , " said bert rürup , chairman of the " council of wise men " - five highly regarded academics who advise the government on economic policy . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : germany 's booming exports have helped it to profit from a global upswing german companies have consistently restructured and together with the unions negotiated moderate and flexible wage agreements , rürup told newspaper , handelsblatt . the daily reported that a further sign for economic revival lay in the fact that for the first time foreign investors own a majority share in germany 's top 30 publicly traded companies .

" employment will further rise in 2008 , " germany 's federal labor office said on wednesday , jan 2 , a day before official labor market figures were released for the month of december , 2007 . less than two years after spiking to 5 million , germany 's number of jobless fell in november to 3.278 million people .

in november , a government report had predicted a drop in germany 's economic growth , slipping from a forecasted 2.6 percent in 2007 to 1.9 percent in 2008 . in an interview with berliner zeitung , dihk president ludwig georg braun said he was confident that 300,000 jobs could be created in 2008 despite the slight slowdown in gross domestic product growth .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de extremism -pipe- 02.01.2008 eu says ready to help pakistan fight extremism großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : kouchner laid a wreath at the spot where benazir bhutto was assassinated the eu has offered pakistan help in investigating the assassination of benazir bhutto , with scotland yard sending a team of police to lead the inquiry .
but european and us politicians say a un probe is n't necessary . french foreign minister bernhard kouchner said on wednesday , jan .
2 , that he was speaking formally on behalf of the 27-member bloc when he offered pakistan help in combating extremism and probing the killing of opposition leader benazir bhutto . kouchner was the first high-ranking foreign official to visit pakistan since the killing of bhutto , in a gun and bomb attack after a campaign rally last week . kouchner rules out un probe " today we proposed to president musharraf to provide french or european experts , " kouchner said after meeting the pakistani leader in rawalpindi , the garrison city where bhutto , 54 , was slain . " mr. musharraf responded that the idea was interesting . " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : bhutto in a photo taken in october 2007 koucher , however , stressed that he saw little prospect of a united nations investigation into bhutto 's killing .
officials in washington also said a un investigation into bhutto 's death was unnecessary . bhutto 's pakistan people 's party -lrb- ppp -rrb- had called for a probe similar to that into the death in 2005 of former lebanese premier rafiq hariri , where an international court in the hague will try suspects . " if you are talking about a group of international experts , why not , we will be happy to contribute , " kouchner told reporters in islamabad .
" if , though , you 're asking for an international investigation in the un sense of the term , there are conditions which , unfortunately , are not so easy to fulfill . " kouchner said a un investigation commission presupposes the involvement of a third party or country . " in the case of hariri , the presumption was that another country was implicated , whereas here , we ca n't say that with any clarity , " the french minister said .
" as a consequence , unless un rules were suddenly rewritten , it would appear to me to be difficult . " musharraf asks for british help pakistani government officials have so far rejected calls for an international investigation into bhutto 's killing .
but on wednesday , pervez musharraf said he had asked british police for help in the investigation into the assassination . " i am grateful to prime minister brown that ... he accepted my request , " musharraf said in a televised address to the nation , referring to british prime minister gordon brown . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : musharraf said scotland yard will help in the probe " this team will come immediately and will assist our team in the investigation , " musharraf added .
" i hope these investigations would be done properly with scotland yard and remove all doubts . " though musharraf 's administration has said that local groups linked to al qaeda were behind the assassination , bhutto 's party accuses the government of covering up events surrounding her death . eu eager to fight extremism kouchner also handed over a letter from french president nicolas sarkozy which he said expressed his country 's solidarity with pakistan in the wake of the " horrible crime . " he said the letter also underlined sarkozy 's " support for what must be democratic efforts in the continuation of the election process as well as the fight against terrorism and extremism . " koucher said his visit came specifically at the request of slovenia , which took over the rotating eu presidency on jan .
1 . " bhutto was assassinated by an extremism that we , france and the european union , have decided to fight , " he said .
" it would not be surprising if it was islamist terrorism since i know that it makes its bed in the tribal zone of pakistan . " election delayed pakistan 's election commission on wednesday postponed the general elections by six weeks , to feb .
18 , saying polling was not possible on the original date of jan .
8 because of disturbances following bhutto 's murder . the decision has been criticized by opposition parties .

but european and us politicians say a un probe is n't necessary . french foreign minister bernhard kouchner said on wednesday , jan .
2 , that he was speaking formally on behalf of the 27-member bloc when he offered pakistan help in combating extremism and probing the killing of opposition leader benazir bhutto . kouchner was the first high-ranking foreign official to visit pakistan since the killing of bhutto , in a gun and bomb attack after a campaign rally last week . kouchner rules out un probe " today we proposed to president musharraf to provide french or european experts , " kouchner said after meeting the pakistani leader in rawalpindi , the garrison city where bhutto , 54 , was slain . " mr. musharraf responded that the idea was interesting . " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : bhutto in a photo taken in october 2007 koucher , however , stressed that he saw little prospect of a united nations investigation into bhutto 's killing .
officials in washington also said a un investigation into bhutto 's death was unnecessary . bhutto 's pakistan people 's party -lrb- ppp -rrb- had called for a probe similar to that into the death in 2005 of former lebanese premier rafiq hariri , where an international court in the hague will try suspects . " if you are talking about a group of international experts , why not , we will be happy to contribute , " kouchner told reporters in islamabad .
" if , though , you 're asking for an international investigation in the un sense of the term , there are conditions which , unfortunately , are not so easy to fulfill . " kouchner said a un investigation commission presupposes the involvement of a third party or country . " in the case of hariri , the presumption was that another country was implicated , whereas here , we ca n't say that with any clarity , " the french minister said .
" as a consequence , unless un rules were suddenly rewritten , it would appear to me to be difficult . " musharraf asks for british help pakistani government officials have so far rejected calls for an international investigation into bhutto 's killing .
but on wednesday , pervez musharraf said he had asked british police for help in the investigation into the assassination . " i am grateful to prime minister brown that ... he accepted my request , " musharraf said in a televised address to the nation , referring to british prime minister gordon brown . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : musharraf said scotland yard will help in the probe " this team will come immediately and will assist our team in the investigation , " musharraf added .
" i hope these investigations would be done properly with scotland yard and remove all doubts . " though musharraf 's administration has said that local groups linked to al qaeda were behind the assassination , bhutto 's party accuses the government of covering up events surrounding her death . eu eager to fight extremism kouchner also handed over a letter from french president nicolas sarkozy which he said expressed his country 's solidarity with pakistan in the wake of the " horrible crime . " he said the letter also underlined sarkozy 's " support for what must be democratic efforts in the continuation of the election process as well as the fight against terrorism and extremism . " koucher said his visit came specifically at the request of slovenia , which took over the rotating eu presidency on jan .

internationally , the country takes second place - behind china . germany 's flourishing economy , the largest in europe , got a further boost in the new year with the publishing of a survey giving the country glowing marks for its competitiveness . in a study commissioned by german business daily handelsblatt , 59 percent of the 1,200 leading executives in europe polled rated germany 's competitiveness as " very good " or " good . " on a scale of one to five , they gave germany an average rate of 2.3 points , with one being the best possible score . in 2003 , only 13 percent of top executives surveyed in a similar poll in europe , shared such an optimistic outlook for germany .
since then , germany 's image has risen in the eyes of europe 's executive by 1 percent each year . on an international scale , only china is considered more competitive by european managers .
germany shared second place with switzerland . more foreign investors " the german economy has continually become more competitive in the past years thanks in particular to companies , but also thanks to parties negotiating collective wage agreements and politics , " said bert rürup , chairman of the " council of wise men " - five highly regarded academics who advise the government on economic policy . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : germany 's booming exports have helped it to profit from a global upswing german companies have consistently restructured and together with the unions negotiated moderate and flexible wage agreements , rürup told newspaper , handelsblatt . the daily reported that a further sign for economic revival lay in the fact that for the first time foreign investors own a majority share in germany 's top 30 publicly traded companies .
their share climbed from 20 percent in 2005 to 53 percent in 2007 , the paper said , adding it reflected a vote of confidence in the ability of german companies to profit from a global upswing thanks to their booming exports . " that shows - in the eyes of foreign investors - how competitive german companies have become , but also that there 's mistrust towards the dollar , " rürup said . good news for the labor market the good news from the survey was further bolstered by predictions that a decline in germany 's jobless total last year would continue in the new year despite recent signs of weakening economic growth . " employment will further rise in 2008 , " germany 's federal labor office said on wednesday , jan 2 , a day before official labor market figures were released for the month of december , 2007 . less than two years after spiking to 5 million , germany 's number of jobless fell in november to 3.278 million people .
it 's the lowest level in 15 years , according to figures released by the federal labor office earlier in december . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : economics minister glos is less optimistic than some financial institutes germany 's chambers of industry and commerce -lsb- dikh -rsb- also said german economic growth will slow only slightly in 2008 and will still expand by more than 2 percent . but german economics minister michael glos said wednesday that he anticipated growth to continue at a slower pace .
in an interview with the mass-market bild newspaper , he added that he anticipated economic expansion to come in at just under 2 percent . germany emerged from a protracted period of stagnation in 2006 to report a growth rate of 2.9 percent with the economy expected to post an expansion rate last year of about 2.6 percent .
in november , a government report had predicted a drop in germany 's economic growth , slipping from a forecasted 2.6 percent in 2007 to 1.9 percent in 2008 . in an interview with berliner zeitung , dihk president ludwig georg braun said he was confident that 300,000 jobs could be created in 2008 despite the slight slowdown in gross domestic product growth .

german carmaker audi announced on wednesday that it intended to hire 800 additional engineers in 2008 . braun said that the optimism was due more to strong worldwide economic growth rather than to political decisions made in germany .
he added he was concerned about a worsening in the shortage of highly skilled workers . " that 's where political and industry leaders need to work together to change that , " he said .

internationally , the country takes second place - behind china . germany 's flourishing economy , the largest in europe , got a further boost in the new year with the publishing of a survey giving the country glowing marks for its competitiveness . in a study commissioned by german business daily handelsblatt , 59 percent of the 1,200 leading executives in europe polled rated germany 's competitiveness as " very good " or " good . " on a scale of one to five , they gave germany an average rate of 2.3 points , with one being the best possible score . in 2003 , only 13 percent of top executives surveyed in a similar poll in europe , shared such an optimistic outlook for germany .
since then , germany 's image has risen in the eyes of europe 's executive by 1 percent each year . on an international scale , only china is considered more competitive by european managers .
germany shared second place with switzerland . more foreign investors " the german economy has continually become more competitive in the past years thanks in particular to companies , but also thanks to parties negotiating collective wage agreements and politics , " said bert rürup , chairman of the " council of wise men " - five highly regarded academics who advise the government on economic policy . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : germany 's booming exports have helped it to profit from a global upswing german companies have consistently restructured and together with the unions negotiated moderate and flexible wage agreements , rürup told newspaper , handelsblatt . the daily reported that a further sign for economic revival lay in the fact that for the first time foreign investors own a majority share in germany 's top 30 publicly traded companies .
their share climbed from 20 percent in 2005 to 53 percent in 2007 , the paper said , adding it reflected a vote of confidence in the ability of german companies to profit from a global upswing thanks to their booming exports . " that shows - in the eyes of foreign investors - how competitive german companies have become , but also that there 's mistrust towards the dollar , " rürup said . good news for the labor market the good news from the survey was further bolstered by predictions that a decline in germany 's jobless total last year would continue in the new year despite recent signs of weakening economic growth . " employment will further rise in 2008 , " germany 's federal labor office said on wednesday , jan 2 , a day before official labor market figures were released for the month of december , 2007 . less than two years after spiking to 5 million , germany 's number of jobless fell in november to 3.278 million people .
it 's the lowest level in 15 years , according to figures released by the federal labor office earlier in december . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : economics minister glos is less optimistic than some financial institutes germany 's chambers of industry and commerce -lsb- dikh -rsb- also said german economic growth will slow only slightly in 2008 and will still expand by more than 2 percent . but german economics minister michael glos said wednesday that he anticipated growth to continue at a slower pace .
in an interview with the mass-market bild newspaper , he added that he anticipated economic expansion to come in at just under 2 percent . germany emerged from a protracted period of stagnation in 2006 to report a growth rate of 2.9 percent with the economy expected to post an expansion rate last year of about 2.6 percent .
in november , a government report had predicted a drop in germany 's economic growth , slipping from a forecasted 2.6 percent in 2007 to 1.9 percent in 2008 . in an interview with berliner zeitung , dihk president ludwig georg braun said he was confident that 300,000 jobs could be created in 2008 despite the slight slowdown in gross domestic product growth . " the economy will slow only slightly in 2008 but the companies ' expectations remain good , " he said . shortage of highly skilled workers bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the dip in germany 's jobless rate is expected to continue in 2008 despite the flood of positive predictions , experts warn that germany 's labor market will not be able to maintain its current good form throughout 2008 .
german carmaker audi announced on wednesday that it intended to hire 800 additional engineers in 2008 . braun said that the optimism was due more to strong worldwide economic growth rather than to political decisions made in germany .
he added he was concerned about a worsening in the shortage of highly skilled workers . " that 's where political and industry leaders need to work together to change that , " he said .
" we need better training but also we need to open the country more to highly qualified foreign workers . " dw staff -lrb- sp -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de economy -pipe- 02.01.2008 top european executives praise german economy großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : germany 's economic upswing , boosted by falling jobless numbers , is expected to continue a survey of top managers and executives from six eu nations has found that germany tops the list of most competitive economies in europe .
internationally , the country takes second place - behind china . germany 's flourishing economy , the largest in europe , got a further boost in the new year with the publishing of a survey giving the country glowing marks for its competitiveness . in a study commissioned by german business daily handelsblatt , 59 percent of the 1,200 leading executives in europe polled rated germany 's competitiveness as " very good " or " good . " on a scale of one to five , they gave germany an average rate of 2.3 points , with one being the best possible score . in 2003 , only 13 percent of top executives surveyed in a similar poll in europe , shared such an optimistic outlook for germany .
since then , germany 's image has risen in the eyes of europe 's executive by 1 percent each year . on an international scale , only china is considered more competitive by european managers .
germany shared second place with switzerland . more foreign investors " the german economy has continually become more competitive in the past years thanks in particular to companies , but also thanks to parties negotiating collective wage agreements and politics , " said bert rürup , chairman of the " council of wise men " - five highly regarded academics who advise the government on economic policy . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : germany 's booming exports have helped it to profit from a global upswing german companies have consistently restructured and together with the unions negotiated moderate and flexible wage agreements , rürup told newspaper , handelsblatt . the daily reported that a further sign for economic revival lay in the fact that for the first time foreign investors own a majority share in germany 's top 30 publicly traded companies .
their share climbed from 20 percent in 2005 to 53 percent in 2007 , the paper said , adding it reflected a vote of confidence in the ability of german companies to profit from a global upswing thanks to their booming exports . " that shows - in the eyes of foreign investors - how competitive german companies have become , but also that there 's mistrust towards the dollar , " rürup said . good news for the labor market the good news from the survey was further bolstered by predictions that a decline in germany 's jobless total last year would continue in the new year despite recent signs of weakening economic growth . " employment will further rise in 2008 , " germany 's federal labor office said on wednesday , jan 2 , a day before official labor market figures were released for the month of december , 2007 . less than two years after spiking to 5 million , germany 's number of jobless fell in november to 3.278 million people .
it 's the lowest level in 15 years , according to figures released by the federal labor office earlier in december . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : economics minister glos is less optimistic than some financial institutes germany 's chambers of industry and commerce -lsb- dikh -rsb- also said german economic growth will slow only slightly in 2008 and will still expand by more than 2 percent . but german economics minister michael glos said wednesday that he anticipated growth to continue at a slower pace .
in an interview with the mass-market bild newspaper , he added that he anticipated economic expansion to come in at just under 2 percent . germany emerged from a protracted period of stagnation in 2006 to report a growth rate of 2.9 percent with the economy expected to post an expansion rate last year of about 2.6 percent .
in november , a government report had predicted a drop in germany 's economic growth , slipping from a forecasted 2.6 percent in 2007 to 1.9 percent in 2008 . in an interview with berliner zeitung , dihk president ludwig georg braun said he was confident that 300,000 jobs could be created in 2008 despite the slight slowdown in gross domestic product growth . " the economy will slow only slightly in 2008 but the companies ' expectations remain good , " he said . shortage of highly skilled workers bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the dip in germany 's jobless rate is expected to continue in 2008 despite the flood of positive predictions , experts warn that germany 's labor market will not be able to maintain its current good form throughout 2008 .
german carmaker audi announced on wednesday that it intended to hire 800 additional engineers in 2008 . braun said that the optimism was due more to strong worldwide economic growth rather than to political decisions made in germany .
he added he was concerned about a worsening in the shortage of highly skilled workers . " that 's where political and industry leaders need to work together to change that , " he said .

bayern currently top the table but are level on points with bremen , a club with nowhere near munich 's financial resources . and bayern 's fortunes in the league are slipping .

so , police arrested the rollicky collie near the central city of kassel . but rather than be angry , kassel cops were amused by the dog 's antics .
police said the collie jumped aboard the passenger rail-car at a stop in hümme , a tiny town near kassel , in the state of hesse . nabbing the collie bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : then again , some collies look clever enough to make a dash for the train the train driver , luckily , was adept at multi-tasking and managed to grab the canine beast and tie it up to his seat .
police in kassel later placed the dog in the city pound . the dog also committed a second big no-no in the german handbook of responsible living : not registering his identity to city officials . " it not only did n't have a ticket , " police told dpa .
" it did n't have an ownership tag either . " the kassel cops were still impressed by the scoundrel , though .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de economy -pipe- 02.01.2008 top european executives praise german economy großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : germany 's economic upswing , boosted by falling jobless numbers , is expected to continue a survey of top managers and executives from six eu nations has found that germany tops the list of most competitive economies in europe .
internationally , the country takes second place - behind china . germany 's flourishing economy , the largest in europe , got a further boost in the new year with the publishing of a survey giving the country glowing marks for its competitiveness . in a study commissioned by german business daily handelsblatt , 59 percent of the 1,200 leading executives in europe polled rated germany 's competitiveness as " very good " or " good . " on a scale of one to five , they gave germany an average rate of 2.3 points , with one being the best possible score . in 2003 , only 13 percent of top executives surveyed in a similar poll in europe , shared such an optimistic outlook for germany .
since then , germany 's image has risen in the eyes of europe 's executive by 1 percent each year . on an international scale , only china is considered more competitive by european managers .
germany shared second place with switzerland . more foreign investors " the german economy has continually become more competitive in the past years thanks in particular to companies , but also thanks to parties negotiating collective wage agreements and politics , " said bert rürup , chairman of the " council of wise men " - five highly regarded academics who advise the government on economic policy . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : germany 's booming exports have helped it to profit from a global upswing german companies have consistently restructured and together with the unions negotiated moderate and flexible wage agreements , rürup told newspaper , handelsblatt . the daily reported that a further sign for economic revival lay in the fact that for the first time foreign investors own a majority share in germany 's top 30 publicly traded companies .
their share climbed from 20 percent in 2005 to 53 percent in 2007 , the paper said , adding it reflected a vote of confidence in the ability of german companies to profit from a global upswing thanks to their booming exports . " that shows - in the eyes of foreign investors - how competitive german companies have become , but also that there 's mistrust towards the dollar , " rürup said . good news for the labor market the good news from the survey was further bolstered by predictions that a decline in germany 's jobless total last year would continue in the new year despite recent signs of weakening economic growth . " employment will further rise in 2008 , " germany 's federal labor office said on wednesday , jan 2 , a day before official labor market figures were released for the month of december , 2007 . less than two years after spiking to 5 million , germany 's number of jobless fell in november to 3.278 million people .
it 's the lowest level in 15 years , according to figures released by the federal labor office earlier in december . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : economics minister glos is less optimistic than some financial institutes germany 's chambers of industry and commerce -lsb- dikh -rsb- also said german economic growth will slow only slightly in 2008 and will still expand by more than 2 percent . but german economics minister michael glos said wednesday that he anticipated growth to continue at a slower pace .
in an interview with the mass-market bild newspaper , he added that he anticipated economic expansion to come in at just under 2 percent . germany emerged from a protracted period of stagnation in 2006 to report a growth rate of 2.9 percent with the economy expected to post an expansion rate last year of about 2.6 percent .
in november , a government report had predicted a drop in germany 's economic growth , slipping from a forecasted 2.6 percent in 2007 to 1.9 percent in 2008 . in an interview with berliner zeitung , dihk president ludwig georg braun said he was confident that 300,000 jobs could be created in 2008 despite the slight slowdown in gross domestic product growth . " the economy will slow only slightly in 2008 but the companies ' expectations remain good , " he said . shortage of highly skilled workers bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the dip in germany 's jobless rate is expected to continue in 2008 despite the flood of positive predictions , experts warn that germany 's labor market will not be able to maintain its current good form throughout 2008 .
german carmaker audi announced on wednesday that it intended to hire 800 additional engineers in 2008 . braun said that the optimism was due more to strong worldwide economic growth rather than to political decisions made in germany .

essen will be one in 2010 : a european capital of culture .
this year , the english city of liverpool shares the title with the norwegian town of stavanger . " love me do " could be the anthem of this british town known most famously as home to the fab four .
visitors to the city on the mersey river are confronted with beatlemania as soon as they arrive at the airport , which is named after john lennon . indeed , for many years , most visitors were drawn to liverpool due to the beatles ' fame .
" people all over the world have heard of this place , " tour guide phil hughes told dpa news agency . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the fab four remain the most famous musicians in the world the musical history alone could be reason enough to deem liverpool a " european capital of culture " in 2008 .
after all , other british music greats - the rolling stones , the kinks and the who among them - got their start in the cavern club in mathew street .
even american music stars such as chuck berry and bo diddley once played there . beatles ' fame not enough " the beatles legacy certainly helped the city , but that alone was n't all we wanted to show the world , " said paul newman , spokesman for the liverpool culture company .
the company has been the hub for the transformation of the seaport in northwestern england that was not long ago an example of urban decay . decades ago , liverpool was rutted in unemployment and a sense of hopelessness far longer than other industrial regions . the shipyards had been shut down , followed by massive redundancies in the region 's manufacturing sector . in the 1980s , british prime minister margaret thatcher introduced sweeping reforms throughout the country , but liverpool missed the boat . bildunterschrift : liverpool 's wealth now stems from culture rather than shipping pragmatism and economic expertise ultimately helped liverpool citizens to pull themselves up by the boot straps .
but culture also played a big part in the transformation of the city , with cultural institutions receiving massive financial support . " it brought us out of the crisis , " newman told dpa . " investing in art and culture was the right thing to do , especially during a very difficult period . " capitalizing on culture now , liverpool is second only to london in its vast array of cultural events , including an annual modern art fair , galleries with free admission , theater and concerts at the philharmonic hall . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the tate liverpool gallery at albert dock liverpool is also europe 's biggest building site .
cranes will dot the skyline throughout the year of culture in 2008 and longer , as the regeneration of entire districts is planned for well into 2010 . meanwhile , tourists can enjoy the sight of the " liver bird " - a cross between a cormorant , a griffin and an eagle that is the city 's mascot .
in addition to resting atop the liver building , the bird can also be seen on the jerseys of the city 's world-renowned soccer team . slavery history exposed a lively spot for tourists is the historic harbor area called albert dock .
the dock has undergone extensive renovation after years of neglect , with the waterfront district hosting everything from the " tate liverpool " - home of the national collection of modern art in the north of england and the largest gallery of modern and contemporary art outside london - to shops , cafes and the international slavery museum . the museum addresses liverpool 's history as the prime shipment point for " human cargo " between africa and america - a trade that contributed to the city 's former enormous wealth . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : a beatles ' creation : st. pepper 's lonely hearts club band though the slave trade was banned in britain in 1807 , a debate broke out about the issue last year .
penny lane , located in the harbor district and which a beatles song helped make one of the city 's most famous , was named after ship-owner james penny . mr. penny 's ships transported enslaved africans to britain 's colonies in america hundreds of years ago . last year , a local councilman proposed renaming the street , but many citizens protested , including liverpool 's black community , who spoke out against what they called the " silliness " of the matter . back on the map whether it 's exploring liverpool 's history as a " gateway to the world , " its rich architectural legacy or the haunts of rock ' n ' roll stars , visitors will find plenty to do in the city . and , if they 're still not satisfied , they can attend any of the more than 300 cultural events planned for 2008 , some led by such stellar liverpudlian sons as former beatles paul mccartney and ringo starr , as well as conductor sir simon rattle , who will take his berlin philharmonic to his hometown to perform . dw staff -lrb- als -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

but that was before a 17-year-old greek national and a 20-year-old turkish national brutally attacked a pensioner who asked them to stop smoking in a munich subway station .
the pre-christmas attack prompted a national debate about how to deal with youth violence - particulary when the offenders are of non-german origin .
spotting a prime election opportunity , hesse 's embattled christian democrat state premier , roland koch , is now trying to pre-empt the social democrat 's minimum wage campaign by launching a broadside against crime perpetrated by young foreigners .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : according to cdu politicians , around half of germany 's young offenders are foreigners " we have too many criminal foreigner juveniles in germany , " koch said .
" in the name of multi-cultural tolerance , we 've been blinded to accept behavior that can lead to dangerous aggression .
we 've got to put an end to the grand delusion . "
on wednesday , koch will meet with his interior minister to discuss a new anti-crime campaign for the january 27 election .
spd fights back the social democrat leader in hesse , andrea ypsilanti , has hit back at koch , telling the süddeutsche zeitung newspaper : " he 's leading a dirty campaign again … that 's his style . "
other spd leaders have accused koch of trying to score points by stirring anti-foreigner sentiment - a sensitive issue in germany .
vice chancellor frank-walter steinmeier said it showed that koch " was nervous " about losing the election to the social democrats .
" herr koch , why do n't you come up with some concrete ideas on integration instead of whipping the people up against each other ? "
steinmeier asked .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : roland koch is fighting to maintain his majority in hesse koch was once considered a rising star in the cdu , but lately , polls have showed him slipping and possibly in danger of losing his absolute majority .
the election in hesse is one of four regional ballots in 2008 in cdu-controlled states .
the spd said it would be a victory to take power in one of the four , and considers hesse one of its best shots .
the spd had decided to make minimum wage its main issue for the election .
polls show most germans are in favor of introducing a minimum wage , but koch and his party are against it .
send delinquents to boot camp , cdu says in the wake of the munich subway attack , conservative politicians have called for a host of tougher punishments for young offenders , including a " warning arrest " of several weeks and the establishment of us-style private correctional " boot camps . "
leading cdu politician wolfgang bosbach said that a period spent at boot camp could be " most effective " as many young offenders do n't see being released on probation as punishment .
federal justice minister brigitte zypries -lrb- spd -rrb- has sharply criticized the discussion .

now he is trying to prevent the dissolution of his generation , which has anchored itself in the administration and economy since independence in 1963 and unscrupulously enriched itself .

some called for sanctions ; others noted the feeling of betrayal among the people . britain 's financial times took a hard stance toward the announced victory of kenya 's president mwai kibaki .
" kibaki must know that his government is illegitimate .
if he refuses to accept that , then western powers should halt aid programs and instead , use the money for emergency aid and provide it as well to the african union for it to use for a firm intervention .
visas should be denied not only to corrupt civil servants , but also to kibaki and his entire government team .
if odinga and his circle are caught stoking violence , then the same sanctions must also be applied to them .
whatever occurs , the outside world must prepare for the worst and , at the same time , fervently pray that both sides will come to their senses .

the presidential election in kenya - one of africa 's richest and most stable countries - has set the nation aflame .
hundreds of people have been killed in the clashes between president kibaki 's supporters and those of opposition candidate raila odinga .
all of the independent sources and reports , including those of a european union observer mission led by germany 's alexander graf lambsdorff , say very clearly : state powers pulled the necessary votes out of a hat to prevent a victory for odinga .

the announcement was hardly a surprise considering bayern 's recent struggles . " i informed the club about my decision to leave this summer three weeks ago , " hitzfeld told the german sports news agency sid on wednesday , jan .
2 .
" but i 'll still be trying to win as many titles as possible in the next half-year . " earlier bayern commercial manager uli hoeneß had offered a typically gruff remark to the daily bild newspaper . " you 'd be safe to assume that -lsb- hitzfeld -rsb- will not be staying , " hoeneß said .
" but he will be here until june . " the 58-year-old hitzfeld is a legend in his own time , the only coach ever to have won the champions league with two different clubs .
but his tactics have come in for criticism from some bayern potentates - most prominently chairman karl-heinz rummenigge - and his current spell in munich has n't lived up to expectations . disappointing returns bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : hitzfeld won the champions league with both dortmund and bayern hitzfeld was brought in last season to replace felix magath - the man who succeeded him at the end of his previous bayern tenure in 2004 .
but hitzfeld was unable to get munich back into the top three last year , and his won-lost record was much the same as his predecessor 's . that was supposed to change this season , after bayern went on a club-record spending spree to bring in stars like miroslav klose , franck ribery and luca toni .
bayern currently top the table but are level on points with bremen , a club with nowhere near munich 's financial resources . and bayern 's fortunes in the league are slipping .
the team scored only a single goal in their last three bundesliga matches in december - hardly a satisfactory return on summer investments topping 70 million euros -lrb- $ 100 million -rrb- . a team of two halves bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : hoeneß was one of hitzfeld 's few remaining allies in munich the squad is rumored to be split into a german faction around klose and a foreign one around ribery and toni , neither of whom seem particularly keen on learning the language of the country where they 're employed . and hitzfeld has failed to get very much out of young stars like bastian schweinsteiger and lukas podolski .
meanwhile veterans like valerian ismael and willy sagnol have left the club or said publicly that they 'd like to . there 's no clear indication of who might succeed hitzfeld , but dutch national coach marco van basten is rumored to have been put up for discussion . meanwhile , hitzfeld could take over as the national coach of his second-home , switzerland , or become a television commentator . dw staff -lrb- jc -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

but european and us politicians say a un probe is n't necessary . french foreign minister bernhard kouchner said on wednesday , jan .
2 , that he was speaking formally on behalf of the 27-member bloc when he offered pakistan help in combating extremism and probing the killing of opposition leader benazir bhutto . kouchner was the first high-ranking foreign official to visit pakistan since the killing of bhutto , in a gun and bomb attack after a campaign rally last week . kouchner rules out un probe " today we proposed to president musharraf to provide french or european experts , " kouchner said after meeting the pakistani leader in rawalpindi , the garrison city where bhutto , 54 , was slain . " mr. musharraf responded that the idea was interesting . " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : bhutto in a photo taken in october 2007 koucher , however , stressed that he saw little prospect of a united nations investigation into bhutto 's killing .
officials in washington also said a un investigation into bhutto 's death was unnecessary . bhutto 's pakistan people 's party -lrb- ppp -rrb- had called for a probe similar to that into the death in 2005 of former lebanese premier rafiq hariri , where an international court in the hague will try suspects . " if you are talking about a group of international experts , why not , we will be happy to contribute , " kouchner told reporters in islamabad .
" if , though , you 're asking for an international investigation in the un sense of the term , there are conditions which , unfortunately , are not so easy to fulfill . " kouchner said a un investigation commission presupposes the involvement of a third party or country . " in the case of hariri , the presumption was that another country was implicated , whereas here , we ca n't say that with any clarity , " the french minister said .
" as a consequence , unless un rules were suddenly rewritten , it would appear to me to be difficult . " musharraf asks for british help pakistani government officials have so far rejected calls for an international investigation into bhutto 's killing .
but on wednesday , pervez musharraf said he had asked british police for help in the investigation into the assassination . " i am grateful to prime minister brown that ... he accepted my request , " musharraf said in a televised address to the nation , referring to british prime minister gordon brown . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : musharraf said scotland yard will help in the probe " this team will come immediately and will assist our team in the investigation , " musharraf added .
" i hope these investigations would be done properly with scotland yard and remove all doubts . " though musharraf 's administration has said that local groups linked to al qaeda were behind the assassination , bhutto 's party accuses the government of covering up events surrounding her death . eu eager to fight extremism kouchner also handed over a letter from french president nicolas sarkozy which he said expressed his country 's solidarity with pakistan in the wake of the " horrible crime . " he said the letter also underlined sarkozy 's " support for what must be democratic efforts in the continuation of the election process as well as the fight against terrorism and extremism . " koucher said his visit came specifically at the request of slovenia , which took over the rotating eu presidency on jan .
1 . " bhutto was assassinated by an extremism that we , france and the european union , have decided to fight , " he said .
" it would not be surprising if it was islamist terrorism since i know that it makes its bed in the tribal zone of pakistan . " election delayed pakistan 's election commission on wednesday postponed the general elections by six weeks , to feb .

8 because of disturbances following bhutto 's murder . the decision has been criticized by opposition parties .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de economy -pipe- 02.01.2008 top european executives praise german economy großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : germany 's economic upswing , boosted by falling jobless numbers , is expected to continue a survey of top managers and executives from six eu nations has found that germany tops the list of most competitive economies in europe .
internationally , the country takes second place - behind china . germany 's flourishing economy , the largest in europe , got a further boost in the new year with the publishing of a survey giving the country glowing marks for its competitiveness . in a study commissioned by german business daily handelsblatt , 59 percent of the 1,200 leading executives in europe polled rated germany 's competitiveness as " very good " or " good . " on a scale of one to five , they gave germany an average rate of 2.3 points , with one being the best possible score . in 2003 , only 13 percent of top executives surveyed in a similar poll in europe , shared such an optimistic outlook for germany .
since then , germany 's image has risen in the eyes of europe 's executive by 1 percent each year . on an international scale , only china is considered more competitive by european managers .
germany shared second place with switzerland . more foreign investors " the german economy has continually become more competitive in the past years thanks in particular to companies , but also thanks to parties negotiating collective wage agreements and politics , " said bert rürup , chairman of the " council of wise men " - five highly regarded academics who advise the government on economic policy . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : germany 's booming exports have helped it to profit from a global upswing german companies have consistently restructured and together with the unions negotiated moderate and flexible wage agreements , rürup told newspaper , handelsblatt . the daily reported that a further sign for economic revival lay in the fact that for the first time foreign investors own a majority share in germany 's top 30 publicly traded companies .
their share climbed from 20 percent in 2005 to 53 percent in 2007 , the paper said , adding it reflected a vote of confidence in the ability of german companies to profit from a global upswing thanks to their booming exports . " that shows - in the eyes of foreign investors - how competitive german companies have become , but also that there 's mistrust towards the dollar , " rürup said . good news for the labor market the good news from the survey was further bolstered by predictions that a decline in germany 's jobless total last year would continue in the new year despite recent signs of weakening economic growth . " employment will further rise in 2008 , " germany 's federal labor office said on wednesday , jan 2 , a day before official labor market figures were released for the month of december , 2007 . less than two years after spiking to 5 million , germany 's number of jobless fell in november to 3.278 million people .
it 's the lowest level in 15 years , according to figures released by the federal labor office earlier in december . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : economics minister glos is less optimistic than some financial institutes germany 's chambers of industry and commerce -lsb- dikh -rsb- also said german economic growth will slow only slightly in 2008 and will still expand by more than 2 percent . but german economics minister michael glos said wednesday that he anticipated growth to continue at a slower pace .
in an interview with the mass-market bild newspaper , he added that he anticipated economic expansion to come in at just under 2 percent . germany emerged from a protracted period of stagnation in 2006 to report a growth rate of 2.9 percent with the economy expected to post an expansion rate last year of about 2.6 percent .
in november , a government report had predicted a drop in germany 's economic growth , slipping from a forecasted 2.6 percent in 2007 to 1.9 percent in 2008 . in an interview with berliner zeitung , dihk president ludwig georg braun said he was confident that 300,000 jobs could be created in 2008 despite the slight slowdown in gross domestic product growth . " the economy will slow only slightly in 2008 but the companies ' expectations remain good , " he said . shortage of highly skilled workers bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the dip in germany 's jobless rate is expected to continue in 2008 despite the flood of positive predictions , experts warn that germany 's labor market will not be able to maintain its current good form throughout 2008 .
german carmaker audi announced on wednesday that it intended to hire 800 additional engineers in 2008 . braun said that the optimism was due more to strong worldwide economic growth rather than to political decisions made in germany .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de extremism -pipe- 02.01.2008 eu says ready to help pakistan fight extremism großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : kouchner laid a wreath at the spot where benazir bhutto was assassinated the eu has offered pakistan help in investigating the assassination of benazir bhutto , with scotland yard sending a team of police to lead the inquiry .
but european and us politicians say a un probe is n't necessary . french foreign minister bernhard kouchner said on wednesday , jan .
2 , that he was speaking formally on behalf of the 27-member bloc when he offered pakistan help in combating extremism and probing the killing of opposition leader benazir bhutto . kouchner was the first high-ranking foreign official to visit pakistan since the killing of bhutto , in a gun and bomb attack after a campaign rally last week . kouchner rules out un probe " today we proposed to president musharraf to provide french or european experts , " kouchner said after meeting the pakistani leader in rawalpindi , the garrison city where bhutto , 54 , was slain . " mr. musharraf responded that the idea was interesting . " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : bhutto in a photo taken in october 2007 koucher , however , stressed that he saw little prospect of a united nations investigation into bhutto 's killing .
officials in washington also said a un investigation into bhutto 's death was unnecessary . bhutto 's pakistan people 's party -lrb- ppp -rrb- had called for a probe similar to that into the death in 2005 of former lebanese premier rafiq hariri , where an international court in the hague will try suspects . " if you are talking about a group of international experts , why not , we will be happy to contribute , " kouchner told reporters in islamabad .
" if , though , you 're asking for an international investigation in the un sense of the term , there are conditions which , unfortunately , are not so easy to fulfill . " kouchner said a un investigation commission presupposes the involvement of a third party or country . " in the case of hariri , the presumption was that another country was implicated , whereas here , we ca n't say that with any clarity , " the french minister said .
" as a consequence , unless un rules were suddenly rewritten , it would appear to me to be difficult . " musharraf asks for british help pakistani government officials have so far rejected calls for an international investigation into bhutto 's killing .
but on wednesday , pervez musharraf said he had asked british police for help in the investigation into the assassination . " i am grateful to prime minister brown that ... he accepted my request , " musharraf said in a televised address to the nation , referring to british prime minister gordon brown . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : musharraf said scotland yard will help in the probe " this team will come immediately and will assist our team in the investigation , " musharraf added .
" i hope these investigations would be done properly with scotland yard and remove all doubts . " though musharraf 's administration has said that local groups linked to al qaeda were behind the assassination , bhutto 's party accuses the government of covering up events surrounding her death . eu eager to fight extremism kouchner also handed over a letter from french president nicolas sarkozy which he said expressed his country 's solidarity with pakistan in the wake of the " horrible crime . " he said the letter also underlined sarkozy 's " support for what must be democratic efforts in the continuation of the election process as well as the fight against terrorism and extremism . " koucher said his visit came specifically at the request of slovenia , which took over the rotating eu presidency on jan .
1 . " bhutto was assassinated by an extremism that we , france and the european union , have decided to fight , " he said .
" it would not be surprising if it was islamist terrorism since i know that it makes its bed in the tribal zone of pakistan . " election delayed pakistan 's election commission on wednesday postponed the general elections by six weeks , to feb .
18 , saying polling was not possible on the original date of jan .
8 because of disturbances following bhutto 's murder . the decision has been criticized by opposition parties .
they say the delay will benefit beleaguered musharraf and his ruling party , the pakistan muslim league-q . they also say a delay could provoke more unrest and violence . dw staff -lrb- sp -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

officials in washington also said a un investigation into bhutto 's death was unnecessary . bhutto 's pakistan people 's party -lrb- ppp -rrb- had called for a probe similar to that into the death in 2005 of former lebanese premier rafiq hariri , where an international court in the hague will try suspects .

" as a consequence , unless un rules were suddenly rewritten , it would appear to me to be difficult . " musharraf asks for british help pakistani government officials have so far rejected calls for an international investigation into bhutto 's killing .
but on wednesday , pervez musharraf said he had asked british police for help in the investigation into the assassination .

" though musharraf 's administration has said that local groups linked to al qaeda were behind the assassination , bhutto 's party accuses the government of covering up events surrounding her death . eu eager to fight extremism kouchner also handed over a letter from french president nicolas sarkozy which he said expressed his country 's solidarity with pakistan in the wake of the " horrible crime . " he said the letter also underlined sarkozy 's " support for what must be democratic efforts in the continuation of the election process as well as the fight against terrorism and extremism .

the presidential election in kenya - one of africa 's richest and most stable countries - has set the nation aflame .
hundreds of people have been killed in the clashes between president kibaki 's supporters and those of opposition candidate raila odinga .
all of the independent sources and reports , including those of a european union observer mission led by germany 's alexander graf lambsdorff , say very clearly : state powers pulled the necessary votes out of a hat to prevent a victory for odinga .
kenya has never really been home to a democracy . " germany 's süddeutsche zeitung commented on how the international community is dealing with the situation .
" as many rulers there have learned , in africa it does n't matter how election results come about ; the primary thing is that they are recognized internationally … that the united states has now - due to the violent protests in kenya - back-pedaled and , along with great britain , is demanding an independent investigation into the vote-counting may be embarrassing for president george w. bush 's administration , but it is not yet threatening to kibaki . " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : eu election observer head graf lambsdorff noted " extreme discrepencies " in vote-counting " but , what is perfectly clear is that the situation is so explosive that the country is now faced with its most crucial test since its independence .
every western country that seriously believes in democracy for africa is required to do everything it can to help deescalate the situation .
part of that is creating powerful scare tactics both for kibaki as well as for odinga .
any country , however , which recognizes the results of this election is contributing to the escalation , " the paper said . the german daily tageszeitung -lrb- taz -rrb- examined the context behind the violence in kenya .
" when kenyans voted for mwai kibaki five years ago , he promised to put an end to corruption and the state 's arbitrary ways and was celebrated like a pop star as a result .
nowadays , he ca n't even venture out on the street without fearing for his life … so , one ca n't really hold it against the kenyans that they feel betrayed … they wanted to vote him out of office , but were not allowed to do so .
frustration can particularly be felt among young unemployed people , whose last shimmer of hope has been stripped away .
while one may not agree with their actions , they 're understandable in such a context . " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : violence also broke out in nairobi 's slums vienna 's der standard commented that kibaki , through presumed vote-rigging , wanted to prevent a switch of power to the younger generation .
" kibaki , who during his first election presented himself as a champion of democracy , has dispelled his own powers of enchantment .
and he has shown more loyalty to his friends in the so-called ' mount kenya mafia ' than to his citizens .
kibaki , also a former finance minister and vice president , has been in politics for ages .
now he is trying to prevent the dissolution of his generation , which has anchored itself in the administration and economy since independence in 1963 and unscrupulously enriched itself .
but kenyans wanted the exact opposite , as shown in all the opinion polls before the election .

some called for sanctions ; others noted the feeling of betrayal among the people . britain 's financial times took a hard stance toward the announced victory of kenya 's president mwai kibaki .
" kibaki must know that his government is illegitimate .
if he refuses to accept that , then western powers should halt aid programs and instead , use the money for emergency aid and provide it as well to the african union for it to use for a firm intervention .
visas should be denied not only to corrupt civil servants , but also to kibaki and his entire government team .
if odinga and his circle are caught stoking violence , then the same sanctions must also be applied to them .
whatever occurs , the outside world must prepare for the worst and , at the same time , fervently pray that both sides will come to their senses . " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : locals in front of a church where 46 people were trapped and killed tuesday spain 's el pais wrote : " seldom is something so obtuse and so lucid at the same time .
the presidential election in kenya - one of africa 's richest and most stable countries - has set the nation aflame .
hundreds of people have been killed in the clashes between president kibaki 's supporters and those of opposition candidate raila odinga .
all of the independent sources and reports , including those of a european union observer mission led by germany 's alexander graf lambsdorff , say very clearly : state powers pulled the necessary votes out of a hat to prevent a victory for odinga .
kenya has never really been home to a democracy . " germany 's süddeutsche zeitung commented on how the international community is dealing with the situation .
" as many rulers there have learned , in africa it does n't matter how election results come about ; the primary thing is that they are recognized internationally … that the united states has now - due to the violent protests in kenya - back-pedaled and , along with great britain , is demanding an independent investigation into the vote-counting may be embarrassing for president george w. bush 's administration , but it is not yet threatening to kibaki . " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : eu election observer head graf lambsdorff noted " extreme discrepencies " in vote-counting " but , what is perfectly clear is that the situation is so explosive that the country is now faced with its most crucial test since its independence .
every western country that seriously believes in democracy for africa is required to do everything it can to help deescalate the situation .
part of that is creating powerful scare tactics both for kibaki as well as for odinga .
any country , however , which recognizes the results of this election is contributing to the escalation , " the paper said . the german daily tageszeitung -lrb- taz -rrb- examined the context behind the violence in kenya .
" when kenyans voted for mwai kibaki five years ago , he promised to put an end to corruption and the state 's arbitrary ways and was celebrated like a pop star as a result .
nowadays , he ca n't even venture out on the street without fearing for his life … so , one ca n't really hold it against the kenyans that they feel betrayed … they wanted to vote him out of office , but were not allowed to do so .
frustration can particularly be felt among young unemployed people , whose last shimmer of hope has been stripped away .
while one may not agree with their actions , they 're understandable in such a context . " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : violence also broke out in nairobi 's slums vienna 's der standard commented that kibaki , through presumed vote-rigging , wanted to prevent a switch of power to the younger generation .
" kibaki , who during his first election presented himself as a champion of democracy , has dispelled his own powers of enchantment .
and he has shown more loyalty to his friends in the so-called ' mount kenya mafia ' than to his citizens .
kibaki , also a former finance minister and vice president , has been in politics for ages .
now he is trying to prevent the dissolution of his generation , which has anchored itself in the administration and economy since independence in 1963 and unscrupulously enriched itself .
but kenyans wanted the exact opposite , as shown in all the opinion polls before the election .

the announcement was hardly a surprise considering bayern 's recent struggles . " i informed the club about my decision to leave this summer three weeks ago , " hitzfeld told the german sports news agency sid on wednesday , jan .
2 .
" but i 'll still be trying to win as many titles as possible in the next half-year . " earlier bayern commercial manager uli hoeneß had offered a typically gruff remark to the daily bild newspaper . " you 'd be safe to assume that -lsb- hitzfeld -rsb- will not be staying , " hoeneß said .
" but he will be here until june . " the 58-year-old hitzfeld is a legend in his own time , the only coach ever to have won the champions league with two different clubs .
but his tactics have come in for criticism from some bayern potentates - most prominently chairman karl-heinz rummenigge - and his current spell in munich has n't lived up to expectations . disappointing returns bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : hitzfeld won the champions league with both dortmund and bayern hitzfeld was brought in last season to replace felix magath - the man who succeeded him at the end of his previous bayern tenure in 2004 .
but hitzfeld was unable to get munich back into the top three last year , and his won-lost record was much the same as his predecessor 's . that was supposed to change this season , after bayern went on a club-record spending spree to bring in stars like miroslav klose , franck ribery and luca toni .
bayern currently top the table but are level on points with bremen , a club with nowhere near munich 's financial resources . and bayern 's fortunes in the league are slipping .
the team scored only a single goal in their last three bundesliga matches in december - hardly a satisfactory return on summer investments topping 70 million euros -lrb- $ 100 million -rrb- . a team of two halves bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : hoeneß was one of hitzfeld 's few remaining allies in munich the squad is rumored to be split into a german faction around klose and a foreign one around ribery and toni , neither of whom seem particularly keen on learning the language of the country where they 're employed . and hitzfeld has failed to get very much out of young stars like bastian schweinsteiger and lukas podolski .
meanwhile veterans like valerian ismael and willy sagnol have left the club or said publicly that they 'd like to . there 's no clear indication of who might succeed hitzfeld , but dutch national coach marco van basten is rumored to have been put up for discussion . meanwhile , hitzfeld could take over as the national coach of his second-home , switzerland , or become a television commentator . dw staff -lrb- jc -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?
dw-world.de world class stars aiding bundesliga 's rehabilitation when bayern munich bought some of the world 's most wanted players , it looked like game over .
but those who rushed to crown bayern before a ball was even kicked forgot that the league already had its own superstars .

some called for sanctions ; others noted the feeling of betrayal among the people . britain 's financial times took a hard stance toward the announced victory of kenya 's president mwai kibaki .
" kibaki must know that his government is illegitimate .
if he refuses to accept that , then western powers should halt aid programs and instead , use the money for emergency aid and provide it as well to the african union for it to use for a firm intervention .
visas should be denied not only to corrupt civil servants , but also to kibaki and his entire government team .
if odinga and his circle are caught stoking violence , then the same sanctions must also be applied to them .
whatever occurs , the outside world must prepare for the worst and , at the same time , fervently pray that both sides will come to their senses . " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : locals in front of a church where 46 people were trapped and killed tuesday spain 's el pais wrote : " seldom is something so obtuse and so lucid at the same time .
the presidential election in kenya - one of africa 's richest and most stable countries - has set the nation aflame .
hundreds of people have been killed in the clashes between president kibaki 's supporters and those of opposition candidate raila odinga .
all of the independent sources and reports , including those of a european union observer mission led by germany 's alexander graf lambsdorff , say very clearly : state powers pulled the necessary votes out of a hat to prevent a victory for odinga .
kenya has never really been home to a democracy . " germany 's süddeutsche zeitung commented on how the international community is dealing with the situation .
" as many rulers there have learned , in africa it does n't matter how election results come about ; the primary thing is that they are recognized internationally … that the united states has now - due to the violent protests in kenya - back-pedaled and , along with great britain , is demanding an independent investigation into the vote-counting may be embarrassing for president george w. bush 's administration , but it is not yet threatening to kibaki . " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : eu election observer head graf lambsdorff noted " extreme discrepencies " in vote-counting " but , what is perfectly clear is that the situation is so explosive that the country is now faced with its most crucial test since its independence .
every western country that seriously believes in democracy for africa is required to do everything it can to help deescalate the situation .
part of that is creating powerful scare tactics both for kibaki as well as for odinga .
any country , however , which recognizes the results of this election is contributing to the escalation , " the paper said . the german daily tageszeitung -lrb- taz -rrb- examined the context behind the violence in kenya .
" when kenyans voted for mwai kibaki five years ago , he promised to put an end to corruption and the state 's arbitrary ways and was celebrated like a pop star as a result .
nowadays , he ca n't even venture out on the street without fearing for his life … so , one ca n't really hold it against the kenyans that they feel betrayed … they wanted to vote him out of office , but were not allowed to do so .
frustration can particularly be felt among young unemployed people , whose last shimmer of hope has been stripped away .
while one may not agree with their actions , they 're understandable in such a context . " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : violence also broke out in nairobi 's slums vienna 's der standard commented that kibaki , through presumed vote-rigging , wanted to prevent a switch of power to the younger generation .
" kibaki , who during his first election presented himself as a champion of democracy , has dispelled his own powers of enchantment .
and he has shown more loyalty to his friends in the so-called ' mount kenya mafia ' than to his citizens .
kibaki , also a former finance minister and vice president , has been in politics for ages .
now he is trying to prevent the dissolution of his generation , which has anchored itself in the administration and economy since independence in 1963 and unscrupulously enriched itself .

" as a consequence , unless un rules were suddenly rewritten , it would appear to me to be difficult . " musharraf asks for british help pakistani government officials have so far rejected calls for an international investigation into bhutto 's killing .
but on wednesday , pervez musharraf said he had asked british police for help in the investigation into the assassination .

but that was before a 17-year-old greek national and a 20-year-old turkish national brutally attacked a pensioner who asked them to stop smoking in a munich subway station .
the pre-christmas attack prompted a national debate about how to deal with youth violence - particulary when the offenders are of non-german origin .
spotting a prime election opportunity , hesse 's embattled christian democrat state premier , roland koch , is now trying to pre-empt the social democrat 's minimum wage campaign by launching a broadside against crime perpetrated by young foreigners .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : according to cdu politicians , around half of germany 's young offenders are foreigners " we have too many criminal foreigner juveniles in germany , " koch said .
" in the name of multi-cultural tolerance , we 've been blinded to accept behavior that can lead to dangerous aggression .
we 've got to put an end to the grand delusion . "
on wednesday , koch will meet with his interior minister to discuss a new anti-crime campaign for the january 27 election .
spd fights back the social democrat leader in hesse , andrea ypsilanti , has hit back at koch , telling the süddeutsche zeitung newspaper : " he 's leading a dirty campaign again … that 's his style . "
other spd leaders have accused koch of trying to score points by stirring anti-foreigner sentiment - a sensitive issue in germany .
vice chancellor frank-walter steinmeier said it showed that koch " was nervous " about losing the election to the social democrats .
" herr koch , why do n't you come up with some concrete ideas on integration instead of whipping the people up against each other ? "
steinmeier asked .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : roland koch is fighting to maintain his majority in hesse koch was once considered a rising star in the cdu , but lately , polls have showed him slipping and possibly in danger of losing his absolute majority .
the election in hesse is one of four regional ballots in 2008 in cdu-controlled states .
the spd said it would be a victory to take power in one of the four , and considers hesse one of its best shots .
the spd had decided to make minimum wage its main issue for the election .
polls show most germans are in favor of introducing a minimum wage , but koch and his party are against it .
send delinquents to boot camp , cdu says in the wake of the munich subway attack , conservative politicians have called for a host of tougher punishments for young offenders , including a " warning arrest " of several weeks and the establishment of us-style private correctional " boot camps . "
leading cdu politician wolfgang bosbach said that a period spent at boot camp could be " most effective " as many young offenders do n't see being released on probation as punishment .
federal justice minister brigitte zypries -lrb- spd -rrb- has sharply criticized the discussion .
" so-called ' boot camps ' in which young people are meant to be humiliated and subjected to drills are in no way compatible with human dignity , " zypries said . dw staff -lrb- dc -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : according to cdu politicians , around half of germany 's young offenders are foreigners " we have too many criminal foreigner juveniles in germany , " koch said .
" in the name of multi-cultural tolerance , we 've been blinded to accept behavior that can lead to dangerous aggression .
we 've got to put an end to the grand delusion . "
on wednesday , koch will meet with his interior minister to discuss a new anti-crime campaign for the january 27 election .
spd fights back the social democrat leader in hesse , andrea ypsilanti , has hit back at koch , telling the süddeutsche zeitung newspaper : " he 's leading a dirty campaign again … that 's his style . "
other spd leaders have accused koch of trying to score points by stirring anti-foreigner sentiment - a sensitive issue in germany .
vice chancellor frank-walter steinmeier said it showed that koch " was nervous " about losing the election to the social democrats .
" herr koch , why do n't you come up with some concrete ideas on integration instead of whipping the people up against each other ? "
steinmeier asked .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de economy -pipe- 02.01.2008 top european executives praise german economy großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : germany 's economic upswing , boosted by falling jobless numbers , is expected to continue a survey of top managers and executives from six eu nations has found that germany tops the list of most competitive economies in europe .
internationally , the country takes second place - behind china . germany 's flourishing economy , the largest in europe , got a further boost in the new year with the publishing of a survey giving the country glowing marks for its competitiveness . in a study commissioned by german business daily handelsblatt , 59 percent of the 1,200 leading executives in europe polled rated germany 's competitiveness as " very good " or " good . " on a scale of one to five , they gave germany an average rate of 2.3 points , with one being the best possible score . in 2003 , only 13 percent of top executives surveyed in a similar poll in europe , shared such an optimistic outlook for germany .
since then , germany 's image has risen in the eyes of europe 's executive by 1 percent each year . on an international scale , only china is considered more competitive by european managers .
germany shared second place with switzerland . more foreign investors " the german economy has continually become more competitive in the past years thanks in particular to companies , but also thanks to parties negotiating collective wage agreements and politics , " said bert rürup , chairman of the " council of wise men " - five highly regarded academics who advise the government on economic policy . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : germany 's booming exports have helped it to profit from a global upswing german companies have consistently restructured and together with the unions negotiated moderate and flexible wage agreements , rürup told newspaper , handelsblatt . the daily reported that a further sign for economic revival lay in the fact that for the first time foreign investors own a majority share in germany 's top 30 publicly traded companies .
their share climbed from 20 percent in 2005 to 53 percent in 2007 , the paper said , adding it reflected a vote of confidence in the ability of german companies to profit from a global upswing thanks to their booming exports . " that shows - in the eyes of foreign investors - how competitive german companies have become , but also that there 's mistrust towards the dollar , " rürup said . good news for the labor market the good news from the survey was further bolstered by predictions that a decline in germany 's jobless total last year would continue in the new year despite recent signs of weakening economic growth . " employment will further rise in 2008 , " germany 's federal labor office said on wednesday , jan 2 , a day before official labor market figures were released for the month of december , 2007 . less than two years after spiking to 5 million , germany 's number of jobless fell in november to 3.278 million people .
it 's the lowest level in 15 years , according to figures released by the federal labor office earlier in december . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : economics minister glos is less optimistic than some financial institutes germany 's chambers of industry and commerce -lsb- dikh -rsb- also said german economic growth will slow only slightly in 2008 and will still expand by more than 2 percent . but german economics minister michael glos said wednesday that he anticipated growth to continue at a slower pace .
in an interview with the mass-market bild newspaper , he added that he anticipated economic expansion to come in at just under 2 percent . germany emerged from a protracted period of stagnation in 2006 to report a growth rate of 2.9 percent with the economy expected to post an expansion rate last year of about 2.6 percent .
in november , a government report had predicted a drop in germany 's economic growth , slipping from a forecasted 2.6 percent in 2007 to 1.9 percent in 2008 . in an interview with berliner zeitung , dihk president ludwig georg braun said he was confident that 300,000 jobs could be created in 2008 despite the slight slowdown in gross domestic product growth . " the economy will slow only slightly in 2008 but the companies ' expectations remain good , " he said . shortage of highly skilled workers bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the dip in germany 's jobless rate is expected to continue in 2008 despite the flood of positive predictions , experts warn that germany 's labor market will not be able to maintain its current good form throughout 2008 .
german carmaker audi announced on wednesday that it intended to hire 800 additional engineers in 2008 . braun said that the optimism was due more to strong worldwide economic growth rather than to political decisions made in germany .
he added he was concerned about a worsening in the shortage of highly skilled workers . " that 's where political and industry leaders need to work together to change that , " he said .
" we need better training but also we need to open the country more to highly qualified foreign workers . " dw staff -lrb- sp -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?
dw-world.de merkel says fight against unemployment a major goal in 2008 in her annual new year 's speech , german chancellor angela merkel warned of " big risks " to economic growth , but vowed that europe 's largest economy would stay on its reform path to combat unemployment .

their share climbed from 20 percent in 2005 to 53 percent in 2007 , the paper said , adding it reflected a vote of confidence in the ability of german companies to profit from a global upswing thanks to their booming exports .

internationally , the country takes second place - behind china . germany 's flourishing economy , the largest in europe , got a further boost in the new year with the publishing of a survey giving the country glowing marks for its competitiveness . in a study commissioned by german business daily handelsblatt , 59 percent of the 1,200 leading executives in europe polled rated germany 's competitiveness as " very good " or " good . " on a scale of one to five , they gave germany an average rate of 2.3 points , with one being the best possible score . in 2003 , only 13 percent of top executives surveyed in a similar poll in europe , shared such an optimistic outlook for germany .
since then , germany 's image has risen in the eyes of europe 's executive by 1 percent each year . on an international scale , only china is considered more competitive by european managers .
germany shared second place with switzerland . more foreign investors " the german economy has continually become more competitive in the past years thanks in particular to companies , but also thanks to parties negotiating collective wage agreements and politics , " said bert rürup , chairman of the " council of wise men " - five highly regarded academics who advise the government on economic policy . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : germany 's booming exports have helped it to profit from a global upswing german companies have consistently restructured and together with the unions negotiated moderate and flexible wage agreements , rürup told newspaper , handelsblatt . the daily reported that a further sign for economic revival lay in the fact that for the first time foreign investors own a majority share in germany 's top 30 publicly traded companies .
their share climbed from 20 percent in 2005 to 53 percent in 2007 , the paper said , adding it reflected a vote of confidence in the ability of german companies to profit from a global upswing thanks to their booming exports . " that shows - in the eyes of foreign investors - how competitive german companies have become , but also that there 's mistrust towards the dollar , " rürup said . good news for the labor market the good news from the survey was further bolstered by predictions that a decline in germany 's jobless total last year would continue in the new year despite recent signs of weakening economic growth . " employment will further rise in 2008 , " germany 's federal labor office said on wednesday , jan 2 , a day before official labor market figures were released for the month of december , 2007 . less than two years after spiking to 5 million , germany 's number of jobless fell in november to 3.278 million people .
it 's the lowest level in 15 years , according to figures released by the federal labor office earlier in december . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : economics minister glos is less optimistic than some financial institutes germany 's chambers of industry and commerce -lsb- dikh -rsb- also said german economic growth will slow only slightly in 2008 and will still expand by more than 2 percent . but german economics minister michael glos said wednesday that he anticipated growth to continue at a slower pace .
in an interview with the mass-market bild newspaper , he added that he anticipated economic expansion to come in at just under 2 percent . germany emerged from a protracted period of stagnation in 2006 to report a growth rate of 2.9 percent with the economy expected to post an expansion rate last year of about 2.6 percent .
in november , a government report had predicted a drop in germany 's economic growth , slipping from a forecasted 2.6 percent in 2007 to 1.9 percent in 2008 . in an interview with berliner zeitung , dihk president ludwig georg braun said he was confident that 300,000 jobs could be created in 2008 despite the slight slowdown in gross domestic product growth . " the economy will slow only slightly in 2008 but the companies ' expectations remain good , " he said . shortage of highly skilled workers bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the dip in germany 's jobless rate is expected to continue in 2008 despite the flood of positive predictions , experts warn that germany 's labor market will not be able to maintain its current good form throughout 2008 .
german carmaker audi announced on wednesday that it intended to hire 800 additional engineers in 2008 . braun said that the optimism was due more to strong worldwide economic growth rather than to political decisions made in germany .
he added he was concerned about a worsening in the shortage of highly skilled workers . " that 's where political and industry leaders need to work together to change that , " he said .

but that was before a 17-year-old greek national and a 20-year-old turkish national brutally attacked a pensioner who asked them to stop smoking in a munich subway station .
the pre-christmas attack prompted a national debate about how to deal with youth violence - particulary when the offenders are of non-german origin .
spotting a prime election opportunity , hesse 's embattled christian democrat state premier , roland koch , is now trying to pre-empt the social democrat 's minimum wage campaign by launching a broadside against crime perpetrated by young foreigners .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : according to cdu politicians , around half of germany 's young offenders are foreigners " we have too many criminal foreigner juveniles in germany , " koch said .
" in the name of multi-cultural tolerance , we 've been blinded to accept behavior that can lead to dangerous aggression .
we 've got to put an end to the grand delusion . "
on wednesday , koch will meet with his interior minister to discuss a new anti-crime campaign for the january 27 election .
spd fights back the social democrat leader in hesse , andrea ypsilanti , has hit back at koch , telling the süddeutsche zeitung newspaper : " he 's leading a dirty campaign again … that 's his style . "
other spd leaders have accused koch of trying to score points by stirring anti-foreigner sentiment - a sensitive issue in germany .
vice chancellor frank-walter steinmeier said it showed that koch " was nervous " about losing the election to the social democrats .
" herr koch , why do n't you come up with some concrete ideas on integration instead of whipping the people up against each other ? "
steinmeier asked .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : roland koch is fighting to maintain his majority in hesse koch was once considered a rising star in the cdu , but lately , polls have showed him slipping and possibly in danger of losing his absolute majority .
the election in hesse is one of four regional ballots in 2008 in cdu-controlled states .
the spd said it would be a victory to take power in one of the four , and considers hesse one of its best shots .
the spd had decided to make minimum wage its main issue for the election .
polls show most germans are in favor of introducing a minimum wage , but koch and his party are against it .
send delinquents to boot camp , cdu says in the wake of the munich subway attack , conservative politicians have called for a host of tougher punishments for young offenders , including a " warning arrest " of several weeks and the establishment of us-style private correctional " boot camps . "
leading cdu politician wolfgang bosbach said that a period spent at boot camp could be " most effective " as many young offenders do n't see being released on probation as punishment .
federal justice minister brigitte zypries -lrb- spd -rrb- has sharply criticized the discussion .
" so-called ' boot camps ' in which young people are meant to be humiliated and subjected to drills are in no way compatible with human dignity , " zypries said . dw staff -lrb- dc -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

some called for sanctions ; others noted the feeling of betrayal among the people . britain 's financial times took a hard stance toward the announced victory of kenya 's president mwai kibaki .
" kibaki must know that his government is illegitimate .
if he refuses to accept that , then western powers should halt aid programs and instead , use the money for emergency aid and provide it as well to the african union for it to use for a firm intervention .
visas should be denied not only to corrupt civil servants , but also to kibaki and his entire government team .
if odinga and his circle are caught stoking violence , then the same sanctions must also be applied to them .
whatever occurs , the outside world must prepare for the worst and , at the same time , fervently pray that both sides will come to their senses . " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : locals in front of a church where 46 people were trapped and killed tuesday spain 's el pais wrote : " seldom is something so obtuse and so lucid at the same time .
the presidential election in kenya - one of africa 's richest and most stable countries - has set the nation aflame .
hundreds of people have been killed in the clashes between president kibaki 's supporters and those of opposition candidate raila odinga .
all of the independent sources and reports , including those of a european union observer mission led by germany 's alexander graf lambsdorff , say very clearly : state powers pulled the necessary votes out of a hat to prevent a victory for odinga .
kenya has never really been home to a democracy . " germany 's süddeutsche zeitung commented on how the international community is dealing with the situation .
" as many rulers there have learned , in africa it does n't matter how election results come about ; the primary thing is that they are recognized internationally … that the united states has now - due to the violent protests in kenya - back-pedaled and , along with great britain , is demanding an independent investigation into the vote-counting may be embarrassing for president george w. bush 's administration , but it is not yet threatening to kibaki . " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : eu election observer head graf lambsdorff noted " extreme discrepencies " in vote-counting " but , what is perfectly clear is that the situation is so explosive that the country is now faced with its most crucial test since its independence .
every western country that seriously believes in democracy for africa is required to do everything it can to help deescalate the situation .
part of that is creating powerful scare tactics both for kibaki as well as for odinga .
any country , however , which recognizes the results of this election is contributing to the escalation , " the paper said . the german daily tageszeitung -lrb- taz -rrb- examined the context behind the violence in kenya .
" when kenyans voted for mwai kibaki five years ago , he promised to put an end to corruption and the state 's arbitrary ways and was celebrated like a pop star as a result .
nowadays , he ca n't even venture out on the street without fearing for his life … so , one ca n't really hold it against the kenyans that they feel betrayed … they wanted to vote him out of office , but were not allowed to do so .
frustration can particularly be felt among young unemployed people , whose last shimmer of hope has been stripped away .
while one may not agree with their actions , they 're understandable in such a context . " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : violence also broke out in nairobi 's slums vienna 's der standard commented that kibaki , through presumed vote-rigging , wanted to prevent a switch of power to the younger generation .
" kibaki , who during his first election presented himself as a champion of democracy , has dispelled his own powers of enchantment .
and he has shown more loyalty to his friends in the so-called ' mount kenya mafia ' than to his citizens .
kibaki , also a former finance minister and vice president , has been in politics for ages .
now he is trying to prevent the dissolution of his generation , which has anchored itself in the administration and economy since independence in 1963 and unscrupulously enriched itself .
but kenyans wanted the exact opposite , as shown in all the opinion polls before the election .
the open criticism of kibaki testifies to a new confidence in a country which is enjoying five-percent economic growth and a truly free press . " dw staff -lrb- als -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

" kibaki must know that his government is illegitimate .
if he refuses to accept that , then western powers should halt aid programs and instead , use the money for emergency aid and provide it as well to the african union for it to use for a firm intervention .
visas should be denied not only to corrupt civil servants , but also to kibaki and his entire government team .

the presidential election in kenya - one of africa 's richest and most stable countries - has set the nation aflame .
hundreds of people have been killed in the clashes between president kibaki 's supporters and those of opposition candidate raila odinga .
all of the independent sources and reports , including those of a european union observer mission led by germany 's alexander graf lambsdorff , say very clearly : state powers pulled the necessary votes out of a hat to prevent a victory for odinga .
kenya has never really been home to a democracy . " germany 's süddeutsche zeitung commented on how the international community is dealing with the situation .
" as many rulers there have learned , in africa it does n't matter how election results come about ; the primary thing is that they are recognized internationally … that the united states has now - due to the violent protests in kenya - back-pedaled and , along with great britain , is demanding an independent investigation into the vote-counting may be embarrassing for president george w. bush 's administration , but it is not yet threatening to kibaki . " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : eu election observer head graf lambsdorff noted " extreme discrepencies " in vote-counting " but , what is perfectly clear is that the situation is so explosive that the country is now faced with its most crucial test since its independence .
every western country that seriously believes in democracy for africa is required to do everything it can to help deescalate the situation .
part of that is creating powerful scare tactics both for kibaki as well as for odinga .
any country , however , which recognizes the results of this election is contributing to the escalation , " the paper said . the german daily tageszeitung -lrb- taz -rrb- examined the context behind the violence in kenya .
" when kenyans voted for mwai kibaki five years ago , he promised to put an end to corruption and the state 's arbitrary ways and was celebrated like a pop star as a result .
nowadays , he ca n't even venture out on the street without fearing for his life … so , one ca n't really hold it against the kenyans that they feel betrayed … they wanted to vote him out of office , but were not allowed to do so .
frustration can particularly be felt among young unemployed people , whose last shimmer of hope has been stripped away .
while one may not agree with their actions , they 're understandable in such a context . " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : violence also broke out in nairobi 's slums vienna 's der standard commented that kibaki , through presumed vote-rigging , wanted to prevent a switch of power to the younger generation .
" kibaki , who during his first election presented himself as a champion of democracy , has dispelled his own powers of enchantment .
and he has shown more loyalty to his friends in the so-called ' mount kenya mafia ' than to his citizens .
kibaki , also a former finance minister and vice president , has been in politics for ages .
now he is trying to prevent the dissolution of his generation , which has anchored itself in the administration and economy since independence in 1963 and unscrupulously enriched itself .
but kenyans wanted the exact opposite , as shown in all the opinion polls before the election .
the open criticism of kibaki testifies to a new confidence in a country which is enjoying five-percent economic growth and a truly free press . " dw staff -lrb- als -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

by 2020 , seven of the world ’ s ten most populated cities will be located in asia alone .
in an effort to provide an adequate infrastructure for asia ’ s mega cities , german companies play a major role . in 2004 , hyderabad , the capital of the indian state of andhra pradesh , had 3.5 million inhabitants , not including the outskirts .

this goes for infrastructure in several asian cities .

so the cities can turn to the cdia and apply for funding and advice .

essen will be one in 2010 : a european capital of culture .
this year , the english city of liverpool shares the title with the norwegian town of stavanger . " love me do " could be the anthem of this british town known most famously as home to the fab four .
visitors to the city on the mersey river are confronted with beatlemania as soon as they arrive at the airport , which is named after john lennon . indeed , for many years , most visitors were drawn to liverpool due to the beatles ' fame .
" people all over the world have heard of this place , " tour guide phil hughes told dpa news agency . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the fab four remain the most famous musicians in the world the musical history alone could be reason enough to deem liverpool a " european capital of culture " in 2008 .
after all , other british music greats - the rolling stones , the kinks and the who among them - got their start in the cavern club in mathew street .
even american music stars such as chuck berry and bo diddley once played there . beatles ' fame not enough " the beatles legacy certainly helped the city , but that alone was n't all we wanted to show the world , " said paul newman , spokesman for the liverpool culture company .
the company has been the hub for the transformation of the seaport in northwestern england that was not long ago an example of urban decay . decades ago , liverpool was rutted in unemployment and a sense of hopelessness far longer than other industrial regions . the shipyards had been shut down , followed by massive redundancies in the region 's manufacturing sector . in the 1980s , british prime minister margaret thatcher introduced sweeping reforms throughout the country , but liverpool missed the boat . bildunterschrift : liverpool 's wealth now stems from culture rather than shipping pragmatism and economic expertise ultimately helped liverpool citizens to pull themselves up by the boot straps .
but culture also played a big part in the transformation of the city , with cultural institutions receiving massive financial support . " it brought us out of the crisis , " newman told dpa . " investing in art and culture was the right thing to do , especially during a very difficult period . " capitalizing on culture now , liverpool is second only to london in its vast array of cultural events , including an annual modern art fair , galleries with free admission , theater and concerts at the philharmonic hall . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the tate liverpool gallery at albert dock liverpool is also europe 's biggest building site .
cranes will dot the skyline throughout the year of culture in 2008 and longer , as the regeneration of entire districts is planned for well into 2010 . meanwhile , tourists can enjoy the sight of the " liver bird " - a cross between a cormorant , a griffin and an eagle that is the city 's mascot .
in addition to resting atop the liver building , the bird can also be seen on the jerseys of the city 's world-renowned soccer team . slavery history exposed a lively spot for tourists is the historic harbor area called albert dock .
the dock has undergone extensive renovation after years of neglect , with the waterfront district hosting everything from the " tate liverpool " - home of the national collection of modern art in the north of england and the largest gallery of modern and contemporary art outside london - to shops , cafes and the international slavery museum . the museum addresses liverpool 's history as the prime shipment point for " human cargo " between africa and america - a trade that contributed to the city 's former enormous wealth . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : a beatles ' creation : st. pepper 's lonely hearts club band though the slave trade was banned in britain in 1807 , a debate broke out about the issue last year .
penny lane , located in the harbor district and which a beatles song helped make one of the city 's most famous , was named after ship-owner james penny . mr. penny 's ships transported enslaved africans to britain 's colonies in america hundreds of years ago . last year , a local councilman proposed renaming the street , but many citizens protested , including liverpool 's black community , who spoke out against what they called the " silliness " of the matter . back on the map whether it 's exploring liverpool 's history as a " gateway to the world , " its rich architectural legacy or the haunts of rock ' n ' roll stars , visitors will find plenty to do in the city . and , if they 're still not satisfied , they can attend any of the more than 300 cultural events planned for 2008 , some led by such stellar liverpudlian sons as former beatles paul mccartney and ringo starr , as well as conductor sir simon rattle , who will take his berlin philharmonic to his hometown to perform . dw staff -lrb- als -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

but european and us politicians say a un probe is n't necessary . french foreign minister bernhard kouchner said on wednesday , jan .
2 , that he was speaking formally on behalf of the 27-member bloc when he offered pakistan help in combating extremism and probing the killing of opposition leader benazir bhutto . kouchner was the first high-ranking foreign official to visit pakistan since the killing of bhutto , in a gun and bomb attack after a campaign rally last week . kouchner rules out un probe " today we proposed to president musharraf to provide french or european experts , " kouchner said after meeting the pakistani leader in rawalpindi , the garrison city where bhutto , 54 , was slain . " mr. musharraf responded that the idea was interesting . " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : bhutto in a photo taken in october 2007 koucher , however , stressed that he saw little prospect of a united nations investigation into bhutto 's killing .
officials in washington also said a un investigation into bhutto 's death was unnecessary . bhutto 's pakistan people 's party -lrb- ppp -rrb- had called for a probe similar to that into the death in 2005 of former lebanese premier rafiq hariri , where an international court in the hague will try suspects . " if you are talking about a group of international experts , why not , we will be happy to contribute , " kouchner told reporters in islamabad .
" if , though , you 're asking for an international investigation in the un sense of the term , there are conditions which , unfortunately , are not so easy to fulfill . " kouchner said a un investigation commission presupposes the involvement of a third party or country . " in the case of hariri , the presumption was that another country was implicated , whereas here , we ca n't say that with any clarity , " the french minister said .
" as a consequence , unless un rules were suddenly rewritten , it would appear to me to be difficult . " musharraf asks for british help pakistani government officials have so far rejected calls for an international investigation into bhutto 's killing .
but on wednesday , pervez musharraf said he had asked british police for help in the investigation into the assassination . " i am grateful to prime minister brown that ... he accepted my request , " musharraf said in a televised address to the nation , referring to british prime minister gordon brown . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : musharraf said scotland yard will help in the probe " this team will come immediately and will assist our team in the investigation , " musharraf added .
" i hope these investigations would be done properly with scotland yard and remove all doubts . " though musharraf 's administration has said that local groups linked to al qaeda were behind the assassination , bhutto 's party accuses the government of covering up events surrounding her death . eu eager to fight extremism kouchner also handed over a letter from french president nicolas sarkozy which he said expressed his country 's solidarity with pakistan in the wake of the " horrible crime . " he said the letter also underlined sarkozy 's " support for what must be democratic efforts in the continuation of the election process as well as the fight against terrorism and extremism . " koucher said his visit came specifically at the request of slovenia , which took over the rotating eu presidency on jan .
1 . " bhutto was assassinated by an extremism that we , france and the european union , have decided to fight , " he said .
" it would not be surprising if it was islamist terrorism since i know that it makes its bed in the tribal zone of pakistan . " election delayed pakistan 's election commission on wednesday postponed the general elections by six weeks , to feb .
18 , saying polling was not possible on the original date of jan .
8 because of disturbances following bhutto 's murder . the decision has been criticized by opposition parties .
they say the delay will benefit beleaguered musharraf and his ruling party , the pakistan muslim league-q . they also say a delay could provoke more unrest and violence . dw staff -lrb- sp -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

essen will be one in 2010 : a european capital of culture .
this year , the english city of liverpool shares the title with the norwegian town of stavanger . " love me do " could be the anthem of this british town known most famously as home to the fab four .
visitors to the city on the mersey river are confronted with beatlemania as soon as they arrive at the airport , which is named after john lennon . indeed , for many years , most visitors were drawn to liverpool due to the beatles ' fame .
" people all over the world have heard of this place , " tour guide phil hughes told dpa news agency . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the fab four remain the most famous musicians in the world the musical history alone could be reason enough to deem liverpool a " european capital of culture " in 2008 .
after all , other british music greats - the rolling stones , the kinks and the who among them - got their start in the cavern club in mathew street .
even american music stars such as chuck berry and bo diddley once played there . beatles ' fame not enough " the beatles legacy certainly helped the city , but that alone was n't all we wanted to show the world , " said paul newman , spokesman for the liverpool culture company .
the company has been the hub for the transformation of the seaport in northwestern england that was not long ago an example of urban decay . decades ago , liverpool was rutted in unemployment and a sense of hopelessness far longer than other industrial regions . the shipyards had been shut down , followed by massive redundancies in the region 's manufacturing sector . in the 1980s , british prime minister margaret thatcher introduced sweeping reforms throughout the country , but liverpool missed the boat . bildunterschrift : liverpool 's wealth now stems from culture rather than shipping pragmatism and economic expertise ultimately helped liverpool citizens to pull themselves up by the boot straps .
but culture also played a big part in the transformation of the city , with cultural institutions receiving massive financial support . " it brought us out of the crisis , " newman told dpa . " investing in art and culture was the right thing to do , especially during a very difficult period . " capitalizing on culture now , liverpool is second only to london in its vast array of cultural events , including an annual modern art fair , galleries with free admission , theater and concerts at the philharmonic hall . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the tate liverpool gallery at albert dock liverpool is also europe 's biggest building site .
cranes will dot the skyline throughout the year of culture in 2008 and longer , as the regeneration of entire districts is planned for well into 2010 . meanwhile , tourists can enjoy the sight of the " liver bird " - a cross between a cormorant , a griffin and an eagle that is the city 's mascot .
in addition to resting atop the liver building , the bird can also be seen on the jerseys of the city 's world-renowned soccer team . slavery history exposed a lively spot for tourists is the historic harbor area called albert dock .
the dock has undergone extensive renovation after years of neglect , with the waterfront district hosting everything from the " tate liverpool " - home of the national collection of modern art in the north of england and the largest gallery of modern and contemporary art outside london - to shops , cafes and the international slavery museum . the museum addresses liverpool 's history as the prime shipment point for " human cargo " between africa and america - a trade that contributed to the city 's former enormous wealth . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : a beatles ' creation : st. pepper 's lonely hearts club band though the slave trade was banned in britain in 1807 , a debate broke out about the issue last year .
penny lane , located in the harbor district and which a beatles song helped make one of the city 's most famous , was named after ship-owner james penny . mr. penny 's ships transported enslaved africans to britain 's colonies in america hundreds of years ago . last year , a local councilman proposed renaming the street , but many citizens protested , including liverpool 's black community , who spoke out against what they called the " silliness " of the matter . back on the map whether it 's exploring liverpool 's history as a " gateway to the world , " its rich architectural legacy or the haunts of rock ' n ' roll stars , visitors will find plenty to do in the city . and , if they 're still not satisfied , they can attend any of the more than 300 cultural events planned for 2008 , some led by such stellar liverpudlian sons as former beatles paul mccartney and ringo starr , as well as conductor sir simon rattle , who will take his berlin philharmonic to his hometown to perform . dw staff -lrb- als -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

so , police arrested the rollicky collie near the central city of kassel . but rather than be angry , kassel cops were amused by the dog 's antics .
police said the collie jumped aboard the passenger rail-car at a stop in hümme , a tiny town near kassel , in the state of hesse . nabbing the collie bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : then again , some collies look clever enough to make a dash for the train the train driver , luckily , was adept at multi-tasking and managed to grab the canine beast and tie it up to his seat .
police in kassel later placed the dog in the city pound . the dog also committed a second big no-no in the german handbook of responsible living : not registering his identity to city officials . " it not only did n't have a ticket , " police told dpa .
" it did n't have an ownership tag either . " the kassel cops were still impressed by the scoundrel , though .
they said it reminded them of canine screen star lassie , who always managed to make the cross-country journey home to its owners - without a train ticket . dw staff -lrb- als -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

a poll of 9,000 people in 13 nations , alongside a bbc investigation into global obesity , found vast variations in attitudes towards food and weight .
many french get on the scales every day the poll found , while singaporeans are the least likely to weigh themselves .
people are now said to be getting fatter in most of the world , with the exception of parts of asia .
the three-day bbc series will look at the problems arising from the trend and what can be done about it .
this study , by market research firm synovate , questioned 9,000 people in 13 countries across five continents .

people in the uk and the us were the most likely to nominate " no self discipline " as the leading factor in obesity .
these two nations also had the most respondents who said they would be unable to give up fast food .
some 45 % in the uk agreed with the statement " i like the taste of fast food too much to give it up " , while 44 % of americans said they would be unable to give up their burgers , pizzas and chicken wings .

bbc news -pipe- entertainment -pipe- sound of 2008 : the ting tings bbc news / entertainment graphics version bbc sport home news front page -pipe- africa -pipe- americas -pipe- asia-pacific -pipe- europe -pipe- middle east -pipe- south asia -pipe- uk -pipe- business -pipe- health -pipe- science & environment -pipe- technology -pipe- entertainment -pipe- also in the news -pipe- have your say -pipe- entertainment contents : arts & culture wednesday , 2 january 2008 , 08:17 gmt sound of 2008 : the ting tings self-proclaimed " garage pop " duo the ting tings have come third in the bbc 's sound of 2008 new music poll .
we are revealing one artist from the top five every day until friday , when the winner and full top 10 will be announced .
less than 12 months after forming , manchester-based the ting tings are struggling to get to grips with being one of the uk 's most talked-about new bands .
when a fan recognised them as they were hauling their luggage through liverpool airport , they were sure there was some mistake .
" i thought he thought i was somebody else , " says singer and guitarist katie white , who assured him : " i do n't know what you 're on about , " and ran away .
when he correctly identified them , they both breathed a sigh of relief .
" i thought phew , he actually knows the band .
i was quite rude to him at first . "
interest in the group has snowballed since their first gigs for friends at their home at the start of 2007 .
when word rapidly spread , they found music fans and industry folk descending on their living room to watch their early shows .
" we got invaded , " katie says .
" it got out of hand really , " explains drummer jules de martino .
" someone advertised our fourth gig on xfm , and it just got packed out . "
comparisons in the press have likened them to the gossip , blondie , girls aloud and even toni basil , of 1980s cheese-pop hit hey mickey fame .
much of the interest has centred on the infectious yelping and handclaps of their jagged pop single that 's not my name .
for katie and jules , the current attention comes after several years of false starts in the music scene .
katie made her first attempt at stardom as a teenager in girl group tko - short for total knock out - who supported acts like atomic kitten , steps and five .
they were managed by her dad david - who was also responsible for one-hit-wonders sweet female attitude .
jules started writing songs for tko in 2001 , and later formed a new pop trio , dear eskiimo , with katie .
they were billed as " scissor sisters strapping on gorillaz ' animal suits " and won a major record deal - but stalled at the starting line .
so the pair started from scratch and began playing together as a duo .
" what we was doing this time last year was counting the copper jar , and we did literally collect loads of change , " katie says .
" and you were selling a bit of equipment because we were a bit skint , " she says , turning to jules .
" which i regret , " he adds .
" i sold this tape-playing machine just to pay our rent . "
shortly after starting to rehearse as a duo , katie decided she needed to play an instrument as well as sing .
" so she just picked up one of my old guitars and started playing , " says jules .
" she 'd never played a guitar before , so that 's how it 's formed .
" it 's kind of like a happy accident and it 's going to continue like that . "
the pair have now successfully reinvented themselves and become one of the most credible and critically-acclaimed groups on the indie scene .
their reputation rocketed in the summer when steve lamacq introduced them on a small stage at glastonbury as " the next big thing " , and their performance made it onto bbc two .
" with it being late-night tv , you do n't realise how many people it 's actually getting to , " katie says .
" but then the next day , we looked at all our messages on myspace and there were hundreds and hundreds of them .
it was fantastic . "
but the singer says they are too busy to take much notice of the current buzz , describing it as " a bit weird for us " .
when they released a limited edition single , they " did n't expect it to go anywhere " , she says .
" and it just went whoosh , so now we 're just enjoying it , enjoying the ride . "
almost 150 uk-based music writers , editors and broadcasters took part in the sound of 2008 poll .
they named their three favourite new acts and their responses were used to compile a top 10 .

we are revealing one artist from the top five every day until friday , when the winner and full top 10 will be announced .
the ting tings tell all in their dressing room less than 12 months after forming , manchester-based the ting tings are struggling to get to grips with being one of the uk 's most talked-about new bands .
when a fan recognised them as they were hauling their luggage through liverpool airport , they were sure there was some mistake .
" i thought he thought i was somebody else , " says singer and guitarist katie white , who assured him : " i do n't know what you 're on about , " and ran away .
when he correctly identified them , they both breathed a sigh of relief .
" i thought phew , he actually knows the band .
i was quite rude to him at first . "
interest in the group has snowballed since their first gigs for friends at their home at the start of 2007 .
the ting tings staged their first gigs in their flat in salford when word rapidly spread , they found music fans and industry folk descending on their living room to watch their early shows .
" we got invaded , " katie says .
" it got out of hand really , " explains drummer jules de martino .
" someone advertised our fourth gig on xfm , and it just got packed out . "
comparisons in the press have likened them to the gossip , blondie , girls aloud and even toni basil , of 1980s cheese-pop hit hey mickey fame .
much of the interest has centred on the infectious yelping and handclaps of their jagged pop single that 's not my name .
for katie and jules , the current attention comes after several years of false starts in the music scene .
katie made her first attempt at stardom as a teenager in girl group tko - short for total knock out - who supported acts like atomic kitten , steps and five .
katie and jules were in a previous band together , dear eskiimo they were managed by her dad david - who was also responsible for one-hit-wonders sweet female attitude .
jules started writing songs for tko in 2001 , and later formed a new pop trio , dear eskiimo , with katie .
they were billed as " scissor sisters strapping on gorillaz ' animal suits " and won a major record deal - but stalled at the starting line .
so the pair started from scratch and began playing together as a duo .
" what we was doing this time last year was counting the copper jar , and we did literally collect loads of change , " katie says .
" and you were selling a bit of equipment because we were a bit skint , " she says , turning to jules .
" which i regret , " he adds .
" i sold this tape-playing machine just to pay our rent . "
shortly after starting to rehearse as a duo , katie decided she needed to play an instrument as well as sing .
the band took off after their glastonbury performance was on tv " so she just picked up one of my old guitars and started playing , " says jules .
" she 'd never played a guitar before , so that 's how it 's formed .
" it 's kind of like a happy accident and it 's going to continue like that . "
the pair have now successfully reinvented themselves and become one of the most credible and critically-acclaimed groups on the indie scene .
their reputation rocketed in the summer when steve lamacq introduced them on a small stage at glastonbury as " the next big thing " , and their performance made it onto bbc two .
" with it being late-night tv , you do n't realise how many people it 's actually getting to , " katie says .
" but then the next day , we looked at all our messages on myspace and there were hundreds and hundreds of them .
it was fantastic . "
but the singer says they are too busy to take much notice of the current buzz , describing it as " a bit weird for us " .
when they released a limited edition single , they " did n't expect it to go anywhere " , she says .
" and it just went whoosh , so now we 're just enjoying it , enjoying the ride . "
almost 150 uk-based music writers , editors and broadcasters took part in the sound of 2008 poll .
they named their three favourite new acts and their responses were used to compile a top 10 .

we are revealing one artist from the top five every day until friday , when the winner and full top 10 will be announced .
the ting tings tell all in their dressing room less than 12 months after forming , manchester-based the ting tings are struggling to get to grips with being one of the uk 's most talked-about new bands .
when a fan recognised them as they were hauling their luggage through liverpool airport , they were sure there was some mistake .
" i thought he thought i was somebody else , " says singer and guitarist katie white , who assured him : " i do n't know what you 're on about , " and ran away .
when he correctly identified them , they both breathed a sigh of relief .
" i thought phew , he actually knows the band .
i was quite rude to him at first . "
interest in the group has snowballed since their first gigs for friends at their home at the start of 2007 .
the ting tings staged their first gigs in their flat in salford when word rapidly spread , they found music fans and industry folk descending on their living room to watch their early shows .
" we got invaded , " katie says .
" it got out of hand really , " explains drummer jules de martino .
" someone advertised our fourth gig on xfm , and it just got packed out . "
comparisons in the press have likened them to the gossip , blondie , girls aloud and even toni basil , of 1980s cheese-pop hit hey mickey fame .
much of the interest has centred on the infectious yelping and handclaps of their jagged pop single that 's not my name .
for katie and jules , the current attention comes after several years of false starts in the music scene .
katie made her first attempt at stardom as a teenager in girl group tko - short for total knock out - who supported acts like atomic kitten , steps and five .
katie and jules were in a previous band together , dear eskiimo they were managed by her dad david - who was also responsible for one-hit-wonders sweet female attitude .
jules started writing songs for tko in 2001 , and later formed a new pop trio , dear eskiimo , with katie .
they were billed as " scissor sisters strapping on gorillaz ' animal suits " and won a major record deal - but stalled at the starting line .
so the pair started from scratch and began playing together as a duo .
" what we was doing this time last year was counting the copper jar , and we did literally collect loads of change , " katie says .
" and you were selling a bit of equipment because we were a bit skint , " she says , turning to jules .
" which i regret , " he adds .
" i sold this tape-playing machine just to pay our rent . "
shortly after starting to rehearse as a duo , katie decided she needed to play an instrument as well as sing .
the band took off after their glastonbury performance was on tv " so she just picked up one of my old guitars and started playing , " says jules .
" she 'd never played a guitar before , so that 's how it 's formed .
" it 's kind of like a happy accident and it 's going to continue like that . "
the pair have now successfully reinvented themselves and become one of the most credible and critically-acclaimed groups on the indie scene .
their reputation rocketed in the summer when steve lamacq introduced them on a small stage at glastonbury as " the next big thing " , and their performance made it onto bbc two .
" with it being late-night tv , you do n't realise how many people it 's actually getting to , " katie says .
" but then the next day , we looked at all our messages on myspace and there were hundreds and hundreds of them .
it was fantastic . "
but the singer says they are too busy to take much notice of the current buzz , describing it as " a bit weird for us " .
when they released a limited edition single , they " did n't expect it to go anywhere " , she says .
" and it just went whoosh , so now we 're just enjoying it , enjoying the ride . "
almost 150 uk-based music writers , editors and broadcasters took part in the sound of 2008 poll .
they named their three favourite new acts and their responses were used to compile a top 10 .

" we need to define the benefits of climate change - and there are many .
look at a map of northern canada - there 's only one deep water port and churchill is it , " says mr spence .
with the latest estimates of ice-free summers in the arctic as early as 2013 and the northwest passage becoming navigable for the first time this year , mr spence claims that churchill could find itself at the centre of a new network of international shipping routes .
churchill can look to northern europe as well as asia , which puts it slap in the middle of an arctic sea route that bypasses the panama canal and could shave two weeks off the journey between east and west . $ 10 bargain and if churchill is to be the first boom town of the globally warmed age , one us company stands to do very nicely .

" my big vision is that the port will be as busy as a beehive at least six months of the year , serving north america , europe , the middle east and asia . "
that optimism is shared by the man who negotiated the sale to omnitrax , canadian statesman lloyd axworthy , minister of transport at the time .
" if you look at the transportation potential there are all kinds of opportunities which , 10 years out , i think could quite dramatically change the entire sea transit system , globally . "
he envisages churchill as the key link in a chain , which would see goods arriving by ship from europe and asia , and then distributed by rail throughout north and central america .

politicians have branded it " the arctic bridge " .
" what we have demonstrated is that this route is possible and is worth trying .

lee has won the top award at the venice film festival twice the film - a 1940s espionage thriller set in shanghai during the japanese occupation - received a restrictive nc-17 rating when it opened in the us last september .
the period drama , which won the golden lion award at the 2007 venice film festival , will be released in the uk on 4 january with an 18 certificate .
while an 18 certificate is roughly equivalent to an american nc-17 , the us rating is generally considered to affect a film 's ability to attract a big american audience .
the film was shown unedited in hong kong and taiwan , but had its sex scenes excised by authorities in china .
" when you cut those scenes , you still get the story and can understand it completely , " the 53-year-old told the bbc news website .
" but if i 'm allowed to include them , i 'd rather lose money than show a lesser version . "
attraction the " pivotal " sex scenes between actors tony leung and tang wei were shot over 11 days on a closed set , with only the main camera and sound personnel present .
" i just did what i thought was best for the movie and what i felt was necessary , " said lee .
his latest film is set in shanghai during the japanese occupation " i did n't think about the scary part - how it would look and what kind of trouble i would get myself into , " he continued .
" but it turned out people have reacted a lot more positively than i expected . "
based on a short story by the late chinese author eileen chang , lust , caution - se , jie in mandarin - tells of a group of actors who plot to assassinate an enemy collaborator .
the film 's young heroine , however , finds her mission imperilled by her powerful attraction to the man she has been ordered to seduce .
speaking at the london film festival last october , the taiwanese director explained why he chose to follow his 2005 drama brokeback mountain with a chinese-language film .
martial arts " if i did n't make it , i do n't think anybody could have , " he said .
" i got a lot of support after winning the oscar -lsb- for brokeback mountain -rsb- , so i felt the time was right .
" in 10 years this history will be gone with the wind .
anybody who lived through it will have passed away . "
lee won a best director oscar for " gay western " brokeback mountain since making his english-language debut with jane austen adaptation sense and sensibility in 1995 , lee has made only one other movie in his native tongue .
that was crouching tiger , hidden dragon - a martial arts epic that went on to win the 2001 oscar for best foreign language film .
" i do n't have a specific plan about how many chinese movies i do , " he said .
" but i 'm glad after doing two english language films -lsb- brokeback and 2003 's hulk -rsb- i got to go back to china . "
lee returned knowing he would need to adopt a more " hands-on " role than would normally be the case in hollywood .
' exhausting ' " chinese film for me is exhausting , " he admitted .
" it 's a smaller industry , so i had to do a lot of the pushing personally . "
focus features , the specialty films unit of universal pictures , will no doubt be hoping lust , caution will replicate some of brokeback 's award-winning success .
his other films include action epic crouching tiger , hidden dragon its hopes of winning the 2008 foreign language film oscar , however , were scuppered when it was rejected by the academy .
too few of the film 's key crew members hailed from taiwan for it to be eligible , the selection committee ruled .
lee admits to being baffled by the panel 's decision , saying the rejection " came as a surprise " .
" i think it 's a stern regulation , and an old-fashioned way of thinking , " he said .
" films are made by a lot of people , and whoever is best for the job gets hired .
" it seems a little dated to me , as an international film-maker . "

while an 18 certificate is roughly equivalent to an american nc-17 , the us rating is generally considered to affect a film 's ability to attract a big american audience .
the film was shown unedited in hong kong and taiwan , but had its sex scenes excised by authorities in china .
" when you cut those scenes , you still get the story and can understand it completely , " the 53-year-old told the bbc news website .
" but if i 'm allowed to include them , i 'd rather lose money than show a lesser version . "
attraction the " pivotal " sex scenes between actors tony leung and tang wei were shot over 11 days on a closed set , with only the main camera and sound personnel present .
" i just did what i thought was best for the movie and what i felt was necessary , " said lee .
" i did n't think about the scary part - how it would look and what kind of trouble i would get myself into , " he continued .
" but it turned out people have reacted a lot more positively than i expected . "
based on a short story by the late chinese author eileen chang , lust , caution - se , jie in mandarin - tells of a group of actors who plot to assassinate an enemy collaborator .
the film 's young heroine , however , finds her mission imperilled by her powerful attraction to the man she has been ordered to seduce .
speaking at the london film festival last october , the taiwanese director explained why he chose to follow his 2005 drama brokeback mountain with a chinese-language film .
martial arts " if i did n't make it , i do n't think anybody could have , " he said .
" i got a lot of support after winning the oscar -lsb- for brokeback mountain -rsb- , so i felt the time was right .
" in 10 years this history will be gone with the wind .
anybody who lived through it will have passed away . "
since making his english-language debut with jane austen adaptation sense and sensibility in 1995 , lee has made only one other movie in his native tongue .
that was crouching tiger , hidden dragon - a martial arts epic that went on to win the 2001 oscar for best foreign language film .
" i do n't have a specific plan about how many chinese movies i do , " he said .
" but i 'm glad after doing two english language films -lsb- brokeback and 2003 's hulk -rsb- i got to go back to china . "
lee returned knowing he would need to adopt a more " hands-on " role than would normally be the case in hollywood .
' exhausting ' " chinese film for me is exhausting , " he admitted .
" it 's a smaller industry , so i had to do a lot of the pushing personally . "
focus features , the specialty films unit of universal pictures , will no doubt be hoping lust , caution will replicate some of brokeback 's award-winning success .
its hopes of winning the 2008 foreign language film oscar , however , were scuppered when it was rejected by the academy .
too few of the film 's key crew members hailed from taiwan for it to be eligible , the selection committee ruled .
lee admits to being baffled by the panel 's decision , saying the rejection " came as a surprise " .
" i think it 's a stern regulation , and an old-fashioned way of thinking , " he said .
" films are made by a lot of people , and whoever is best for the job gets hired .
" it seems a little dated to me , as an international film-maker . "
