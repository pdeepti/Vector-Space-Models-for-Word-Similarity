16 , amid growing concern about the fallout from the us subprime mortgage crisis that has rattled markets since last year and cast a pall over the global economic outlook . lagarde , her british counterpart alistair darling , germany 's peer steinbrück and tommaso padoa-schioppa of italy discussed how to reach " a european strategy on all of the main issues of international finance , " a french finance ministry official said . heads of the four governments are scheduled to meet again on jan .

other g7 members are the united states , canada and japan . crisis will continue bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the financial crisis continues to worry financial markets " we are dealing with a serious situation , " steinbrück said .
" the crisis is going to continue for the next few months . " but after the thursday meeting , lagarde said the fundamentals of the european economy were " good " and that financial and money markets were in a process of " gradual recovery . " eu monetary affairs commissioner joaquin almunia , who also took part in the talks , said the group had an optimistic outlook for the future . " we do not predict a pronounced economic slowdown , " he said officials said the biggest challenge facing the " european four " was finding a shared position on ways to increase market transparency , particularly in the banking sector , which has been hard hit by the us subprime mortgage crisis , and perhaps even strengthening the european union 's financial regulations . darling told reporters from a handful of european newspapers that the financial crisis was " significant " and required " rapid action .

the crisis has also caused serious funding problems for germany 's ikb institute and sachsenlb bank .
deutsche bank also announced this week that it would cut 300 jobs in its investment banking branch . the imf said the market 's current turmoil was in part due to institution with insufficient analysis of the risk posed by new financial products . eu finance ministers had agreed in december to step up coordination between their national financial surveillance bodies but germany and britain balked at a proposal from italy for eu-wide regulations for financial institutions . dw staff -lrb- sms -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de opinion -pipe- 19.01.2008 opinion : when in doubt , blame eu bureaucracy großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : german politicians should n't act so surprised by nokia 's decision to move from germany to romania .
it 's a common occurrence in the eu 's single market and not the result of any bloc subsidies , says dw 's bernd riegert . there 's quite a bit the european union might be guilty of , but it 's not responsible for nokia 's decision to shut a factory in bochum .
the premature accusations from german politicians that eu subsidies were used to move the factory to romania are wrong .
the charges are another example of a well-loved reaction : someone has to be held responsible whenever there are domestic problems , and the soulless bureaucratic machine in brussels can always take the blame .
it 's not the first time that politicians have pointed to brussels - even though the problems are of their own making . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : in the north-rhine westphalia state election in 2005 , the scapegoat was an eu service industry initiative , which was brought about by none other than then-chancellor schröder .
then it was economics minister glos who thundered against an eu subsidy scandal when aeg moved a plant from nuremberg to poland , also in 2005 .
again in that instance , there was nothing behind the accusations . and now it 's nokia and bochum .
the finnish cell phone giant is moving to an industrial park in romania , whose first stage of construction was partially financed with eu funds seven years ago .
there is absolutely nothing to find fault with .
this kind of thing happens all over the eu , including in structurally weak parts of eastern germany and the ruhr region , which also receives eu funds . as painful a situation as it of course is for the employees involved in bochum , it is an everyday occurrence for european companies to set up their production wherever inside the european union they believe to have come across the best conditions .
it 's a part of the collectively sought after single market . it 's possible the finns also were n't all that happy back in the 90s when nokia decided to move from finland to bochum .
but there were n't any german politicians complaining then .
the awareness that a single european market has winners and sometimes even losers does not seem to be very pronounced .
eu commission president barroso was right when he said that , overall , the german economy is counted among the winners of the bloc 's growing market . it 's also not just foreign companies moving their production to other eu member states , but also german ones .
the key factors going into these decisions are usually expenses , such as salaries , energy , transportation and tax - not other promised benefits .
the subsidies are , at the most , an extra advertising tool used by the cities to attract companies . this competition also exists within germany and within north-rhine westphalia .
bochum , essen , oberhausen , cologne and düsseldorf : all of them compete with each other when it comes to attracting companies .

while foreigners from eu countries can take part in local elections , those from outside the eu can not vote at all .
calls for a law change are growing . " jasmine " -lsb- name changed - eds. note -rsb- was born in germany .
like her parents , who hail from turkey , she holds a turkish passport .
she has successfully completed school exams to continue her studies at university and her educational performance was so good she got a scholarship to study medicine . despite this and the fact that she has spent her entire 23 years of life in germany , she does not have her say in how her state or the country is run . " jasmine " is not an isolated case .
while foreigners from european union members may vote in the local elections , she can not .
she also ca n't vote for the government which runs the country in which she was born and raised .
she is excluded from the german election process , like many others who have lived in germany for decades but hold turkish passports . those who have spoken up against the law tend to use similar arguments . " i believe that the chance to express your opinion at a public , municipal level helps promote integration , " said lale akgün , a migration and integration spokeswoman for the social democratic party 's parliamentary group .
" i ca n't see where there is a problem with someone deciding where a one-way street begins or where a kindergarten is setup . " akgün said other eu lands that have allowed foreigners to vote have experienced few problems at a municipal level and most eu citizens see that the right to vote among all those who live in a country is a step towards equality in society . moves to change law blocked by conservatives bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : young turkish women are among those with no vote in september 2007 , the states of berlin and the rhineland-palatinate introduced an initiative to the bundesrat , germany 's upper house of parliament , to allow foreigners from non-eu countries to vote in local elections .
the initiative has drawn vehement criticism from german conservatives . the following month , the greens party faction in the bundestag , the lower house of parliament , announced their own bill to change the law , in line with the previous social democratic-green government 's coalition agreement , in which municipal voting rights were a central theme .
so far , however , there has not been the necessary majority voting in favor of the bill to make it law . at a local level , a number of districts are in favor of a law change .
eight of a total of 13 towns in north rhine-westphalia which took part in a survey conducted by local broadcaster wdr supported a change to allow non-eu foreigners vote at a municipal level .
in hesse , frankfurt 's conservative mayor petra roth herself expressed support for a change in february 2007 . international trend towards wider voting rights on the international front , observers have noted a slow but definite trend developing . " more and more countries are introducing local voting rights for foreigners , " said dietrich thränhardt , a professor comparative governance and migration research at the university of münster .
" possibly half of the organization for economic co-operation and development -lrb- oecd -rrb- states already have such voting rights at local level , although there conditions are different .
some places require a certain length of residence before having the right . " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : conservatives want to keep the law for local elections hans-peter uhl , a member of the conservative 's bundestag faction for interior affairs , said he believes that the law should remain as it is . " germany belongs to the people of the state , " he said .
" who does n't want this to be the basic law of the land ? " he added , however , that eu citizens voting in local elections made sense but ruled out a widespread voting law encompassing all non-germans . uhl said he believes such a law would be unconstitutional and that the only reason the social democrats , greens and the left party support the initiative to expand their own potential electorate to non-eu citizens in germany as the number of foreigners increases . the law itself may have the final say .
in an article published in a legal journal in 1994 , brun otto bryde , a judge on the federal constitutional court - the highest in the land - wrote that foreigners who live , work , eat and drink in a state should also have some say in how that state is run .
they belong to the state , he wrote , and so the state should belong to them . marvin oppong -lrb- nda -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

20 , but only two of them are seen as having a real chance of winning : the current president boris tadic and tomislav nikolic , whose nationalistic and anti-western politics have gained popularity at home thanks to the european union 's backing of kosovo 's albanian government .

3 , a repeat of the last election in 2004 . democratic party leader tadic , who in 2004 became serbia 's first non-communist president since world war ii , has made it clear he sees his country 's future with the european union . " these elections are about choosing between two paths - in the direction of europe , which brings more stability and a better life , or the path of fools that directs serbia back to the 1990s , " tadic said . pro-russian nikolic his main opponent , nikolic , the acting head and presidential candidate of the serbian radical party , has taken a widely divergent view in the past , commenting in serbian parliament that he would prefer serbia to be a russian province than an eu member . in this campaign , however , nikolic has sought to distance himself from his previous hard-line rhetoric , saying he wants serbia to be a " link between the west and the east " and promoting a foreign policy of " cooperation not concessions . " but he has made his view on the eu 's support for kosovo independence clear , stating in a recent interview with the afp news agency that serbia should not join the eu as long as it is being " conditioned and humiliated " by brussels over kosovo . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : kosovo could tip public feeling against serbia 's president boris tadic the majority ethnic-albanian province has been administered by the united nations since a nato air war in 1999 ended a serbian crackdown on ethnic albanians , including separatist rebels . kosovo politicians , elected in december , said they intend to declare independence unilaterally soon .
but the united states and european union have pressured them to wait until after the serbian election before making any announcement . once independence is proclaimed , the eu plans to send a mission to replace the un . election failing to capture voter attention voters have failed to realize the upcoming elections are basically a referendum for or against europe , according to serbian market and media researcher srdjan bogosavljevic , " serbia 's citizens have n't yet realized how opposing the attitudes of the two favorites are , " bogosavljevic said .
" if there happens to be a change in power , then we will find ourselves in a complete reversal of direction . " austrian foreign minister ursula plassnik said just days before the election that serbia was " at a crossroads . " " in this sunday 's presidential elections , serbia 's population has a choice - to continue along the path of european convergence or to cut itself off from the rest of europe , " she added . dw staff -lrb- kh -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

while foreigners from eu countries can take part in local elections , those from outside the eu can not vote at all .
calls for a law change are growing . " jasmine " -lsb- name changed - eds. note -rsb- was born in germany .
like her parents , who hail from turkey , she holds a turkish passport .
she has successfully completed school exams to continue her studies at university and her educational performance was so good she got a scholarship to study medicine . despite this and the fact that she has spent her entire 23 years of life in germany , she does not have her say in how her state or the country is run . " jasmine " is not an isolated case .
while foreigners from european union members may vote in the local elections , she can not .
she also ca n't vote for the government which runs the country in which she was born and raised .
she is excluded from the german election process , like many others who have lived in germany for decades but hold turkish passports . those who have spoken up against the law tend to use similar arguments . " i believe that the chance to express your opinion at a public , municipal level helps promote integration , " said lale akgün , a migration and integration spokeswoman for the social democratic party 's parliamentary group .
" i ca n't see where there is a problem with someone deciding where a one-way street begins or where a kindergarten is setup . " akgün said other eu lands that have allowed foreigners to vote have experienced few problems at a municipal level and most eu citizens see that the right to vote among all those who live in a country is a step towards equality in society . moves to change law blocked by conservatives bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : young turkish women are among those with no vote in september 2007 , the states of berlin and the rhineland-palatinate introduced an initiative to the bundesrat , germany 's upper house of parliament , to allow foreigners from non-eu countries to vote in local elections .
the initiative has drawn vehement criticism from german conservatives . the following month , the greens party faction in the bundestag , the lower house of parliament , announced their own bill to change the law , in line with the previous social democratic-green government 's coalition agreement , in which municipal voting rights were a central theme .
so far , however , there has not been the necessary majority voting in favor of the bill to make it law . at a local level , a number of districts are in favor of a law change .
eight of a total of 13 towns in north rhine-westphalia which took part in a survey conducted by local broadcaster wdr supported a change to allow non-eu foreigners vote at a municipal level .
in hesse , frankfurt 's conservative mayor petra roth herself expressed support for a change in february 2007 . international trend towards wider voting rights on the international front , observers have noted a slow but definite trend developing . " more and more countries are introducing local voting rights for foreigners , " said dietrich thränhardt , a professor comparative governance and migration research at the university of münster .
" possibly half of the organization for economic co-operation and development -lrb- oecd -rrb- states already have such voting rights at local level , although there conditions are different .
some places require a certain length of residence before having the right . " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : conservatives want to keep the law for local elections hans-peter uhl , a member of the conservative 's bundestag faction for interior affairs , said he believes that the law should remain as it is . " germany belongs to the people of the state , " he said .
" who does n't want this to be the basic law of the land ? " he added , however , that eu citizens voting in local elections made sense but ruled out a widespread voting law encompassing all non-germans . uhl said he believes such a law would be unconstitutional and that the only reason the social democrats , greens and the left party support the initiative to expand their own potential electorate to non-eu citizens in germany as the number of foreigners increases . the law itself may have the final say .
in an article published in a legal journal in 1994 , brun otto bryde , a judge on the federal constitutional court - the highest in the land - wrote that foreigners who live , work , eat and drink in a state should also have some say in how that state is run .
they belong to the state , he wrote , and so the state should belong to them . marvin oppong -lrb- nda -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

while foreigners from european union members may vote in the local elections , she can not .
she also ca n't vote for the government which runs the country in which she was born and raised .
she is excluded from the german election process , like many others who have lived in germany for decades but hold turkish passports . those who have spoken up against the law tend to use similar arguments . " i believe that the chance to express your opinion at a public , municipal level helps promote integration , " said lale akgün , a migration and integration spokeswoman for the social democratic party 's parliamentary group .
" i ca n't see where there is a problem with someone deciding where a one-way street begins or where a kindergarten is setup .

the initiative has drawn vehement criticism from german conservatives . the following month , the greens party faction in the bundestag , the lower house of parliament , announced their own bill to change the law , in line with the previous social democratic-green government 's coalition agreement , in which municipal voting rights were a central theme .
so far , however , there has not been the necessary majority voting in favor of the bill to make it law . at a local level , a number of districts are in favor of a law change .

while foreigners from eu countries can take part in local elections , those from outside the eu can not vote at all .
calls for a law change are growing . " jasmine " -lsb- name changed - eds. note -rsb- was born in germany .
like her parents , who hail from turkey , she holds a turkish passport .
she has successfully completed school exams to continue her studies at university and her educational performance was so good she got a scholarship to study medicine . despite this and the fact that she has spent her entire 23 years of life in germany , she does not have her say in how her state or the country is run . " jasmine " is not an isolated case .
while foreigners from european union members may vote in the local elections , she can not .
she also ca n't vote for the government which runs the country in which she was born and raised .
she is excluded from the german election process , like many others who have lived in germany for decades but hold turkish passports . those who have spoken up against the law tend to use similar arguments . " i believe that the chance to express your opinion at a public , municipal level helps promote integration , " said lale akgün , a migration and integration spokeswoman for the social democratic party 's parliamentary group .
" i ca n't see where there is a problem with someone deciding where a one-way street begins or where a kindergarten is setup . " akgün said other eu lands that have allowed foreigners to vote have experienced few problems at a municipal level and most eu citizens see that the right to vote among all those who live in a country is a step towards equality in society . moves to change law blocked by conservatives bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : young turkish women are among those with no vote in september 2007 , the states of berlin and the rhineland-palatinate introduced an initiative to the bundesrat , germany 's upper house of parliament , to allow foreigners from non-eu countries to vote in local elections .
the initiative has drawn vehement criticism from german conservatives . the following month , the greens party faction in the bundestag , the lower house of parliament , announced their own bill to change the law , in line with the previous social democratic-green government 's coalition agreement , in which municipal voting rights were a central theme .
so far , however , there has not been the necessary majority voting in favor of the bill to make it law . at a local level , a number of districts are in favor of a law change .
eight of a total of 13 towns in north rhine-westphalia which took part in a survey conducted by local broadcaster wdr supported a change to allow non-eu foreigners vote at a municipal level .
in hesse , frankfurt 's conservative mayor petra roth herself expressed support for a change in february 2007 . international trend towards wider voting rights on the international front , observers have noted a slow but definite trend developing . " more and more countries are introducing local voting rights for foreigners , " said dietrich thränhardt , a professor comparative governance and migration research at the university of münster .
" possibly half of the organization for economic co-operation and development -lrb- oecd -rrb- states already have such voting rights at local level , although there conditions are different .
some places require a certain length of residence before having the right . " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : conservatives want to keep the law for local elections hans-peter uhl , a member of the conservative 's bundestag faction for interior affairs , said he believes that the law should remain as it is . " germany belongs to the people of the state , " he said .
" who does n't want this to be the basic law of the land ? " he added , however , that eu citizens voting in local elections made sense but ruled out a widespread voting law encompassing all non-germans . uhl said he believes such a law would be unconstitutional and that the only reason the social democrats , greens and the left party support the initiative to expand their own potential electorate to non-eu citizens in germany as the number of foreigners increases . the law itself may have the final say .
in an article published in a legal journal in 1994 , brun otto bryde , a judge on the federal constitutional court - the highest in the land - wrote that foreigners who live , work , eat and drink in a state should also have some say in how that state is run .
they belong to the state , he wrote , and so the state should belong to them . marvin oppong -lrb- nda -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

the premature accusations from german politicians that eu subsidies were used to move the factory to romania are wrong .
the charges are another example of a well-loved reaction : someone has to be held responsible whenever there are domestic problems , and the soulless bureaucratic machine in brussels can always take the blame .

it 's a part of the collectively sought after single market . it 's possible the finns also were n't all that happy back in the 90s when nokia decided to move from finland to bochum .

the key factors going into these decisions are usually expenses , such as salaries , energy , transportation and tax - not other promised benefits .

it 's a common occurrence in the eu 's single market and not the result of any bloc subsidies , says dw 's bernd riegert . there 's quite a bit the european union might be guilty of , but it 's not responsible for nokia 's decision to shut a factory in bochum .
the premature accusations from german politicians that eu subsidies were used to move the factory to romania are wrong .
the charges are another example of a well-loved reaction : someone has to be held responsible whenever there are domestic problems , and the soulless bureaucratic machine in brussels can always take the blame .
it 's not the first time that politicians have pointed to brussels - even though the problems are of their own making . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : in the north-rhine westphalia state election in 2005 , the scapegoat was an eu service industry initiative , which was brought about by none other than then-chancellor schröder .
then it was economics minister glos who thundered against an eu subsidy scandal when aeg moved a plant from nuremberg to poland , also in 2005 .
again in that instance , there was nothing behind the accusations . and now it 's nokia and bochum .
the finnish cell phone giant is moving to an industrial park in romania , whose first stage of construction was partially financed with eu funds seven years ago .
there is absolutely nothing to find fault with .
this kind of thing happens all over the eu , including in structurally weak parts of eastern germany and the ruhr region , which also receives eu funds . as painful a situation as it of course is for the employees involved in bochum , it is an everyday occurrence for european companies to set up their production wherever inside the european union they believe to have come across the best conditions .
it 's a part of the collectively sought after single market . it 's possible the finns also were n't all that happy back in the 90s when nokia decided to move from finland to bochum .
but there were n't any german politicians complaining then .
the awareness that a single european market has winners and sometimes even losers does not seem to be very pronounced .
eu commission president barroso was right when he said that , overall , the german economy is counted among the winners of the bloc 's growing market . it 's also not just foreign companies moving their production to other eu member states , but also german ones .
the key factors going into these decisions are usually expenses , such as salaries , energy , transportation and tax - not other promised benefits .
the subsidies are , at the most , an extra advertising tool used by the cities to attract companies . this competition also exists within germany and within north-rhine westphalia .
bochum , essen , oberhausen , cologne and düsseldorf : all of them compete with each other when it comes to attracting companies .

the premature accusations from german politicians that eu subsidies were used to move the factory to romania are wrong .
the charges are another example of a well-loved reaction : someone has to be held responsible whenever there are domestic problems , and the soulless bureaucratic machine in brussels can always take the blame .

eu commission president barroso was right when he said that , overall , the german economy is counted among the winners of the bloc 's growing market . it 's also not just foreign companies moving their production to other eu member states , but also german ones .

while foreigners from eu countries can take part in local elections , those from outside the eu can not vote at all .
calls for a law change are growing . " jasmine " -lsb- name changed - eds. note -rsb- was born in germany .
like her parents , who hail from turkey , she holds a turkish passport .
she has successfully completed school exams to continue her studies at university and her educational performance was so good she got a scholarship to study medicine . despite this and the fact that she has spent her entire 23 years of life in germany , she does not have her say in how her state or the country is run . " jasmine " is not an isolated case .
while foreigners from european union members may vote in the local elections , she can not .
she also ca n't vote for the government which runs the country in which she was born and raised .
she is excluded from the german election process , like many others who have lived in germany for decades but hold turkish passports . those who have spoken up against the law tend to use similar arguments . " i believe that the chance to express your opinion at a public , municipal level helps promote integration , " said lale akgün , a migration and integration spokeswoman for the social democratic party 's parliamentary group .
" i ca n't see where there is a problem with someone deciding where a one-way street begins or where a kindergarten is setup . " akgün said other eu lands that have allowed foreigners to vote have experienced few problems at a municipal level and most eu citizens see that the right to vote among all those who live in a country is a step towards equality in society . moves to change law blocked by conservatives bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : young turkish women are among those with no vote in september 2007 , the states of berlin and the rhineland-palatinate introduced an initiative to the bundesrat , germany 's upper house of parliament , to allow foreigners from non-eu countries to vote in local elections .
the initiative has drawn vehement criticism from german conservatives . the following month , the greens party faction in the bundestag , the lower house of parliament , announced their own bill to change the law , in line with the previous social democratic-green government 's coalition agreement , in which municipal voting rights were a central theme .
so far , however , there has not been the necessary majority voting in favor of the bill to make it law . at a local level , a number of districts are in favor of a law change .
eight of a total of 13 towns in north rhine-westphalia which took part in a survey conducted by local broadcaster wdr supported a change to allow non-eu foreigners vote at a municipal level .
in hesse , frankfurt 's conservative mayor petra roth herself expressed support for a change in february 2007 . international trend towards wider voting rights on the international front , observers have noted a slow but definite trend developing . " more and more countries are introducing local voting rights for foreigners , " said dietrich thränhardt , a professor comparative governance and migration research at the university of münster .
" possibly half of the organization for economic co-operation and development -lrb- oecd -rrb- states already have such voting rights at local level , although there conditions are different .
some places require a certain length of residence before having the right . " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : conservatives want to keep the law for local elections hans-peter uhl , a member of the conservative 's bundestag faction for interior affairs , said he believes that the law should remain as it is . " germany belongs to the people of the state , " he said .
" who does n't want this to be the basic law of the land ? " he added , however , that eu citizens voting in local elections made sense but ruled out a widespread voting law encompassing all non-germans . uhl said he believes such a law would be unconstitutional and that the only reason the social democrats , greens and the left party support the initiative to expand their own potential electorate to non-eu citizens in germany as the number of foreigners increases . the law itself may have the final say .
in an article published in a legal journal in 1994 , brun otto bryde , a judge on the federal constitutional court - the highest in the land - wrote that foreigners who live , work , eat and drink in a state should also have some say in how that state is run .
they belong to the state , he wrote , and so the state should belong to them . marvin oppong -lrb- nda -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

3 's second round run-off as serbia prepares for sunday 's presidential elections , eu support of kosovo 's independence could turn serbians away from the pro-west incumbent boris tadic in favor of euro-skeptic tomislav nikolic . there are nine candidates standing in the presidential elections on sunday , jan .
20 , but only two of them are seen as having a real chance of winning : the current president boris tadic and tomislav nikolic , whose nationalistic and anti-western politics have gained popularity at home thanks to the european union 's backing of kosovo 's albanian government .

3 , a repeat of the last election in 2004 . democratic party leader tadic , who in 2004 became serbia 's first non-communist president since world war ii , has made it clear he sees his country 's future with the european union . " these elections are about choosing between two paths - in the direction of europe , which brings more stability and a better life , or the path of fools that directs serbia back to the 1990s , " tadic said . pro-russian nikolic his main opponent , nikolic , the acting head and presidential candidate of the serbian radical party , has taken a widely divergent view in the past , commenting in serbian parliament that he would prefer serbia to be a russian province than an eu member . in this campaign , however , nikolic has sought to distance himself from his previous hard-line rhetoric , saying he wants serbia to be a " link between the west and the east " and promoting a foreign policy of " cooperation not concessions . " but he has made his view on the eu 's support for kosovo independence clear , stating in a recent interview with the afp news agency that serbia should not join the eu as long as it is being " conditioned and humiliated " by brussels over kosovo . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : kosovo could tip public feeling against serbia 's president boris tadic the majority ethnic-albanian province has been administered by the united nations since a nato air war in 1999 ended a serbian crackdown on ethnic albanians , including separatist rebels . kosovo politicians , elected in december , said they intend to declare independence unilaterally soon .
but the united states and european union have pressured them to wait until after the serbian election before making any announcement . once independence is proclaimed , the eu plans to send a mission to replace the un . election failing to capture voter attention voters have failed to realize the upcoming elections are basically a referendum for or against europe , according to serbian market and media researcher srdjan bogosavljevic , " serbia 's citizens have n't yet realized how opposing the attitudes of the two favorites are , " bogosavljevic said .
" if there happens to be a change in power , then we will find ourselves in a complete reversal of direction . " austrian foreign minister ursula plassnik said just days before the election that serbia was " at a crossroads . " " in this sunday 's presidential elections , serbia 's population has a choice - to continue along the path of european convergence or to cut itself off from the rest of europe , " she added . dw staff -lrb- kh -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

" jasmine " is not an isolated case .
while foreigners from european union members may vote in the local elections , she can not .
she also ca n't vote for the government which runs the country in which she was born and raised .
she is excluded from the german election process , like many others who have lived in germany for decades but hold turkish passports . those who have spoken up against the law tend to use similar arguments .

" i ca n't see where there is a problem with someone deciding where a one-way street begins or where a kindergarten is setup .

the initiative has drawn vehement criticism from german conservatives . the following month , the greens party faction in the bundestag , the lower house of parliament , announced their own bill to change the law , in line with the previous social democratic-green government 's coalition agreement , in which municipal voting rights were a central theme .
so far , however , there has not been the necessary majority voting in favor of the bill to make it law . at a local level , a number of districts are in favor of a law change .
eight of a total of 13 towns in north rhine-westphalia which took part in a survey conducted by local broadcaster wdr supported a change to allow non-eu foreigners vote at a municipal level .
in hesse , frankfurt 's conservative mayor petra roth herself expressed support for a change in february 2007 . international trend towards wider voting rights on the international front , observers have noted a slow but definite trend developing . " more and more countries are introducing local voting rights for foreigners , " said dietrich thränhardt , a professor comparative governance and migration research at the university of münster .

" germany belongs to the people of the state , " he said .
" who does n't want this to be the basic law of the land ? " he added , however , that eu citizens voting in local elections made sense but ruled out a widespread voting law encompassing all non-germans . uhl said he believes such a law would be unconstitutional and that the only reason the social democrats , greens and the left party support the initiative to expand their own potential electorate to non-eu citizens in germany as the number of foreigners increases . the law itself may have the final say .

16 , amid growing concern about the fallout from the us subprime mortgage crisis that has rattled markets since last year and cast a pall over the global economic outlook . lagarde , her british counterpart alistair darling , germany 's peer steinbrück and tommaso padoa-schioppa of italy discussed how to reach " a european strategy on all of the main issues of international finance , " a french finance ministry official said . heads of the four governments are scheduled to meet again on jan .
29 in london to expand on the finance ministers ' work and prepare a european position ahead of a february g7 meeting in tokyo .
other g7 members are the united states , canada and japan . crisis will continue bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the financial crisis continues to worry financial markets " we are dealing with a serious situation , " steinbrück said .
" the crisis is going to continue for the next few months . " but after the thursday meeting , lagarde said the fundamentals of the european economy were " good " and that financial and money markets were in a process of " gradual recovery . " eu monetary affairs commissioner joaquin almunia , who also took part in the talks , said the group had an optimistic outlook for the future . " we do not predict a pronounced economic slowdown , " he said officials said the biggest challenge facing the " european four " was finding a shared position on ways to increase market transparency , particularly in the banking sector , which has been hard hit by the us subprime mortgage crisis , and perhaps even strengthening the european union 's financial regulations . darling told reporters from a handful of european newspapers that the financial crisis was " significant " and required " rapid action . "
he also said the quartet of governments " share the objective of doing everything possible at government level , and separately by the central banks , to find a solution to the crisis on financial markets and prevent future crises . " insufficient risk evaluation bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : sachsenlb was bought out by another regional german bank the international monetary fund warned in a report this week that the crisis triggered by the collapse of the subprime mortgage market will likely produce deeper problems than expected because not all market players have come clean about their losses . after denying it would be affected by the crisis , german mortgage lender hypo real estate holdings said wednesday that it was taking a 400-million-euro -lrb- $ 586.2-million -rrb- hit from us credit investments .
the crisis has also caused serious funding problems for germany 's ikb institute and sachsenlb bank .
deutsche bank also announced this week that it would cut 300 jobs in its investment banking branch . the imf said the market 's current turmoil was in part due to institution with insufficient analysis of the risk posed by new financial products . eu finance ministers had agreed in december to step up coordination between their national financial surveillance bodies but germany and britain balked at a proposal from italy for eu-wide regulations for financial institutions . dw staff -lrb- sms -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de opinion -pipe- 19.01.2008 opinion : when in doubt , blame eu bureaucracy großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : german politicians should n't act so surprised by nokia 's decision to move from germany to romania .
it 's a common occurrence in the eu 's single market and not the result of any bloc subsidies , says dw 's bernd riegert . there 's quite a bit the european union might be guilty of , but it 's not responsible for nokia 's decision to shut a factory in bochum .
the premature accusations from german politicians that eu subsidies were used to move the factory to romania are wrong .
the charges are another example of a well-loved reaction : someone has to be held responsible whenever there are domestic problems , and the soulless bureaucratic machine in brussels can always take the blame .
it 's not the first time that politicians have pointed to brussels - even though the problems are of their own making . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : in the north-rhine westphalia state election in 2005 , the scapegoat was an eu service industry initiative , which was brought about by none other than then-chancellor schröder .
then it was economics minister glos who thundered against an eu subsidy scandal when aeg moved a plant from nuremberg to poland , also in 2005 .
again in that instance , there was nothing behind the accusations . and now it 's nokia and bochum .
the finnish cell phone giant is moving to an industrial park in romania , whose first stage of construction was partially financed with eu funds seven years ago .
there is absolutely nothing to find fault with .
this kind of thing happens all over the eu , including in structurally weak parts of eastern germany and the ruhr region , which also receives eu funds . as painful a situation as it of course is for the employees involved in bochum , it is an everyday occurrence for european companies to set up their production wherever inside the european union they believe to have come across the best conditions .
it 's a part of the collectively sought after single market . it 's possible the finns also were n't all that happy back in the 90s when nokia decided to move from finland to bochum .
but there were n't any german politicians complaining then .
the awareness that a single european market has winners and sometimes even losers does not seem to be very pronounced .
eu commission president barroso was right when he said that , overall , the german economy is counted among the winners of the bloc 's growing market . it 's also not just foreign companies moving their production to other eu member states , but also german ones .
the key factors going into these decisions are usually expenses , such as salaries , energy , transportation and tax - not other promised benefits .
the subsidies are , at the most , an extra advertising tool used by the cities to attract companies . this competition also exists within germany and within north-rhine westphalia .
bochum , essen , oberhausen , cologne and düsseldorf : all of them compete with each other when it comes to attracting companies .
at the european level those cities are replaced by germany , slovenia and romania . welcome to borderless single market . bernd riegert is dw-radio 's brussels correspondent -lrb- sms -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de opinion -pipe- 19.01.2008 opinion : when in doubt , blame eu bureaucracy großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : german politicians should n't act so surprised by nokia 's decision to move from germany to romania .
it 's a common occurrence in the eu 's single market and not the result of any bloc subsidies , says dw 's bernd riegert . there 's quite a bit the european union might be guilty of , but it 's not responsible for nokia 's decision to shut a factory in bochum .
the premature accusations from german politicians that eu subsidies were used to move the factory to romania are wrong .
the charges are another example of a well-loved reaction : someone has to be held responsible whenever there are domestic problems , and the soulless bureaucratic machine in brussels can always take the blame .
it 's not the first time that politicians have pointed to brussels - even though the problems are of their own making . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : in the north-rhine westphalia state election in 2005 , the scapegoat was an eu service industry initiative , which was brought about by none other than then-chancellor schröder .
then it was economics minister glos who thundered against an eu subsidy scandal when aeg moved a plant from nuremberg to poland , also in 2005 .
again in that instance , there was nothing behind the accusations . and now it 's nokia and bochum .
the finnish cell phone giant is moving to an industrial park in romania , whose first stage of construction was partially financed with eu funds seven years ago .
there is absolutely nothing to find fault with .
this kind of thing happens all over the eu , including in structurally weak parts of eastern germany and the ruhr region , which also receives eu funds . as painful a situation as it of course is for the employees involved in bochum , it is an everyday occurrence for european companies to set up their production wherever inside the european union they believe to have come across the best conditions .
it 's a part of the collectively sought after single market . it 's possible the finns also were n't all that happy back in the 90s when nokia decided to move from finland to bochum .
but there were n't any german politicians complaining then .
the awareness that a single european market has winners and sometimes even losers does not seem to be very pronounced .
eu commission president barroso was right when he said that , overall , the german economy is counted among the winners of the bloc 's growing market . it 's also not just foreign companies moving their production to other eu member states , but also german ones .
the key factors going into these decisions are usually expenses , such as salaries , energy , transportation and tax - not other promised benefits .
the subsidies are , at the most , an extra advertising tool used by the cities to attract companies . this competition also exists within germany and within north-rhine westphalia .
bochum , essen , oberhausen , cologne and düsseldorf : all of them compete with each other when it comes to attracting companies .
at the european level those cities are replaced by germany , slovenia and romania . welcome to borderless single market . bernd riegert is dw-radio 's brussels correspondent -lrb- sms -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

16 , amid growing concern about the fallout from the us subprime mortgage crisis that has rattled markets since last year and cast a pall over the global economic outlook . lagarde , her british counterpart alistair darling , germany 's peer steinbrück and tommaso padoa-schioppa of italy discussed how to reach " a european strategy on all of the main issues of international finance , " a french finance ministry official said . heads of the four governments are scheduled to meet again on jan .

" the crisis is going to continue for the next few months .

" eu monetary affairs commissioner joaquin almunia , who also took part in the talks , said the group had an optimistic outlook for the future . " we do not predict a pronounced economic slowdown , " he said officials said the biggest challenge facing the " european four " was finding a shared position on ways to increase market transparency , particularly in the banking sector , which has been hard hit by the us subprime mortgage crisis , and perhaps even strengthening the european union 's financial regulations . darling told reporters from a handful of european newspapers that the financial crisis was " significant " and required " rapid action .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de opinion -pipe- 19.01.2008 opinion : when in doubt , blame eu bureaucracy großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : german politicians should n't act so surprised by nokia 's decision to move from germany to romania .
it 's a common occurrence in the eu 's single market and not the result of any bloc subsidies , says dw 's bernd riegert . there 's quite a bit the european union might be guilty of , but it 's not responsible for nokia 's decision to shut a factory in bochum .
the premature accusations from german politicians that eu subsidies were used to move the factory to romania are wrong .
the charges are another example of a well-loved reaction : someone has to be held responsible whenever there are domestic problems , and the soulless bureaucratic machine in brussels can always take the blame .
it 's not the first time that politicians have pointed to brussels - even though the problems are of their own making . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : in the north-rhine westphalia state election in 2005 , the scapegoat was an eu service industry initiative , which was brought about by none other than then-chancellor schröder .
then it was economics minister glos who thundered against an eu subsidy scandal when aeg moved a plant from nuremberg to poland , also in 2005 .
again in that instance , there was nothing behind the accusations . and now it 's nokia and bochum .
the finnish cell phone giant is moving to an industrial park in romania , whose first stage of construction was partially financed with eu funds seven years ago .
there is absolutely nothing to find fault with .
this kind of thing happens all over the eu , including in structurally weak parts of eastern germany and the ruhr region , which also receives eu funds . as painful a situation as it of course is for the employees involved in bochum , it is an everyday occurrence for european companies to set up their production wherever inside the european union they believe to have come across the best conditions .
it 's a part of the collectively sought after single market . it 's possible the finns also were n't all that happy back in the 90s when nokia decided to move from finland to bochum .
but there were n't any german politicians complaining then .
the awareness that a single european market has winners and sometimes even losers does not seem to be very pronounced .
eu commission president barroso was right when he said that , overall , the german economy is counted among the winners of the bloc 's growing market . it 's also not just foreign companies moving their production to other eu member states , but also german ones .
the key factors going into these decisions are usually expenses , such as salaries , energy , transportation and tax - not other promised benefits .
the subsidies are , at the most , an extra advertising tool used by the cities to attract companies . this competition also exists within germany and within north-rhine westphalia .
bochum , essen , oberhausen , cologne and düsseldorf : all of them compete with each other when it comes to attracting companies .
at the european level those cities are replaced by germany , slovenia and romania . welcome to borderless single market . bernd riegert is dw-radio 's brussels correspondent -lrb- sms -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

" eu monetary affairs commissioner joaquin almunia , who also took part in the talks , said the group had an optimistic outlook for the future . " we do not predict a pronounced economic slowdown , " he said officials said the biggest challenge facing the " european four " was finding a shared position on ways to increase market transparency , particularly in the banking sector , which has been hard hit by the us subprime mortgage crisis , and perhaps even strengthening the european union 's financial regulations . darling told reporters from a handful of european newspapers that the financial crisis was " significant " and required " rapid action .

the crisis has also caused serious funding problems for germany 's ikb institute and sachsenlb bank .

it 's a common occurrence in the eu 's single market and not the result of any bloc subsidies , says dw 's bernd riegert . there 's quite a bit the european union might be guilty of , but it 's not responsible for nokia 's decision to shut a factory in bochum .
the premature accusations from german politicians that eu subsidies were used to move the factory to romania are wrong .
the charges are another example of a well-loved reaction : someone has to be held responsible whenever there are domestic problems , and the soulless bureaucratic machine in brussels can always take the blame .
it 's not the first time that politicians have pointed to brussels - even though the problems are of their own making . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : in the north-rhine westphalia state election in 2005 , the scapegoat was an eu service industry initiative , which was brought about by none other than then-chancellor schröder .
then it was economics minister glos who thundered against an eu subsidy scandal when aeg moved a plant from nuremberg to poland , also in 2005 .
again in that instance , there was nothing behind the accusations . and now it 's nokia and bochum .
the finnish cell phone giant is moving to an industrial park in romania , whose first stage of construction was partially financed with eu funds seven years ago .
there is absolutely nothing to find fault with .
this kind of thing happens all over the eu , including in structurally weak parts of eastern germany and the ruhr region , which also receives eu funds . as painful a situation as it of course is for the employees involved in bochum , it is an everyday occurrence for european companies to set up their production wherever inside the european union they believe to have come across the best conditions .
it 's a part of the collectively sought after single market . it 's possible the finns also were n't all that happy back in the 90s when nokia decided to move from finland to bochum .
but there were n't any german politicians complaining then .
the awareness that a single european market has winners and sometimes even losers does not seem to be very pronounced .
eu commission president barroso was right when he said that , overall , the german economy is counted among the winners of the bloc 's growing market . it 's also not just foreign companies moving their production to other eu member states , but also german ones .
the key factors going into these decisions are usually expenses , such as salaries , energy , transportation and tax - not other promised benefits .
the subsidies are , at the most , an extra advertising tool used by the cities to attract companies . this competition also exists within germany and within north-rhine westphalia .
bochum , essen , oberhausen , cologne and düsseldorf : all of them compete with each other when it comes to attracting companies .
at the european level those cities are replaced by germany , slovenia and romania . welcome to borderless single market . bernd riegert is dw-radio 's brussels correspondent -lrb- sms -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

the initiative has drawn vehement criticism from german conservatives . the following month , the greens party faction in the bundestag , the lower house of parliament , announced their own bill to change the law , in line with the previous social democratic-green government 's coalition agreement , in which municipal voting rights were a central theme .
so far , however , there has not been the necessary majority voting in favor of the bill to make it law . at a local level , a number of districts are in favor of a law change .
eight of a total of 13 towns in north rhine-westphalia which took part in a survey conducted by local broadcaster wdr supported a change to allow non-eu foreigners vote at a municipal level .

while foreigners from eu countries can take part in local elections , those from outside the eu can not vote at all .
calls for a law change are growing . " jasmine " -lsb- name changed - eds. note -rsb- was born in germany .
like her parents , who hail from turkey , she holds a turkish passport .
she has successfully completed school exams to continue her studies at university and her educational performance was so good she got a scholarship to study medicine . despite this and the fact that she has spent her entire 23 years of life in germany , she does not have her say in how her state or the country is run . " jasmine " is not an isolated case .
while foreigners from european union members may vote in the local elections , she can not .
she also ca n't vote for the government which runs the country in which she was born and raised .
she is excluded from the german election process , like many others who have lived in germany for decades but hold turkish passports . those who have spoken up against the law tend to use similar arguments . " i believe that the chance to express your opinion at a public , municipal level helps promote integration , " said lale akgün , a migration and integration spokeswoman for the social democratic party 's parliamentary group .
" i ca n't see where there is a problem with someone deciding where a one-way street begins or where a kindergarten is setup . " akgün said other eu lands that have allowed foreigners to vote have experienced few problems at a municipal level and most eu citizens see that the right to vote among all those who live in a country is a step towards equality in society . moves to change law blocked by conservatives bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : young turkish women are among those with no vote in september 2007 , the states of berlin and the rhineland-palatinate introduced an initiative to the bundesrat , germany 's upper house of parliament , to allow foreigners from non-eu countries to vote in local elections .
the initiative has drawn vehement criticism from german conservatives . the following month , the greens party faction in the bundestag , the lower house of parliament , announced their own bill to change the law , in line with the previous social democratic-green government 's coalition agreement , in which municipal voting rights were a central theme .
so far , however , there has not been the necessary majority voting in favor of the bill to make it law . at a local level , a number of districts are in favor of a law change .
eight of a total of 13 towns in north rhine-westphalia which took part in a survey conducted by local broadcaster wdr supported a change to allow non-eu foreigners vote at a municipal level .
in hesse , frankfurt 's conservative mayor petra roth herself expressed support for a change in february 2007 . international trend towards wider voting rights on the international front , observers have noted a slow but definite trend developing . " more and more countries are introducing local voting rights for foreigners , " said dietrich thränhardt , a professor comparative governance and migration research at the university of münster .
" possibly half of the organization for economic co-operation and development -lrb- oecd -rrb- states already have such voting rights at local level , although there conditions are different .
some places require a certain length of residence before having the right . " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : conservatives want to keep the law for local elections hans-peter uhl , a member of the conservative 's bundestag faction for interior affairs , said he believes that the law should remain as it is . " germany belongs to the people of the state , " he said .
" who does n't want this to be the basic law of the land ? " he added , however , that eu citizens voting in local elections made sense but ruled out a widespread voting law encompassing all non-germans . uhl said he believes such a law would be unconstitutional and that the only reason the social democrats , greens and the left party support the initiative to expand their own potential electorate to non-eu citizens in germany as the number of foreigners increases . the law itself may have the final say .
in an article published in a legal journal in 1994 , brun otto bryde , a judge on the federal constitutional court - the highest in the land - wrote that foreigners who live , work , eat and drink in a state should also have some say in how that state is run .
they belong to the state , he wrote , and so the state should belong to them . marvin oppong -lrb- nda -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

while foreigners from european union members may vote in the local elections , she can not .

the initiative has drawn vehement criticism from german conservatives . the following month , the greens party faction in the bundestag , the lower house of parliament , announced their own bill to change the law , in line with the previous social democratic-green government 's coalition agreement , in which municipal voting rights were a central theme .
so far , however , there has not been the necessary majority voting in favor of the bill to make it law . at a local level , a number of districts are in favor of a law change .

3 's second round run-off as serbia prepares for sunday 's presidential elections , eu support of kosovo 's independence could turn serbians away from the pro-west incumbent boris tadic in favor of euro-skeptic tomislav nikolic . there are nine candidates standing in the presidential elections on sunday , jan .
20 , but only two of them are seen as having a real chance of winning : the current president boris tadic and tomislav nikolic , whose nationalistic and anti-western politics have gained popularity at home thanks to the european union 's backing of kosovo 's albanian government .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : tomislav nikolic 's is known for his ultra-nationalistic views polls and analysts say neither of the two favorites will get a first round majority , and tadic and nikolic will fight a run-off on feb .
3 , a repeat of the last election in 2004 . democratic party leader tadic , who in 2004 became serbia 's first non-communist president since world war ii , has made it clear he sees his country 's future with the european union . " these elections are about choosing between two paths - in the direction of europe , which brings more stability and a better life , or the path of fools that directs serbia back to the 1990s , " tadic said . pro-russian nikolic his main opponent , nikolic , the acting head and presidential candidate of the serbian radical party , has taken a widely divergent view in the past , commenting in serbian parliament that he would prefer serbia to be a russian province than an eu member . in this campaign , however , nikolic has sought to distance himself from his previous hard-line rhetoric , saying he wants serbia to be a " link between the west and the east " and promoting a foreign policy of " cooperation not concessions . " but he has made his view on the eu 's support for kosovo independence clear , stating in a recent interview with the afp news agency that serbia should not join the eu as long as it is being " conditioned and humiliated " by brussels over kosovo . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : kosovo could tip public feeling against serbia 's president boris tadic the majority ethnic-albanian province has been administered by the united nations since a nato air war in 1999 ended a serbian crackdown on ethnic albanians , including separatist rebels . kosovo politicians , elected in december , said they intend to declare independence unilaterally soon .
but the united states and european union have pressured them to wait until after the serbian election before making any announcement . once independence is proclaimed , the eu plans to send a mission to replace the un . election failing to capture voter attention voters have failed to realize the upcoming elections are basically a referendum for or against europe , according to serbian market and media researcher srdjan bogosavljevic , " serbia 's citizens have n't yet realized how opposing the attitudes of the two favorites are , " bogosavljevic said .
" if there happens to be a change in power , then we will find ourselves in a complete reversal of direction . " austrian foreign minister ursula plassnik said just days before the election that serbia was " at a crossroads . " " in this sunday 's presidential elections , serbia 's population has a choice - to continue along the path of european convergence or to cut itself off from the rest of europe , " she added . dw staff -lrb- kh -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

it 's a common occurrence in the eu 's single market and not the result of any bloc subsidies , says dw 's bernd riegert . there 's quite a bit the european union might be guilty of , but it 's not responsible for nokia 's decision to shut a factory in bochum .
the premature accusations from german politicians that eu subsidies were used to move the factory to romania are wrong .
the charges are another example of a well-loved reaction : someone has to be held responsible whenever there are domestic problems , and the soulless bureaucratic machine in brussels can always take the blame .
it 's not the first time that politicians have pointed to brussels - even though the problems are of their own making . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : in the north-rhine westphalia state election in 2005 , the scapegoat was an eu service industry initiative , which was brought about by none other than then-chancellor schröder .
then it was economics minister glos who thundered against an eu subsidy scandal when aeg moved a plant from nuremberg to poland , also in 2005 .
again in that instance , there was nothing behind the accusations . and now it 's nokia and bochum .
the finnish cell phone giant is moving to an industrial park in romania , whose first stage of construction was partially financed with eu funds seven years ago .
there is absolutely nothing to find fault with .
this kind of thing happens all over the eu , including in structurally weak parts of eastern germany and the ruhr region , which also receives eu funds . as painful a situation as it of course is for the employees involved in bochum , it is an everyday occurrence for european companies to set up their production wherever inside the european union they believe to have come across the best conditions .
it 's a part of the collectively sought after single market . it 's possible the finns also were n't all that happy back in the 90s when nokia decided to move from finland to bochum .
but there were n't any german politicians complaining then .
the awareness that a single european market has winners and sometimes even losers does not seem to be very pronounced .
eu commission president barroso was right when he said that , overall , the german economy is counted among the winners of the bloc 's growing market . it 's also not just foreign companies moving their production to other eu member states , but also german ones .
the key factors going into these decisions are usually expenses , such as salaries , energy , transportation and tax - not other promised benefits .
the subsidies are , at the most , an extra advertising tool used by the cities to attract companies . this competition also exists within germany and within north-rhine westphalia .
bochum , essen , oberhausen , cologne and düsseldorf : all of them compete with each other when it comes to attracting companies .

" if there happens to be a change in power , then we will find ourselves in a complete reversal of direction . " austrian foreign minister ursula plassnik said just days before the election that serbia was " at a crossroads .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de opinion -pipe- 19.01.2008 opinion : when in doubt , blame eu bureaucracy großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : german politicians should n't act so surprised by nokia 's decision to move from germany to romania .
it 's a common occurrence in the eu 's single market and not the result of any bloc subsidies , says dw 's bernd riegert . there 's quite a bit the european union might be guilty of , but it 's not responsible for nokia 's decision to shut a factory in bochum .
the premature accusations from german politicians that eu subsidies were used to move the factory to romania are wrong .
the charges are another example of a well-loved reaction : someone has to be held responsible whenever there are domestic problems , and the soulless bureaucratic machine in brussels can always take the blame .
it 's not the first time that politicians have pointed to brussels - even though the problems are of their own making . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : in the north-rhine westphalia state election in 2005 , the scapegoat was an eu service industry initiative , which was brought about by none other than then-chancellor schröder .
then it was economics minister glos who thundered against an eu subsidy scandal when aeg moved a plant from nuremberg to poland , also in 2005 .
again in that instance , there was nothing behind the accusations . and now it 's nokia and bochum .
the finnish cell phone giant is moving to an industrial park in romania , whose first stage of construction was partially financed with eu funds seven years ago .
there is absolutely nothing to find fault with .
this kind of thing happens all over the eu , including in structurally weak parts of eastern germany and the ruhr region , which also receives eu funds . as painful a situation as it of course is for the employees involved in bochum , it is an everyday occurrence for european companies to set up their production wherever inside the european union they believe to have come across the best conditions .
it 's a part of the collectively sought after single market . it 's possible the finns also were n't all that happy back in the 90s when nokia decided to move from finland to bochum .
but there were n't any german politicians complaining then .
the awareness that a single european market has winners and sometimes even losers does not seem to be very pronounced .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de opinion -pipe- 19.01.2008 opinion : when in doubt , blame eu bureaucracy großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : german politicians should n't act so surprised by nokia 's decision to move from germany to romania .
it 's a common occurrence in the eu 's single market and not the result of any bloc subsidies , says dw 's bernd riegert . there 's quite a bit the european union might be guilty of , but it 's not responsible for nokia 's decision to shut a factory in bochum .
the premature accusations from german politicians that eu subsidies were used to move the factory to romania are wrong .
the charges are another example of a well-loved reaction : someone has to be held responsible whenever there are domestic problems , and the soulless bureaucratic machine in brussels can always take the blame .
it 's not the first time that politicians have pointed to brussels - even though the problems are of their own making . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : in the north-rhine westphalia state election in 2005 , the scapegoat was an eu service industry initiative , which was brought about by none other than then-chancellor schröder .
then it was economics minister glos who thundered against an eu subsidy scandal when aeg moved a plant from nuremberg to poland , also in 2005 .
again in that instance , there was nothing behind the accusations . and now it 's nokia and bochum .
the finnish cell phone giant is moving to an industrial park in romania , whose first stage of construction was partially financed with eu funds seven years ago .
there is absolutely nothing to find fault with .
this kind of thing happens all over the eu , including in structurally weak parts of eastern germany and the ruhr region , which also receives eu funds . as painful a situation as it of course is for the employees involved in bochum , it is an everyday occurrence for european companies to set up their production wherever inside the european union they believe to have come across the best conditions .
it 's a part of the collectively sought after single market . it 's possible the finns also were n't all that happy back in the 90s when nokia decided to move from finland to bochum .
but there were n't any german politicians complaining then .
the awareness that a single european market has winners and sometimes even losers does not seem to be very pronounced .
eu commission president barroso was right when he said that , overall , the german economy is counted among the winners of the bloc 's growing market . it 's also not just foreign companies moving their production to other eu member states , but also german ones .
the key factors going into these decisions are usually expenses , such as salaries , energy , transportation and tax - not other promised benefits .
the subsidies are , at the most , an extra advertising tool used by the cities to attract companies . this competition also exists within germany and within north-rhine westphalia .
bochum , essen , oberhausen , cologne and düsseldorf : all of them compete with each other when it comes to attracting companies .
at the european level those cities are replaced by germany , slovenia and romania . welcome to borderless single market . bernd riegert is dw-radio 's brussels correspondent -lrb- sms -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

it 's a common occurrence in the eu 's single market and not the result of any bloc subsidies , says dw 's bernd riegert . there 's quite a bit the european union might be guilty of , but it 's not responsible for nokia 's decision to shut a factory in bochum .
the premature accusations from german politicians that eu subsidies were used to move the factory to romania are wrong .
the charges are another example of a well-loved reaction : someone has to be held responsible whenever there are domestic problems , and the soulless bureaucratic machine in brussels can always take the blame .
it 's not the first time that politicians have pointed to brussels - even though the problems are of their own making . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : in the north-rhine westphalia state election in 2005 , the scapegoat was an eu service industry initiative , which was brought about by none other than then-chancellor schröder .
then it was economics minister glos who thundered against an eu subsidy scandal when aeg moved a plant from nuremberg to poland , also in 2005 .
again in that instance , there was nothing behind the accusations . and now it 's nokia and bochum .
the finnish cell phone giant is moving to an industrial park in romania , whose first stage of construction was partially financed with eu funds seven years ago .
there is absolutely nothing to find fault with .
this kind of thing happens all over the eu , including in structurally weak parts of eastern germany and the ruhr region , which also receives eu funds . as painful a situation as it of course is for the employees involved in bochum , it is an everyday occurrence for european companies to set up their production wherever inside the european union they believe to have come across the best conditions .
it 's a part of the collectively sought after single market . it 's possible the finns also were n't all that happy back in the 90s when nokia decided to move from finland to bochum .
but there were n't any german politicians complaining then .
the awareness that a single european market has winners and sometimes even losers does not seem to be very pronounced .
eu commission president barroso was right when he said that , overall , the german economy is counted among the winners of the bloc 's growing market . it 's also not just foreign companies moving their production to other eu member states , but also german ones .
the key factors going into these decisions are usually expenses , such as salaries , energy , transportation and tax - not other promised benefits .
the subsidies are , at the most , an extra advertising tool used by the cities to attract companies . this competition also exists within germany and within north-rhine westphalia .
bochum , essen , oberhausen , cologne and düsseldorf : all of them compete with each other when it comes to attracting companies .
at the european level those cities are replaced by germany , slovenia and romania . welcome to borderless single market . bernd riegert is dw-radio 's brussels correspondent -lrb- sms -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

3 's second round run-off as serbia prepares for sunday 's presidential elections , eu support of kosovo 's independence could turn serbians away from the pro-west incumbent boris tadic in favor of euro-skeptic tomislav nikolic . there are nine candidates standing in the presidential elections on sunday , jan .

" these elections are about choosing between two paths - in the direction of europe , which brings more stability and a better life , or the path of fools that directs serbia back to the 1990s , " tadic said . pro-russian nikolic his main opponent , nikolic , the acting head and presidential candidate of the serbian radical party , has taken a widely divergent view in the past , commenting in serbian parliament that he would prefer serbia to be a russian province than an eu member . in this campaign , however , nikolic has sought to distance himself from his previous hard-line rhetoric , saying he wants serbia to be a " link between the west and the east " and promoting a foreign policy of " cooperation not concessions . " but he has made his view on the eu 's support for kosovo independence clear , stating in a recent interview with the afp news agency that serbia should not join the eu as long as it is being " conditioned and humiliated " by brussels over kosovo . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : kosovo could tip public feeling against serbia 's president boris tadic the majority ethnic-albanian province has been administered by the united nations since a nato air war in 1999 ended a serbian crackdown on ethnic albanians , including separatist rebels . kosovo politicians , elected in december , said they intend to declare independence unilaterally soon .
but the united states and european union have pressured them to wait until after the serbian election before making any announcement . once independence is proclaimed , the eu plans to send a mission to replace the un . election failing to capture voter attention voters have failed to realize the upcoming elections are basically a referendum for or against europe , according to serbian market and media researcher srdjan bogosavljevic , " serbia 's citizens have n't yet realized how opposing the attitudes of the two favorites are , " bogosavljevic said .
" if there happens to be a change in power , then we will find ourselves in a complete reversal of direction . " austrian foreign minister ursula plassnik said just days before the election that serbia was " at a crossroads .

police said the laptop was taken from a vehicle which had been parked in the edgbaston area of birmingham .
it contains data including passport numbers , national insurance numbers and bank details .
they relate to people who had expressed an interest in , or joined , the royal navy , royal marines and the raf .
separately , hundreds of documents containing sensitive personal data have been found dumped on a roundabout in devon .
details of benefit claims , passport photocopies and mortgage payments were included in the confidential data found near exeter airport . "
the idea that someone could have the computer with the information unencrypted , it is on a par with the hmrc loss " simon davies , privacy international last november , it emerged that 25m child benefit records had been lost after hm revenue and customs -lrb- hmrc -rrb- sent two unregistered and unencrypted discs to the national audit office .
the mod said it was treating this latest theft with the " utmost seriousness " .
the police said they received a report that the laptop had been stolen from a car parked in edgbaston on 10 january .
" the information held is not the same for every individual , " the mod said .
" in some cases , for casual enquiries , the record is no more than a name .
" but for those who progressed as far as submitting an application to join the forces , extensive personal data may be held , including passport details , national insurance numbers , drivers ' licence details , family details , doctors ' addresses and national health service numbers . "
the mod said it was writing to 3,500 people whose bank details were on the laptop 's database .
it said it was working with the association for payment clearing services to inform the relevant banks and ensure that accounts affected are " flagged for scrutiny against unauthorised access " . "
it 's just been too easy for data to go missing recently " liam fox shadow defence secretary simon davies , from pressure group privacy international , told bbc news 24 he was " flabbergasted " .
" i can not believe that our flagship security agency can not get this right , " mr davies said .
" the idea that someone could have the computer with the information unencrypted - it is on a par with the hmrc loss . "
' quite concerning ' mr davies said the theft was " reminiscent of so many data breaches " .
" there are so many procedures and no-one knows which procedure is in place , " he said .
have your say " the first thing they should do is stop putting the data onto laptops " llew g , newbury send us your comments information commissioner richard thomas said the incident was " a stark illustration of the potency of personal information in a database world " .
" we will require satisfactory answers from the mod about their data protection practices and a firm assurance that steps have been taken to improve these practices before deciding on the appropriate action to take , " he said .
shadow defence secretary liam fox told bbc news 24 that the theft was " clearly quite concerning " .
" i think that the police will be wanting to check in the first instance that there is no real risk of security lapses , " he said . "
you can not trust any system you invent to store this much data in one place " nick harvey lib dem defence spokesman " it 's just been too easy for data to go missing recently and we need to look at how to protect the details of the public . "
he said he had spoken to defence secretary des browne and agreed that the matter would be discussed in the house of commons next week .
nick harvey , lib dem defence spokesman , said the incident was further proof of the dangers of a national id card system .
" if anybody is entertaining lingering support for the idea ... surely this would worry anybody into realising that you can not trust any system you invent to store this much data in one place , " mr harvey said .
douglas young , of the british armed forces federation , said : " it really is very , very worrying and i 'm deeply concerned to hear this .
" there must be a top level investigation . "

the village of penrhos and riverside near pwllhelli are frequently cut off by flood water .
people living there have described the situation as " critical " and have called for improvements to be made to prevent further flooding .
the environment agency said as much work as possible , given the money available , had been carried out .
gwynedd councillor penri jones said flooding of the a499 at penrhos village and near riverside at pwllheli was leading to misery for people living there .
" this is the main artery in the lleyn and it is frequently closed , " said mr jones .
" in addition the floods prevent people travelling to work , and prevents emergency services getting through . "
i 'm scared something will happen when i 'm not there sharon jones , householder improvement works on another nearby road had been spoilt , he added , because large lorries which had been redirected there , had churned up the grass verges turning them into " a sea of mud " .
" i accept that there is such a thing as global warming , and the county council has not received enough funding but the situation is critical and something needs to be done , " he added .
residents have said that when the area is flooded they face diversions along unsuitable narrow country lanes which lead to long journey times or are forced to stay at home .
" it usually happens on around two days every year , " said the reverend meirion lloyd davies , who has lived at penrhos for 12 years .
" we have to use another route which is only a few miles longer but is along incredibly narrow lanes where you have to reverse back if anyone comes towards you . "
the road near penrhos is regularly flooded sharon jones , had to be rescued by boat from her home in riverside , with her two children now aged eight and five , when 10 inches -lrb- 25cm -rrb- of water rushed into her house in 2006 .
the family , along with the five adjoining properties , have since been given flood gates by the environment agency to block all entrances to help prevent further flooding .
" thursday last week was particularly bad here , " she said .
we have done as much as we can , with the money available , to protect as many people as we can environment agency spokesman " we woke up and the water was already high -lrb- in the river -rrb- so it was very difficult to put the gates in place .
" i 've left them in now though , and just climb over them when i need to get out of the house , because i 'm scared something will happen when i 'm not there . "
she said that when the water levels rose , she was often forced to pick her children up from school early or they would be stranded from home .
an environment agency spokesman said two nearby streams sometimes overflowed into each other causing problems in riverside .
" we are hoping the flood gates given to individual properties will provide as much protection as possible , " he said .
at penrhos there was a similar situation , he added .
" we have done as much as we can , with the money available , to protect as many people as we can . "

one of the best-loved characters in the show , vera died in an armchair as her husband jack was in the rovers return .
actress liz dawn , 68 , who played vera since 1971 , is retiring because she suffers from chronic lung disease .
some 12.5 million viewers watched between 1945-2000 gmt , according to unofficial overnight figures .
three different death scenes had been written , with the final end filmed under tight security .
' wonderful woman ' dawn said : " i have had 33 marvellous years in coronation street and will miss everyone very much .
" it was very emotional filming vera 's death scenes but i do think it was the right decision for the character . "
actor bill tarmey , who has played her husband jack for almost 30 years , called dawn a " wonderful woman " .
" we have never had a cross word .
she only left a few weeks ago but i already miss walking on set and seeing her there and i miss working with her . "
together , the pair became one of the most enduring soap opera partnerships , which ended with jack tearfully watching funeral directors taking away vera 's body .
vera 's early years in coronation street revolved around work at the factory with friends including ivy tilsley .
while her marriage to jack was often stormy , her only son terry caused her no end of heartache , culminating in his sale of her grandson tommy .
her high point came when the duckworths temporarily took charge of the rovers pub .

vera 's best friend was ivy tilsley actor bill tarmey , who has played her husband jack for almost 30 years , called dawn a " wonderful woman " .
" we have never had a cross word .
she only left a few weeks ago but i already miss walking on set and seeing her there and i miss working with her . "
together , the pair became one of the most enduring soap opera partnerships , which ended with jack tearfully watching funeral directors taking away vera 's body .
vera 's early years in coronation street revolved around work at the factory with friends including ivy tilsley .
while her marriage to jack was often stormy , her only son terry caused her no end of heartache , culminating in his sale of her grandson tommy .
her high point came when the duckworths temporarily took charge of the rovers pub .
