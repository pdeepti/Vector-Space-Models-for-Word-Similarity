the united nations ' security council gave its formal green-light to the eu mission , which is to last for one year at a cost of 8.3 million euros -lrb- $ 10.5 million -rrb- last week .
the eu force takes over from nato 's own flotilla , which has been patrolling the somali coast since late october .
but as the eu force prepares to take over the responsiblility of patrolling the waters off somalia , a number of factors are casting a shadow over the mission .
earlier this week , eu foreign policy chief javier solana conceded that there were still a number of legal issues that needed to be resolved .
one concerns the different rules which eu member states apply on the detention of pirates .
" we need to coordinate that , but every country has a position - and that position is that they will not allow pirates to play around , " solana said .
nato commanders have also stressed the need for a more permanent solution to the patrols off the somali coast .
but officials note that any decision will likely require months of discussions .
" nato is indeed studying a longer-term role ... but there 's a lot of water on this globe , and this issue will be on the agenda for some time to come , " the nato chief said .
eu efforts were thrown further into doubt on friday when germany said that it would be reluctant to " actively " pursue somali pirates under its commitments to the eu security mission unless national interests were at stake .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : steinmeier and jung want national interests to be a priority " arresting people suspected of piracy is not the primary objective of the -lrb- german -rrb- operation , " foreign minister frank-walter steinmeier and defense minister franz josef jung wrote in a letter addressed to lawmakers , according to ard public television and saturday 's edition of frankfurter allgemeine zeitung newspaper .
in the letter berlin had drawn up a list of priority cases in which it is willing to deploy its navy to combat the pirates .
a decision setting out the terms of germany 's contribution to the mission is due to be made public on wednesday .
" we must protect civilian boats in this order of priority : world food program boats , other ships delivering humanitarian aid , vessels from eu member states or involving a third country , -lrb- and -rrb- other boats , " the document said .
the report has drawn criticism from germany 's opposition , which has accused the government of being too defensive .
" we must actively fight the pirates and take their boats .
after all , a pirate without a boat is quite ridiculous , " said rainer stinner from the liberal free democrats party -lrb- fdp -rrb- .
somali pirates undeterred by eu force bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : somali pirates are undeterred by the eu 's presence meanwhile , somali pirates were undeterred saturday as the new eu naval forces readied to launch their operation aimed at curbing relentless attacks that have rattled world maritime trade in the gulf of aden , which has in recent months become the world 's most dangerous stretch of water .
the gulf of aden commands access to the red sea and the suez canal , a key trade route between asia and europe , and atalanta will attempt to reassure shipping companies .
pirates equipped with speedboats , assault rifles and rocket launchers , have carried out more than 100 attacks since the start of the year .
they have raked in tens of millions of dollars in ransom money after hijacking foreign vessels , from luxury yachts to the sirius star , a 330-metre crude carrier which is still being held .
arguing that foreign fishing fleets have for years plundered somali fishing resources illegally , pirates have secured strong support from the coastal communities in a country ravaged by conflict and starvation .
" the presence of european war ships will undermine the somalis ' ability to protect their natural resources from illegal fishing , " said mohamed said , a pirate leader whose group has held the saudi super-tanker sirius star for ransom since november 15 .
" many of the polluters of somalia 's waters , those who dump toxic waste , are europeans .
this force will contribute to giving them unimpeded access to our waters , " he told reporters .
experts doubt multinational force is large enough with five of six eu ships expected in somali waters this month , the international naval presence in the region will be further enhanced , restricting the pirates ' room for maneuver .
but despite the added support of nato , the us navy and asian powers , experts argue the number of war ships will remain insufficient to root out piracy .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : experts believe the anti-piracy force is too small according to unosat , a un-affiliated agency that analyses satellite data , the recent increase in naval vessels has done little to deter pirates , only forcing them to concentrate their attacks in specific areas .
out of the 80 attacks reported in the past three months alone , half of them occurred in or around the so-called corridor which merchant vessels have been encouraged to use in order to benefit from navy monitoring .
while the success rate of the pirates ' attacks has dipped slightly in recent weeks , the sheer numbers of attacks continues to thwart the west 's state-of-the-art naval machine .
" you would need at least 100 naval ships in the area to make a decisive impact but this is impossible , " said jean duval , a maritime expert with french private maritime security outfit secopex .
duval 's firm , which expects to clinch contracts with shipping companies in the coming weeks , is one of dozens of private companies hoping to cash in on the surge in piracy in somalia 's strategic waters .
while navies only can actively combat piracy and detain pirates , private firms seek to offer complementary services by escorting ships through the gulf of aden .
the eu and its international partners are aware of the limits to their action , admitting that piracy can only be eradicated if durable solutions are found to stabilize somalia .
" everything needs to be done to change somalia from a failed to state to a country where the authorities are in a position to maintain law and order , " vice admiral gerard vallin , who heads france 's naval forces in the indian ocean , told reporters .
navies have been powerless to free hijacked ships once they have been seized by pirates .
somali pirates are currently holding 16 ships and more than 350 crew .
pirates gave the owner of the sirius star up to the end of november to pay a ransom of $ 25 million . dw staff -lrb- nda -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

5 in a simulated attack to test the defense system it wants to expand in eastern europe to counter attacks from north korea or iran . " this was the largest , most complex task that we 've ever done , " said lieutenant general patrick o 'reilly , director of the pentagon 's missile defense agency .
but the target missile 's countermeasures , intended to simulate decoys from enemy missiles - precisely what critics of the defense shield doubt the system could overcome - failed to deploy , he said .
" countermeasures are very difficult to deploy , " he said , adding that " there are many threats today that do n't have countermeasures . "
the interception took place at 3:29 pm -lrb- 21:29 cet -rrb- , pentagon spokesman bryan whitman said , making the effort the eighth successful intercept out of the 13 tests conducted since 1999 , with the last successful test taking place in september 2007 .
overall military chiefs approved of the effort .
" i am extremely pleased , " said o 'reilly at a press briefing .
" all the systems were working together , " he added , referring to the complex alignment of radars , sensors and timing to coordinate the high-octane missile .
brian green , deputy assistant secretary of defense for strategic capabilities , added that the effort was an " operationally realistic test . "
the effectiveness of the defense shield has been questioned by some scientists who claim the program would be unable to distinguish between a missile and a decoy - precisely what failed to be realized in friday 's effort .
the test is seen as a crucial step towards a controversial anti-missile shield washington plans to base in eastern europe .
the bush administration wants to install a radar facility in the czech republic and 10 interceptor missiles in neighboring poland by 2014 .
the test of the project , which so far has cost the defense department some $ 100 billion , comes at a critical time before president-elect barack obama moves into the white house on january 20 .
obama has so far not committed to the missile defense shield .
one of his senior foreign policy advisors , denis mcdonough , has indicated however that obama would support the program if the technology proves viable .
opponent russia still on edge bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : medvedev warned that he would deploy missiles in kaliningrad moscow has repeatedly voiced strong objections to the shield plan , which washington insists is not directed against russia but at " rogue states " such as iran and north korea .
in late november russian prime minister vladimir putin urged obama to drop the planned shield in eastern europe .
" this project is aimed against the strategic potential of russia .
and we can only give it an adequate response , " he said .
earlier last month moscow raised alarm in western capitals by warning it could place missiles in the russian exclave of kaliningrad , close to poland , in response to the plan .
on friday the interceptor missile was launched from vandenberg air force base in california , as the target - a fake warhead mimicking long-range ballistic missiles from nations like north korea - was set off from the alaskan island of kodiak . dw staff -lrb- nda -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

the united nations ' security council gave its formal green-light to the eu mission , which is to last for one year at a cost of 8.3 million euros -lrb- $ 10.5 million -rrb- last week .
the eu force takes over from nato 's own flotilla , which has been patrolling the somali coast since late october .
but as the eu force prepares to take over the responsiblility of patrolling the waters off somalia , a number of factors are casting a shadow over the mission .
earlier this week , eu foreign policy chief javier solana conceded that there were still a number of legal issues that needed to be resolved .
one concerns the different rules which eu member states apply on the detention of pirates .
" we need to coordinate that , but every country has a position - and that position is that they will not allow pirates to play around , " solana said .
nato commanders have also stressed the need for a more permanent solution to the patrols off the somali coast .
but officials note that any decision will likely require months of discussions .
" nato is indeed studying a longer-term role ... but there 's a lot of water on this globe , and this issue will be on the agenda for some time to come , " the nato chief said .
eu efforts were thrown further into doubt on friday when germany said that it would be reluctant to " actively " pursue somali pirates under its commitments to the eu security mission unless national interests were at stake .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : steinmeier and jung want national interests to be a priority " arresting people suspected of piracy is not the primary objective of the -lrb- german -rrb- operation , " foreign minister frank-walter steinmeier and defense minister franz josef jung wrote in a letter addressed to lawmakers , according to ard public television and saturday 's edition of frankfurter allgemeine zeitung newspaper .
in the letter berlin had drawn up a list of priority cases in which it is willing to deploy its navy to combat the pirates .
a decision setting out the terms of germany 's contribution to the mission is due to be made public on wednesday .
" we must protect civilian boats in this order of priority : world food program boats , other ships delivering humanitarian aid , vessels from eu member states or involving a third country , -lrb- and -rrb- other boats , " the document said .
the report has drawn criticism from germany 's opposition , which has accused the government of being too defensive .
" we must actively fight the pirates and take their boats .
after all , a pirate without a boat is quite ridiculous , " said rainer stinner from the liberal free democrats party -lrb- fdp -rrb- .
somali pirates undeterred by eu force bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : somali pirates are undeterred by the eu 's presence meanwhile , somali pirates were undeterred saturday as the new eu naval forces readied to launch their operation aimed at curbing relentless attacks that have rattled world maritime trade in the gulf of aden , which has in recent months become the world 's most dangerous stretch of water .
the gulf of aden commands access to the red sea and the suez canal , a key trade route between asia and europe , and atalanta will attempt to reassure shipping companies .
pirates equipped with speedboats , assault rifles and rocket launchers , have carried out more than 100 attacks since the start of the year .
they have raked in tens of millions of dollars in ransom money after hijacking foreign vessels , from luxury yachts to the sirius star , a 330-metre crude carrier which is still being held .
arguing that foreign fishing fleets have for years plundered somali fishing resources illegally , pirates have secured strong support from the coastal communities in a country ravaged by conflict and starvation .
" the presence of european war ships will undermine the somalis ' ability to protect their natural resources from illegal fishing , " said mohamed said , a pirate leader whose group has held the saudi super-tanker sirius star for ransom since november 15 .
" many of the polluters of somalia 's waters , those who dump toxic waste , are europeans .
this force will contribute to giving them unimpeded access to our waters , " he told reporters .
experts doubt multinational force is large enough with five of six eu ships expected in somali waters this month , the international naval presence in the region will be further enhanced , restricting the pirates ' room for maneuver .
but despite the added support of nato , the us navy and asian powers , experts argue the number of war ships will remain insufficient to root out piracy .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : experts believe the anti-piracy force is too small according to unosat , a un-affiliated agency that analyses satellite data , the recent increase in naval vessels has done little to deter pirates , only forcing them to concentrate their attacks in specific areas .
out of the 80 attacks reported in the past three months alone , half of them occurred in or around the so-called corridor which merchant vessels have been encouraged to use in order to benefit from navy monitoring .
while the success rate of the pirates ' attacks has dipped slightly in recent weeks , the sheer numbers of attacks continues to thwart the west 's state-of-the-art naval machine .
" you would need at least 100 naval ships in the area to make a decisive impact but this is impossible , " said jean duval , a maritime expert with french private maritime security outfit secopex .
duval 's firm , which expects to clinch contracts with shipping companies in the coming weeks , is one of dozens of private companies hoping to cash in on the surge in piracy in somalia 's strategic waters .
while navies only can actively combat piracy and detain pirates , private firms seek to offer complementary services by escorting ships through the gulf of aden .
the eu and its international partners are aware of the limits to their action , admitting that piracy can only be eradicated if durable solutions are found to stabilize somalia .
" everything needs to be done to change somalia from a failed to state to a country where the authorities are in a position to maintain law and order , " vice admiral gerard vallin , who heads france 's naval forces in the indian ocean , told reporters .
navies have been powerless to free hijacked ships once they have been seized by pirates .
somali pirates are currently holding 16 ships and more than 350 crew .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de defense -pipe- 06.12.2008 doubts and indifference dog eu anti-piracy mission in somalia großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : germany expressed doubts about its involvement in the mission days before it begins as the european union 's anti-piracy mission off the coast of somalia prepares for the start of operations on monday , doubts are raised by governments and experts as the pirates themselves offer indifferent responses . the eu 's naval force for somalia " atalanta " mission , which consists of six warships and three maritime reconnaissance aircraft , is due to start escorting merchant ships and world food program vessels delivering food aid to africa on monday .
the united nations ' security council gave its formal green-light to the eu mission , which is to last for one year at a cost of 8.3 million euros -lrb- $ 10.5 million -rrb- last week .
the eu force takes over from nato 's own flotilla , which has been patrolling the somali coast since late october .
but as the eu force prepares to take over the responsiblility of patrolling the waters off somalia , a number of factors are casting a shadow over the mission .
earlier this week , eu foreign policy chief javier solana conceded that there were still a number of legal issues that needed to be resolved .
one concerns the different rules which eu member states apply on the detention of pirates .
" we need to coordinate that , but every country has a position - and that position is that they will not allow pirates to play around , " solana said .
nato commanders have also stressed the need for a more permanent solution to the patrols off the somali coast .
but officials note that any decision will likely require months of discussions .
" nato is indeed studying a longer-term role ... but there 's a lot of water on this globe , and this issue will be on the agenda for some time to come , " the nato chief said .
eu efforts were thrown further into doubt on friday when germany said that it would be reluctant to " actively " pursue somali pirates under its commitments to the eu security mission unless national interests were at stake .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : steinmeier and jung want national interests to be a priority " arresting people suspected of piracy is not the primary objective of the -lrb- german -rrb- operation , " foreign minister frank-walter steinmeier and defense minister franz josef jung wrote in a letter addressed to lawmakers , according to ard public television and saturday 's edition of frankfurter allgemeine zeitung newspaper .
in the letter berlin had drawn up a list of priority cases in which it is willing to deploy its navy to combat the pirates .
a decision setting out the terms of germany 's contribution to the mission is due to be made public on wednesday .
" we must protect civilian boats in this order of priority : world food program boats , other ships delivering humanitarian aid , vessels from eu member states or involving a third country , -lrb- and -rrb- other boats , " the document said .
the report has drawn criticism from germany 's opposition , which has accused the government of being too defensive .
" we must actively fight the pirates and take their boats .
after all , a pirate without a boat is quite ridiculous , " said rainer stinner from the liberal free democrats party -lrb- fdp -rrb- .
somali pirates undeterred by eu force bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : somali pirates are undeterred by the eu 's presence meanwhile , somali pirates were undeterred saturday as the new eu naval forces readied to launch their operation aimed at curbing relentless attacks that have rattled world maritime trade in the gulf of aden , which has in recent months become the world 's most dangerous stretch of water .
the gulf of aden commands access to the red sea and the suez canal , a key trade route between asia and europe , and atalanta will attempt to reassure shipping companies .
pirates equipped with speedboats , assault rifles and rocket launchers , have carried out more than 100 attacks since the start of the year .
they have raked in tens of millions of dollars in ransom money after hijacking foreign vessels , from luxury yachts to the sirius star , a 330-metre crude carrier which is still being held .
arguing that foreign fishing fleets have for years plundered somali fishing resources illegally , pirates have secured strong support from the coastal communities in a country ravaged by conflict and starvation .
" the presence of european war ships will undermine the somalis ' ability to protect their natural resources from illegal fishing , " said mohamed said , a pirate leader whose group has held the saudi super-tanker sirius star for ransom since november 15 .
" many of the polluters of somalia 's waters , those who dump toxic waste , are europeans .
this force will contribute to giving them unimpeded access to our waters , " he told reporters .
experts doubt multinational force is large enough with five of six eu ships expected in somali waters this month , the international naval presence in the region will be further enhanced , restricting the pirates ' room for maneuver .
but despite the added support of nato , the us navy and asian powers , experts argue the number of war ships will remain insufficient to root out piracy .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : experts believe the anti-piracy force is too small according to unosat , a un-affiliated agency that analyses satellite data , the recent increase in naval vessels has done little to deter pirates , only forcing them to concentrate their attacks in specific areas .
out of the 80 attacks reported in the past three months alone , half of them occurred in or around the so-called corridor which merchant vessels have been encouraged to use in order to benefit from navy monitoring .
while the success rate of the pirates ' attacks has dipped slightly in recent weeks , the sheer numbers of attacks continues to thwart the west 's state-of-the-art naval machine .
" you would need at least 100 naval ships in the area to make a decisive impact but this is impossible , " said jean duval , a maritime expert with french private maritime security outfit secopex .
duval 's firm , which expects to clinch contracts with shipping companies in the coming weeks , is one of dozens of private companies hoping to cash in on the surge in piracy in somalia 's strategic waters .
while navies only can actively combat piracy and detain pirates , private firms seek to offer complementary services by escorting ships through the gulf of aden .
the eu and its international partners are aware of the limits to their action , admitting that piracy can only be eradicated if durable solutions are found to stabilize somalia .
" everything needs to be done to change somalia from a failed to state to a country where the authorities are in a position to maintain law and order , " vice admiral gerard vallin , who heads france 's naval forces in the indian ocean , told reporters .
navies have been powerless to free hijacked ships once they have been seized by pirates .

" the massive and uncontrolled entry of zimbabweans into mozambique could be an open door for the further spread of the disease which is also affecting us , " a mozambique health ministry spokesman said friday . urgent food crisis humanitarian aid group oxfam said at least 300,000 zimbabweans weakened by a lack of food were in danger of the epidemic . " millions of people were already facing starvation .
with unemployment over 80 percent , and food unavailable across the country , they now have to contend with cholera and other diseases as the water and sanitation systems break down , " said peter mutoredzanwa , director for oxfam in zimbabwe . mutoredzanwa said in a statement that nearly half of zimbabwe 's 13 million people have been weakened by serious food shortages and that some 5 million people will urgently need food aid by january next year . zimbabwe a ' failed state ' bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : tsvangirai and mugabe are locked in a power struggle us secretary of state condoleezza rice called on friday for mugabe 's resignation , citing the cholera outbreak as an example of his government 's inability protect zimbabweans . describing mugabe 's departure as " long overdue , " rice called elections that had brought him to power a " sham . " after a meeting with danish prime minister anders fogh rasmussen in copenhagen , rice urged the international community , especially zimbabwe 's southern african neighbors , to help break the political impasse over the power-sharing government between mugabe 's party and that of opposition leader morgan tsvangirai . mugabe 's zanu-pf and tsvangirai 's mdc have been unable to reach agreement on the distribution of ministries since september when the power-sharing deal was agreed . tutu weighs in speaking on late night dutch current affairs program " nova " on thursday , south african bishop desmond tutu said mugabe must be forced out of power as soon as possible . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : archbishop tutu says mugabe must go or face arrest " the point is that we should stop the suffering of so many people , " said the 1984 nobel peace prize winner .

" he has destroyed a wonderful country .
zimbabwe has become an empty basket .
the country needs help , " tutu said , adding that african countries should play an important role in the process of forcing mugabe out of power . " the world should bring him to the hague and this should also include african countries as well as the european union .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de european union -pipe- 06.12.2008 czech president cuts ties with pm 's party before eu presidency großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : czech president klaus has made his choice to split at a most inopportune moment czech president vaclav klaus saturday cut ties with the civic democratic party of prime minister mirek topolanek on the eve of the czech republic 's eu presidency and a half year before european parliament elections . speaking at a key party congress , klaus said he " definitively " yielded honorary chairmanship of the party he founded nearly 18 years ago because he could not identify with the policies of its current leadership .
he said the party abandoned its conservative ideas and has been turning into a centrist defender of business interests .
" one i know for sure that these are not the policies with which i founded and led the ods for many years , " the president told the shocked delegates .
the surprise move came amid high tensions between the president and topolanek , his successor at the ods helm , over the party 's direction , with the rise in tensions coming when prague is preparing to assume the european union presidency on january 1 .
while klaus is a fierce critic of the eu , deeper european integration and bloc 's reform treaty , topolanek has urged a pragmatic and active european policy .
" when my views represent a minority it does not mean that i will be sulking and negate everything that will be agreed by everyone else , " topolanek told the congress .
" that is a highly unpolitical approach .
how long can such a game be played ?
not very . "
topolanek signed the lisbon treaty on the country 's behalf in december 2007 and has since backed it reluctantly as a necessary evil that opens the way for further reforms of the 27-member bloc .
while klaus ' step allows the premier to free the party from eurosceptic views , it also enables klaus to back a potential new eurosceptic party before june 's european parliament election .
klaus aligns himself with eu 's eurosceptics during a recent visit to ireland , klaus threw his support behind the eurosceptic libertas movement of irish businessman and anti-eu activist declan ganley , which successfully campaigned against the lisbon treaty in ireland .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : why me , why now ?
topolanek faces tough times the impact of klaus ' decision will become clear sunday when the civic democrats are to pick their new leadership .
topolanek faces a challenge for the top ods post from a klaus backer , prague mayor pavel bem .
the civic democrats are a senior partner in a three-party government , which has introduced several unpopular belt-tightening reforms , such as direct fees in health care , since assuming power in january 2007 .
the party suffered a massive loss in october regional and senate elections and bem would prefer to torpedo the current center-right coalition and form a minority government , backed by the leftist opposition .
topolanek , however , argued before the delegates that his government was the best choice at a time when the country is bracing for a sharp slowdown of its export-driven economy amid the global financial crisis . dpa news agency -lrb- nda -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

" poland is a people who experience many difficult periods , however no matter what difficulties , the polish people always keep your spirit , your determination , " the dalai lama told the gathering of world leaders in northern poland .
" i admire polish people ... a lot of atrocities , a lot of difficulties , but you never lost your hope , your determination . "
the anniversary celebrations of his nobel peace prize included leaders like french president nicolas sarkozy , and nobel peace prize laureates like south africa 's fw de klerk and israel 's shimon peres .
the dalai lama also called for " external disarmament , " and said demilitarization must begin with " inner peace " and letting go of fear and suspicion .
sarkozy arrived in gdansk with firm plans to meet the dalai lama , a move that has china fuming .
sarkozy 's meeting leads to scrapped eu-china summit bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : sarkozy and hu jintao have done much business recently as current holder of the european union 's six-month rotating presidency , the french leader 's decision to engage with the exiled tibetan spiritual leader has so far seen beijing retaliate by scrapping a china-eu summit in france earlier this week .
it also warned multi-billion-dollar trade deals between china and france were in jeopardy should the meeting go ahead .
" we have not noticed any kind of start of a boycott of our products , " a french presidential official told reporters saturday , emphasizing that france and china needed each other during a period of economic crisis .
sarkozy is set to become the only european head of state to meet the dalai lama while holding the eu 's rotating presidency .
asked friday in the northern polish city whether he thought the french president might cancel the meeting with him , as has happened twice in the past , the dalai lama said : " wait until tomorrow .

france is digging in its heels , saying the meeting will go ahead and calling for economic ties to be spared from retribution , especially during the financial crisis .
" we can not have france 's conduct dictated to , even by our friends , " said foreign minister bernard kouchner .
the dalai lama , who lives in exile in india , has sought " meaningful autonomy " for tibet since he fled his homeland following a failed uprising in 1959 against chinese rule , nine years after chinese troops invaded the region .
china argues he is actually seeking full independence , something he on friday called a " totally baseless " claim .
" when china becomes more democratic , with freedom of speech , with rule of law and particularly with freedom of the press , ... once china becomes an open , modern society , then the tibet issue , i think within a few days , can be solved , " the dalai lama said friday .
addressing the european parliament in brussels on thursday , he said china lacked the moral authority to be a true superpower .
" the dalai lama will raise human rights issues and above all the very urgent situation of tibet ... where the situation nearly resembles that of martial law , " during the saturday afternoon meeting with sarkozy , the head of france 's tibetan community wangpo bashi told radio france-info saturday .

he said while poland 's interest depended on europe , it was also a case that " europe 's interest depends on the rest of the world . "
the dalai lama praised walesa 's solidarity movement , which in the 1980s lead strikes in the gdansk 's shipyards that helped peacefully topple the communist regime in poland .

5 in a simulated attack to test the defense system it wants to expand in eastern europe to counter attacks from north korea or iran . " this was the largest , most complex task that we 've ever done , " said lieutenant general patrick o 'reilly , director of the pentagon 's missile defense agency .
but the target missile 's countermeasures , intended to simulate decoys from enemy missiles - precisely what critics of the defense shield doubt the system could overcome - failed to deploy , he said .
" countermeasures are very difficult to deploy , " he said , adding that " there are many threats today that do n't have countermeasures . "
the interception took place at 3:29 pm -lrb- 21:29 cet -rrb- , pentagon spokesman bryan whitman said , making the effort the eighth successful intercept out of the 13 tests conducted since 1999 , with the last successful test taking place in september 2007 .
overall military chiefs approved of the effort .
" i am extremely pleased , " said o 'reilly at a press briefing .
" all the systems were working together , " he added , referring to the complex alignment of radars , sensors and timing to coordinate the high-octane missile .
brian green , deputy assistant secretary of defense for strategic capabilities , added that the effort was an " operationally realistic test . "
the effectiveness of the defense shield has been questioned by some scientists who claim the program would be unable to distinguish between a missile and a decoy - precisely what failed to be realized in friday 's effort .
the test is seen as a crucial step towards a controversial anti-missile shield washington plans to base in eastern europe .
the bush administration wants to install a radar facility in the czech republic and 10 interceptor missiles in neighboring poland by 2014 .
the test of the project , which so far has cost the defense department some $ 100 billion , comes at a critical time before president-elect barack obama moves into the white house on january 20 .
obama has so far not committed to the missile defense shield .
one of his senior foreign policy advisors , denis mcdonough , has indicated however that obama would support the program if the technology proves viable .

in late november russian prime minister vladimir putin urged obama to drop the planned shield in eastern europe .
" this project is aimed against the strategic potential of russia .
and we can only give it an adequate response , " he said .
earlier last month moscow raised alarm in western capitals by warning it could place missiles in the russian exclave of kaliningrad , close to poland , in response to the plan .
on friday the interceptor missile was launched from vandenberg air force base in california , as the target - a fake warhead mimicking long-range ballistic missiles from nations like north korea - was set off from the alaskan island of kodiak . dw staff -lrb- nda -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

5 in a simulated attack to test the defense system it wants to expand in eastern europe to counter attacks from north korea or iran . " this was the largest , most complex task that we 've ever done , " said lieutenant general patrick o 'reilly , director of the pentagon 's missile defense agency .
but the target missile 's countermeasures , intended to simulate decoys from enemy missiles - precisely what critics of the defense shield doubt the system could overcome - failed to deploy , he said .
" countermeasures are very difficult to deploy , " he said , adding that " there are many threats today that do n't have countermeasures . "
the interception took place at 3:29 pm -lrb- 21:29 cet -rrb- , pentagon spokesman bryan whitman said , making the effort the eighth successful intercept out of the 13 tests conducted since 1999 , with the last successful test taking place in september 2007 .
overall military chiefs approved of the effort .
" i am extremely pleased , " said o 'reilly at a press briefing .
" all the systems were working together , " he added , referring to the complex alignment of radars , sensors and timing to coordinate the high-octane missile .
brian green , deputy assistant secretary of defense for strategic capabilities , added that the effort was an " operationally realistic test . "
the effectiveness of the defense shield has been questioned by some scientists who claim the program would be unable to distinguish between a missile and a decoy - precisely what failed to be realized in friday 's effort .
the test is seen as a crucial step towards a controversial anti-missile shield washington plans to base in eastern europe .
the bush administration wants to install a radar facility in the czech republic and 10 interceptor missiles in neighboring poland by 2014 .
the test of the project , which so far has cost the defense department some $ 100 billion , comes at a critical time before president-elect barack obama moves into the white house on january 20 .
obama has so far not committed to the missile defense shield .
one of his senior foreign policy advisors , denis mcdonough , has indicated however that obama would support the program if the technology proves viable .

in late november russian prime minister vladimir putin urged obama to drop the planned shield in eastern europe .
" this project is aimed against the strategic potential of russia .
and we can only give it an adequate response , " he said .
earlier last month moscow raised alarm in western capitals by warning it could place missiles in the russian exclave of kaliningrad , close to poland , in response to the plan .
on friday the interceptor missile was launched from vandenberg air force base in california , as the target - a fake warhead mimicking long-range ballistic missiles from nations like north korea - was set off from the alaskan island of kodiak . dw staff -lrb- nda -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

the united nations ' security council gave its formal green-light to the eu mission , which is to last for one year at a cost of 8.3 million euros -lrb- $ 10.5 million -rrb- last week .
the eu force takes over from nato 's own flotilla , which has been patrolling the somali coast since late october .
but as the eu force prepares to take over the responsiblility of patrolling the waters off somalia , a number of factors are casting a shadow over the mission .
earlier this week , eu foreign policy chief javier solana conceded that there were still a number of legal issues that needed to be resolved .
one concerns the different rules which eu member states apply on the detention of pirates .
" we need to coordinate that , but every country has a position - and that position is that they will not allow pirates to play around , " solana said .
nato commanders have also stressed the need for a more permanent solution to the patrols off the somali coast .
but officials note that any decision will likely require months of discussions .
" nato is indeed studying a longer-term role ... but there 's a lot of water on this globe , and this issue will be on the agenda for some time to come , " the nato chief said .
eu efforts were thrown further into doubt on friday when germany said that it would be reluctant to " actively " pursue somali pirates under its commitments to the eu security mission unless national interests were at stake .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : steinmeier and jung want national interests to be a priority " arresting people suspected of piracy is not the primary objective of the -lrb- german -rrb- operation , " foreign minister frank-walter steinmeier and defense minister franz josef jung wrote in a letter addressed to lawmakers , according to ard public television and saturday 's edition of frankfurter allgemeine zeitung newspaper .
in the letter berlin had drawn up a list of priority cases in which it is willing to deploy its navy to combat the pirates .
a decision setting out the terms of germany 's contribution to the mission is due to be made public on wednesday .
" we must protect civilian boats in this order of priority : world food program boats , other ships delivering humanitarian aid , vessels from eu member states or involving a third country , -lrb- and -rrb- other boats , " the document said .
the report has drawn criticism from germany 's opposition , which has accused the government of being too defensive .
" we must actively fight the pirates and take their boats .
after all , a pirate without a boat is quite ridiculous , " said rainer stinner from the liberal free democrats party -lrb- fdp -rrb- .
somali pirates undeterred by eu force bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : somali pirates are undeterred by the eu 's presence meanwhile , somali pirates were undeterred saturday as the new eu naval forces readied to launch their operation aimed at curbing relentless attacks that have rattled world maritime trade in the gulf of aden , which has in recent months become the world 's most dangerous stretch of water .
the gulf of aden commands access to the red sea and the suez canal , a key trade route between asia and europe , and atalanta will attempt to reassure shipping companies .
pirates equipped with speedboats , assault rifles and rocket launchers , have carried out more than 100 attacks since the start of the year .
they have raked in tens of millions of dollars in ransom money after hijacking foreign vessels , from luxury yachts to the sirius star , a 330-metre crude carrier which is still being held .
arguing that foreign fishing fleets have for years plundered somali fishing resources illegally , pirates have secured strong support from the coastal communities in a country ravaged by conflict and starvation .
" the presence of european war ships will undermine the somalis ' ability to protect their natural resources from illegal fishing , " said mohamed said , a pirate leader whose group has held the saudi super-tanker sirius star for ransom since november 15 .
" many of the polluters of somalia 's waters , those who dump toxic waste , are europeans .
this force will contribute to giving them unimpeded access to our waters , " he told reporters .
experts doubt multinational force is large enough with five of six eu ships expected in somali waters this month , the international naval presence in the region will be further enhanced , restricting the pirates ' room for maneuver .
but despite the added support of nato , the us navy and asian powers , experts argue the number of war ships will remain insufficient to root out piracy .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : experts believe the anti-piracy force is too small according to unosat , a un-affiliated agency that analyses satellite data , the recent increase in naval vessels has done little to deter pirates , only forcing them to concentrate their attacks in specific areas .
out of the 80 attacks reported in the past three months alone , half of them occurred in or around the so-called corridor which merchant vessels have been encouraged to use in order to benefit from navy monitoring .
while the success rate of the pirates ' attacks has dipped slightly in recent weeks , the sheer numbers of attacks continues to thwart the west 's state-of-the-art naval machine .
" you would need at least 100 naval ships in the area to make a decisive impact but this is impossible , " said jean duval , a maritime expert with french private maritime security outfit secopex .
duval 's firm , which expects to clinch contracts with shipping companies in the coming weeks , is one of dozens of private companies hoping to cash in on the surge in piracy in somalia 's strategic waters .
while navies only can actively combat piracy and detain pirates , private firms seek to offer complementary services by escorting ships through the gulf of aden .
the eu and its international partners are aware of the limits to their action , admitting that piracy can only be eradicated if durable solutions are found to stabilize somalia .
" everything needs to be done to change somalia from a failed to state to a country where the authorities are in a position to maintain law and order , " vice admiral gerard vallin , who heads france 's naval forces in the indian ocean , told reporters .
navies have been powerless to free hijacked ships once they have been seized by pirates .
somali pirates are currently holding 16 ships and more than 350 crew .

" it was a tense and exciting game and it 's super that we won in the end , " bayern coach juergen klinsmann said .
" we had enough chances to score the second goal earlier . " ibisevic struck his 18th goal in 16 games to stun bayern in the 49th minute following an even first half in which luca toni had an early chance for bayern only to hit the side-netting . record scoring threat ? bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : ibisevic is shooting to beat mueller 's goal-scoring record tobias weis started the move for the visitors , combining well with chinedu obasi before crossing to find ibisevic who shrugged off massimo oddo and turned to rifle the ball past keeper michael rensing . oddo claimed he had been fouled , but it was a goal very much in the mold of bayern legend gerd mueller whose record of 40 league goals in a season could be under threat from the bosnia striker . " we put a lot into the game , ran and worked hard but in the end we have nothing to show for it which is a pity , " ibisevic said .
" it is undeserved if you look at the game , but life goes on .
we have to learn quickly that you should n't lose games like this .

5 in a simulated attack to test the defense system it wants to expand in eastern europe to counter attacks from north korea or iran . " this was the largest , most complex task that we 've ever done , " said lieutenant general patrick o 'reilly , director of the pentagon 's missile defense agency .
but the target missile 's countermeasures , intended to simulate decoys from enemy missiles - precisely what critics of the defense shield doubt the system could overcome - failed to deploy , he said .
" countermeasures are very difficult to deploy , " he said , adding that " there are many threats today that do n't have countermeasures . "
the interception took place at 3:29 pm -lrb- 21:29 cet -rrb- , pentagon spokesman bryan whitman said , making the effort the eighth successful intercept out of the 13 tests conducted since 1999 , with the last successful test taking place in september 2007 .
overall military chiefs approved of the effort .
" i am extremely pleased , " said o 'reilly at a press briefing .
" all the systems were working together , " he added , referring to the complex alignment of radars , sensors and timing to coordinate the high-octane missile .
brian green , deputy assistant secretary of defense for strategic capabilities , added that the effort was an " operationally realistic test . "
the effectiveness of the defense shield has been questioned by some scientists who claim the program would be unable to distinguish between a missile and a decoy - precisely what failed to be realized in friday 's effort .
the test is seen as a crucial step towards a controversial anti-missile shield washington plans to base in eastern europe .
the bush administration wants to install a radar facility in the czech republic and 10 interceptor missiles in neighboring poland by 2014 .
the test of the project , which so far has cost the defense department some $ 100 billion , comes at a critical time before president-elect barack obama moves into the white house on january 20 .
obama has so far not committed to the missile defense shield .
one of his senior foreign policy advisors , denis mcdonough , has indicated however that obama would support the program if the technology proves viable .
opponent russia still on edge bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : medvedev warned that he would deploy missiles in kaliningrad moscow has repeatedly voiced strong objections to the shield plan , which washington insists is not directed against russia but at " rogue states " such as iran and north korea .
in late november russian prime minister vladimir putin urged obama to drop the planned shield in eastern europe .
" this project is aimed against the strategic potential of russia .
and we can only give it an adequate response , " he said .
earlier last month moscow raised alarm in western capitals by warning it could place missiles in the russian exclave of kaliningrad , close to poland , in response to the plan .
on friday the interceptor missile was launched from vandenberg air force base in california , as the target - a fake warhead mimicking long-range ballistic missiles from nations like north korea - was set off from the alaskan island of kodiak . dw staff -lrb- nda -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

the united nations ' security council gave its formal green-light to the eu mission , which is to last for one year at a cost of 8.3 million euros -lrb- $ 10.5 million -rrb- last week .
the eu force takes over from nato 's own flotilla , which has been patrolling the somali coast since late october .
but as the eu force prepares to take over the responsiblility of patrolling the waters off somalia , a number of factors are casting a shadow over the mission .
earlier this week , eu foreign policy chief javier solana conceded that there were still a number of legal issues that needed to be resolved .
one concerns the different rules which eu member states apply on the detention of pirates .
" we need to coordinate that , but every country has a position - and that position is that they will not allow pirates to play around , " solana said .
nato commanders have also stressed the need for a more permanent solution to the patrols off the somali coast .
but officials note that any decision will likely require months of discussions .
" nato is indeed studying a longer-term role ... but there 's a lot of water on this globe , and this issue will be on the agenda for some time to come , " the nato chief said .
eu efforts were thrown further into doubt on friday when germany said that it would be reluctant to " actively " pursue somali pirates under its commitments to the eu security mission unless national interests were at stake .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : steinmeier and jung want national interests to be a priority " arresting people suspected of piracy is not the primary objective of the -lrb- german -rrb- operation , " foreign minister frank-walter steinmeier and defense minister franz josef jung wrote in a letter addressed to lawmakers , according to ard public television and saturday 's edition of frankfurter allgemeine zeitung newspaper .
in the letter berlin had drawn up a list of priority cases in which it is willing to deploy its navy to combat the pirates .
a decision setting out the terms of germany 's contribution to the mission is due to be made public on wednesday .
" we must protect civilian boats in this order of priority : world food program boats , other ships delivering humanitarian aid , vessels from eu member states or involving a third country , -lrb- and -rrb- other boats , " the document said .
the report has drawn criticism from germany 's opposition , which has accused the government of being too defensive .
" we must actively fight the pirates and take their boats .
after all , a pirate without a boat is quite ridiculous , " said rainer stinner from the liberal free democrats party -lrb- fdp -rrb- .
somali pirates undeterred by eu force bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : somali pirates are undeterred by the eu 's presence meanwhile , somali pirates were undeterred saturday as the new eu naval forces readied to launch their operation aimed at curbing relentless attacks that have rattled world maritime trade in the gulf of aden , which has in recent months become the world 's most dangerous stretch of water .
the gulf of aden commands access to the red sea and the suez canal , a key trade route between asia and europe , and atalanta will attempt to reassure shipping companies .
pirates equipped with speedboats , assault rifles and rocket launchers , have carried out more than 100 attacks since the start of the year .
they have raked in tens of millions of dollars in ransom money after hijacking foreign vessels , from luxury yachts to the sirius star , a 330-metre crude carrier which is still being held .
arguing that foreign fishing fleets have for years plundered somali fishing resources illegally , pirates have secured strong support from the coastal communities in a country ravaged by conflict and starvation .
" the presence of european war ships will undermine the somalis ' ability to protect their natural resources from illegal fishing , " said mohamed said , a pirate leader whose group has held the saudi super-tanker sirius star for ransom since november 15 .
" many of the polluters of somalia 's waters , those who dump toxic waste , are europeans .
this force will contribute to giving them unimpeded access to our waters , " he told reporters .
experts doubt multinational force is large enough with five of six eu ships expected in somali waters this month , the international naval presence in the region will be further enhanced , restricting the pirates ' room for maneuver .
but despite the added support of nato , the us navy and asian powers , experts argue the number of war ships will remain insufficient to root out piracy .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : experts believe the anti-piracy force is too small according to unosat , a un-affiliated agency that analyses satellite data , the recent increase in naval vessels has done little to deter pirates , only forcing them to concentrate their attacks in specific areas .
out of the 80 attacks reported in the past three months alone , half of them occurred in or around the so-called corridor which merchant vessels have been encouraged to use in order to benefit from navy monitoring .
while the success rate of the pirates ' attacks has dipped slightly in recent weeks , the sheer numbers of attacks continues to thwart the west 's state-of-the-art naval machine .
" you would need at least 100 naval ships in the area to make a decisive impact but this is impossible , " said jean duval , a maritime expert with french private maritime security outfit secopex .
duval 's firm , which expects to clinch contracts with shipping companies in the coming weeks , is one of dozens of private companies hoping to cash in on the surge in piracy in somalia 's strategic waters .
while navies only can actively combat piracy and detain pirates , private firms seek to offer complementary services by escorting ships through the gulf of aden .
the eu and its international partners are aware of the limits to their action , admitting that piracy can only be eradicated if durable solutions are found to stabilize somalia .
" everything needs to be done to change somalia from a failed to state to a country where the authorities are in a position to maintain law and order , " vice admiral gerard vallin , who heads france 's naval forces in the indian ocean , told reporters .
navies have been powerless to free hijacked ships once they have been seized by pirates .
somali pirates are currently holding 16 ships and more than 350 crew .

the united nations ' security council gave its formal green-light to the eu mission , which is to last for one year at a cost of 8.3 million euros -lrb- $ 10.5 million -rrb- last week .
the eu force takes over from nato 's own flotilla , which has been patrolling the somali coast since late october .
but as the eu force prepares to take over the responsiblility of patrolling the waters off somalia , a number of factors are casting a shadow over the mission .
earlier this week , eu foreign policy chief javier solana conceded that there were still a number of legal issues that needed to be resolved .
one concerns the different rules which eu member states apply on the detention of pirates .
" we need to coordinate that , but every country has a position - and that position is that they will not allow pirates to play around , " solana said .
nato commanders have also stressed the need for a more permanent solution to the patrols off the somali coast .
but officials note that any decision will likely require months of discussions .
" nato is indeed studying a longer-term role ... but there 's a lot of water on this globe , and this issue will be on the agenda for some time to come , " the nato chief said .
eu efforts were thrown further into doubt on friday when germany said that it would be reluctant to " actively " pursue somali pirates under its commitments to the eu security mission unless national interests were at stake .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : steinmeier and jung want national interests to be a priority " arresting people suspected of piracy is not the primary objective of the -lrb- german -rrb- operation , " foreign minister frank-walter steinmeier and defense minister franz josef jung wrote in a letter addressed to lawmakers , according to ard public television and saturday 's edition of frankfurter allgemeine zeitung newspaper .
in the letter berlin had drawn up a list of priority cases in which it is willing to deploy its navy to combat the pirates .
a decision setting out the terms of germany 's contribution to the mission is due to be made public on wednesday .
" we must protect civilian boats in this order of priority : world food program boats , other ships delivering humanitarian aid , vessels from eu member states or involving a third country , -lrb- and -rrb- other boats , " the document said .
the report has drawn criticism from germany 's opposition , which has accused the government of being too defensive .
" we must actively fight the pirates and take their boats .
after all , a pirate without a boat is quite ridiculous , " said rainer stinner from the liberal free democrats party -lrb- fdp -rrb- .
somali pirates undeterred by eu force bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : somali pirates are undeterred by the eu 's presence meanwhile , somali pirates were undeterred saturday as the new eu naval forces readied to launch their operation aimed at curbing relentless attacks that have rattled world maritime trade in the gulf of aden , which has in recent months become the world 's most dangerous stretch of water .
the gulf of aden commands access to the red sea and the suez canal , a key trade route between asia and europe , and atalanta will attempt to reassure shipping companies .
pirates equipped with speedboats , assault rifles and rocket launchers , have carried out more than 100 attacks since the start of the year .
they have raked in tens of millions of dollars in ransom money after hijacking foreign vessels , from luxury yachts to the sirius star , a 330-metre crude carrier which is still being held .
arguing that foreign fishing fleets have for years plundered somali fishing resources illegally , pirates have secured strong support from the coastal communities in a country ravaged by conflict and starvation .
" the presence of european war ships will undermine the somalis ' ability to protect their natural resources from illegal fishing , " said mohamed said , a pirate leader whose group has held the saudi super-tanker sirius star for ransom since november 15 .
" many of the polluters of somalia 's waters , those who dump toxic waste , are europeans .
this force will contribute to giving them unimpeded access to our waters , " he told reporters .
experts doubt multinational force is large enough with five of six eu ships expected in somali waters this month , the international naval presence in the region will be further enhanced , restricting the pirates ' room for maneuver .
but despite the added support of nato , the us navy and asian powers , experts argue the number of war ships will remain insufficient to root out piracy .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : experts believe the anti-piracy force is too small according to unosat , a un-affiliated agency that analyses satellite data , the recent increase in naval vessels has done little to deter pirates , only forcing them to concentrate their attacks in specific areas .
out of the 80 attacks reported in the past three months alone , half of them occurred in or around the so-called corridor which merchant vessels have been encouraged to use in order to benefit from navy monitoring .
while the success rate of the pirates ' attacks has dipped slightly in recent weeks , the sheer numbers of attacks continues to thwart the west 's state-of-the-art naval machine .
" you would need at least 100 naval ships in the area to make a decisive impact but this is impossible , " said jean duval , a maritime expert with french private maritime security outfit secopex .
duval 's firm , which expects to clinch contracts with shipping companies in the coming weeks , is one of dozens of private companies hoping to cash in on the surge in piracy in somalia 's strategic waters .
while navies only can actively combat piracy and detain pirates , private firms seek to offer complementary services by escorting ships through the gulf of aden .
the eu and its international partners are aware of the limits to their action , admitting that piracy can only be eradicated if durable solutions are found to stabilize somalia .
" everything needs to be done to change somalia from a failed to state to a country where the authorities are in a position to maintain law and order , " vice admiral gerard vallin , who heads france 's naval forces in the indian ocean , told reporters .
navies have been powerless to free hijacked ships once they have been seized by pirates .
somali pirates are currently holding 16 ships and more than 350 crew .

he said the party abandoned its conservative ideas and has been turning into a centrist defender of business interests .
" one i know for sure that these are not the policies with which i founded and led the ods for many years , " the president told the shocked delegates .
the surprise move came amid high tensions between the president and topolanek , his successor at the ods helm , over the party 's direction , with the rise in tensions coming when prague is preparing to assume the european union presidency on january 1 .
while klaus is a fierce critic of the eu , deeper european integration and bloc 's reform treaty , topolanek has urged a pragmatic and active european policy .
" when my views represent a minority it does not mean that i will be sulking and negate everything that will be agreed by everyone else , " topolanek told the congress .
" that is a highly unpolitical approach .
how long can such a game be played ?
not very . "
topolanek signed the lisbon treaty on the country 's behalf in december 2007 and has since backed it reluctantly as a necessary evil that opens the way for further reforms of the 27-member bloc .
while klaus ' step allows the premier to free the party from eurosceptic views , it also enables klaus to back a potential new eurosceptic party before june 's european parliament election .
klaus aligns himself with eu 's eurosceptics during a recent visit to ireland , klaus threw his support behind the eurosceptic libertas movement of irish businessman and anti-eu activist declan ganley , which successfully campaigned against the lisbon treaty in ireland .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : why me , why now ?
topolanek faces tough times the impact of klaus ' decision will become clear sunday when the civic democrats are to pick their new leadership .
topolanek faces a challenge for the top ods post from a klaus backer , prague mayor pavel bem .
the civic democrats are a senior partner in a three-party government , which has introduced several unpopular belt-tightening reforms , such as direct fees in health care , since assuming power in january 2007 .
the party suffered a massive loss in october regional and senate elections and bem would prefer to torpedo the current center-right coalition and form a minority government , backed by the leftist opposition .
topolanek , however , argued before the delegates that his government was the best choice at a time when the country is bracing for a sharp slowdown of its export-driven economy amid the global financial crisis . dpa news agency -lrb- nda -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de defense -pipe- 06.12.2008 doubts and indifference dog eu anti-piracy mission in somalia großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : germany expressed doubts about its involvement in the mission days before it begins as the european union 's anti-piracy mission off the coast of somalia prepares for the start of operations on monday , doubts are raised by governments and experts as the pirates themselves offer indifferent responses . the eu 's naval force for somalia " atalanta " mission , which consists of six warships and three maritime reconnaissance aircraft , is due to start escorting merchant ships and world food program vessels delivering food aid to africa on monday .
the united nations ' security council gave its formal green-light to the eu mission , which is to last for one year at a cost of 8.3 million euros -lrb- $ 10.5 million -rrb- last week .
the eu force takes over from nato 's own flotilla , which has been patrolling the somali coast since late october .
but as the eu force prepares to take over the responsiblility of patrolling the waters off somalia , a number of factors are casting a shadow over the mission .
earlier this week , eu foreign policy chief javier solana conceded that there were still a number of legal issues that needed to be resolved .
one concerns the different rules which eu member states apply on the detention of pirates .
" we need to coordinate that , but every country has a position - and that position is that they will not allow pirates to play around , " solana said .
nato commanders have also stressed the need for a more permanent solution to the patrols off the somali coast .
but officials note that any decision will likely require months of discussions .
" nato is indeed studying a longer-term role ... but there 's a lot of water on this globe , and this issue will be on the agenda for some time to come , " the nato chief said .
eu efforts were thrown further into doubt on friday when germany said that it would be reluctant to " actively " pursue somali pirates under its commitments to the eu security mission unless national interests were at stake .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : steinmeier and jung want national interests to be a priority " arresting people suspected of piracy is not the primary objective of the -lrb- german -rrb- operation , " foreign minister frank-walter steinmeier and defense minister franz josef jung wrote in a letter addressed to lawmakers , according to ard public television and saturday 's edition of frankfurter allgemeine zeitung newspaper .
in the letter berlin had drawn up a list of priority cases in which it is willing to deploy its navy to combat the pirates .
a decision setting out the terms of germany 's contribution to the mission is due to be made public on wednesday .
" we must protect civilian boats in this order of priority : world food program boats , other ships delivering humanitarian aid , vessels from eu member states or involving a third country , -lrb- and -rrb- other boats , " the document said .
the report has drawn criticism from germany 's opposition , which has accused the government of being too defensive .
" we must actively fight the pirates and take their boats .
after all , a pirate without a boat is quite ridiculous , " said rainer stinner from the liberal free democrats party -lrb- fdp -rrb- .
somali pirates undeterred by eu force bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : somali pirates are undeterred by the eu 's presence meanwhile , somali pirates were undeterred saturday as the new eu naval forces readied to launch their operation aimed at curbing relentless attacks that have rattled world maritime trade in the gulf of aden , which has in recent months become the world 's most dangerous stretch of water .
the gulf of aden commands access to the red sea and the suez canal , a key trade route between asia and europe , and atalanta will attempt to reassure shipping companies .
pirates equipped with speedboats , assault rifles and rocket launchers , have carried out more than 100 attacks since the start of the year .
they have raked in tens of millions of dollars in ransom money after hijacking foreign vessels , from luxury yachts to the sirius star , a 330-metre crude carrier which is still being held .
arguing that foreign fishing fleets have for years plundered somali fishing resources illegally , pirates have secured strong support from the coastal communities in a country ravaged by conflict and starvation .
" the presence of european war ships will undermine the somalis ' ability to protect their natural resources from illegal fishing , " said mohamed said , a pirate leader whose group has held the saudi super-tanker sirius star for ransom since november 15 .
" many of the polluters of somalia 's waters , those who dump toxic waste , are europeans .
this force will contribute to giving them unimpeded access to our waters , " he told reporters .
experts doubt multinational force is large enough with five of six eu ships expected in somali waters this month , the international naval presence in the region will be further enhanced , restricting the pirates ' room for maneuver .
but despite the added support of nato , the us navy and asian powers , experts argue the number of war ships will remain insufficient to root out piracy .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : experts believe the anti-piracy force is too small according to unosat , a un-affiliated agency that analyses satellite data , the recent increase in naval vessels has done little to deter pirates , only forcing them to concentrate their attacks in specific areas .
out of the 80 attacks reported in the past three months alone , half of them occurred in or around the so-called corridor which merchant vessels have been encouraged to use in order to benefit from navy monitoring .
while the success rate of the pirates ' attacks has dipped slightly in recent weeks , the sheer numbers of attacks continues to thwart the west 's state-of-the-art naval machine .
" you would need at least 100 naval ships in the area to make a decisive impact but this is impossible , " said jean duval , a maritime expert with french private maritime security outfit secopex .
duval 's firm , which expects to clinch contracts with shipping companies in the coming weeks , is one of dozens of private companies hoping to cash in on the surge in piracy in somalia 's strategic waters .
while navies only can actively combat piracy and detain pirates , private firms seek to offer complementary services by escorting ships through the gulf of aden .
the eu and its international partners are aware of the limits to their action , admitting that piracy can only be eradicated if durable solutions are found to stabilize somalia .
" everything needs to be done to change somalia from a failed to state to a country where the authorities are in a position to maintain law and order , " vice admiral gerard vallin , who heads france 's naval forces in the indian ocean , told reporters .
navies have been powerless to free hijacked ships once they have been seized by pirates .
somali pirates are currently holding 16 ships and more than 350 crew .
pirates gave the owner of the sirius star up to the end of november to pay a ransom of $ 25 million . dw staff -lrb- nda -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

he said the party abandoned its conservative ideas and has been turning into a centrist defender of business interests .
" one i know for sure that these are not the policies with which i founded and led the ods for many years , " the president told the shocked delegates .
the surprise move came amid high tensions between the president and topolanek , his successor at the ods helm , over the party 's direction , with the rise in tensions coming when prague is preparing to assume the european union presidency on january 1 .
while klaus is a fierce critic of the eu , deeper european integration and bloc 's reform treaty , topolanek has urged a pragmatic and active european policy .
" when my views represent a minority it does not mean that i will be sulking and negate everything that will be agreed by everyone else , " topolanek told the congress .
" that is a highly unpolitical approach .
how long can such a game be played ?
not very . "
topolanek signed the lisbon treaty on the country 's behalf in december 2007 and has since backed it reluctantly as a necessary evil that opens the way for further reforms of the 27-member bloc .
while klaus ' step allows the premier to free the party from eurosceptic views , it also enables klaus to back a potential new eurosceptic party before june 's european parliament election .
klaus aligns himself with eu 's eurosceptics during a recent visit to ireland , klaus threw his support behind the eurosceptic libertas movement of irish businessman and anti-eu activist declan ganley , which successfully campaigned against the lisbon treaty in ireland .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : why me , why now ?
topolanek faces tough times the impact of klaus ' decision will become clear sunday when the civic democrats are to pick their new leadership .
topolanek faces a challenge for the top ods post from a klaus backer , prague mayor pavel bem .
the civic democrats are a senior partner in a three-party government , which has introduced several unpopular belt-tightening reforms , such as direct fees in health care , since assuming power in january 2007 .
the party suffered a massive loss in october regional and senate elections and bem would prefer to torpedo the current center-right coalition and form a minority government , backed by the leftist opposition .
topolanek , however , argued before the delegates that his government was the best choice at a time when the country is bracing for a sharp slowdown of its export-driven economy amid the global financial crisis . dpa news agency -lrb- nda -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

" we had enough chances to score the second goal earlier .

" we put a lot into the game , ran and worked hard but in the end we have nothing to show for it which is a pity , " ibisevic said .
" it is undeserved if you look at the game , but life goes on .
we have to learn quickly that you should n't lose games like this . " hoffenheim had come out after half-time with all guns blazing and carlos eduardo went close to a second with a long-range effort turned round the post by rensing . plenty of opportunities bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : observers said composure in the final minutes sets bayern apart from the german league it was bayern who struck when lahm set off on an unhindered run towards the edge of the area where his shot was deflected into the top corner by marvin compper . the goal revived bayern who came close eight minutes later when a quickly-taken oddo free-kick found toni who glanced his header wide of a gaping goal . bayern looked closer to finding a second and there were several scares for the hoffenheim defense , with toni again glancing a header wide and miroslav klose shooting tamely on the break . however the visitors had an even better opportunity when sejad salihovic played a one-two with ibisevic and found himself clear only to be foiled by rensing . toni then headed over the bar from close range , but the italy striker finally settled the game with a minute already gone of stoppage time . a ' brutal ' end bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : hoffenheim had hoped to do more celebrating at the end of the match there appeared to be little danger for hoffenheim but defender andreas ibertsberger went in for sliding tackle only to direct the ball straight into the path of toni who had little problem in finding the net . hoffenheim coach ralf rangnick said it was a " brutal " end to the match for his side .

he said the party abandoned its conservative ideas and has been turning into a centrist defender of business interests .
" one i know for sure that these are not the policies with which i founded and led the ods for many years , " the president told the shocked delegates .
the surprise move came amid high tensions between the president and topolanek , his successor at the ods helm , over the party 's direction , with the rise in tensions coming when prague is preparing to assume the european union presidency on january 1 .
while klaus is a fierce critic of the eu , deeper european integration and bloc 's reform treaty , topolanek has urged a pragmatic and active european policy .
" when my views represent a minority it does not mean that i will be sulking and negate everything that will be agreed by everyone else , " topolanek told the congress .
" that is a highly unpolitical approach .
how long can such a game be played ?
not very . "
topolanek signed the lisbon treaty on the country 's behalf in december 2007 and has since backed it reluctantly as a necessary evil that opens the way for further reforms of the 27-member bloc .
while klaus ' step allows the premier to free the party from eurosceptic views , it also enables klaus to back a potential new eurosceptic party before june 's european parliament election .
klaus aligns himself with eu 's eurosceptics during a recent visit to ireland , klaus threw his support behind the eurosceptic libertas movement of irish businessman and anti-eu activist declan ganley , which successfully campaigned against the lisbon treaty in ireland .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : why me , why now ?
topolanek faces tough times the impact of klaus ' decision will become clear sunday when the civic democrats are to pick their new leadership .
topolanek faces a challenge for the top ods post from a klaus backer , prague mayor pavel bem .
the civic democrats are a senior partner in a three-party government , which has introduced several unpopular belt-tightening reforms , such as direct fees in health care , since assuming power in january 2007 .
the party suffered a massive loss in october regional and senate elections and bem would prefer to torpedo the current center-right coalition and form a minority government , backed by the leftist opposition .
topolanek , however , argued before the delegates that his government was the best choice at a time when the country is bracing for a sharp slowdown of its export-driven economy amid the global financial crisis . dpa news agency -lrb- nda -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

" countermeasures are very difficult to deploy , " he said , adding that " there are many threats today that do n't have countermeasures . "
the interception took place at 3:29 pm -lrb- 21:29 cet -rrb- , pentagon spokesman bryan whitman said , making the effort the eighth successful intercept out of the 13 tests conducted since 1999 , with the last successful test taking place in september 2007 .

" i am extremely pleased , " said o 'reilly at a press briefing .
" all the systems were working together , " he added , referring to the complex alignment of radars , sensors and timing to coordinate the high-octane missile .
brian green , deputy assistant secretary of defense for strategic capabilities , added that the effort was an " operationally realistic test . "
the effectiveness of the defense shield has been questioned by some scientists who claim the program would be unable to distinguish between a missile and a decoy - precisely what failed to be realized in friday 's effort .
the test is seen as a crucial step towards a controversial anti-missile shield washington plans to base in eastern europe .
the bush administration wants to install a radar facility in the czech republic and 10 interceptor missiles in neighboring poland by 2014 .
the test of the project , which so far has cost the defense department some $ 100 billion , comes at a critical time before president-elect barack obama moves into the white house on january 20 .

the average age of the study 's participants was 23 , and more than two-thirds of the participants were women .
the study did not count the shaving of men 's beards and moustaches .
nine of 10 women in the study or 89 per cent who regularly shave , epilate or trim , said they removed hair from three or more places on their body .
almost half said they removed hair from four places .
researchers said women most commonly shave their legs , armpits and genital areas , and some also shave their eyebrows .
among men , who regularly remove hair - not including their beards and moustaches - more than 50 per cent said they removed hair from two or three places on their bodies .
for men the primary places are the armpits , genital area and the upper body .
asked why they need to be rid of the hair , the participants said they wanted to look attractive and meet society norms .
researchers link the shaving trend , particularly among women who remove hair from their genital area , to a desire to look pre-pubescent and signal sexual immaturity .
this strengthens a man 's sense of superiority , the researchers said .
at the same , time shaving intimate areas could also be interpreted as a sign of heightened feminine liberation and a sense of mature feminine self- confidence .
professor elmar braehler , who was responsible for the study , said basically there is a general cultural trend toward shaving .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : body hair is expected to be back in vogue in the future " ever-skimpier bathing suits as well as the strong presence of nudity in the media contribute to the emergence of an aesthetic norm for these areas , " said braehler .

he said the party abandoned its conservative ideas and has been turning into a centrist defender of business interests .
" one i know for sure that these are not the policies with which i founded and led the ods for many years , " the president told the shocked delegates .
the surprise move came amid high tensions between the president and topolanek , his successor at the ods helm , over the party 's direction , with the rise in tensions coming when prague is preparing to assume the european union presidency on january 1 .
while klaus is a fierce critic of the eu , deeper european integration and bloc 's reform treaty , topolanek has urged a pragmatic and active european policy .
" when my views represent a minority it does not mean that i will be sulking and negate everything that will be agreed by everyone else , " topolanek told the congress .
" that is a highly unpolitical approach .
how long can such a game be played ?
not very . "
topolanek signed the lisbon treaty on the country 's behalf in december 2007 and has since backed it reluctantly as a necessary evil that opens the way for further reforms of the 27-member bloc .
while klaus ' step allows the premier to free the party from eurosceptic views , it also enables klaus to back a potential new eurosceptic party before june 's european parliament election .
klaus aligns himself with eu 's eurosceptics during a recent visit to ireland , klaus threw his support behind the eurosceptic libertas movement of irish businessman and anti-eu activist declan ganley , which successfully campaigned against the lisbon treaty in ireland .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : why me , why now ?
topolanek faces tough times the impact of klaus ' decision will become clear sunday when the civic democrats are to pick their new leadership .
topolanek faces a challenge for the top ods post from a klaus backer , prague mayor pavel bem .
the civic democrats are a senior partner in a three-party government , which has introduced several unpopular belt-tightening reforms , such as direct fees in health care , since assuming power in january 2007 .
the party suffered a massive loss in october regional and senate elections and bem would prefer to torpedo the current center-right coalition and form a minority government , backed by the leftist opposition .
topolanek , however , argued before the delegates that his government was the best choice at a time when the country is bracing for a sharp slowdown of its export-driven economy amid the global financial crisis . dpa news agency -lrb- nda -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

they have said rampant corruption in the russian judiciary affects judges ' independence . " jury trials have their own negatives , but they are less biased , " yuri schmidt , a moscow-based defense lawyer , told reuters news agency .
" courts without juries wo n't take free decisions and instead all decisions will be controlled by the authorities .

the united nations ' security council gave its formal green-light to the eu mission , which is to last for one year at a cost of 8.3 million euros -lrb- $ 10.5 million -rrb- last week .
the eu force takes over from nato 's own flotilla , which has been patrolling the somali coast since late october .
but as the eu force prepares to take over the responsiblility of patrolling the waters off somalia , a number of factors are casting a shadow over the mission .
earlier this week , eu foreign policy chief javier solana conceded that there were still a number of legal issues that needed to be resolved .
one concerns the different rules which eu member states apply on the detention of pirates .
" we need to coordinate that , but every country has a position - and that position is that they will not allow pirates to play around , " solana said .
nato commanders have also stressed the need for a more permanent solution to the patrols off the somali coast .
but officials note that any decision will likely require months of discussions .
" nato is indeed studying a longer-term role ... but there 's a lot of water on this globe , and this issue will be on the agenda for some time to come , " the nato chief said .
eu efforts were thrown further into doubt on friday when germany said that it would be reluctant to " actively " pursue somali pirates under its commitments to the eu security mission unless national interests were at stake .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : steinmeier and jung want national interests to be a priority " arresting people suspected of piracy is not the primary objective of the -lrb- german -rrb- operation , " foreign minister frank-walter steinmeier and defense minister franz josef jung wrote in a letter addressed to lawmakers , according to ard public television and saturday 's edition of frankfurter allgemeine zeitung newspaper .
in the letter berlin had drawn up a list of priority cases in which it is willing to deploy its navy to combat the pirates .
a decision setting out the terms of germany 's contribution to the mission is due to be made public on wednesday .
" we must protect civilian boats in this order of priority : world food program boats , other ships delivering humanitarian aid , vessels from eu member states or involving a third country , -lrb- and -rrb- other boats , " the document said .
the report has drawn criticism from germany 's opposition , which has accused the government of being too defensive .
" we must actively fight the pirates and take their boats .
after all , a pirate without a boat is quite ridiculous , " said rainer stinner from the liberal free democrats party -lrb- fdp -rrb- .
somali pirates undeterred by eu force bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : somali pirates are undeterred by the eu 's presence meanwhile , somali pirates were undeterred saturday as the new eu naval forces readied to launch their operation aimed at curbing relentless attacks that have rattled world maritime trade in the gulf of aden , which has in recent months become the world 's most dangerous stretch of water .
the gulf of aden commands access to the red sea and the suez canal , a key trade route between asia and europe , and atalanta will attempt to reassure shipping companies .
pirates equipped with speedboats , assault rifles and rocket launchers , have carried out more than 100 attacks since the start of the year .
they have raked in tens of millions of dollars in ransom money after hijacking foreign vessels , from luxury yachts to the sirius star , a 330-metre crude carrier which is still being held .
arguing that foreign fishing fleets have for years plundered somali fishing resources illegally , pirates have secured strong support from the coastal communities in a country ravaged by conflict and starvation .
" the presence of european war ships will undermine the somalis ' ability to protect their natural resources from illegal fishing , " said mohamed said , a pirate leader whose group has held the saudi super-tanker sirius star for ransom since november 15 .
" many of the polluters of somalia 's waters , those who dump toxic waste , are europeans .
this force will contribute to giving them unimpeded access to our waters , " he told reporters .
experts doubt multinational force is large enough with five of six eu ships expected in somali waters this month , the international naval presence in the region will be further enhanced , restricting the pirates ' room for maneuver .
but despite the added support of nato , the us navy and asian powers , experts argue the number of war ships will remain insufficient to root out piracy .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : experts believe the anti-piracy force is too small according to unosat , a un-affiliated agency that analyses satellite data , the recent increase in naval vessels has done little to deter pirates , only forcing them to concentrate their attacks in specific areas .
out of the 80 attacks reported in the past three months alone , half of them occurred in or around the so-called corridor which merchant vessels have been encouraged to use in order to benefit from navy monitoring .
while the success rate of the pirates ' attacks has dipped slightly in recent weeks , the sheer numbers of attacks continues to thwart the west 's state-of-the-art naval machine .
" you would need at least 100 naval ships in the area to make a decisive impact but this is impossible , " said jean duval , a maritime expert with french private maritime security outfit secopex .
duval 's firm , which expects to clinch contracts with shipping companies in the coming weeks , is one of dozens of private companies hoping to cash in on the surge in piracy in somalia 's strategic waters .
while navies only can actively combat piracy and detain pirates , private firms seek to offer complementary services by escorting ships through the gulf of aden .
the eu and its international partners are aware of the limits to their action , admitting that piracy can only be eradicated if durable solutions are found to stabilize somalia .
" everything needs to be done to change somalia from a failed to state to a country where the authorities are in a position to maintain law and order , " vice admiral gerard vallin , who heads france 's naval forces in the indian ocean , told reporters .
navies have been powerless to free hijacked ships once they have been seized by pirates .
somali pirates are currently holding 16 ships and more than 350 crew .

6 , hours before a meeting with french president nicolas sarkozy which has enraged china . the spiritual leader called for dialogue and stressed interdependence and cooperation while praising poland 's spirit in face of hardship during celebrations in gdansk that marked the 25th anniversary of lech walesa receiving the nobel peace prize .
he said while poland 's interest depended on europe , it was also a case that " europe 's interest depends on the rest of the world . "
the dalai lama praised walesa 's solidarity movement , which in the 1980s lead strikes in the gdansk 's shipyards that helped peacefully topple the communist regime in poland .
he said the movement worked with " courage and determination " under " difficult circumstances . "
" poland is a people who experience many difficult periods , however no matter what difficulties , the polish people always keep your spirit , your determination , " the dalai lama told the gathering of world leaders in northern poland .
" i admire polish people ... a lot of atrocities , a lot of difficulties , but you never lost your hope , your determination . "
the anniversary celebrations of his nobel peace prize included leaders like french president nicolas sarkozy , and nobel peace prize laureates like south africa 's fw de klerk and israel 's shimon peres .
the dalai lama also called for " external disarmament , " and said demilitarization must begin with " inner peace " and letting go of fear and suspicion .
sarkozy arrived in gdansk with firm plans to meet the dalai lama , a move that has china fuming .
sarkozy 's meeting leads to scrapped eu-china summit bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : sarkozy and hu jintao have done much business recently as current holder of the european union 's six-month rotating presidency , the french leader 's decision to engage with the exiled tibetan spiritual leader has so far seen beijing retaliate by scrapping a china-eu summit in france earlier this week .
it also warned multi-billion-dollar trade deals between china and france were in jeopardy should the meeting go ahead .
" we have not noticed any kind of start of a boycott of our products , " a french presidential official told reporters saturday , emphasizing that france and china needed each other during a period of economic crisis .
sarkozy is set to become the only european head of state to meet the dalai lama while holding the eu 's rotating presidency .
asked friday in the northern polish city whether he thought the french president might cancel the meeting with him , as has happened twice in the past , the dalai lama said : " wait until tomorrow .
i do n't know . "
france calls for restraint over trade threats bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : kouchner says sanctions at this time would be unfair commenting on whether eu-china relations and trade could suffer over his planned meeting with sarkozy the dalai lama remarked : " china also needs europe . "
" the original initiative of some pressure , sometimes is not followed by action , " he said .
france is digging in its heels , saying the meeting will go ahead and calling for economic ties to be spared from retribution , especially during the financial crisis .
" we can not have france 's conduct dictated to , even by our friends , " said foreign minister bernard kouchner .
the dalai lama , who lives in exile in india , has sought " meaningful autonomy " for tibet since he fled his homeland following a failed uprising in 1959 against chinese rule , nine years after chinese troops invaded the region .
china argues he is actually seeking full independence , something he on friday called a " totally baseless " claim .
" when china becomes more democratic , with freedom of speech , with rule of law and particularly with freedom of the press , ... once china becomes an open , modern society , then the tibet issue , i think within a few days , can be solved , " the dalai lama said friday .
addressing the european parliament in brussels on thursday , he said china lacked the moral authority to be a true superpower .
" the dalai lama will raise human rights issues and above all the very urgent situation of tibet ... where the situation nearly resembles that of martial law , " during the saturday afternoon meeting with sarkozy , the head of france 's tibetan community wangpo bashi told radio france-info saturday .

" we have not noticed any kind of start of a boycott of our products , " a french presidential official told reporters saturday , emphasizing that france and china needed each other during a period of economic crisis .
sarkozy is set to become the only european head of state to meet the dalai lama while holding the eu 's rotating presidency .
asked friday in the northern polish city whether he thought the french president might cancel the meeting with him , as has happened twice in the past , the dalai lama said : " wait until tomorrow .
i do n't know . "
france calls for restraint over trade threats bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : kouchner says sanctions at this time would be unfair commenting on whether eu-china relations and trade could suffer over his planned meeting with sarkozy the dalai lama remarked : " china also needs europe . "
" the original initiative of some pressure , sometimes is not followed by action , " he said .
france is digging in its heels , saying the meeting will go ahead and calling for economic ties to be spared from retribution , especially during the financial crisis .
" we can not have france 's conduct dictated to , even by our friends , " said foreign minister bernard kouchner .
the dalai lama , who lives in exile in india , has sought " meaningful autonomy " for tibet since he fled his homeland following a failed uprising in 1959 against chinese rule , nine years after chinese troops invaded the region .
china argues he is actually seeking full independence , something he on friday called a " totally baseless " claim .
" when china becomes more democratic , with freedom of speech , with rule of law and particularly with freedom of the press , ... once china becomes an open , modern society , then the tibet issue , i think within a few days , can be solved , " the dalai lama said friday .
addressing the european parliament in brussels on thursday , he said china lacked the moral authority to be a true superpower .
" the dalai lama will raise human rights issues and above all the very urgent situation of tibet ... where the situation nearly resembles that of martial law , " during the saturday afternoon meeting with sarkozy , the head of france 's tibetan community wangpo bashi told radio france-info saturday .
the meeting is " a very strong signal " for tibetans , he added . dw staff -lrb- nda -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

the united nations ' security council gave its formal green-light to the eu mission , which is to last for one year at a cost of 8.3 million euros -lrb- $ 10.5 million -rrb- last week .
the eu force takes over from nato 's own flotilla , which has been patrolling the somali coast since late october .
but as the eu force prepares to take over the responsiblility of patrolling the waters off somalia , a number of factors are casting a shadow over the mission .
earlier this week , eu foreign policy chief javier solana conceded that there were still a number of legal issues that needed to be resolved .
one concerns the different rules which eu member states apply on the detention of pirates .
" we need to coordinate that , but every country has a position - and that position is that they will not allow pirates to play around , " solana said .
nato commanders have also stressed the need for a more permanent solution to the patrols off the somali coast .
but officials note that any decision will likely require months of discussions .
" nato is indeed studying a longer-term role ... but there 's a lot of water on this globe , and this issue will be on the agenda for some time to come , " the nato chief said .
eu efforts were thrown further into doubt on friday when germany said that it would be reluctant to " actively " pursue somali pirates under its commitments to the eu security mission unless national interests were at stake .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : steinmeier and jung want national interests to be a priority " arresting people suspected of piracy is not the primary objective of the -lrb- german -rrb- operation , " foreign minister frank-walter steinmeier and defense minister franz josef jung wrote in a letter addressed to lawmakers , according to ard public television and saturday 's edition of frankfurter allgemeine zeitung newspaper .
in the letter berlin had drawn up a list of priority cases in which it is willing to deploy its navy to combat the pirates .
a decision setting out the terms of germany 's contribution to the mission is due to be made public on wednesday .
" we must protect civilian boats in this order of priority : world food program boats , other ships delivering humanitarian aid , vessels from eu member states or involving a third country , -lrb- and -rrb- other boats , " the document said .
the report has drawn criticism from germany 's opposition , which has accused the government of being too defensive .
" we must actively fight the pirates and take their boats .
after all , a pirate without a boat is quite ridiculous , " said rainer stinner from the liberal free democrats party -lrb- fdp -rrb- .
somali pirates undeterred by eu force bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : somali pirates are undeterred by the eu 's presence meanwhile , somali pirates were undeterred saturday as the new eu naval forces readied to launch their operation aimed at curbing relentless attacks that have rattled world maritime trade in the gulf of aden , which has in recent months become the world 's most dangerous stretch of water .
the gulf of aden commands access to the red sea and the suez canal , a key trade route between asia and europe , and atalanta will attempt to reassure shipping companies .
pirates equipped with speedboats , assault rifles and rocket launchers , have carried out more than 100 attacks since the start of the year .
they have raked in tens of millions of dollars in ransom money after hijacking foreign vessels , from luxury yachts to the sirius star , a 330-metre crude carrier which is still being held .
arguing that foreign fishing fleets have for years plundered somali fishing resources illegally , pirates have secured strong support from the coastal communities in a country ravaged by conflict and starvation .
" the presence of european war ships will undermine the somalis ' ability to protect their natural resources from illegal fishing , " said mohamed said , a pirate leader whose group has held the saudi super-tanker sirius star for ransom since november 15 .
" many of the polluters of somalia 's waters , those who dump toxic waste , are europeans .
this force will contribute to giving them unimpeded access to our waters , " he told reporters .
experts doubt multinational force is large enough with five of six eu ships expected in somali waters this month , the international naval presence in the region will be further enhanced , restricting the pirates ' room for maneuver .
but despite the added support of nato , the us navy and asian powers , experts argue the number of war ships will remain insufficient to root out piracy .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : experts believe the anti-piracy force is too small according to unosat , a un-affiliated agency that analyses satellite data , the recent increase in naval vessels has done little to deter pirates , only forcing them to concentrate their attacks in specific areas .
out of the 80 attacks reported in the past three months alone , half of them occurred in or around the so-called corridor which merchant vessels have been encouraged to use in order to benefit from navy monitoring .
while the success rate of the pirates ' attacks has dipped slightly in recent weeks , the sheer numbers of attacks continues to thwart the west 's state-of-the-art naval machine .
" you would need at least 100 naval ships in the area to make a decisive impact but this is impossible , " said jean duval , a maritime expert with french private maritime security outfit secopex .
duval 's firm , which expects to clinch contracts with shipping companies in the coming weeks , is one of dozens of private companies hoping to cash in on the surge in piracy in somalia 's strategic waters .
while navies only can actively combat piracy and detain pirates , private firms seek to offer complementary services by escorting ships through the gulf of aden .
the eu and its international partners are aware of the limits to their action , admitting that piracy can only be eradicated if durable solutions are found to stabilize somalia .
" everything needs to be done to change somalia from a failed to state to a country where the authorities are in a position to maintain law and order , " vice admiral gerard vallin , who heads france 's naval forces in the indian ocean , told reporters .
navies have been powerless to free hijacked ships once they have been seized by pirates .
somali pirates are currently holding 16 ships and more than 350 crew .
pirates gave the owner of the sirius star up to the end of november to pay a ransom of $ 25 million . dw staff -lrb- nda -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

" we had enough chances to score the second goal earlier .

" we put a lot into the game , ran and worked hard but in the end we have nothing to show for it which is a pity , " ibisevic said .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de defense -pipe- 06.12.2008 doubts and indifference dog eu anti-piracy mission in somalia großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : germany expressed doubts about its involvement in the mission days before it begins as the european union 's anti-piracy mission off the coast of somalia prepares for the start of operations on monday , doubts are raised by governments and experts as the pirates themselves offer indifferent responses . the eu 's naval force for somalia " atalanta " mission , which consists of six warships and three maritime reconnaissance aircraft , is due to start escorting merchant ships and world food program vessels delivering food aid to africa on monday .
the united nations ' security council gave its formal green-light to the eu mission , which is to last for one year at a cost of 8.3 million euros -lrb- $ 10.5 million -rrb- last week .
the eu force takes over from nato 's own flotilla , which has been patrolling the somali coast since late october .
but as the eu force prepares to take over the responsiblility of patrolling the waters off somalia , a number of factors are casting a shadow over the mission .
earlier this week , eu foreign policy chief javier solana conceded that there were still a number of legal issues that needed to be resolved .
one concerns the different rules which eu member states apply on the detention of pirates .
" we need to coordinate that , but every country has a position - and that position is that they will not allow pirates to play around , " solana said .
nato commanders have also stressed the need for a more permanent solution to the patrols off the somali coast .
but officials note that any decision will likely require months of discussions .
" nato is indeed studying a longer-term role ... but there 's a lot of water on this globe , and this issue will be on the agenda for some time to come , " the nato chief said .
eu efforts were thrown further into doubt on friday when germany said that it would be reluctant to " actively " pursue somali pirates under its commitments to the eu security mission unless national interests were at stake .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : steinmeier and jung want national interests to be a priority " arresting people suspected of piracy is not the primary objective of the -lrb- german -rrb- operation , " foreign minister frank-walter steinmeier and defense minister franz josef jung wrote in a letter addressed to lawmakers , according to ard public television and saturday 's edition of frankfurter allgemeine zeitung newspaper .
in the letter berlin had drawn up a list of priority cases in which it is willing to deploy its navy to combat the pirates .
a decision setting out the terms of germany 's contribution to the mission is due to be made public on wednesday .
" we must protect civilian boats in this order of priority : world food program boats , other ships delivering humanitarian aid , vessels from eu member states or involving a third country , -lrb- and -rrb- other boats , " the document said .
the report has drawn criticism from germany 's opposition , which has accused the government of being too defensive .
" we must actively fight the pirates and take their boats .
after all , a pirate without a boat is quite ridiculous , " said rainer stinner from the liberal free democrats party -lrb- fdp -rrb- .
somali pirates undeterred by eu force bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : somali pirates are undeterred by the eu 's presence meanwhile , somali pirates were undeterred saturday as the new eu naval forces readied to launch their operation aimed at curbing relentless attacks that have rattled world maritime trade in the gulf of aden , which has in recent months become the world 's most dangerous stretch of water .
the gulf of aden commands access to the red sea and the suez canal , a key trade route between asia and europe , and atalanta will attempt to reassure shipping companies .
pirates equipped with speedboats , assault rifles and rocket launchers , have carried out more than 100 attacks since the start of the year .
they have raked in tens of millions of dollars in ransom money after hijacking foreign vessels , from luxury yachts to the sirius star , a 330-metre crude carrier which is still being held .
arguing that foreign fishing fleets have for years plundered somali fishing resources illegally , pirates have secured strong support from the coastal communities in a country ravaged by conflict and starvation .
" the presence of european war ships will undermine the somalis ' ability to protect their natural resources from illegal fishing , " said mohamed said , a pirate leader whose group has held the saudi super-tanker sirius star for ransom since november 15 .
" many of the polluters of somalia 's waters , those who dump toxic waste , are europeans .
this force will contribute to giving them unimpeded access to our waters , " he told reporters .
experts doubt multinational force is large enough with five of six eu ships expected in somali waters this month , the international naval presence in the region will be further enhanced , restricting the pirates ' room for maneuver .
but despite the added support of nato , the us navy and asian powers , experts argue the number of war ships will remain insufficient to root out piracy .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : experts believe the anti-piracy force is too small according to unosat , a un-affiliated agency that analyses satellite data , the recent increase in naval vessels has done little to deter pirates , only forcing them to concentrate their attacks in specific areas .
out of the 80 attacks reported in the past three months alone , half of them occurred in or around the so-called corridor which merchant vessels have been encouraged to use in order to benefit from navy monitoring .
while the success rate of the pirates ' attacks has dipped slightly in recent weeks , the sheer numbers of attacks continues to thwart the west 's state-of-the-art naval machine .
" you would need at least 100 naval ships in the area to make a decisive impact but this is impossible , " said jean duval , a maritime expert with french private maritime security outfit secopex .
duval 's firm , which expects to clinch contracts with shipping companies in the coming weeks , is one of dozens of private companies hoping to cash in on the surge in piracy in somalia 's strategic waters .
while navies only can actively combat piracy and detain pirates , private firms seek to offer complementary services by escorting ships through the gulf of aden .
the eu and its international partners are aware of the limits to their action , admitting that piracy can only be eradicated if durable solutions are found to stabilize somalia .
" everything needs to be done to change somalia from a failed to state to a country where the authorities are in a position to maintain law and order , " vice admiral gerard vallin , who heads france 's naval forces in the indian ocean , told reporters .
navies have been powerless to free hijacked ships once they have been seized by pirates .
somali pirates are currently holding 16 ships and more than 350 crew .
pirates gave the owner of the sirius star up to the end of november to pay a ransom of $ 25 million . dw staff -lrb- nda -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

he said the party abandoned its conservative ideas and has been turning into a centrist defender of business interests .
" one i know for sure that these are not the policies with which i founded and led the ods for many years , " the president told the shocked delegates .
the surprise move came amid high tensions between the president and topolanek , his successor at the ods helm , over the party 's direction , with the rise in tensions coming when prague is preparing to assume the european union presidency on january 1 .
while klaus is a fierce critic of the eu , deeper european integration and bloc 's reform treaty , topolanek has urged a pragmatic and active european policy .
" when my views represent a minority it does not mean that i will be sulking and negate everything that will be agreed by everyone else , " topolanek told the congress .
" that is a highly unpolitical approach .
how long can such a game be played ?
not very . "
topolanek signed the lisbon treaty on the country 's behalf in december 2007 and has since backed it reluctantly as a necessary evil that opens the way for further reforms of the 27-member bloc .
while klaus ' step allows the premier to free the party from eurosceptic views , it also enables klaus to back a potential new eurosceptic party before june 's european parliament election .
klaus aligns himself with eu 's eurosceptics during a recent visit to ireland , klaus threw his support behind the eurosceptic libertas movement of irish businessman and anti-eu activist declan ganley , which successfully campaigned against the lisbon treaty in ireland .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : why me , why now ?
topolanek faces tough times the impact of klaus ' decision will become clear sunday when the civic democrats are to pick their new leadership .
topolanek faces a challenge for the top ods post from a klaus backer , prague mayor pavel bem .
the civic democrats are a senior partner in a three-party government , which has introduced several unpopular belt-tightening reforms , such as direct fees in health care , since assuming power in january 2007 .
the party suffered a massive loss in october regional and senate elections and bem would prefer to torpedo the current center-right coalition and form a minority government , backed by the leftist opposition .
topolanek , however , argued before the delegates that his government was the best choice at a time when the country is bracing for a sharp slowdown of its export-driven economy amid the global financial crisis . dpa news agency -lrb- nda -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de european union -pipe- 06.12.2008 czech president cuts ties with pm 's party before eu presidency großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : czech president klaus has made his choice to split at a most inopportune moment czech president vaclav klaus saturday cut ties with the civic democratic party of prime minister mirek topolanek on the eve of the czech republic 's eu presidency and a half year before european parliament elections . speaking at a key party congress , klaus said he " definitively " yielded honorary chairmanship of the party he founded nearly 18 years ago because he could not identify with the policies of its current leadership .
he said the party abandoned its conservative ideas and has been turning into a centrist defender of business interests .
" one i know for sure that these are not the policies with which i founded and led the ods for many years , " the president told the shocked delegates .
the surprise move came amid high tensions between the president and topolanek , his successor at the ods helm , over the party 's direction , with the rise in tensions coming when prague is preparing to assume the european union presidency on january 1 .
while klaus is a fierce critic of the eu , deeper european integration and bloc 's reform treaty , topolanek has urged a pragmatic and active european policy .
" when my views represent a minority it does not mean that i will be sulking and negate everything that will be agreed by everyone else , " topolanek told the congress .
" that is a highly unpolitical approach .
how long can such a game be played ?
not very . "
topolanek signed the lisbon treaty on the country 's behalf in december 2007 and has since backed it reluctantly as a necessary evil that opens the way for further reforms of the 27-member bloc .
while klaus ' step allows the premier to free the party from eurosceptic views , it also enables klaus to back a potential new eurosceptic party before june 's european parliament election .
klaus aligns himself with eu 's eurosceptics during a recent visit to ireland , klaus threw his support behind the eurosceptic libertas movement of irish businessman and anti-eu activist declan ganley , which successfully campaigned against the lisbon treaty in ireland .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : why me , why now ?
topolanek faces tough times the impact of klaus ' decision will become clear sunday when the civic democrats are to pick their new leadership .
topolanek faces a challenge for the top ods post from a klaus backer , prague mayor pavel bem .
the civic democrats are a senior partner in a three-party government , which has introduced several unpopular belt-tightening reforms , such as direct fees in health care , since assuming power in january 2007 .
the party suffered a massive loss in october regional and senate elections and bem would prefer to torpedo the current center-right coalition and form a minority government , backed by the leftist opposition .
topolanek , however , argued before the delegates that his government was the best choice at a time when the country is bracing for a sharp slowdown of its export-driven economy amid the global financial crisis . dpa news agency -lrb- nda -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

he said the party abandoned its conservative ideas and has been turning into a centrist defender of business interests .
" one i know for sure that these are not the policies with which i founded and led the ods for many years , " the president told the shocked delegates .
the surprise move came amid high tensions between the president and topolanek , his successor at the ods helm , over the party 's direction , with the rise in tensions coming when prague is preparing to assume the european union presidency on january 1 .
while klaus is a fierce critic of the eu , deeper european integration and bloc 's reform treaty , topolanek has urged a pragmatic and active european policy .

klaus aligns himself with eu 's eurosceptics during a recent visit to ireland , klaus threw his support behind the eurosceptic libertas movement of irish businessman and anti-eu activist declan ganley , which successfully campaigned against the lisbon treaty in ireland .

the united nations ' security council gave its formal green-light to the eu mission , which is to last for one year at a cost of 8.3 million euros -lrb- $ 10.5 million -rrb- last week .
the eu force takes over from nato 's own flotilla , which has been patrolling the somali coast since late october .
but as the eu force prepares to take over the responsiblility of patrolling the waters off somalia , a number of factors are casting a shadow over the mission .
earlier this week , eu foreign policy chief javier solana conceded that there were still a number of legal issues that needed to be resolved .
one concerns the different rules which eu member states apply on the detention of pirates .
" we need to coordinate that , but every country has a position - and that position is that they will not allow pirates to play around , " solana said .
nato commanders have also stressed the need for a more permanent solution to the patrols off the somali coast .
but officials note that any decision will likely require months of discussions .
" nato is indeed studying a longer-term role ... but there 's a lot of water on this globe , and this issue will be on the agenda for some time to come , " the nato chief said .
eu efforts were thrown further into doubt on friday when germany said that it would be reluctant to " actively " pursue somali pirates under its commitments to the eu security mission unless national interests were at stake .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : steinmeier and jung want national interests to be a priority " arresting people suspected of piracy is not the primary objective of the -lrb- german -rrb- operation , " foreign minister frank-walter steinmeier and defense minister franz josef jung wrote in a letter addressed to lawmakers , according to ard public television and saturday 's edition of frankfurter allgemeine zeitung newspaper .
in the letter berlin had drawn up a list of priority cases in which it is willing to deploy its navy to combat the pirates .
a decision setting out the terms of germany 's contribution to the mission is due to be made public on wednesday .
" we must protect civilian boats in this order of priority : world food program boats , other ships delivering humanitarian aid , vessels from eu member states or involving a third country , -lrb- and -rrb- other boats , " the document said .
the report has drawn criticism from germany 's opposition , which has accused the government of being too defensive .
" we must actively fight the pirates and take their boats .
after all , a pirate without a boat is quite ridiculous , " said rainer stinner from the liberal free democrats party -lrb- fdp -rrb- .
somali pirates undeterred by eu force bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : somali pirates are undeterred by the eu 's presence meanwhile , somali pirates were undeterred saturday as the new eu naval forces readied to launch their operation aimed at curbing relentless attacks that have rattled world maritime trade in the gulf of aden , which has in recent months become the world 's most dangerous stretch of water .
the gulf of aden commands access to the red sea and the suez canal , a key trade route between asia and europe , and atalanta will attempt to reassure shipping companies .
pirates equipped with speedboats , assault rifles and rocket launchers , have carried out more than 100 attacks since the start of the year .
they have raked in tens of millions of dollars in ransom money after hijacking foreign vessels , from luxury yachts to the sirius star , a 330-metre crude carrier which is still being held .
arguing that foreign fishing fleets have for years plundered somali fishing resources illegally , pirates have secured strong support from the coastal communities in a country ravaged by conflict and starvation .
" the presence of european war ships will undermine the somalis ' ability to protect their natural resources from illegal fishing , " said mohamed said , a pirate leader whose group has held the saudi super-tanker sirius star for ransom since november 15 .
" many of the polluters of somalia 's waters , those who dump toxic waste , are europeans .
this force will contribute to giving them unimpeded access to our waters , " he told reporters .
experts doubt multinational force is large enough with five of six eu ships expected in somali waters this month , the international naval presence in the region will be further enhanced , restricting the pirates ' room for maneuver .
but despite the added support of nato , the us navy and asian powers , experts argue the number of war ships will remain insufficient to root out piracy .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : experts believe the anti-piracy force is too small according to unosat , a un-affiliated agency that analyses satellite data , the recent increase in naval vessels has done little to deter pirates , only forcing them to concentrate their attacks in specific areas .
out of the 80 attacks reported in the past three months alone , half of them occurred in or around the so-called corridor which merchant vessels have been encouraged to use in order to benefit from navy monitoring .
while the success rate of the pirates ' attacks has dipped slightly in recent weeks , the sheer numbers of attacks continues to thwart the west 's state-of-the-art naval machine .
" you would need at least 100 naval ships in the area to make a decisive impact but this is impossible , " said jean duval , a maritime expert with french private maritime security outfit secopex .
duval 's firm , which expects to clinch contracts with shipping companies in the coming weeks , is one of dozens of private companies hoping to cash in on the surge in piracy in somalia 's strategic waters .
while navies only can actively combat piracy and detain pirates , private firms seek to offer complementary services by escorting ships through the gulf of aden .
the eu and its international partners are aware of the limits to their action , admitting that piracy can only be eradicated if durable solutions are found to stabilize somalia .
" everything needs to be done to change somalia from a failed to state to a country where the authorities are in a position to maintain law and order , " vice admiral gerard vallin , who heads france 's naval forces in the indian ocean , told reporters .
navies have been powerless to free hijacked ships once they have been seized by pirates .
somali pirates are currently holding 16 ships and more than 350 crew .
pirates gave the owner of the sirius star up to the end of november to pay a ransom of $ 25 million . dw staff -lrb- nda -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

5 in a simulated attack to test the defense system it wants to expand in eastern europe to counter attacks from north korea or iran . " this was the largest , most complex task that we 've ever done , " said lieutenant general patrick o 'reilly , director of the pentagon 's missile defense agency .
but the target missile 's countermeasures , intended to simulate decoys from enemy missiles - precisely what critics of the defense shield doubt the system could overcome - failed to deploy , he said .
" countermeasures are very difficult to deploy , " he said , adding that " there are many threats today that do n't have countermeasures . "
the interception took place at 3:29 pm -lrb- 21:29 cet -rrb- , pentagon spokesman bryan whitman said , making the effort the eighth successful intercept out of the 13 tests conducted since 1999 , with the last successful test taking place in september 2007 .
overall military chiefs approved of the effort .
" i am extremely pleased , " said o 'reilly at a press briefing .
" all the systems were working together , " he added , referring to the complex alignment of radars , sensors and timing to coordinate the high-octane missile .
brian green , deputy assistant secretary of defense for strategic capabilities , added that the effort was an " operationally realistic test . "
the effectiveness of the defense shield has been questioned by some scientists who claim the program would be unable to distinguish between a missile and a decoy - precisely what failed to be realized in friday 's effort .
the test is seen as a crucial step towards a controversial anti-missile shield washington plans to base in eastern europe .
the bush administration wants to install a radar facility in the czech republic and 10 interceptor missiles in neighboring poland by 2014 .
the test of the project , which so far has cost the defense department some $ 100 billion , comes at a critical time before president-elect barack obama moves into the white house on january 20 .
obama has so far not committed to the missile defense shield .
one of his senior foreign policy advisors , denis mcdonough , has indicated however that obama would support the program if the technology proves viable .
opponent russia still on edge bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : medvedev warned that he would deploy missiles in kaliningrad moscow has repeatedly voiced strong objections to the shield plan , which washington insists is not directed against russia but at " rogue states " such as iran and north korea .
in late november russian prime minister vladimir putin urged obama to drop the planned shield in eastern europe .
" this project is aimed against the strategic potential of russia .
and we can only give it an adequate response , " he said .
earlier last month moscow raised alarm in western capitals by warning it could place missiles in the russian exclave of kaliningrad , close to poland , in response to the plan .
on friday the interceptor missile was launched from vandenberg air force base in california , as the target - a fake warhead mimicking long-range ballistic missiles from nations like north korea - was set off from the alaskan island of kodiak . dw staff -lrb- nda -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

one of his senior foreign policy advisors , denis mcdonough , has indicated however that obama would support the program if the technology proves viable .

the interception took place at 3:29 pm -lrb- 21:29 cet -rrb- , pentagon spokesman bryan whitman said , making the effort the eighth successful intercept out of the 13 tests conducted since 1999 , with the last successful test taking place in september 2007 .

in a move human rights groups fear will weaken the judiciary 's independence , judges may soon be deciding all verdicts on serious crime the lower house of russia 's parliament passed the bill on friday , dec .
5 , in the first of three required readings , the interfax news agency reported , adding that 351 lawmakers voted in favor of the bill while 34 were opposed . " a practice has been noted where juries acquit terrorists who have committed grave crimes , " vladimir vasilyev , head of the duma 's security committee , was quoted as saying on the web site of the pro-kremlin united russia party . legislators proposed the bill to limit the use of jury trials , which were introduced in the post-soviet era .
supporters of the bill have said trial by jury ends much more often in an acquittal than trials where a judge presides over the case . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the fates of three men accused of killing politkovskaya will be decided by a jury in some high-profile cases , such as the trial of the murdered journalist paul klebnikov , the suspects were acquitted .
the trial of three men accused of roles in the killing of journalist anna politkovskaya is being heard before a jury . lawyers and human rights organization , however , have criticized the bill .
they have said rampant corruption in the russian judiciary affects judges ' independence . " jury trials have their own negatives , but they are less biased , " yuri schmidt , a moscow-based defense lawyer , told reuters news agency .
" courts without juries wo n't take free decisions and instead all decisions will be controlled by the authorities . " the bill would also abolish jury trials for people suspected of treason , hostage-taking , organizing mass disturbances and some other serious crimes . before the bill is enacted as law , it must pass two more readings in the duma and be approved by the upper house of parliament and president dmitry medvedev . dw staff -lrb- sms -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

" a practice has been noted where juries acquit terrorists who have committed grave crimes , " vladimir vasilyev , head of the duma 's security committee , was quoted as saying on the web site of the pro-kremlin united russia party . legislators proposed the bill to limit the use of jury trials , which were introduced in the post-soviet era .
supporters of the bill have said trial by jury ends much more often in an acquittal than trials where a judge presides over the case . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the fates of three men accused of killing politkovskaya will be decided by a jury in some high-profile cases , such as the trial of the murdered journalist paul klebnikov , the suspects were acquitted .
the trial of three men accused of roles in the killing of journalist anna politkovskaya is being heard before a jury . lawyers and human rights organization , however , have criticized the bill .
they have said rampant corruption in the russian judiciary affects judges ' independence . " jury trials have their own negatives , but they are less biased , " yuri schmidt , a moscow-based defense lawyer , told reuters news agency .
" courts without juries wo n't take free decisions and instead all decisions will be controlled by the authorities . " the bill would also abolish jury trials for people suspected of treason , hostage-taking , organizing mass disturbances and some other serious crimes . before the bill is enacted as law , it must pass two more readings in the duma and be approved by the upper house of parliament and president dmitry medvedev . dw staff -lrb- sms -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

he said the party abandoned its conservative ideas and has been turning into a centrist defender of business interests .
" one i know for sure that these are not the policies with which i founded and led the ods for many years , " the president told the shocked delegates .
the surprise move came amid high tensions between the president and topolanek , his successor at the ods helm , over the party 's direction , with the rise in tensions coming when prague is preparing to assume the european union presidency on january 1 .
while klaus is a fierce critic of the eu , deeper european integration and bloc 's reform treaty , topolanek has urged a pragmatic and active european policy .
" when my views represent a minority it does not mean that i will be sulking and negate everything that will be agreed by everyone else , " topolanek told the congress .
" that is a highly unpolitical approach .
how long can such a game be played ?
not very . "
topolanek signed the lisbon treaty on the country 's behalf in december 2007 and has since backed it reluctantly as a necessary evil that opens the way for further reforms of the 27-member bloc .
while klaus ' step allows the premier to free the party from eurosceptic views , it also enables klaus to back a potential new eurosceptic party before june 's european parliament election .
klaus aligns himself with eu 's eurosceptics during a recent visit to ireland , klaus threw his support behind the eurosceptic libertas movement of irish businessman and anti-eu activist declan ganley , which successfully campaigned against the lisbon treaty in ireland .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de intercultural dialogue -pipe- 06.12.2008 dalai lama calls for dialogue ahead of sarkozy meeting großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the dalai lama 's planned meeting with sarkozy has enraged china tibetan spiritual leader the dalai lama called for a " century of dialogue " and disarmament in poland saturday , dec .
6 , hours before a meeting with french president nicolas sarkozy which has enraged china . the spiritual leader called for dialogue and stressed interdependence and cooperation while praising poland 's spirit in face of hardship during celebrations in gdansk that marked the 25th anniversary of lech walesa receiving the nobel peace prize .
he said while poland 's interest depended on europe , it was also a case that " europe 's interest depends on the rest of the world . "
the dalai lama praised walesa 's solidarity movement , which in the 1980s lead strikes in the gdansk 's shipyards that helped peacefully topple the communist regime in poland .
he said the movement worked with " courage and determination " under " difficult circumstances . "
" poland is a people who experience many difficult periods , however no matter what difficulties , the polish people always keep your spirit , your determination , " the dalai lama told the gathering of world leaders in northern poland .
" i admire polish people ... a lot of atrocities , a lot of difficulties , but you never lost your hope , your determination . "
the anniversary celebrations of his nobel peace prize included leaders like french president nicolas sarkozy , and nobel peace prize laureates like south africa 's fw de klerk and israel 's shimon peres .
the dalai lama also called for " external disarmament , " and said demilitarization must begin with " inner peace " and letting go of fear and suspicion .
sarkozy arrived in gdansk with firm plans to meet the dalai lama , a move that has china fuming .
sarkozy 's meeting leads to scrapped eu-china summit bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : sarkozy and hu jintao have done much business recently as current holder of the european union 's six-month rotating presidency , the french leader 's decision to engage with the exiled tibetan spiritual leader has so far seen beijing retaliate by scrapping a china-eu summit in france earlier this week .
it also warned multi-billion-dollar trade deals between china and france were in jeopardy should the meeting go ahead .
" we have not noticed any kind of start of a boycott of our products , " a french presidential official told reporters saturday , emphasizing that france and china needed each other during a period of economic crisis .
sarkozy is set to become the only european head of state to meet the dalai lama while holding the eu 's rotating presidency .
asked friday in the northern polish city whether he thought the french president might cancel the meeting with him , as has happened twice in the past , the dalai lama said : " wait until tomorrow .
i do n't know . "
france calls for restraint over trade threats bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : kouchner says sanctions at this time would be unfair commenting on whether eu-china relations and trade could suffer over his planned meeting with sarkozy the dalai lama remarked : " china also needs europe . "
" the original initiative of some pressure , sometimes is not followed by action , " he said .
france is digging in its heels , saying the meeting will go ahead and calling for economic ties to be spared from retribution , especially during the financial crisis .
" we can not have france 's conduct dictated to , even by our friends , " said foreign minister bernard kouchner .
the dalai lama , who lives in exile in india , has sought " meaningful autonomy " for tibet since he fled his homeland following a failed uprising in 1959 against chinese rule , nine years after chinese troops invaded the region .
china argues he is actually seeking full independence , something he on friday called a " totally baseless " claim .
" when china becomes more democratic , with freedom of speech , with rule of law and particularly with freedom of the press , ... once china becomes an open , modern society , then the tibet issue , i think within a few days , can be solved , " the dalai lama said friday .
addressing the european parliament in brussels on thursday , he said china lacked the moral authority to be a true superpower .
" the dalai lama will raise human rights issues and above all the very urgent situation of tibet ... where the situation nearly resembles that of martial law , " during the saturday afternoon meeting with sarkozy , the head of france 's tibetan community wangpo bashi told radio france-info saturday .
the meeting is " a very strong signal " for tibetans , he added . dw staff -lrb- nda -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

he said while poland 's interest depended on europe , it was also a case that " europe 's interest depends on the rest of the world . "
the dalai lama praised walesa 's solidarity movement , which in the 1980s lead strikes in the gdansk 's shipyards that helped peacefully topple the communist regime in poland .
he said the movement worked with " courage and determination " under " difficult circumstances . "
" poland is a people who experience many difficult periods , however no matter what difficulties , the polish people always keep your spirit , your determination , " the dalai lama told the gathering of world leaders in northern poland .
" i admire polish people ... a lot of atrocities , a lot of difficulties , but you never lost your hope , your determination . "
the anniversary celebrations of his nobel peace prize included leaders like french president nicolas sarkozy , and nobel peace prize laureates like south africa 's fw de klerk and israel 's shimon peres .

it also warned multi-billion-dollar trade deals between china and france were in jeopardy should the meeting go ahead .
" we have not noticed any kind of start of a boycott of our products , " a french presidential official told reporters saturday , emphasizing that france and china needed each other during a period of economic crisis .

"
" the original initiative of some pressure , sometimes is not followed by action , " he said .
france is digging in its heels , saying the meeting will go ahead and calling for economic ties to be spared from retribution , especially during the financial crisis .
" we can not have france 's conduct dictated to , even by our friends , " said foreign minister bernard kouchner .
the dalai lama , who lives in exile in india , has sought " meaningful autonomy " for tibet since he fled his homeland following a failed uprising in 1959 against chinese rule , nine years after chinese troops invaded the region .
china argues he is actually seeking full independence , something he on friday called a " totally baseless " claim .
" when china becomes more democratic , with freedom of speech , with rule of law and particularly with freedom of the press , ... once china becomes an open , modern society , then the tibet issue , i think within a few days , can be solved , " the dalai lama said friday .

but the target missile 's countermeasures , intended to simulate decoys from enemy missiles - precisely what critics of the defense shield doubt the system could overcome - failed to deploy , he said .
" countermeasures are very difficult to deploy , " he said , adding that " there are many threats today that do n't have countermeasures . "
the interception took place at 3:29 pm -lrb- 21:29 cet -rrb- , pentagon spokesman bryan whitman said , making the effort the eighth successful intercept out of the 13 tests conducted since 1999 , with the last successful test taking place in september 2007 .
overall military chiefs approved of the effort .
" i am extremely pleased , " said o 'reilly at a press briefing .
" all the systems were working together , " he added , referring to the complex alignment of radars , sensors and timing to coordinate the high-octane missile .
brian green , deputy assistant secretary of defense for strategic capabilities , added that the effort was an " operationally realistic test . "
the effectiveness of the defense shield has been questioned by some scientists who claim the program would be unable to distinguish between a missile and a decoy - precisely what failed to be realized in friday 's effort .
the test is seen as a crucial step towards a controversial anti-missile shield washington plans to base in eastern europe .
the bush administration wants to install a radar facility in the czech republic and 10 interceptor missiles in neighboring poland by 2014 .
the test of the project , which so far has cost the defense department some $ 100 billion , comes at a critical time before president-elect barack obama moves into the white house on january 20 .
obama has so far not committed to the missile defense shield .
one of his senior foreign policy advisors , denis mcdonough , has indicated however that obama would support the program if the technology proves viable .

in late november russian prime minister vladimir putin urged obama to drop the planned shield in eastern europe .
" this project is aimed against the strategic potential of russia .
and we can only give it an adequate response , " he said .
earlier last month moscow raised alarm in western capitals by warning it could place missiles in the russian exclave of kaliningrad , close to poland , in response to the plan .
on friday the interceptor missile was launched from vandenberg air force base in california , as the target - a fake warhead mimicking long-range ballistic missiles from nations like north korea - was set off from the alaskan island of kodiak . dw staff -lrb- nda -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

5 in a simulated attack to test the defense system it wants to expand in eastern europe to counter attacks from north korea or iran . " this was the largest , most complex task that we 've ever done , " said lieutenant general patrick o 'reilly , director of the pentagon 's missile defense agency .
but the target missile 's countermeasures , intended to simulate decoys from enemy missiles - precisely what critics of the defense shield doubt the system could overcome - failed to deploy , he said .
" countermeasures are very difficult to deploy , " he said , adding that " there are many threats today that do n't have countermeasures . "
the interception took place at 3:29 pm -lrb- 21:29 cet -rrb- , pentagon spokesman bryan whitman said , making the effort the eighth successful intercept out of the 13 tests conducted since 1999 , with the last successful test taking place in september 2007 .
overall military chiefs approved of the effort .
" i am extremely pleased , " said o 'reilly at a press briefing .
" all the systems were working together , " he added , referring to the complex alignment of radars , sensors and timing to coordinate the high-octane missile .
brian green , deputy assistant secretary of defense for strategic capabilities , added that the effort was an " operationally realistic test . "
the effectiveness of the defense shield has been questioned by some scientists who claim the program would be unable to distinguish between a missile and a decoy - precisely what failed to be realized in friday 's effort .
the test is seen as a crucial step towards a controversial anti-missile shield washington plans to base in eastern europe .
the bush administration wants to install a radar facility in the czech republic and 10 interceptor missiles in neighboring poland by 2014 .
the test of the project , which so far has cost the defense department some $ 100 billion , comes at a critical time before president-elect barack obama moves into the white house on january 20 .
obama has so far not committed to the missile defense shield .
one of his senior foreign policy advisors , denis mcdonough , has indicated however that obama would support the program if the technology proves viable .
opponent russia still on edge bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : medvedev warned that he would deploy missiles in kaliningrad moscow has repeatedly voiced strong objections to the shield plan , which washington insists is not directed against russia but at " rogue states " such as iran and north korea .
in late november russian prime minister vladimir putin urged obama to drop the planned shield in eastern europe .
" this project is aimed against the strategic potential of russia .
and we can only give it an adequate response , " he said .
earlier last month moscow raised alarm in western capitals by warning it could place missiles in the russian exclave of kaliningrad , close to poland , in response to the plan .
on friday the interceptor missile was launched from vandenberg air force base in california , as the target - a fake warhead mimicking long-range ballistic missiles from nations like north korea - was set off from the alaskan island of kodiak . dw staff -lrb- nda -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

the united nations ' security council gave its formal green-light to the eu mission , which is to last for one year at a cost of 8.3 million euros -lrb- $ 10.5 million -rrb- last week .
the eu force takes over from nato 's own flotilla , which has been patrolling the somali coast since late october .
but as the eu force prepares to take over the responsiblility of patrolling the waters off somalia , a number of factors are casting a shadow over the mission .
earlier this week , eu foreign policy chief javier solana conceded that there were still a number of legal issues that needed to be resolved .
one concerns the different rules which eu member states apply on the detention of pirates .
" we need to coordinate that , but every country has a position - and that position is that they will not allow pirates to play around , " solana said .
nato commanders have also stressed the need for a more permanent solution to the patrols off the somali coast .
but officials note that any decision will likely require months of discussions .
" nato is indeed studying a longer-term role ... but there 's a lot of water on this globe , and this issue will be on the agenda for some time to come , " the nato chief said .
eu efforts were thrown further into doubt on friday when germany said that it would be reluctant to " actively " pursue somali pirates under its commitments to the eu security mission unless national interests were at stake .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : steinmeier and jung want national interests to be a priority " arresting people suspected of piracy is not the primary objective of the -lrb- german -rrb- operation , " foreign minister frank-walter steinmeier and defense minister franz josef jung wrote in a letter addressed to lawmakers , according to ard public television and saturday 's edition of frankfurter allgemeine zeitung newspaper .
in the letter berlin had drawn up a list of priority cases in which it is willing to deploy its navy to combat the pirates .
a decision setting out the terms of germany 's contribution to the mission is due to be made public on wednesday .
" we must protect civilian boats in this order of priority : world food program boats , other ships delivering humanitarian aid , vessels from eu member states or involving a third country , -lrb- and -rrb- other boats , " the document said .
the report has drawn criticism from germany 's opposition , which has accused the government of being too defensive .
" we must actively fight the pirates and take their boats .
after all , a pirate without a boat is quite ridiculous , " said rainer stinner from the liberal free democrats party -lrb- fdp -rrb- .
somali pirates undeterred by eu force bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : somali pirates are undeterred by the eu 's presence meanwhile , somali pirates were undeterred saturday as the new eu naval forces readied to launch their operation aimed at curbing relentless attacks that have rattled world maritime trade in the gulf of aden , which has in recent months become the world 's most dangerous stretch of water .
the gulf of aden commands access to the red sea and the suez canal , a key trade route between asia and europe , and atalanta will attempt to reassure shipping companies .
pirates equipped with speedboats , assault rifles and rocket launchers , have carried out more than 100 attacks since the start of the year .
they have raked in tens of millions of dollars in ransom money after hijacking foreign vessels , from luxury yachts to the sirius star , a 330-metre crude carrier which is still being held .
arguing that foreign fishing fleets have for years plundered somali fishing resources illegally , pirates have secured strong support from the coastal communities in a country ravaged by conflict and starvation .
" the presence of european war ships will undermine the somalis ' ability to protect their natural resources from illegal fishing , " said mohamed said , a pirate leader whose group has held the saudi super-tanker sirius star for ransom since november 15 .
" many of the polluters of somalia 's waters , those who dump toxic waste , are europeans .
this force will contribute to giving them unimpeded access to our waters , " he told reporters .
experts doubt multinational force is large enough with five of six eu ships expected in somali waters this month , the international naval presence in the region will be further enhanced , restricting the pirates ' room for maneuver .
but despite the added support of nato , the us navy and asian powers , experts argue the number of war ships will remain insufficient to root out piracy .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : experts believe the anti-piracy force is too small according to unosat , a un-affiliated agency that analyses satellite data , the recent increase in naval vessels has done little to deter pirates , only forcing them to concentrate their attacks in specific areas .
out of the 80 attacks reported in the past three months alone , half of them occurred in or around the so-called corridor which merchant vessels have been encouraged to use in order to benefit from navy monitoring .
while the success rate of the pirates ' attacks has dipped slightly in recent weeks , the sheer numbers of attacks continues to thwart the west 's state-of-the-art naval machine .
" you would need at least 100 naval ships in the area to make a decisive impact but this is impossible , " said jean duval , a maritime expert with french private maritime security outfit secopex .
duval 's firm , which expects to clinch contracts with shipping companies in the coming weeks , is one of dozens of private companies hoping to cash in on the surge in piracy in somalia 's strategic waters .
while navies only can actively combat piracy and detain pirates , private firms seek to offer complementary services by escorting ships through the gulf of aden .
the eu and its international partners are aware of the limits to their action , admitting that piracy can only be eradicated if durable solutions are found to stabilize somalia .
" everything needs to be done to change somalia from a failed to state to a country where the authorities are in a position to maintain law and order , " vice admiral gerard vallin , who heads france 's naval forces in the indian ocean , told reporters .
navies have been powerless to free hijacked ships once they have been seized by pirates .
somali pirates are currently holding 16 ships and more than 350 crew .

the united nations ' security council gave its formal green-light to the eu mission , which is to last for one year at a cost of 8.3 million euros -lrb- $ 10.5 million -rrb- last week .
the eu force takes over from nato 's own flotilla , which has been patrolling the somali coast since late october .
but as the eu force prepares to take over the responsiblility of patrolling the waters off somalia , a number of factors are casting a shadow over the mission .
earlier this week , eu foreign policy chief javier solana conceded that there were still a number of legal issues that needed to be resolved .
one concerns the different rules which eu member states apply on the detention of pirates .
" we need to coordinate that , but every country has a position - and that position is that they will not allow pirates to play around , " solana said .
nato commanders have also stressed the need for a more permanent solution to the patrols off the somali coast .
but officials note that any decision will likely require months of discussions .
" nato is indeed studying a longer-term role ... but there 's a lot of water on this globe , and this issue will be on the agenda for some time to come , " the nato chief said .
eu efforts were thrown further into doubt on friday when germany said that it would be reluctant to " actively " pursue somali pirates under its commitments to the eu security mission unless national interests were at stake .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : steinmeier and jung want national interests to be a priority " arresting people suspected of piracy is not the primary objective of the -lrb- german -rrb- operation , " foreign minister frank-walter steinmeier and defense minister franz josef jung wrote in a letter addressed to lawmakers , according to ard public television and saturday 's edition of frankfurter allgemeine zeitung newspaper .
in the letter berlin had drawn up a list of priority cases in which it is willing to deploy its navy to combat the pirates .
a decision setting out the terms of germany 's contribution to the mission is due to be made public on wednesday .
" we must protect civilian boats in this order of priority : world food program boats , other ships delivering humanitarian aid , vessels from eu member states or involving a third country , -lrb- and -rrb- other boats , " the document said .
the report has drawn criticism from germany 's opposition , which has accused the government of being too defensive .
" we must actively fight the pirates and take their boats .
after all , a pirate without a boat is quite ridiculous , " said rainer stinner from the liberal free democrats party -lrb- fdp -rrb- .
somali pirates undeterred by eu force bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : somali pirates are undeterred by the eu 's presence meanwhile , somali pirates were undeterred saturday as the new eu naval forces readied to launch their operation aimed at curbing relentless attacks that have rattled world maritime trade in the gulf of aden , which has in recent months become the world 's most dangerous stretch of water .
the gulf of aden commands access to the red sea and the suez canal , a key trade route between asia and europe , and atalanta will attempt to reassure shipping companies .
pirates equipped with speedboats , assault rifles and rocket launchers , have carried out more than 100 attacks since the start of the year .
they have raked in tens of millions of dollars in ransom money after hijacking foreign vessels , from luxury yachts to the sirius star , a 330-metre crude carrier which is still being held .
arguing that foreign fishing fleets have for years plundered somali fishing resources illegally , pirates have secured strong support from the coastal communities in a country ravaged by conflict and starvation .
" the presence of european war ships will undermine the somalis ' ability to protect their natural resources from illegal fishing , " said mohamed said , a pirate leader whose group has held the saudi super-tanker sirius star for ransom since november 15 .
" many of the polluters of somalia 's waters , those who dump toxic waste , are europeans .
this force will contribute to giving them unimpeded access to our waters , " he told reporters .
experts doubt multinational force is large enough with five of six eu ships expected in somali waters this month , the international naval presence in the region will be further enhanced , restricting the pirates ' room for maneuver .
but despite the added support of nato , the us navy and asian powers , experts argue the number of war ships will remain insufficient to root out piracy .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : experts believe the anti-piracy force is too small according to unosat , a un-affiliated agency that analyses satellite data , the recent increase in naval vessels has done little to deter pirates , only forcing them to concentrate their attacks in specific areas .
out of the 80 attacks reported in the past three months alone , half of them occurred in or around the so-called corridor which merchant vessels have been encouraged to use in order to benefit from navy monitoring .
while the success rate of the pirates ' attacks has dipped slightly in recent weeks , the sheer numbers of attacks continues to thwart the west 's state-of-the-art naval machine .
" you would need at least 100 naval ships in the area to make a decisive impact but this is impossible , " said jean duval , a maritime expert with french private maritime security outfit secopex .
duval 's firm , which expects to clinch contracts with shipping companies in the coming weeks , is one of dozens of private companies hoping to cash in on the surge in piracy in somalia 's strategic waters .
while navies only can actively combat piracy and detain pirates , private firms seek to offer complementary services by escorting ships through the gulf of aden .
the eu and its international partners are aware of the limits to their action , admitting that piracy can only be eradicated if durable solutions are found to stabilize somalia .
" everything needs to be done to change somalia from a failed to state to a country where the authorities are in a position to maintain law and order , " vice admiral gerard vallin , who heads france 's naval forces in the indian ocean , told reporters .
navies have been powerless to free hijacked ships once they have been seized by pirates .
somali pirates are currently holding 16 ships and more than 350 crew .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de defense -pipe- 06.12.2008 doubts and indifference dog eu anti-piracy mission in somalia großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : germany expressed doubts about its involvement in the mission days before it begins as the european union 's anti-piracy mission off the coast of somalia prepares for the start of operations on monday , doubts are raised by governments and experts as the pirates themselves offer indifferent responses . the eu 's naval force for somalia " atalanta " mission , which consists of six warships and three maritime reconnaissance aircraft , is due to start escorting merchant ships and world food program vessels delivering food aid to africa on monday .
the united nations ' security council gave its formal green-light to the eu mission , which is to last for one year at a cost of 8.3 million euros -lrb- $ 10.5 million -rrb- last week .
the eu force takes over from nato 's own flotilla , which has been patrolling the somali coast since late october .
but as the eu force prepares to take over the responsiblility of patrolling the waters off somalia , a number of factors are casting a shadow over the mission .
earlier this week , eu foreign policy chief javier solana conceded that there were still a number of legal issues that needed to be resolved .
one concerns the different rules which eu member states apply on the detention of pirates .
" we need to coordinate that , but every country has a position - and that position is that they will not allow pirates to play around , " solana said .
nato commanders have also stressed the need for a more permanent solution to the patrols off the somali coast .
but officials note that any decision will likely require months of discussions .
" nato is indeed studying a longer-term role ... but there 's a lot of water on this globe , and this issue will be on the agenda for some time to come , " the nato chief said .
eu efforts were thrown further into doubt on friday when germany said that it would be reluctant to " actively " pursue somali pirates under its commitments to the eu security mission unless national interests were at stake .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : steinmeier and jung want national interests to be a priority " arresting people suspected of piracy is not the primary objective of the -lrb- german -rrb- operation , " foreign minister frank-walter steinmeier and defense minister franz josef jung wrote in a letter addressed to lawmakers , according to ard public television and saturday 's edition of frankfurter allgemeine zeitung newspaper .
in the letter berlin had drawn up a list of priority cases in which it is willing to deploy its navy to combat the pirates .
a decision setting out the terms of germany 's contribution to the mission is due to be made public on wednesday .
" we must protect civilian boats in this order of priority : world food program boats , other ships delivering humanitarian aid , vessels from eu member states or involving a third country , -lrb- and -rrb- other boats , " the document said .
the report has drawn criticism from germany 's opposition , which has accused the government of being too defensive .
" we must actively fight the pirates and take their boats .
after all , a pirate without a boat is quite ridiculous , " said rainer stinner from the liberal free democrats party -lrb- fdp -rrb- .
somali pirates undeterred by eu force bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : somali pirates are undeterred by the eu 's presence meanwhile , somali pirates were undeterred saturday as the new eu naval forces readied to launch their operation aimed at curbing relentless attacks that have rattled world maritime trade in the gulf of aden , which has in recent months become the world 's most dangerous stretch of water .
the gulf of aden commands access to the red sea and the suez canal , a key trade route between asia and europe , and atalanta will attempt to reassure shipping companies .
pirates equipped with speedboats , assault rifles and rocket launchers , have carried out more than 100 attacks since the start of the year .
they have raked in tens of millions of dollars in ransom money after hijacking foreign vessels , from luxury yachts to the sirius star , a 330-metre crude carrier which is still being held .
arguing that foreign fishing fleets have for years plundered somali fishing resources illegally , pirates have secured strong support from the coastal communities in a country ravaged by conflict and starvation .
" the presence of european war ships will undermine the somalis ' ability to protect their natural resources from illegal fishing , " said mohamed said , a pirate leader whose group has held the saudi super-tanker sirius star for ransom since november 15 .
" many of the polluters of somalia 's waters , those who dump toxic waste , are europeans .
this force will contribute to giving them unimpeded access to our waters , " he told reporters .
experts doubt multinational force is large enough with five of six eu ships expected in somali waters this month , the international naval presence in the region will be further enhanced , restricting the pirates ' room for maneuver .
but despite the added support of nato , the us navy and asian powers , experts argue the number of war ships will remain insufficient to root out piracy .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : experts believe the anti-piracy force is too small according to unosat , a un-affiliated agency that analyses satellite data , the recent increase in naval vessels has done little to deter pirates , only forcing them to concentrate their attacks in specific areas .
out of the 80 attacks reported in the past three months alone , half of them occurred in or around the so-called corridor which merchant vessels have been encouraged to use in order to benefit from navy monitoring .
while the success rate of the pirates ' attacks has dipped slightly in recent weeks , the sheer numbers of attacks continues to thwart the west 's state-of-the-art naval machine .
" you would need at least 100 naval ships in the area to make a decisive impact but this is impossible , " said jean duval , a maritime expert with french private maritime security outfit secopex .
duval 's firm , which expects to clinch contracts with shipping companies in the coming weeks , is one of dozens of private companies hoping to cash in on the surge in piracy in somalia 's strategic waters .
while navies only can actively combat piracy and detain pirates , private firms seek to offer complementary services by escorting ships through the gulf of aden .
the eu and its international partners are aware of the limits to their action , admitting that piracy can only be eradicated if durable solutions are found to stabilize somalia .
" everything needs to be done to change somalia from a failed to state to a country where the authorities are in a position to maintain law and order , " vice admiral gerard vallin , who heads france 's naval forces in the indian ocean , told reporters .
navies have been powerless to free hijacked ships once they have been seized by pirates .

the average age of the study 's participants was 23 , and more than two-thirds of the participants were women .
the study did not count the shaving of men 's beards and moustaches .
nine of 10 women in the study or 89 per cent who regularly shave , epilate or trim , said they removed hair from three or more places on their body .
almost half said they removed hair from four places .
researchers said women most commonly shave their legs , armpits and genital areas , and some also shave their eyebrows .
among men , who regularly remove hair - not including their beards and moustaches - more than 50 per cent said they removed hair from two or three places on their bodies .
for men the primary places are the armpits , genital area and the upper body .
asked why they need to be rid of the hair , the participants said they wanted to look attractive and meet society norms .
researchers link the shaving trend , particularly among women who remove hair from their genital area , to a desire to look pre-pubescent and signal sexual immaturity .
this strengthens a man 's sense of superiority , the researchers said .
at the same , time shaving intimate areas could also be interpreted as a sign of heightened feminine liberation and a sense of mature feminine self- confidence .
professor elmar braehler , who was responsible for the study , said basically there is a general cultural trend toward shaving .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : body hair is expected to be back in vogue in the future " ever-skimpier bathing suits as well as the strong presence of nudity in the media contribute to the emergence of an aesthetic norm for these areas , " said braehler .
thus , an imperative form for the genital area has developed .
as with all fashion , an opposing trend will follow , according to the researchers .
" sooner or later lush hair again will be considered chic . " dpa news agency -lrb- nda -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

in a move human rights groups fear will weaken the judiciary 's independence , judges may soon be deciding all verdicts on serious crime the lower house of russia 's parliament passed the bill on friday , dec .
5 , in the first of three required readings , the interfax news agency reported , adding that 351 lawmakers voted in favor of the bill while 34 were opposed . " a practice has been noted where juries acquit terrorists who have committed grave crimes , " vladimir vasilyev , head of the duma 's security committee , was quoted as saying on the web site of the pro-kremlin united russia party . legislators proposed the bill to limit the use of jury trials , which were introduced in the post-soviet era .
supporters of the bill have said trial by jury ends much more often in an acquittal than trials where a judge presides over the case . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the fates of three men accused of killing politkovskaya will be decided by a jury in some high-profile cases , such as the trial of the murdered journalist paul klebnikov , the suspects were acquitted .
the trial of three men accused of roles in the killing of journalist anna politkovskaya is being heard before a jury . lawyers and human rights organization , however , have criticized the bill .
they have said rampant corruption in the russian judiciary affects judges ' independence . " jury trials have their own negatives , but they are less biased , " yuri schmidt , a moscow-based defense lawyer , told reuters news agency .
" courts without juries wo n't take free decisions and instead all decisions will be controlled by the authorities . " the bill would also abolish jury trials for people suspected of treason , hostage-taking , organizing mass disturbances and some other serious crimes . before the bill is enacted as law , it must pass two more readings in the duma and be approved by the upper house of parliament and president dmitry medvedev . dw staff -lrb- sms -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

6 , hours before a meeting with french president nicolas sarkozy which has enraged china . the spiritual leader called for dialogue and stressed interdependence and cooperation while praising poland 's spirit in face of hardship during celebrations in gdansk that marked the 25th anniversary of lech walesa receiving the nobel peace prize .
he said while poland 's interest depended on europe , it was also a case that " europe 's interest depends on the rest of the world . "
the dalai lama praised walesa 's solidarity movement , which in the 1980s lead strikes in the gdansk 's shipyards that helped peacefully topple the communist regime in poland .
he said the movement worked with " courage and determination " under " difficult circumstances . "
" poland is a people who experience many difficult periods , however no matter what difficulties , the polish people always keep your spirit , your determination , " the dalai lama told the gathering of world leaders in northern poland .
" i admire polish people ... a lot of atrocities , a lot of difficulties , but you never lost your hope , your determination . "
the anniversary celebrations of his nobel peace prize included leaders like french president nicolas sarkozy , and nobel peace prize laureates like south africa 's fw de klerk and israel 's shimon peres .
the dalai lama also called for " external disarmament , " and said demilitarization must begin with " inner peace " and letting go of fear and suspicion .
sarkozy arrived in gdansk with firm plans to meet the dalai lama , a move that has china fuming .
sarkozy 's meeting leads to scrapped eu-china summit bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : sarkozy and hu jintao have done much business recently as current holder of the european union 's six-month rotating presidency , the french leader 's decision to engage with the exiled tibetan spiritual leader has so far seen beijing retaliate by scrapping a china-eu summit in france earlier this week .
it also warned multi-billion-dollar trade deals between china and france were in jeopardy should the meeting go ahead .
" we have not noticed any kind of start of a boycott of our products , " a french presidential official told reporters saturday , emphasizing that france and china needed each other during a period of economic crisis .
sarkozy is set to become the only european head of state to meet the dalai lama while holding the eu 's rotating presidency .
asked friday in the northern polish city whether he thought the french president might cancel the meeting with him , as has happened twice in the past , the dalai lama said : " wait until tomorrow .
i do n't know . "
france calls for restraint over trade threats bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : kouchner says sanctions at this time would be unfair commenting on whether eu-china relations and trade could suffer over his planned meeting with sarkozy the dalai lama remarked : " china also needs europe . "
" the original initiative of some pressure , sometimes is not followed by action , " he said .
france is digging in its heels , saying the meeting will go ahead and calling for economic ties to be spared from retribution , especially during the financial crisis .
" we can not have france 's conduct dictated to , even by our friends , " said foreign minister bernard kouchner .
the dalai lama , who lives in exile in india , has sought " meaningful autonomy " for tibet since he fled his homeland following a failed uprising in 1959 against chinese rule , nine years after chinese troops invaded the region .
china argues he is actually seeking full independence , something he on friday called a " totally baseless " claim .
" when china becomes more democratic , with freedom of speech , with rule of law and particularly with freedom of the press , ... once china becomes an open , modern society , then the tibet issue , i think within a few days , can be solved , " the dalai lama said friday .
addressing the european parliament in brussels on thursday , he said china lacked the moral authority to be a true superpower .
" the dalai lama will raise human rights issues and above all the very urgent situation of tibet ... where the situation nearly resembles that of martial law , " during the saturday afternoon meeting with sarkozy , the head of france 's tibetan community wangpo bashi told radio france-info saturday .

hoffenheim remain league leaders . the win lifts bayern to 34 points , level with promoted hoffenheim who stay top on goal difference . bundesliga hotshot vedad ibisevic struck again as hoffenheim took the lead shortly after the break , but philipp lahm levelled on the hour for bayern . " it was a tense and exciting game and it 's super that we won in the end , " bayern coach juergen klinsmann said .
" we had enough chances to score the second goal earlier . " ibisevic struck his 18th goal in 16 games to stun bayern in the 49th minute following an even first half in which luca toni had an early chance for bayern only to hit the side-netting . record scoring threat ? bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : ibisevic is shooting to beat mueller 's goal-scoring record tobias weis started the move for the visitors , combining well with chinedu obasi before crossing to find ibisevic who shrugged off massimo oddo and turned to rifle the ball past keeper michael rensing . oddo claimed he had been fouled , but it was a goal very much in the mold of bayern legend gerd mueller whose record of 40 league goals in a season could be under threat from the bosnia striker . " we put a lot into the game , ran and worked hard but in the end we have nothing to show for it which is a pity , " ibisevic said .
" it is undeserved if you look at the game , but life goes on .
we have to learn quickly that you should n't lose games like this .

" the result is very bitter , " he said .

6 , hours before a meeting with french president nicolas sarkozy which has enraged china . the spiritual leader called for dialogue and stressed interdependence and cooperation while praising poland 's spirit in face of hardship during celebrations in gdansk that marked the 25th anniversary of lech walesa receiving the nobel peace prize .
he said while poland 's interest depended on europe , it was also a case that " europe 's interest depends on the rest of the world . "
the dalai lama praised walesa 's solidarity movement , which in the 1980s lead strikes in the gdansk 's shipyards that helped peacefully topple the communist regime in poland .
he said the movement worked with " courage and determination " under " difficult circumstances . "
" poland is a people who experience many difficult periods , however no matter what difficulties , the polish people always keep your spirit , your determination , " the dalai lama told the gathering of world leaders in northern poland .
" i admire polish people ... a lot of atrocities , a lot of difficulties , but you never lost your hope , your determination . "
the anniversary celebrations of his nobel peace prize included leaders like french president nicolas sarkozy , and nobel peace prize laureates like south africa 's fw de klerk and israel 's shimon peres .
the dalai lama also called for " external disarmament , " and said demilitarization must begin with " inner peace " and letting go of fear and suspicion .
sarkozy arrived in gdansk with firm plans to meet the dalai lama , a move that has china fuming .
sarkozy 's meeting leads to scrapped eu-china summit bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : sarkozy and hu jintao have done much business recently as current holder of the european union 's six-month rotating presidency , the french leader 's decision to engage with the exiled tibetan spiritual leader has so far seen beijing retaliate by scrapping a china-eu summit in france earlier this week .
it also warned multi-billion-dollar trade deals between china and france were in jeopardy should the meeting go ahead .
" we have not noticed any kind of start of a boycott of our products , " a french presidential official told reporters saturday , emphasizing that france and china needed each other during a period of economic crisis .
sarkozy is set to become the only european head of state to meet the dalai lama while holding the eu 's rotating presidency .
asked friday in the northern polish city whether he thought the french president might cancel the meeting with him , as has happened twice in the past , the dalai lama said : " wait until tomorrow .
i do n't know . "
france calls for restraint over trade threats bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : kouchner says sanctions at this time would be unfair commenting on whether eu-china relations and trade could suffer over his planned meeting with sarkozy the dalai lama remarked : " china also needs europe . "
" the original initiative of some pressure , sometimes is not followed by action , " he said .
france is digging in its heels , saying the meeting will go ahead and calling for economic ties to be spared from retribution , especially during the financial crisis .
" we can not have france 's conduct dictated to , even by our friends , " said foreign minister bernard kouchner .
the dalai lama , who lives in exile in india , has sought " meaningful autonomy " for tibet since he fled his homeland following a failed uprising in 1959 against chinese rule , nine years after chinese troops invaded the region .
china argues he is actually seeking full independence , something he on friday called a " totally baseless " claim .
" when china becomes more democratic , with freedom of speech , with rule of law and particularly with freedom of the press , ... once china becomes an open , modern society , then the tibet issue , i think within a few days , can be solved , " the dalai lama said friday .
addressing the european parliament in brussels on thursday , he said china lacked the moral authority to be a true superpower .
" the dalai lama will raise human rights issues and above all the very urgent situation of tibet ... where the situation nearly resembles that of martial law , " during the saturday afternoon meeting with sarkozy , the head of france 's tibetan community wangpo bashi told radio france-info saturday .
the meeting is " a very strong signal " for tibetans , he added . dw staff -lrb- nda -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

he said the party abandoned its conservative ideas and has been turning into a centrist defender of business interests .
" one i know for sure that these are not the policies with which i founded and led the ods for many years , " the president told the shocked delegates .
the surprise move came amid high tensions between the president and topolanek , his successor at the ods helm , over the party 's direction , with the rise in tensions coming when prague is preparing to assume the european union presidency on january 1 .
while klaus is a fierce critic of the eu , deeper european integration and bloc 's reform treaty , topolanek has urged a pragmatic and active european policy .
" when my views represent a minority it does not mean that i will be sulking and negate everything that will be agreed by everyone else , " topolanek told the congress .
" that is a highly unpolitical approach .
how long can such a game be played ?
not very . "
topolanek signed the lisbon treaty on the country 's behalf in december 2007 and has since backed it reluctantly as a necessary evil that opens the way for further reforms of the 27-member bloc .
while klaus ' step allows the premier to free the party from eurosceptic views , it also enables klaus to back a potential new eurosceptic party before june 's european parliament election .
klaus aligns himself with eu 's eurosceptics during a recent visit to ireland , klaus threw his support behind the eurosceptic libertas movement of irish businessman and anti-eu activist declan ganley , which successfully campaigned against the lisbon treaty in ireland .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : why me , why now ?
topolanek faces tough times the impact of klaus ' decision will become clear sunday when the civic democrats are to pick their new leadership .
topolanek faces a challenge for the top ods post from a klaus backer , prague mayor pavel bem .
the civic democrats are a senior partner in a three-party government , which has introduced several unpopular belt-tightening reforms , such as direct fees in health care , since assuming power in january 2007 .
the party suffered a massive loss in october regional and senate elections and bem would prefer to torpedo the current center-right coalition and form a minority government , backed by the leftist opposition .
topolanek , however , argued before the delegates that his government was the best choice at a time when the country is bracing for a sharp slowdown of its export-driven economy amid the global financial crisis . dpa news agency -lrb- nda -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

the average age of the study 's participants was 23 , and more than two-thirds of the participants were women .
the study did not count the shaving of men 's beards and moustaches .
nine of 10 women in the study or 89 per cent who regularly shave , epilate or trim , said they removed hair from three or more places on their body .
almost half said they removed hair from four places .
researchers said women most commonly shave their legs , armpits and genital areas , and some also shave their eyebrows .
among men , who regularly remove hair - not including their beards and moustaches - more than 50 per cent said they removed hair from two or three places on their bodies .
for men the primary places are the armpits , genital area and the upper body .
asked why they need to be rid of the hair , the participants said they wanted to look attractive and meet society norms .
researchers link the shaving trend , particularly among women who remove hair from their genital area , to a desire to look pre-pubescent and signal sexual immaturity .
this strengthens a man 's sense of superiority , the researchers said .
at the same , time shaving intimate areas could also be interpreted as a sign of heightened feminine liberation and a sense of mature feminine self- confidence .
professor elmar braehler , who was responsible for the study , said basically there is a general cultural trend toward shaving .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : body hair is expected to be back in vogue in the future " ever-skimpier bathing suits as well as the strong presence of nudity in the media contribute to the emergence of an aesthetic norm for these areas , " said braehler .
thus , an imperative form for the genital area has developed .
as with all fashion , an opposing trend will follow , according to the researchers .

the average age of the study 's participants was 23 , and more than two-thirds of the participants were women .
the study did not count the shaving of men 's beards and moustaches .
nine of 10 women in the study or 89 per cent who regularly shave , epilate or trim , said they removed hair from three or more places on their body .
almost half said they removed hair from four places .
researchers said women most commonly shave their legs , armpits and genital areas , and some also shave their eyebrows .
among men , who regularly remove hair - not including their beards and moustaches - more than 50 per cent said they removed hair from two or three places on their bodies .
for men the primary places are the armpits , genital area and the upper body .
asked why they need to be rid of the hair , the participants said they wanted to look attractive and meet society norms .
researchers link the shaving trend , particularly among women who remove hair from their genital area , to a desire to look pre-pubescent and signal sexual immaturity .
this strengthens a man 's sense of superiority , the researchers said .
at the same , time shaving intimate areas could also be interpreted as a sign of heightened feminine liberation and a sense of mature feminine self- confidence .
professor elmar braehler , who was responsible for the study , said basically there is a general cultural trend toward shaving .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : body hair is expected to be back in vogue in the future " ever-skimpier bathing suits as well as the strong presence of nudity in the media contribute to the emergence of an aesthetic norm for these areas , " said braehler .
thus , an imperative form for the genital area has developed .
as with all fashion , an opposing trend will follow , according to the researchers .
" sooner or later lush hair again will be considered chic . " dpa news agency -lrb- nda -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

the average age of the study 's participants was 23 , and more than two-thirds of the participants were women .
the study did not count the shaving of men 's beards and moustaches .
nine of 10 women in the study or 89 per cent who regularly shave , epilate or trim , said they removed hair from three or more places on their body .
almost half said they removed hair from four places .
researchers said women most commonly shave their legs , armpits and genital areas , and some also shave their eyebrows .
among men , who regularly remove hair - not including their beards and moustaches - more than 50 per cent said they removed hair from two or three places on their bodies .
for men the primary places are the armpits , genital area and the upper body .
asked why they need to be rid of the hair , the participants said they wanted to look attractive and meet society norms .
researchers link the shaving trend , particularly among women who remove hair from their genital area , to a desire to look pre-pubescent and signal sexual immaturity .
this strengthens a man 's sense of superiority , the researchers said .
at the same , time shaving intimate areas could also be interpreted as a sign of heightened feminine liberation and a sense of mature feminine self- confidence .
professor elmar braehler , who was responsible for the study , said basically there is a general cultural trend toward shaving .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : body hair is expected to be back in vogue in the future " ever-skimpier bathing suits as well as the strong presence of nudity in the media contribute to the emergence of an aesthetic norm for these areas , " said braehler .

as with all fashion , an opposing trend will follow , according to the researchers .

6 , that world powers must join together to tell zimbabwe 's robert mugabe that " enough is enough " amid a worsening cholera outbreak that the un says has so far claimed 575 lives and exposed a deficient health system . brown said the crisis in zimbabwe was now " international " , adding he hoped the united nations security council would meet urgently to consider the situation . zimbabwe is also straining under an economic meltdown that has seen inflation rise to 231 million percent , and a food crisis in which basic staples are often unobtainable . in a draft text drawn up by eu ambassadors , the foreign ministers are to on monday call for " a fair and viable power sharing agreement without delay . " the text also stresses the eu 's " deep concern at the deteriorating humanitarian situation in zimbabwe , particularly as a result of the cholera epidemic and the continuing violence against supporters of the mdc party . " the new sanctions will bar travel to the eu and freeze the european assets of 10 members of the zimbabwean regime , in addition to the 168 already on the sanctions list . " all the documents are being prepared ... pending a flash of light in zimbabwe , " an eu diplomat said , adding that those to be added to the sanctions list were responsible for violence in the southern african country . cholera wave bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : zimbabweans are desperate for clean water the outbreak was believed caused by the collapse of the national water system , forcing many zimbabweans to drink from dirty wells and streams . to further energize the spread of the disease , zimbabwe 's government does not have funds to pay doctors or buy essential medicines . former colonial power britain was forced to step in thursday announcing a 10-million-pound -lrb- $ 14.7 million , 11.5 million euros -rrb- emergency aid package to fight the outbreak . causing worry for its fellow southern african states , thousands of zimbabweans cross into southern neighbor south africa every day , prompting that nation , as well as eastern neighbor mozambique , to set up cholera treatment centers and ramp up border security . " the massive and uncontrolled entry of zimbabweans into mozambique could be an open door for the further spread of the disease which is also affecting us , " a mozambique health ministry spokesman said friday . urgent food crisis humanitarian aid group oxfam said at least 300,000 zimbabweans weakened by a lack of food were in danger of the epidemic . " millions of people were already facing starvation .
with unemployment over 80 percent , and food unavailable across the country , they now have to contend with cholera and other diseases as the water and sanitation systems break down , " said peter mutoredzanwa , director for oxfam in zimbabwe . mutoredzanwa said in a statement that nearly half of zimbabwe 's 13 million people have been weakened by serious food shortages and that some 5 million people will urgently need food aid by january next year . zimbabwe a ' failed state ' bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : tsvangirai and mugabe are locked in a power struggle us secretary of state condoleezza rice called on friday for mugabe 's resignation , citing the cholera outbreak as an example of his government 's inability protect zimbabweans . describing mugabe 's departure as " long overdue , " rice called elections that had brought him to power a " sham . " after a meeting with danish prime minister anders fogh rasmussen in copenhagen , rice urged the international community , especially zimbabwe 's southern african neighbors , to help break the political impasse over the power-sharing government between mugabe 's party and that of opposition leader morgan tsvangirai . mugabe 's zanu-pf and tsvangirai 's mdc have been unable to reach agreement on the distribution of ministries since september when the power-sharing deal was agreed . tutu weighs in speaking on late night dutch current affairs program " nova " on thursday , south african bishop desmond tutu said mugabe must be forced out of power as soon as possible . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : archbishop tutu says mugabe must go or face arrest " the point is that we should stop the suffering of so many people , " said the 1984 nobel peace prize winner .

the united nations ' security council gave its formal green-light to the eu mission , which is to last for one year at a cost of 8.3 million euros -lrb- $ 10.5 million -rrb- last week .
the eu force takes over from nato 's own flotilla , which has been patrolling the somali coast since late october .
but as the eu force prepares to take over the responsiblility of patrolling the waters off somalia , a number of factors are casting a shadow over the mission .
earlier this week , eu foreign policy chief javier solana conceded that there were still a number of legal issues that needed to be resolved .
one concerns the different rules which eu member states apply on the detention of pirates .
" we need to coordinate that , but every country has a position - and that position is that they will not allow pirates to play around , " solana said .
nato commanders have also stressed the need for a more permanent solution to the patrols off the somali coast .
but officials note that any decision will likely require months of discussions .
" nato is indeed studying a longer-term role ... but there 's a lot of water on this globe , and this issue will be on the agenda for some time to come , " the nato chief said .
eu efforts were thrown further into doubt on friday when germany said that it would be reluctant to " actively " pursue somali pirates under its commitments to the eu security mission unless national interests were at stake .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : steinmeier and jung want national interests to be a priority " arresting people suspected of piracy is not the primary objective of the -lrb- german -rrb- operation , " foreign minister frank-walter steinmeier and defense minister franz josef jung wrote in a letter addressed to lawmakers , according to ard public television and saturday 's edition of frankfurter allgemeine zeitung newspaper .
in the letter berlin had drawn up a list of priority cases in which it is willing to deploy its navy to combat the pirates .
a decision setting out the terms of germany 's contribution to the mission is due to be made public on wednesday .
" we must protect civilian boats in this order of priority : world food program boats , other ships delivering humanitarian aid , vessels from eu member states or involving a third country , -lrb- and -rrb- other boats , " the document said .
the report has drawn criticism from germany 's opposition , which has accused the government of being too defensive .
" we must actively fight the pirates and take their boats .
after all , a pirate without a boat is quite ridiculous , " said rainer stinner from the liberal free democrats party -lrb- fdp -rrb- .
somali pirates undeterred by eu force bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : somali pirates are undeterred by the eu 's presence meanwhile , somali pirates were undeterred saturday as the new eu naval forces readied to launch their operation aimed at curbing relentless attacks that have rattled world maritime trade in the gulf of aden , which has in recent months become the world 's most dangerous stretch of water .
the gulf of aden commands access to the red sea and the suez canal , a key trade route between asia and europe , and atalanta will attempt to reassure shipping companies .
pirates equipped with speedboats , assault rifles and rocket launchers , have carried out more than 100 attacks since the start of the year .
they have raked in tens of millions of dollars in ransom money after hijacking foreign vessels , from luxury yachts to the sirius star , a 330-metre crude carrier which is still being held .
arguing that foreign fishing fleets have for years plundered somali fishing resources illegally , pirates have secured strong support from the coastal communities in a country ravaged by conflict and starvation .
" the presence of european war ships will undermine the somalis ' ability to protect their natural resources from illegal fishing , " said mohamed said , a pirate leader whose group has held the saudi super-tanker sirius star for ransom since november 15 .
" many of the polluters of somalia 's waters , those who dump toxic waste , are europeans .
this force will contribute to giving them unimpeded access to our waters , " he told reporters .
experts doubt multinational force is large enough with five of six eu ships expected in somali waters this month , the international naval presence in the region will be further enhanced , restricting the pirates ' room for maneuver .
but despite the added support of nato , the us navy and asian powers , experts argue the number of war ships will remain insufficient to root out piracy .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : experts believe the anti-piracy force is too small according to unosat , a un-affiliated agency that analyses satellite data , the recent increase in naval vessels has done little to deter pirates , only forcing them to concentrate their attacks in specific areas .
out of the 80 attacks reported in the past three months alone , half of them occurred in or around the so-called corridor which merchant vessels have been encouraged to use in order to benefit from navy monitoring .
while the success rate of the pirates ' attacks has dipped slightly in recent weeks , the sheer numbers of attacks continues to thwart the west 's state-of-the-art naval machine .
" you would need at least 100 naval ships in the area to make a decisive impact but this is impossible , " said jean duval , a maritime expert with french private maritime security outfit secopex .
duval 's firm , which expects to clinch contracts with shipping companies in the coming weeks , is one of dozens of private companies hoping to cash in on the surge in piracy in somalia 's strategic waters .
while navies only can actively combat piracy and detain pirates , private firms seek to offer complementary services by escorting ships through the gulf of aden .
the eu and its international partners are aware of the limits to their action , admitting that piracy can only be eradicated if durable solutions are found to stabilize somalia .
" everything needs to be done to change somalia from a failed to state to a country where the authorities are in a position to maintain law and order , " vice admiral gerard vallin , who heads france 's naval forces in the indian ocean , told reporters .
navies have been powerless to free hijacked ships once they have been seized by pirates .
somali pirates are currently holding 16 ships and more than 350 crew .

somali pirates undeterred by eu force bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : somali pirates are undeterred by the eu 's presence meanwhile , somali pirates were undeterred saturday as the new eu naval forces readied to launch their operation aimed at curbing relentless attacks that have rattled world maritime trade in the gulf of aden , which has in recent months become the world 's most dangerous stretch of water .
the gulf of aden commands access to the red sea and the suez canal , a key trade route between asia and europe , and atalanta will attempt to reassure shipping companies .
pirates equipped with speedboats , assault rifles and rocket launchers , have carried out more than 100 attacks since the start of the year .
they have raked in tens of millions of dollars in ransom money after hijacking foreign vessels , from luxury yachts to the sirius star , a 330-metre crude carrier which is still being held .
arguing that foreign fishing fleets have for years plundered somali fishing resources illegally , pirates have secured strong support from the coastal communities in a country ravaged by conflict and starvation .
" the presence of european war ships will undermine the somalis ' ability to protect their natural resources from illegal fishing , " said mohamed said , a pirate leader whose group has held the saudi super-tanker sirius star for ransom since november 15 .
" many of the polluters of somalia 's waters , those who dump toxic waste , are europeans .
this force will contribute to giving them unimpeded access to our waters , " he told reporters .
experts doubt multinational force is large enough with five of six eu ships expected in somali waters this month , the international naval presence in the region will be further enhanced , restricting the pirates ' room for maneuver .
but despite the added support of nato , the us navy and asian powers , experts argue the number of war ships will remain insufficient to root out piracy .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : experts believe the anti-piracy force is too small according to unosat , a un-affiliated agency that analyses satellite data , the recent increase in naval vessels has done little to deter pirates , only forcing them to concentrate their attacks in specific areas .
out of the 80 attacks reported in the past three months alone , half of them occurred in or around the so-called corridor which merchant vessels have been encouraged to use in order to benefit from navy monitoring .
while the success rate of the pirates ' attacks has dipped slightly in recent weeks , the sheer numbers of attacks continues to thwart the west 's state-of-the-art naval machine .
" you would need at least 100 naval ships in the area to make a decisive impact but this is impossible , " said jean duval , a maritime expert with french private maritime security outfit secopex .
duval 's firm , which expects to clinch contracts with shipping companies in the coming weeks , is one of dozens of private companies hoping to cash in on the surge in piracy in somalia 's strategic waters .
while navies only can actively combat piracy and detain pirates , private firms seek to offer complementary services by escorting ships through the gulf of aden .
the eu and its international partners are aware of the limits to their action , admitting that piracy can only be eradicated if durable solutions are found to stabilize somalia .
" everything needs to be done to change somalia from a failed to state to a country where the authorities are in a position to maintain law and order , " vice admiral gerard vallin , who heads france 's naval forces in the indian ocean , told reporters .
navies have been powerless to free hijacked ships once they have been seized by pirates .
somali pirates are currently holding 16 ships and more than 350 crew .

the united nations ' security council gave its formal green-light to the eu mission , which is to last for one year at a cost of 8.3 million euros -lrb- $ 10.5 million -rrb- last week .
the eu force takes over from nato 's own flotilla , which has been patrolling the somali coast since late october .
but as the eu force prepares to take over the responsiblility of patrolling the waters off somalia , a number of factors are casting a shadow over the mission .
earlier this week , eu foreign policy chief javier solana conceded that there were still a number of legal issues that needed to be resolved .
one concerns the different rules which eu member states apply on the detention of pirates .
" we need to coordinate that , but every country has a position - and that position is that they will not allow pirates to play around , " solana said .
nato commanders have also stressed the need for a more permanent solution to the patrols off the somali coast .
but officials note that any decision will likely require months of discussions .
" nato is indeed studying a longer-term role ... but there 's a lot of water on this globe , and this issue will be on the agenda for some time to come , " the nato chief said .
eu efforts were thrown further into doubt on friday when germany said that it would be reluctant to " actively " pursue somali pirates under its commitments to the eu security mission unless national interests were at stake .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : steinmeier and jung want national interests to be a priority " arresting people suspected of piracy is not the primary objective of the -lrb- german -rrb- operation , " foreign minister frank-walter steinmeier and defense minister franz josef jung wrote in a letter addressed to lawmakers , according to ard public television and saturday 's edition of frankfurter allgemeine zeitung newspaper .
in the letter berlin had drawn up a list of priority cases in which it is willing to deploy its navy to combat the pirates .
a decision setting out the terms of germany 's contribution to the mission is due to be made public on wednesday .
" we must protect civilian boats in this order of priority : world food program boats , other ships delivering humanitarian aid , vessels from eu member states or involving a third country , -lrb- and -rrb- other boats , " the document said .
the report has drawn criticism from germany 's opposition , which has accused the government of being too defensive .

the united nations ' security council gave its formal green-light to the eu mission , which is to last for one year at a cost of 8.3 million euros -lrb- $ 10.5 million -rrb- last week .
the eu force takes over from nato 's own flotilla , which has been patrolling the somali coast since late october .
but as the eu force prepares to take over the responsiblility of patrolling the waters off somalia , a number of factors are casting a shadow over the mission .
earlier this week , eu foreign policy chief javier solana conceded that there were still a number of legal issues that needed to be resolved .
one concerns the different rules which eu member states apply on the detention of pirates .
" we need to coordinate that , but every country has a position - and that position is that they will not allow pirates to play around , " solana said .
nato commanders have also stressed the need for a more permanent solution to the patrols off the somali coast .
but officials note that any decision will likely require months of discussions .
" nato is indeed studying a longer-term role ... but there 's a lot of water on this globe , and this issue will be on the agenda for some time to come , " the nato chief said .
eu efforts were thrown further into doubt on friday when germany said that it would be reluctant to " actively " pursue somali pirates under its commitments to the eu security mission unless national interests were at stake .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : steinmeier and jung want national interests to be a priority " arresting people suspected of piracy is not the primary objective of the -lrb- german -rrb- operation , " foreign minister frank-walter steinmeier and defense minister franz josef jung wrote in a letter addressed to lawmakers , according to ard public television and saturday 's edition of frankfurter allgemeine zeitung newspaper .
in the letter berlin had drawn up a list of priority cases in which it is willing to deploy its navy to combat the pirates .
a decision setting out the terms of germany 's contribution to the mission is due to be made public on wednesday .
" we must protect civilian boats in this order of priority : world food program boats , other ships delivering humanitarian aid , vessels from eu member states or involving a third country , -lrb- and -rrb- other boats , " the document said .
the report has drawn criticism from germany 's opposition , which has accused the government of being too defensive .
" we must actively fight the pirates and take their boats .
after all , a pirate without a boat is quite ridiculous , " said rainer stinner from the liberal free democrats party -lrb- fdp -rrb- .
somali pirates undeterred by eu force bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : somali pirates are undeterred by the eu 's presence meanwhile , somali pirates were undeterred saturday as the new eu naval forces readied to launch their operation aimed at curbing relentless attacks that have rattled world maritime trade in the gulf of aden , which has in recent months become the world 's most dangerous stretch of water .
the gulf of aden commands access to the red sea and the suez canal , a key trade route between asia and europe , and atalanta will attempt to reassure shipping companies .
pirates equipped with speedboats , assault rifles and rocket launchers , have carried out more than 100 attacks since the start of the year .
they have raked in tens of millions of dollars in ransom money after hijacking foreign vessels , from luxury yachts to the sirius star , a 330-metre crude carrier which is still being held .
arguing that foreign fishing fleets have for years plundered somali fishing resources illegally , pirates have secured strong support from the coastal communities in a country ravaged by conflict and starvation .
" the presence of european war ships will undermine the somalis ' ability to protect their natural resources from illegal fishing , " said mohamed said , a pirate leader whose group has held the saudi super-tanker sirius star for ransom since november 15 .
" many of the polluters of somalia 's waters , those who dump toxic waste , are europeans .
this force will contribute to giving them unimpeded access to our waters , " he told reporters .
experts doubt multinational force is large enough with five of six eu ships expected in somali waters this month , the international naval presence in the region will be further enhanced , restricting the pirates ' room for maneuver .
but despite the added support of nato , the us navy and asian powers , experts argue the number of war ships will remain insufficient to root out piracy .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : experts believe the anti-piracy force is too small according to unosat , a un-affiliated agency that analyses satellite data , the recent increase in naval vessels has done little to deter pirates , only forcing them to concentrate their attacks in specific areas .
out of the 80 attacks reported in the past three months alone , half of them occurred in or around the so-called corridor which merchant vessels have been encouraged to use in order to benefit from navy monitoring .
while the success rate of the pirates ' attacks has dipped slightly in recent weeks , the sheer numbers of attacks continues to thwart the west 's state-of-the-art naval machine .
" you would need at least 100 naval ships in the area to make a decisive impact but this is impossible , " said jean duval , a maritime expert with french private maritime security outfit secopex .
duval 's firm , which expects to clinch contracts with shipping companies in the coming weeks , is one of dozens of private companies hoping to cash in on the surge in piracy in somalia 's strategic waters .
while navies only can actively combat piracy and detain pirates , private firms seek to offer complementary services by escorting ships through the gulf of aden .
the eu and its international partners are aware of the limits to their action , admitting that piracy can only be eradicated if durable solutions are found to stabilize somalia .
" everything needs to be done to change somalia from a failed to state to a country where the authorities are in a position to maintain law and order , " vice admiral gerard vallin , who heads france 's naval forces in the indian ocean , told reporters .
navies have been powerless to free hijacked ships once they have been seized by pirates .

5 in a simulated attack to test the defense system it wants to expand in eastern europe to counter attacks from north korea or iran . " this was the largest , most complex task that we 've ever done , " said lieutenant general patrick o 'reilly , director of the pentagon 's missile defense agency .
but the target missile 's countermeasures , intended to simulate decoys from enemy missiles - precisely what critics of the defense shield doubt the system could overcome - failed to deploy , he said .
" countermeasures are very difficult to deploy , " he said , adding that " there are many threats today that do n't have countermeasures . "
the interception took place at 3:29 pm -lrb- 21:29 cet -rrb- , pentagon spokesman bryan whitman said , making the effort the eighth successful intercept out of the 13 tests conducted since 1999 , with the last successful test taking place in september 2007 .
overall military chiefs approved of the effort .
" i am extremely pleased , " said o 'reilly at a press briefing .
" all the systems were working together , " he added , referring to the complex alignment of radars , sensors and timing to coordinate the high-octane missile .
brian green , deputy assistant secretary of defense for strategic capabilities , added that the effort was an " operationally realistic test . "
the effectiveness of the defense shield has been questioned by some scientists who claim the program would be unable to distinguish between a missile and a decoy - precisely what failed to be realized in friday 's effort .
the test is seen as a crucial step towards a controversial anti-missile shield washington plans to base in eastern europe .
the bush administration wants to install a radar facility in the czech republic and 10 interceptor missiles in neighboring poland by 2014 .
the test of the project , which so far has cost the defense department some $ 100 billion , comes at a critical time before president-elect barack obama moves into the white house on january 20 .
obama has so far not committed to the missile defense shield .
one of his senior foreign policy advisors , denis mcdonough , has indicated however that obama would support the program if the technology proves viable .

" this project is aimed against the strategic potential of russia .
and we can only give it an adequate response , " he said .
earlier last month moscow raised alarm in western capitals by warning it could place missiles in the russian exclave of kaliningrad , close to poland , in response to the plan .

5 in a simulated attack to test the defense system it wants to expand in eastern europe to counter attacks from north korea or iran . " this was the largest , most complex task that we 've ever done , " said lieutenant general patrick o 'reilly , director of the pentagon 's missile defense agency .
but the target missile 's countermeasures , intended to simulate decoys from enemy missiles - precisely what critics of the defense shield doubt the system could overcome - failed to deploy , he said .
" countermeasures are very difficult to deploy , " he said , adding that " there are many threats today that do n't have countermeasures . "
the interception took place at 3:29 pm -lrb- 21:29 cet -rrb- , pentagon spokesman bryan whitman said , making the effort the eighth successful intercept out of the 13 tests conducted since 1999 , with the last successful test taking place in september 2007 .
overall military chiefs approved of the effort .
" i am extremely pleased , " said o 'reilly at a press briefing .
" all the systems were working together , " he added , referring to the complex alignment of radars , sensors and timing to coordinate the high-octane missile .
brian green , deputy assistant secretary of defense for strategic capabilities , added that the effort was an " operationally realistic test . "
the effectiveness of the defense shield has been questioned by some scientists who claim the program would be unable to distinguish between a missile and a decoy - precisely what failed to be realized in friday 's effort .
the test is seen as a crucial step towards a controversial anti-missile shield washington plans to base in eastern europe .
the bush administration wants to install a radar facility in the czech republic and 10 interceptor missiles in neighboring poland by 2014 .
the test of the project , which so far has cost the defense department some $ 100 billion , comes at a critical time before president-elect barack obama moves into the white house on january 20 .
obama has so far not committed to the missile defense shield .
one of his senior foreign policy advisors , denis mcdonough , has indicated however that obama would support the program if the technology proves viable .
opponent russia still on edge bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : medvedev warned that he would deploy missiles in kaliningrad moscow has repeatedly voiced strong objections to the shield plan , which washington insists is not directed against russia but at " rogue states " such as iran and north korea .
in late november russian prime minister vladimir putin urged obama to drop the planned shield in eastern europe .
" this project is aimed against the strategic potential of russia .
and we can only give it an adequate response , " he said .
earlier last month moscow raised alarm in western capitals by warning it could place missiles in the russian exclave of kaliningrad , close to poland , in response to the plan .
on friday the interceptor missile was launched from vandenberg air force base in california , as the target - a fake warhead mimicking long-range ballistic missiles from nations like north korea - was set off from the alaskan island of kodiak . dw staff -lrb- nda -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

in a move human rights groups fear will weaken the judiciary 's independence , judges may soon be deciding all verdicts on serious crime the lower house of russia 's parliament passed the bill on friday , dec .
5 , in the first of three required readings , the interfax news agency reported , adding that 351 lawmakers voted in favor of the bill while 34 were opposed . " a practice has been noted where juries acquit terrorists who have committed grave crimes , " vladimir vasilyev , head of the duma 's security committee , was quoted as saying on the web site of the pro-kremlin united russia party . legislators proposed the bill to limit the use of jury trials , which were introduced in the post-soviet era .
supporters of the bill have said trial by jury ends much more often in an acquittal than trials where a judge presides over the case . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the fates of three men accused of killing politkovskaya will be decided by a jury in some high-profile cases , such as the trial of the murdered journalist paul klebnikov , the suspects were acquitted .
the trial of three men accused of roles in the killing of journalist anna politkovskaya is being heard before a jury . lawyers and human rights organization , however , have criticized the bill .
they have said rampant corruption in the russian judiciary affects judges ' independence . " jury trials have their own negatives , but they are less biased , " yuri schmidt , a moscow-based defense lawyer , told reuters news agency .
" courts without juries wo n't take free decisions and instead all decisions will be controlled by the authorities . " the bill would also abolish jury trials for people suspected of treason , hostage-taking , organizing mass disturbances and some other serious crimes . before the bill is enacted as law , it must pass two more readings in the duma and be approved by the upper house of parliament and president dmitry medvedev . dw staff -lrb- sms -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

opponent russia still on edge bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : medvedev warned that he would deploy missiles in kaliningrad moscow has repeatedly voiced strong objections to the shield plan , which washington insists is not directed against russia but at " rogue states " such as iran and north korea .
in late november russian prime minister vladimir putin urged obama to drop the planned shield in eastern europe .
" this project is aimed against the strategic potential of russia .
and we can only give it an adequate response , " he said .
earlier last month moscow raised alarm in western capitals by warning it could place missiles in the russian exclave of kaliningrad , close to poland , in response to the plan .
on friday the interceptor missile was launched from vandenberg air force base in california , as the target - a fake warhead mimicking long-range ballistic missiles from nations like north korea - was set off from the alaskan island of kodiak . dw staff -lrb- nda -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

he said while poland 's interest depended on europe , it was also a case that " europe 's interest depends on the rest of the world . "
the dalai lama praised walesa 's solidarity movement , which in the 1980s lead strikes in the gdansk 's shipyards that helped peacefully topple the communist regime in poland .
he said the movement worked with " courage and determination " under " difficult circumstances . "
" poland is a people who experience many difficult periods , however no matter what difficulties , the polish people always keep your spirit , your determination , " the dalai lama told the gathering of world leaders in northern poland .

france is digging in its heels , saying the meeting will go ahead and calling for economic ties to be spared from retribution , especially during the financial crisis .
" we can not have france 's conduct dictated to , even by our friends , " said foreign minister bernard kouchner .
the dalai lama , who lives in exile in india , has sought " meaningful autonomy " for tibet since he fled his homeland following a failed uprising in 1959 against chinese rule , nine years after chinese troops invaded the region .
china argues he is actually seeking full independence , something he on friday called a " totally baseless " claim .
" when china becomes more democratic , with freedom of speech , with rule of law and particularly with freedom of the press , ... once china becomes an open , modern society , then the tibet issue , i think within a few days , can be solved , " the dalai lama said friday .

in a move human rights groups fear will weaken the judiciary 's independence , judges may soon be deciding all verdicts on serious crime the lower house of russia 's parliament passed the bill on friday , dec .
5 , in the first of three required readings , the interfax news agency reported , adding that 351 lawmakers voted in favor of the bill while 34 were opposed . " a practice has been noted where juries acquit terrorists who have committed grave crimes , " vladimir vasilyev , head of the duma 's security committee , was quoted as saying on the web site of the pro-kremlin united russia party . legislators proposed the bill to limit the use of jury trials , which were introduced in the post-soviet era .
supporters of the bill have said trial by jury ends much more often in an acquittal than trials where a judge presides over the case . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the fates of three men accused of killing politkovskaya will be decided by a jury in some high-profile cases , such as the trial of the murdered journalist paul klebnikov , the suspects were acquitted .
the trial of three men accused of roles in the killing of journalist anna politkovskaya is being heard before a jury . lawyers and human rights organization , however , have criticized the bill .
they have said rampant corruption in the russian judiciary affects judges ' independence . " jury trials have their own negatives , but they are less biased , " yuri schmidt , a moscow-based defense lawyer , told reuters news agency .
" courts without juries wo n't take free decisions and instead all decisions will be controlled by the authorities . " the bill would also abolish jury trials for people suspected of treason , hostage-taking , organizing mass disturbances and some other serious crimes . before the bill is enacted as law , it must pass two more readings in the duma and be approved by the upper house of parliament and president dmitry medvedev . dw staff -lrb- sms -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

" we had enough chances to score the second goal earlier .

" we put a lot into the game , ran and worked hard but in the end we have nothing to show for it which is a pity , " ibisevic said .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de united states -pipe- 06.12.2008 us successfully tests missile interceptors intended for europe großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the missile interceptors intended for europe were successfully tested the pentagon said it successfully intercepted a long-range missile target friday , dec .
5 in a simulated attack to test the defense system it wants to expand in eastern europe to counter attacks from north korea or iran . " this was the largest , most complex task that we 've ever done , " said lieutenant general patrick o 'reilly , director of the pentagon 's missile defense agency .
but the target missile 's countermeasures , intended to simulate decoys from enemy missiles - precisely what critics of the defense shield doubt the system could overcome - failed to deploy , he said .
" countermeasures are very difficult to deploy , " he said , adding that " there are many threats today that do n't have countermeasures . "
the interception took place at 3:29 pm -lrb- 21:29 cet -rrb- , pentagon spokesman bryan whitman said , making the effort the eighth successful intercept out of the 13 tests conducted since 1999 , with the last successful test taking place in september 2007 .
overall military chiefs approved of the effort .
" i am extremely pleased , " said o 'reilly at a press briefing .
" all the systems were working together , " he added , referring to the complex alignment of radars , sensors and timing to coordinate the high-octane missile .
brian green , deputy assistant secretary of defense for strategic capabilities , added that the effort was an " operationally realistic test . "
the effectiveness of the defense shield has been questioned by some scientists who claim the program would be unable to distinguish between a missile and a decoy - precisely what failed to be realized in friday 's effort .
the test is seen as a crucial step towards a controversial anti-missile shield washington plans to base in eastern europe .
the bush administration wants to install a radar facility in the czech republic and 10 interceptor missiles in neighboring poland by 2014 .
the test of the project , which so far has cost the defense department some $ 100 billion , comes at a critical time before president-elect barack obama moves into the white house on january 20 .
obama has so far not committed to the missile defense shield .
one of his senior foreign policy advisors , denis mcdonough , has indicated however that obama would support the program if the technology proves viable .
opponent russia still on edge bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : medvedev warned that he would deploy missiles in kaliningrad moscow has repeatedly voiced strong objections to the shield plan , which washington insists is not directed against russia but at " rogue states " such as iran and north korea .
in late november russian prime minister vladimir putin urged obama to drop the planned shield in eastern europe .
" this project is aimed against the strategic potential of russia .
and we can only give it an adequate response , " he said .
earlier last month moscow raised alarm in western capitals by warning it could place missiles in the russian exclave of kaliningrad , close to poland , in response to the plan .
on friday the interceptor missile was launched from vandenberg air force base in california , as the target - a fake warhead mimicking long-range ballistic missiles from nations like north korea - was set off from the alaskan island of kodiak . dw staff -lrb- nda -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

almost half said they removed hair from four places .
researchers said women most commonly shave their legs , armpits and genital areas , and some also shave their eyebrows .
among men , who regularly remove hair - not including their beards and moustaches - more than 50 per cent said they removed hair from two or three places on their bodies .
for men the primary places are the armpits , genital area and the upper body .
asked why they need to be rid of the hair , the participants said they wanted to look attractive and meet society norms .
researchers link the shaving trend , particularly among women who remove hair from their genital area , to a desire to look pre-pubescent and signal sexual immaturity .
this strengthens a man 's sense of superiority , the researchers said .
at the same , time shaving intimate areas could also be interpreted as a sign of heightened feminine liberation and a sense of mature feminine self- confidence .
professor elmar braehler , who was responsible for the study , said basically there is a general cultural trend toward shaving .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : body hair is expected to be back in vogue in the future " ever-skimpier bathing suits as well as the strong presence of nudity in the media contribute to the emergence of an aesthetic norm for these areas , " said braehler .
thus , an imperative form for the genital area has developed .
as with all fashion , an opposing trend will follow , according to the researchers .

the announcement was made after the third economic summit in wales since october .
the meeting , between ministers and business leaders in wales , coincided with news that 208 jobs were at risk at the canadian-owned car components company linimar in swansea .

" and it 's their policies which have left us with the mess we are facing today . "
' very resolute ' following the summit , the assembly government announced plans for a scheme to pay companies to retain and train their staff rather than make them redundant .
a plan was also announced to begin work on £ 23m worth of public sector projects over the next four months .
mr morgan described the mood at the talks between as being " very resolute " despite a " huge amount of doom and gloom " for families facing a difficult christmas .
i think wales is leading the united kingdom in terms of the way it is dealing with the economic downturn welsh secretary paul murphy " it 's the resolute feeling of team wales coming together and facing the gathering doom and gloom to say ' we are going to see this through together ' and if we see it through together that will shorten the recession , it will help to make the recession shallower by the combined action of the uk government , the assembly government , welsh local government and the private sector in wales , " he said .
" eventually the patient gets better - at the moment we do n't know when that 's going to be . "
welsh secretary paul murphy said : " i think wales is leading the united kingdom in terms of the way it is dealing with the economic downturn - tremendous cooperation between all sectors in wales but also very interestingly , learning from each other . "
he added wales had to prepare to a future upturn in the economy in terms of research , development , training and skills .
the economic development minister ieuan wyn jones said : " i think we all recognise the difficulties facing industry and businesses and consumers but today i think we 've shown as a government working with our partners including local government in wales that we can respond positively when it 's demanded of us . "
dr kath ringwald , a senior lecturer at the university of glamorgan 's business school said it would be next year before the end of the downturn could be predicted .
" i think it 's laudable they 've jumped in very early with the first summit back n october and i 'm sure they 're trying to do what they can for the welsh economy , " she told bbc radio wales .
" bringing forward capital schemes is a good idea and will have an effect but not in the short term .
" they will need time to prepare .
if you think , there 's land acquisition and the tendering process .
it 's going to be a year or two before we see the real effect of that . "

since 2002 the government has given every newborn £ 250 , which parents can invest for their child 's future .
three out of four put the money into accounts which were invested in shares .
but figures show their value has fallen by an average of 29 % over the past year .
the government said historically shares earned more than cash savings .
a treasury spokesman said : " the child trust fund is a long-term investment over an 18-year period and the first child trust fund accounts will not reach maturity until 2020 .
" although shares can go down as well as up in value , particularly in the short-term , the historical evidence is that they provide a better return than cash savings for long-term investments . "
' middle road ' emma clark followed the government 's advice for her child and said as a result , her fund had lost in the region of £ 200 .
she told the bbc : " we chose a stakeholder account on the basis of government literature .
" it was the middle road of three routes and we liked it because it was fixed management charges of 1.5 % , and it also allowed investment in shares .
basically , consumers have been taken to the cleaners by the investment community roddy kohn investment advisers kohn cougar " and the government had said in their literature that over the last 40 years every 18-year cycle of shares investment had done better than savings , ordinary savings accounts .
" well , over the past year in total we 've paid £ 825 into the account .
and i rang up for a valuation and we were given a figure of £ 613 . "
roddy kohn , from investment advisers kohn cougar , said investing in shares carried a large amount of risk and that people should not invest on the stock market if they were not prepared for that risk .
he told the bbc : " basically , consumers have been taken to the cleaners by the investment community .
" the biggest problem with child trust funds now is that it 's quite evident that many people have invested their money in the stock market without understanding risk .
" consequently when they 're seeing these losses they 're upset by it .
" the truth of the matter is if you have n't got the stomach for risk , if you do n't understand what risk is , then do n't invest this money in a stock market-invested child trust fund . "
' not sensible ' liberal democrat treasury spokesman , vince cable , said as a result of the bbc-obtained figures , people would be put off saving for their children - exactly the opposite objective hoped for by the government .
parents need to remember that these accounts are going to last for 18 years miles bingham , family investments he told the bbc : " the irony of this whole exercise is that a scheme that was primarily designed to encourage people to think about long-term savings , may have exactly the opposite effect .
" because if - for the first time in their lives - people have actually saved money and they 've saved it through this scheme and they 've lost a lot , the lesson they 're going to learn is this is not a very sensible thing to do . "

since 2002 the government has given every newborn £ 250 , which parents can invest for their child 's future .
three out of four put the money into accounts which were invested in shares .
but figures show their value has fallen by an average of 29 % over the past year .
the government said historically shares earned more than cash savings .
a treasury spokesman said : " the child trust fund is a long-term investment over an 18-year period and the first child trust fund accounts will not reach maturity until 2020 .
" although shares can go down as well as up in value , particularly in the short-term , the historical evidence is that they provide a better return than cash savings for long-term investments . "
' middle road ' emma clark followed the government 's advice for her child and said as a result , her fund had lost in the region of £ 200 .
she told the bbc : " we chose a stakeholder account on the basis of government literature .
" it was the middle road of three routes and we liked it because it was fixed management charges of 1.5 % , and it also allowed investment in shares .
basically , consumers have been taken to the cleaners by the investment community roddy kohn investment advisers kohn cougar " and the government had said in their literature that over the last 40 years every 18-year cycle of shares investment had done better than savings , ordinary savings accounts .

roddy kohn , from investment advisers kohn cougar , said investing in shares carried a large amount of risk and that people should not invest on the stock market if they were not prepared for that risk .
he told the bbc : " basically , consumers have been taken to the cleaners by the investment community .
" the biggest problem with child trust funds now is that it 's quite evident that many people have invested their money in the stock market without understanding risk .
" consequently when they 're seeing these losses they 're upset by it .
" the truth of the matter is if you have n't got the stomach for risk , if you do n't understand what risk is , then do n't invest this money in a stock market-invested child trust fund . "
' not sensible ' liberal democrat treasury spokesman , vince cable , said as a result of the bbc-obtained figures , people would be put off saving for their children - exactly the opposite objective hoped for by the government .

" because if - for the first time in their lives - people have actually saved money and they 've saved it through this scheme and they 've lost a lot , the lesson they 're going to learn is this is not a very sensible thing to do . "

truphone uses wi-fi technology in an ipod touch to allow users to make calls to other ipod touch owners and google talk 's messaging service users .
the software is a spin-off from technology truphone developed for smartphones and iphones .
the developers plan to have the ability to make calls to and from landlines in place very soon .
ipod touch owners keen to use the software will also have to buy a clip-on microphone for the portable music player .
truphone is the latest firm to offer voice over internet protocol -lrb- voip -rrb- , alongside unlicensed mobile access and proprietary protocols such as skype .
geraldine wilson - truphone 's ceo - said the firm had ambitions to become a global internet player .
" there are a slew of new features we 're rolling out for the ipod touch that will let users call landlines , skype users or send instant messages .
we 're talking weeks , not months , before these go live . "
although truphone technology can , in theory , work on any mobile device , the firm is concentrating on devices that have an application store .
" we 've decided to focus on devices that are wi-fi enabled and have an apps-store .
for the consumer , there has to be an easy way of downloading an application . "
" our focus on the consumer side - at least in the short term - is finding devices that fit that category , " said ms wilson .
wi-fi go bye bye the only catch is that for a wi-fi connection to work , users need to be within range of a wi-fi network .
truphone founder - james tagg - said that the technology also worked on other mobile devices , albeit in a slightly different way .
" if you were using truphone on a blackberry , it will use cellular technology to log into the truphone 's website . "
" from here you can make an international call , call a user on voip , or send an instant message . "
" because the first leg of the call - from the user to our server - is charged at local rate , you 're talking a bill of pennies , rather than pounds , to call , say the united states . "

truphone uses wi-fi technology in an ipod touch to allow users to make calls to other ipod touch owners and google talk 's messaging service users .
the software is a spin-off from technology truphone developed for smartphones and iphones .
the developers plan to have the ability to make calls to and from landlines in place very soon .
ipod touch owners keen to use the software will also have to buy a clip-on microphone for the portable music player .
truphone is the latest firm to offer voice over internet protocol -lrb- voip -rrb- , alongside unlicensed mobile access and proprietary protocols such as skype .
geraldine wilson - truphone 's ceo - said the firm had ambitions to become a global internet player .
" there are a slew of new features we 're rolling out for the ipod touch that will let users call landlines , skype users or send instant messages .
we 're talking weeks , not months , before these go live . "
although truphone technology can , in theory , work on any mobile device , the firm is concentrating on devices that have an application store .
" we 've decided to focus on devices that are wi-fi enabled and have an apps-store .
for the consumer , there has to be an easy way of downloading an application . "
" our focus on the consumer side - at least in the short term - is finding devices that fit that category , " said ms wilson .
wi-fi go bye bye the only catch is that for a wi-fi connection to work , users need to be within range of a wi-fi network .
truphone founder - james tagg - said that the technology also worked on other mobile devices , albeit in a slightly different way .
" if you were using truphone on a blackberry , it will use cellular technology to log into the truphone 's website . "
" from here you can make an international call , call a user on voip , or send an instant message . "
" because the first leg of the call - from the user to our server - is charged at local rate , you 're talking a bill of pennies , rather than pounds , to call , say the united states . "
the company said google 's android operating system would be the next platform for which it will develop the truphone applications .
