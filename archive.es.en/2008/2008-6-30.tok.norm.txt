midfielder bastian schweinsteiger appeared to cries of " schweini schweini " from many of the young girls among the crowd as captain michael ballack and stars , lukas podolski and miroslav klose too were cheered on enthusiastically .
" the atmosphere in germany was fantastic .
we hope to bring home a cup in the future , " schweinsteiger , the popular bayern munich midfielder , said .
" you are the best " read one of the countless banners in the crowd of some 300,000 and some fans had even brought a replica of the cup with the writing " thank you " on it .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : ballack waves to his supporters " we would have not made it without the fans .
it is important for our young team , " ballack said .
" it is great for us that we could delight the fans even though we lost .
it is an amazing feeling and gives me goose bumps , " goalkeeper jens lehmann said .
germany full of praise for spain despite not always shining on the pitch , the german team had created another soccer frenzy in germany which sometimes came close to that from the 2006 home world cup in which germany finished third .
hundreds of thousands of fans watched the games from austria and switzerland in the country 's public viewing areas , with more than 500,000 on hand in berlin alone for the german 3-2 semi-final win over turkey and the final .
the fans at least partly cheered up the players , but no complaints were heard and read in the country after germany not simply lost the euro 2008 final 1-0 to spain but was comprehensively outplayed on sunday in vienna .
" spain 's victory .
the best team wins the tournament , " was the front page headline of the sueddeutsche zeitung -lrb- sz -rrb- daily under a photo of match-winner fernando torres and other players holding the cup in the air .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : spanish players holding up the euro trophy the sz was just one paper which named spain " the clearly better team " and praised its " brilliant passing " which kept the german defense on their toes .
the paper said that " soccer was the winner " on the night as the german euphoria somewhat hid the fact that the team had only rarely showed its class in the six matches in austria and switzerland .
former germany coach juergen klinsmann said that spain was " considerably better " on the night and german soccer icon franz beckenbauer said in his monday column for the bild daily that " spain dominated the tournament from the first match ... until yesterday 's final . "
other papers acknowledged as well that the better team had won but also looked back at germany 's run to the final .
" the end of the dream .
we are still proud of you , but spain was the better team , " said daily bild .
the hamburger abendblatt said : " only second - but it was still nice . "
slowly getting there the abendblatt recalled the soccer frenzy which had gripped the nation like at the 2006 home world cup and looked ahead , saying " maybe the happy end follows in 2010 " at the world cup in south africa , as germany was third at the 2006 world cup and now second at euro .
german chancellor angela merkel struck a similar note after attending the game in the vienna stadium .
" third at the world cup and now second , that is something .
maybe we will improve again in south africa , " said merkel .
" i told ballack that we have to wait a little longer until we can celebrate together but that we are slowly getting there . "
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : german soccer fans at the berlin fan mile large numbers of germans had celebrated in the fan zones ahead of the match , with the berlin zone closed some three hours before the kickoff as it was filled to its capacity with more than 600,000 fans .
" the fans left the fan zone very quietly , very peacefully and in very well-behaved way , " said a berlin fan zone official after the match .
that was not quite the case in the eastern part of the country , with incidents recorded in magdeburg and other towns when several hundred troublemakers rioted in city centers and fought police .
police said on monday that 25 officers were injured and 60 people arrested .
berlin saw 59 arrests , but , according to a spokesman , all for minor offences . dpa news agency -lrb- sp -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

but the crisis of the irish no vote overshadowed slovenia 's term . at the beginning of the year , slovenia set out to prove that a small country could successfully take on the european union presidency . indeed , the recent eu member showed that " things would n't go disastrously wrong and that they could manage it effectively , " said jacki davis from the european policy center , a leading think-tank in brussels . " i think they 've done that and that 's really the best one could have asked for , " she said . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : slovenia advocated for kosovo , while still trying to keep serbia on board it may be a small country , but slovenia tackled major issues during its six-month presidency , which it is set to hand over to france on july 1 .
among them : balkan diplomacy and the birth of the kosovar state . drawing the balkans closer to europe as a former yugoslav state itself , it came as no huge surprise that slovenia vehemently encouraged the eu not only to recognize kosovo as an independent state but also to smooth the way for serbia 's future membership in the bloc . after snap elections in serbia , tensions relaxed a bit and the eu signed a stabilization and association agreement with both serbia and bosnia-herzegovina - a major step toward eu membership for both countries . as for kosovo , russian concerns prevented the eu from taking over the political supervision of the fledgling country , but the bloc continues to be integrally involved in the un mission . slovenia " handled -lsb- kosovo 's independence -rsb- well , considering the initial qualms and divisions between eu member states or whether to recognize or not , " said davis . irish no a blow to eu leaders bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : slovenia was n't blamed for the irish no to the lisbon treaty the second major issue dominating the slovenian presidency was the irish no vote in june on the bloc 's lisbon treaty .
davis said the vote , which raised existential concerns over the bloc 's future , " had to do with conditions in ireland " and could n't be blamed on slovenia . slovenian prime minister janez jansa said he regrets that he and the bloc 's 26 other heads-of-state were n't able to sufficiently promote europe to its residents . " we need to change the negative attitude toward european institutions , " he said .
" we need a european identity . " mep questions eu connection to the people jansa and his relatively small team managed to push through new laws on unified work times for eu institutions - after 14 years of discussion on the matter .
they also put in motion the first part of a common asylum law , founded a joint eu-mediterranean university , and opened dialogue with latin america on climate change , food production and energy security . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : jansa said a stronger european identity is needed eu parliamentarian jo leinen , a member of germany 's social democratic party , said that slovenia and the rest of the eu states have n't recognized the people 's true concerns . " food prices , energy prices , credit crisis , and high managers ' salaries - the people are worried about lots of things , but we either get around to them too late or just make half-hearted decisions , " he said .
" europe has to be useful to the people , it has to protect the people , and then they will also support and follow us . " a euro team at the next euro ? european commission president jose manuel barroso , on the other hand , praised the slovenian presidency for its effectiveness - a quality some observers in brussels do n't expect from its french successors . " if all the member states applied the same principles -lsb- as slovenia -rsb- , the european union would overcome many of its difficulties , " said barroso . in his final speech as head of 27-member bloc , which coincided with the end of the european soccer championship , jansa quipped that the eu should send its own soccer team to the next euro . then at least the eu would get a little attention . bernd riegert -lrb- kjb -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

she was not ill , but afraid of having to go to a nursing home . robert kusch told reporters that the woman , from the city of wuerzburg , identified in press reports as bettina sch . , took a tranquilizer and malaria medication she obtained herself to end her life on saturday .
in order to prove that the woman , a former x-ray technician , had wanted to die , kusch showed reporters interviews with her which he had videotaped . " i have campaigned for a long time for self-determination until the very end , " he said to reporters in hamburg on monday , june 30 .
he said making one 's own decisions about life and death was a " central pillar of a modern society " and that determining one 's own end of life should not be something " only theoretically discussed in seminars . " robert kusch already stirred controversy in march of this year when he unveiled his " suicide machine , " a device that could deliver a deadly infusion of potassium chloride .
however , in this case , the machine was not used . sharp criticism the german hospice foundation has expressed indignation over kusch 's action , saying he is primarily interested in drawing attention to himself . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : robert kusch and his " suicide machine " " there is a right to life , there is also a right to die , but there is not a right to kill , " said eugen brysch , the foundation 's director , accusing kusch of abuse " people 's fears of old-age care " out of a " deep sense of narcissism . " according to german law , it is not illegal if someone is present at a person 's suicide , brysch said .
however , obtaining lethal medication for that individuals does violate the legal code .
brysch said that the upper house of parliament , the bundesrat , would discuss on friday a draft law that would ban commercial suicide services . policiticians and church leaders have also sharply criticized kusch .
green party politician and vice-president of the bundestag , katrin göring-eckardt , called kusch 's action " completely inacceptable . " the protestant bishop of hamburg , maria jepsen , told the epd news agency that her church rejects kusch 's approach , saying the form of assisted suicide he is endorsing violates human dignity and christian responsibility . hamburg 's prosecutor 's office has begun a preliminary investigation into kusch 's action . dw staff -lrb- jam -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

" i think we have to recognize the greater quality of the spanish team today , " germany coach joachim loew said after his side lost 1-0 to spain . " it -lrb- the defeat -rrb- will encourage us to continue working over the next two years and to improve some things ... in order to get to the 2010 world cup and to play a similar role here . " " possession and one-touch passes are the key in soccer , and that at high speed and under stress .
spain showed that it masters it very well , " loew said . " the best team won " german newspapers too were full of praise for spain , saying the side outclassed the germans on every count . " the artists from spain would n't let themselves be bullied around , " munich-based sueddeutsche zeitung wrote . " after a strong start germany lost their way . "
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : there was no stopping fernando torres as he scored in the 33rd minute " title dreams dashed , " the hamburger morgenpost wrote .
" after 60 minutes of sleep-inducing football and lots of defensive problems the team came to life too late .
thanks to lehmann because it could have been worse . "
germany 's most popular television soccer analyst , guenter netzer said in the end the best team won on sunday .
" congratulations to spain but also i tip my hat in respect to germany for even reaching the final , " netzer , who helped west germany win the european crown in 1972 , said .
" that 's a great success for the team .
spain were the best team throughout the tournament .
they played the best football , " he said .
" they showed us how limited we are , they showed us how to play soccer .
spain showed we have a lot of room to improve . "
germans started well , with miroslav klose missing a glorious opportunity after just four minutes , but then spain soon started to take control and on 33 minutes torres put spain ahead . germany had their chances in the second half but spain remained dangerous and held their nerve to win the championship 1-0 .
one mistake too many germany had come to euro 2008 with lots of ambitions but failed to make a lasting impression apart from a classy 3-2 against portugal in the quarter-finals .
the team was outwitted in a 2-1 defeat against croatia and outplayed for most of the match in the semi-final with turkey where only the famed fighting spirit earned them a 3-2 win .
captain michael ballack scored two goals but was unable to stamp his authority on the team as he finished runner-up for the 10th time in his career .
and there were only flashes of genius from the likes of lukas podolski or bastian schweinsteiger .
" it is always disappointing to reach and final and then lose , " ballack said on sunday , adding that the team " made one or two errors too many . "
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : ballack , left , and spain 's marco senna fight for the ball on sunday , the germans fumbled once too often with the ball , their play marked by flawed passes and defense lapses - a weakness ruthlessly exploited by their technically superior opponents .
midfielder thomas hitzlsperger too said his side 's inaccuracy proved their undoing .
" when you make mistakes at this level you get punished .
the spanish side are so good , so you ca n't afford to make any mistakes , " hitzlsperger said .
" we made too many that is why we lost . "
crushed fans the defeat led to disappointment for millions of german fans raring to celebrate their side 's triumph on sunday night .
fernando torres ' 33rd-minute winner silenced the more than 600,000 fans who crowded into the public viewing area near the brandenburg gate in berlin .
spain 's complete domination from midway in the second half onwards until the final whistle was greeted with admiration .
the final whistle resulted in no trouble as police in berlin and elsewhere said the fans left without incident . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : germany 's euro party ended with a whimper on sunday many fans even left before the final whistle , subdued or to beat the crowd on the way home as there was nothing to celebrate when the henri delaunay trophy was eventually given to spain captain iker casillas and not ballack . apart from the more than 600,000 in berlin , 70,000 fans watched the game in munich , frankfurt recorded 50,000 fans and hamburg 42,000 . despite the disappointment , hundreds of thousands of fans are set to turn up in berlin once again on monday when the team presents itself at the fan zone - empty-handed just like after the 2006 world cup third-place finish . uphill battle for loew coach loew now has his work cut out as he looks to preparing the team for the 2010 world cup in south africa . loew 's ideal is a fast game similar to that of spain , the netherlands or russia , but he faces an uphill battle because change must also come from an overly-hyped bundesliga . the showings of german clubs in europe highlights the problem , with bayer leverkusen and bayern munich blown away by andrei arshavin and his uefa cup-winning zenit st petersburg teammates .
germany last won a european title from bayern munich in 2001 and has not had a team in a continental final since 2002 .
munich has shown some class and a new trend in the league could start there as well now that former national coach juergen klinsmann starts his job as munich coach .
klinsmann revolutionized the germany team during his reign 2004-2006 and his assistant loew is now continuing his legacy as boss .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : loew faces challenges as he looks towards the 2010 world cup " jogi loew should continue his way , " german soccer icon franz beckenbauer wrote in his monday column for the bild daily .
apart from goalkeeper jens lehmann , whose future is unclear , loew has a core of a team which has now played two major events , some like ballack and defender christoph metzelder even featuring in the 2002 world cup final .
podolski and schweinsteiger will only be in their mid-20s by the time of the 2010 world cup , and newcomers who were n't quite good enough to make the euro squad - such as marko marin , jermaine jones and patrick helmes - could by then be regulars .
german chancellor angela merkel , who was in the stadium for the final said the team was gradually building on its play .
" third at the world cup and now second , that is something .
maybe we will improve again in south africa , " merkel said . " i told ballack that we have to wait a little longer until we can celebrate together , but that we are slowly getting there . " loew and his boys will have two excellent opportunities to check on any possible improvement - on october 11 and almost a year later on october 10 , 2009 , in the two world cup qualifying matches against russia . dw staff -lrb- sp -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

she was not ill , but afraid of having to go to a nursing home . robert kusch told reporters that the woman , from the city of wuerzburg , identified in press reports as bettina sch . , took a tranquilizer and malaria medication she obtained herself to end her life on saturday .
in order to prove that the woman , a former x-ray technician , had wanted to die , kusch showed reporters interviews with her which he had videotaped . " i have campaigned for a long time for self-determination until the very end , " he said to reporters in hamburg on monday , june 30 .
he said making one 's own decisions about life and death was a " central pillar of a modern society " and that determining one 's own end of life should not be something " only theoretically discussed in seminars . " robert kusch already stirred controversy in march of this year when he unveiled his " suicide machine , " a device that could deliver a deadly infusion of potassium chloride .

" according to german law , it is not illegal if someone is present at a person 's suicide , brysch said .
however , obtaining lethal medication for that individuals does violate the legal code .
brysch said that the upper house of parliament , the bundesrat , would discuss on friday a draft law that would ban commercial suicide services . policiticians and church leaders have also sharply criticized kusch .
green party politician and vice-president of the bundestag , katrin göring-eckardt , called kusch 's action " completely inacceptable . " the protestant bishop of hamburg , maria jepsen , told the epd news agency that her church rejects kusch 's approach , saying the form of assisted suicide he is endorsing violates human dignity and christian responsibility . hamburg 's prosecutor 's office has begun a preliminary investigation into kusch 's action . dw staff -lrb- jam -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

that 's just fine , says dw 's stefan nestler . the tournament 's best team is european champion .
enough said .
the spanish have overcome their tournament trauma and have finally been rewarded for their fascinating soccer .
they were the strongest of all 16 teams .
they offered refreshing , modern offensive soccer at the highest technical level .
they did so not just in a couple of matches , but throughout the entire tournament . the spanish were simply too much to handle for the german team .
in fact , the defeat should have been much clearer .
apart from 15 good minutes at the beginning , ballack and co. were completely disappointing . from a german point of view , the final was almost a logical end to the past three weeks . the " mountain tour " ended up in several valleys before getting stuck just below the summit .
a promising start against poland was followed by an unacceptable defeat against croatia .
a rather weak austria helped to build up the germans , who outdid themselves in the quarter-final match against portugal , one of the tournament favorites . in the semi-final , germany shrank back to a team that made the most out of very little .
it clearly was n't enough to surprise , let along defeat the outstanding spanish . what 's true for the team is also true for individual players .
no one was constantly good and all had their weak moments .
goalkeeper jens lehmann fluttered more than the ball up to the semi-final .
defender christoph metzelder 's beard might have grown during the tournament , but he did n't get any faster .
per mertesacker also seemed too slow too many times .
midfielder michael ballack was not at his best in several games , including the final .
people should be able to expect more of a top player than that . germany 's much-praised strikers , miroslav klose and mario gomez , did n't manage to achieve much .
the only ones that fulfilled expectations - at least to some extent - were bastian schweinsteiger , lukas podolski and philipp lahm .
but even they did n't shine . germany 's reaching the final should not cover up the fact that the german team is able to do much more than it showed during euro 2008 . the team should focus on strengths that have been developed in recent years : to base attacks with quick combination moves on a sound defense and close the deal decisively . the spanish played like this in the final .
the germans did n't . stefan nestler covers sports for dw-radio -lrb- win -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

" i think we have to recognize the greater quality of the spanish team today , " germany coach joachim loew said after his side lost 1-0 to spain . " it -lrb- the defeat -rrb- will encourage us to continue working over the next two years and to improve some things ... in order to get to the 2010 world cup and to play a similar role here . " " possession and one-touch passes are the key in soccer , and that at high speed and under stress .
spain showed that it masters it very well , " loew said . " the best team won " german newspapers too were full of praise for spain , saying the side outclassed the germans on every count . " the artists from spain would n't let themselves be bullied around , " munich-based sueddeutsche zeitung wrote . " after a strong start germany lost their way . "
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : there was no stopping fernando torres as he scored in the 33rd minute " title dreams dashed , " the hamburger morgenpost wrote .
" after 60 minutes of sleep-inducing football and lots of defensive problems the team came to life too late .
thanks to lehmann because it could have been worse . "
germany 's most popular television soccer analyst , guenter netzer said in the end the best team won on sunday .
" congratulations to spain but also i tip my hat in respect to germany for even reaching the final , " netzer , who helped west germany win the european crown in 1972 , said .
" that 's a great success for the team .
spain were the best team throughout the tournament .
they played the best football , " he said .
" they showed us how limited we are , they showed us how to play soccer .
spain showed we have a lot of room to improve . "
germans started well , with miroslav klose missing a glorious opportunity after just four minutes , but then spain soon started to take control and on 33 minutes torres put spain ahead . germany had their chances in the second half but spain remained dangerous and held their nerve to win the championship 1-0 .
one mistake too many germany had come to euro 2008 with lots of ambitions but failed to make a lasting impression apart from a classy 3-2 against portugal in the quarter-finals .
the team was outwitted in a 2-1 defeat against croatia and outplayed for most of the match in the semi-final with turkey where only the famed fighting spirit earned them a 3-2 win .
captain michael ballack scored two goals but was unable to stamp his authority on the team as he finished runner-up for the 10th time in his career .
and there were only flashes of genius from the likes of lukas podolski or bastian schweinsteiger .
" it is always disappointing to reach and final and then lose , " ballack said on sunday , adding that the team " made one or two errors too many . "
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : ballack , left , and spain 's marco senna fight for the ball on sunday , the germans fumbled once too often with the ball , their play marked by flawed passes and defense lapses - a weakness ruthlessly exploited by their technically superior opponents .
midfielder thomas hitzlsperger too said his side 's inaccuracy proved their undoing .
" when you make mistakes at this level you get punished .
the spanish side are so good , so you ca n't afford to make any mistakes , " hitzlsperger said .
" we made too many that is why we lost . "
crushed fans the defeat led to disappointment for millions of german fans raring to celebrate their side 's triumph on sunday night .
fernando torres ' 33rd-minute winner silenced the more than 600,000 fans who crowded into the public viewing area near the brandenburg gate in berlin .
spain 's complete domination from midway in the second half onwards until the final whistle was greeted with admiration .
the final whistle resulted in no trouble as police in berlin and elsewhere said the fans left without incident . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : germany 's euro party ended with a whimper on sunday many fans even left before the final whistle , subdued or to beat the crowd on the way home as there was nothing to celebrate when the henri delaunay trophy was eventually given to spain captain iker casillas and not ballack . apart from the more than 600,000 in berlin , 70,000 fans watched the game in munich , frankfurt recorded 50,000 fans and hamburg 42,000 . despite the disappointment , hundreds of thousands of fans are set to turn up in berlin once again on monday when the team presents itself at the fan zone - empty-handed just like after the 2006 world cup third-place finish . uphill battle for loew coach loew now has his work cut out as he looks to preparing the team for the 2010 world cup in south africa . loew 's ideal is a fast game similar to that of spain , the netherlands or russia , but he faces an uphill battle because change must also come from an overly-hyped bundesliga . the showings of german clubs in europe highlights the problem , with bayer leverkusen and bayern munich blown away by andrei arshavin and his uefa cup-winning zenit st petersburg teammates .
germany last won a european title from bayern munich in 2001 and has not had a team in a continental final since 2002 .
munich has shown some class and a new trend in the league could start there as well now that former national coach juergen klinsmann starts his job as munich coach .
klinsmann revolutionized the germany team during his reign 2004-2006 and his assistant loew is now continuing his legacy as boss .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : loew faces challenges as he looks towards the 2010 world cup " jogi loew should continue his way , " german soccer icon franz beckenbauer wrote in his monday column for the bild daily .
apart from goalkeeper jens lehmann , whose future is unclear , loew has a core of a team which has now played two major events , some like ballack and defender christoph metzelder even featuring in the 2002 world cup final .
podolski and schweinsteiger will only be in their mid-20s by the time of the 2010 world cup , and newcomers who were n't quite good enough to make the euro squad - such as marko marin , jermaine jones and patrick helmes - could by then be regulars .
german chancellor angela merkel , who was in the stadium for the final said the team was gradually building on its play .
" third at the world cup and now second , that is something .
maybe we will improve again in south africa , " merkel said . " i told ballack that we have to wait a little longer until we can celebrate together , but that we are slowly getting there . " loew and his boys will have two excellent opportunities to check on any possible improvement - on october 11 and almost a year later on october 10 , 2009 , in the two world cup qualifying matches against russia . dw staff -lrb- sp -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

" i think we have to recognize the greater quality of the spanish team today , " germany coach joachim loew said after his side lost 1-0 to spain . " it -lrb- the defeat -rrb- will encourage us to continue working over the next two years and to improve some things ... in order to get to the 2010 world cup and to play a similar role here . " " possession and one-touch passes are the key in soccer , and that at high speed and under stress .
spain showed that it masters it very well , " loew said . " the best team won " german newspapers too were full of praise for spain , saying the side outclassed the germans on every count . " the artists from spain would n't let themselves be bullied around , " munich-based sueddeutsche zeitung wrote . " after a strong start germany lost their way . "
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : there was no stopping fernando torres as he scored in the 33rd minute " title dreams dashed , " the hamburger morgenpost wrote .
" after 60 minutes of sleep-inducing football and lots of defensive problems the team came to life too late .
thanks to lehmann because it could have been worse . "
germany 's most popular television soccer analyst , guenter netzer said in the end the best team won on sunday .
" congratulations to spain but also i tip my hat in respect to germany for even reaching the final , " netzer , who helped west germany win the european crown in 1972 , said .
" that 's a great success for the team .
spain were the best team throughout the tournament .
they played the best football , " he said .
" they showed us how limited we are , they showed us how to play soccer .
spain showed we have a lot of room to improve . "
germans started well , with miroslav klose missing a glorious opportunity after just four minutes , but then spain soon started to take control and on 33 minutes torres put spain ahead . germany had their chances in the second half but spain remained dangerous and held their nerve to win the championship 1-0 .
one mistake too many germany had come to euro 2008 with lots of ambitions but failed to make a lasting impression apart from a classy 3-2 against portugal in the quarter-finals .
the team was outwitted in a 2-1 defeat against croatia and outplayed for most of the match in the semi-final with turkey where only the famed fighting spirit earned them a 3-2 win .
captain michael ballack scored two goals but was unable to stamp his authority on the team as he finished runner-up for the 10th time in his career .
and there were only flashes of genius from the likes of lukas podolski or bastian schweinsteiger .
" it is always disappointing to reach and final and then lose , " ballack said on sunday , adding that the team " made one or two errors too many . "
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : ballack , left , and spain 's marco senna fight for the ball on sunday , the germans fumbled once too often with the ball , their play marked by flawed passes and defense lapses - a weakness ruthlessly exploited by their technically superior opponents .
midfielder thomas hitzlsperger too said his side 's inaccuracy proved their undoing .
" when you make mistakes at this level you get punished .
the spanish side are so good , so you ca n't afford to make any mistakes , " hitzlsperger said .
" we made too many that is why we lost . "
crushed fans the defeat led to disappointment for millions of german fans raring to celebrate their side 's triumph on sunday night .
fernando torres ' 33rd-minute winner silenced the more than 600,000 fans who crowded into the public viewing area near the brandenburg gate in berlin .
spain 's complete domination from midway in the second half onwards until the final whistle was greeted with admiration .
the final whistle resulted in no trouble as police in berlin and elsewhere said the fans left without incident . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : germany 's euro party ended with a whimper on sunday many fans even left before the final whistle , subdued or to beat the crowd on the way home as there was nothing to celebrate when the henri delaunay trophy was eventually given to spain captain iker casillas and not ballack . apart from the more than 600,000 in berlin , 70,000 fans watched the game in munich , frankfurt recorded 50,000 fans and hamburg 42,000 . despite the disappointment , hundreds of thousands of fans are set to turn up in berlin once again on monday when the team presents itself at the fan zone - empty-handed just like after the 2006 world cup third-place finish . uphill battle for loew coach loew now has his work cut out as he looks to preparing the team for the 2010 world cup in south africa . loew 's ideal is a fast game similar to that of spain , the netherlands or russia , but he faces an uphill battle because change must also come from an overly-hyped bundesliga . the showings of german clubs in europe highlights the problem , with bayer leverkusen and bayern munich blown away by andrei arshavin and his uefa cup-winning zenit st petersburg teammates .
germany last won a european title from bayern munich in 2001 and has not had a team in a continental final since 2002 .
munich has shown some class and a new trend in the league could start there as well now that former national coach juergen klinsmann starts his job as munich coach .
klinsmann revolutionized the germany team during his reign 2004-2006 and his assistant loew is now continuing his legacy as boss .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : loew faces challenges as he looks towards the 2010 world cup " jogi loew should continue his way , " german soccer icon franz beckenbauer wrote in his monday column for the bild daily .
apart from goalkeeper jens lehmann , whose future is unclear , loew has a core of a team which has now played two major events , some like ballack and defender christoph metzelder even featuring in the 2002 world cup final .
podolski and schweinsteiger will only be in their mid-20s by the time of the 2010 world cup , and newcomers who were n't quite good enough to make the euro squad - such as marko marin , jermaine jones and patrick helmes - could by then be regulars .
german chancellor angela merkel , who was in the stadium for the final said the team was gradually building on its play .
" third at the world cup and now second , that is something .
maybe we will improve again in south africa , " merkel said . " i told ballack that we have to wait a little longer until we can celebrate together , but that we are slowly getting there . " loew and his boys will have two excellent opportunities to check on any possible improvement - on october 11 and almost a year later on october 10 , 2009 , in the two world cup qualifying matches against russia . dw staff -lrb- sp -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

apart from 15 good minutes at the beginning , ballack and co. were completely disappointing . from a german point of view , the final was almost a logical end to the past three weeks . the " mountain tour " ended up in several valleys before getting stuck just below the summit .
a promising start against poland was followed by an unacceptable defeat against croatia .
a rather weak austria helped to build up the germans , who outdid themselves in the quarter-final match against portugal , one of the tournament favorites . in the semi-final , germany shrank back to a team that made the most out of very little .

that 's just fine , says dw 's stefan nestler . the tournament 's best team is european champion .
enough said .
the spanish have overcome their tournament trauma and have finally been rewarded for their fascinating soccer .
they were the strongest of all 16 teams .
they offered refreshing , modern offensive soccer at the highest technical level .
they did so not just in a couple of matches , but throughout the entire tournament . the spanish were simply too much to handle for the german team .
in fact , the defeat should have been much clearer .
apart from 15 good minutes at the beginning , ballack and co. were completely disappointing . from a german point of view , the final was almost a logical end to the past three weeks . the " mountain tour " ended up in several valleys before getting stuck just below the summit .
a promising start against poland was followed by an unacceptable defeat against croatia .
a rather weak austria helped to build up the germans , who outdid themselves in the quarter-final match against portugal , one of the tournament favorites . in the semi-final , germany shrank back to a team that made the most out of very little .
it clearly was n't enough to surprise , let along defeat the outstanding spanish . what 's true for the team is also true for individual players .
no one was constantly good and all had their weak moments .
goalkeeper jens lehmann fluttered more than the ball up to the semi-final .
defender christoph metzelder 's beard might have grown during the tournament , but he did n't get any faster .
per mertesacker also seemed too slow too many times .
midfielder michael ballack was not at his best in several games , including the final .
people should be able to expect more of a top player than that . germany 's much-praised strikers , miroslav klose and mario gomez , did n't manage to achieve much .
the only ones that fulfilled expectations - at least to some extent - were bastian schweinsteiger , lukas podolski and philipp lahm .
but even they did n't shine . germany 's reaching the final should not cover up the fact that the german team is able to do much more than it showed during euro 2008 . the team should focus on strengths that have been developed in recent years : to base attacks with quick combination moves on a sound defense and close the deal decisively . the spanish played like this in the final .

" i think we have to recognize the greater quality of the spanish team today , " germany coach joachim loew said after his side lost 1-0 to spain . " it -lrb- the defeat -rrb- will encourage us to continue working over the next two years and to improve some things ... in order to get to the 2010 world cup and to play a similar role here . " " possession and one-touch passes are the key in soccer , and that at high speed and under stress .
spain showed that it masters it very well , " loew said . " the best team won " german newspapers too were full of praise for spain , saying the side outclassed the germans on every count . " the artists from spain would n't let themselves be bullied around , " munich-based sueddeutsche zeitung wrote . " after a strong start germany lost their way . "
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : there was no stopping fernando torres as he scored in the 33rd minute " title dreams dashed , " the hamburger morgenpost wrote .
" after 60 minutes of sleep-inducing football and lots of defensive problems the team came to life too late .
thanks to lehmann because it could have been worse . "
germany 's most popular television soccer analyst , guenter netzer said in the end the best team won on sunday .
" congratulations to spain but also i tip my hat in respect to germany for even reaching the final , " netzer , who helped west germany win the european crown in 1972 , said .
" that 's a great success for the team .
spain were the best team throughout the tournament .
they played the best football , " he said .
" they showed us how limited we are , they showed us how to play soccer .
spain showed we have a lot of room to improve . "
germans started well , with miroslav klose missing a glorious opportunity after just four minutes , but then spain soon started to take control and on 33 minutes torres put spain ahead . germany had their chances in the second half but spain remained dangerous and held their nerve to win the championship 1-0 .
one mistake too many germany had come to euro 2008 with lots of ambitions but failed to make a lasting impression apart from a classy 3-2 against portugal in the quarter-finals .
the team was outwitted in a 2-1 defeat against croatia and outplayed for most of the match in the semi-final with turkey where only the famed fighting spirit earned them a 3-2 win .
captain michael ballack scored two goals but was unable to stamp his authority on the team as he finished runner-up for the 10th time in his career .
and there were only flashes of genius from the likes of lukas podolski or bastian schweinsteiger .
" it is always disappointing to reach and final and then lose , " ballack said on sunday , adding that the team " made one or two errors too many . "
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : ballack , left , and spain 's marco senna fight for the ball on sunday , the germans fumbled once too often with the ball , their play marked by flawed passes and defense lapses - a weakness ruthlessly exploited by their technically superior opponents .
midfielder thomas hitzlsperger too said his side 's inaccuracy proved their undoing .
" when you make mistakes at this level you get punished .
the spanish side are so good , so you ca n't afford to make any mistakes , " hitzlsperger said .
" we made too many that is why we lost . "
crushed fans the defeat led to disappointment for millions of german fans raring to celebrate their side 's triumph on sunday night .
fernando torres ' 33rd-minute winner silenced the more than 600,000 fans who crowded into the public viewing area near the brandenburg gate in berlin .
spain 's complete domination from midway in the second half onwards until the final whistle was greeted with admiration .
the final whistle resulted in no trouble as police in berlin and elsewhere said the fans left without incident . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : germany 's euro party ended with a whimper on sunday many fans even left before the final whistle , subdued or to beat the crowd on the way home as there was nothing to celebrate when the henri delaunay trophy was eventually given to spain captain iker casillas and not ballack . apart from the more than 600,000 in berlin , 70,000 fans watched the game in munich , frankfurt recorded 50,000 fans and hamburg 42,000 . despite the disappointment , hundreds of thousands of fans are set to turn up in berlin once again on monday when the team presents itself at the fan zone - empty-handed just like after the 2006 world cup third-place finish . uphill battle for loew coach loew now has his work cut out as he looks to preparing the team for the 2010 world cup in south africa . loew 's ideal is a fast game similar to that of spain , the netherlands or russia , but he faces an uphill battle because change must also come from an overly-hyped bundesliga . the showings of german clubs in europe highlights the problem , with bayer leverkusen and bayern munich blown away by andrei arshavin and his uefa cup-winning zenit st petersburg teammates .
germany last won a european title from bayern munich in 2001 and has not had a team in a continental final since 2002 .
munich has shown some class and a new trend in the league could start there as well now that former national coach juergen klinsmann starts his job as munich coach .
klinsmann revolutionized the germany team during his reign 2004-2006 and his assistant loew is now continuing his legacy as boss .

apart from goalkeeper jens lehmann , whose future is unclear , loew has a core of a team which has now played two major events , some like ballack and defender christoph metzelder even featuring in the 2002 world cup final .

german chancellor angela merkel , who was in the stadium for the final said the team was gradually building on its play .
" third at the world cup and now second , that is something .
maybe we will improve again in south africa , " merkel said . " i told ballack that we have to wait a little longer until we can celebrate together , but that we are slowly getting there .

she was not ill , but afraid of having to go to a nursing home . robert kusch told reporters that the woman , from the city of wuerzburg , identified in press reports as bettina sch . , took a tranquilizer and malaria medication she obtained herself to end her life on saturday .
in order to prove that the woman , a former x-ray technician , had wanted to die , kusch showed reporters interviews with her which he had videotaped . " i have campaigned for a long time for self-determination until the very end , " he said to reporters in hamburg on monday , june 30 .
he said making one 's own decisions about life and death was a " central pillar of a modern society " and that determining one 's own end of life should not be something " only theoretically discussed in seminars . " robert kusch already stirred controversy in march of this year when he unveiled his " suicide machine , " a device that could deliver a deadly infusion of potassium chloride .
however , in this case , the machine was not used . sharp criticism the german hospice foundation has expressed indignation over kusch 's action , saying he is primarily interested in drawing attention to himself . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : robert kusch and his " suicide machine " " there is a right to life , there is also a right to die , but there is not a right to kill , " said eugen brysch , the foundation 's director , accusing kusch of abuse " people 's fears of old-age care " out of a " deep sense of narcissism . " according to german law , it is not illegal if someone is present at a person 's suicide , brysch said .
however , obtaining lethal medication for that individuals does violate the legal code .
brysch said that the upper house of parliament , the bundesrat , would discuss on friday a draft law that would ban commercial suicide services . policiticians and church leaders have also sharply criticized kusch .
green party politician and vice-president of the bundestag , katrin göring-eckardt , called kusch 's action " completely inacceptable . " the protestant bishop of hamburg , maria jepsen , told the epd news agency that her church rejects kusch 's approach , saying the form of assisted suicide he is endorsing violates human dignity and christian responsibility . hamburg 's prosecutor 's office has begun a preliminary investigation into kusch 's action . dw staff -lrb- jam -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

deutsche welle 's wolfgang van kann has these thoughts . that was it - the 13th european championship .
and , for the germans at least , it was n't quite the summer fairytale the 2006 world cup was . the weather gods were partly responsible for spoiling it , as were the small stadiums , which could n't draw as many fans into the two host countries .
most of all , however , the austrians and the swiss just did n't quite come through as hosts like the germans did two years ago . while the germans had opened their doors and hearts to guests from around the world , the austrians and swiss withdrew into their own four walls and observed the whole spectacle with suspicion . the fans did n't feel like it was " a time to make friends , " like the german motto in 2006 said . nevertheless , soccer was the focal point and , without a doubt , we experienced the best european soccer championship of all time .
the triumph of the defensive was celebrated in portugal in 2004 , but the euro 2008 was definitely the most offense-driven international tournament fans have ever seen . striking was the name of the game .
those who just tried not to lose a match were punished in the end - especially greece , the 2004 european champions .
statistics show that there were more scoring chances in the euro 2008 than in any other tournament and the final count of 77 goals in 31 games speaks for itself . great soccer , good sports bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : spain can celebrate ; uefa needs to look at what worked and what did n't for the most part , we saw beautiful , fast soccer played by real teams working together .
of course the top teams have their stars , but stars alone ca n't win a match these days .
they can only shine within a team that functions as a whole and presents itself as a single unit .
the alpine event marked the continuation of a trend that has been evident for some time . the euro was also quite sportsmanlike ; there was little hostility on the pitch and just three relatively painless red cards . what did we learn ?
european soccer is apparently going through a generational shift .
the old stars have had their time in the limelight and new names are come to the fore - like russia 's arshavin and pavlyuchenko or turkey 's nihat . what 's more , a strong start evidently does n't mean everything in a tournament and sending in the b-team can only backfire .
being the favorite is often too heavy a burden .
and turkey showed that a match really can last a whole 90 , or even 120 minutes , as former national coach sepp herberger once warned . but a tournament would n't be a tournament without losers .
next to the 2006 world champions and vice-world champions , italy and france , the biggest loser in the euro 2008 is uefa itself . uefa stumbles that may seem paradoxical , considering the 700-million-euro profit the european soccer association made from the event .
still , there are a few scratches on the shiny surface . of course , uefa could n't do anything about the bad weather that led to an embarrassing interruption of the global television broadcast .
but uefa is responsible for stipulating that all the cables had to run through vienna and that there was no viable backup . it 's also uefa 's fault that the quality of the grass was n't great and apparently had n't been tested under extreme conditions . uefa 's regulation overkill ruffled feathers in the austrian and swiss business communities and came to a head on the pitch with the completely senseless and unbearable patronizing of coaches on the sidelines - something germany coach joachim loew experienced personally . and finally , tv viewers felt they got the short end of the stick when they found out that uefa had prevented images it did n't like - such as those of a streaker or illegal fireworks in a stadium - from being broadcast . the 13th european championship is now history .

what kind of a tournament did it turn out to be ?
deutsche welle 's wolfgang van kann has these thoughts . that was it - the 13th european championship .
and , for the germans at least , it was n't quite the summer fairytale the 2006 world cup was . the weather gods were partly responsible for spoiling it , as were the small stadiums , which could n't draw as many fans into the two host countries .
most of all , however , the austrians and the swiss just did n't quite come through as hosts like the germans did two years ago . while the germans had opened their doors and hearts to guests from around the world , the austrians and swiss withdrew into their own four walls and observed the whole spectacle with suspicion . the fans did n't feel like it was " a time to make friends , " like the german motto in 2006 said . nevertheless , soccer was the focal point and , without a doubt , we experienced the best european soccer championship of all time .
the triumph of the defensive was celebrated in portugal in 2004 , but the euro 2008 was definitely the most offense-driven international tournament fans have ever seen . striking was the name of the game .
those who just tried not to lose a match were punished in the end - especially greece , the 2004 european champions .
statistics show that there were more scoring chances in the euro 2008 than in any other tournament and the final count of 77 goals in 31 games speaks for itself . great soccer , good sports bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : spain can celebrate ; uefa needs to look at what worked and what did n't for the most part , we saw beautiful , fast soccer played by real teams working together .
of course the top teams have their stars , but stars alone ca n't win a match these days .
they can only shine within a team that functions as a whole and presents itself as a single unit .
the alpine event marked the continuation of a trend that has been evident for some time . the euro was also quite sportsmanlike ; there was little hostility on the pitch and just three relatively painless red cards . what did we learn ?

that 's just fine , says dw 's stefan nestler . the tournament 's best team is european champion .
enough said .
the spanish have overcome their tournament trauma and have finally been rewarded for their fascinating soccer .
they were the strongest of all 16 teams .
they offered refreshing , modern offensive soccer at the highest technical level .
they did so not just in a couple of matches , but throughout the entire tournament . the spanish were simply too much to handle for the german team .
in fact , the defeat should have been much clearer .
apart from 15 good minutes at the beginning , ballack and co. were completely disappointing . from a german point of view , the final was almost a logical end to the past three weeks . the " mountain tour " ended up in several valleys before getting stuck just below the summit .
a promising start against poland was followed by an unacceptable defeat against croatia .
a rather weak austria helped to build up the germans , who outdid themselves in the quarter-final match against portugal , one of the tournament favorites . in the semi-final , germany shrank back to a team that made the most out of very little .
it clearly was n't enough to surprise , let along defeat the outstanding spanish . what 's true for the team is also true for individual players .
no one was constantly good and all had their weak moments .
goalkeeper jens lehmann fluttered more than the ball up to the semi-final .
defender christoph metzelder 's beard might have grown during the tournament , but he did n't get any faster .
per mertesacker also seemed too slow too many times .
midfielder michael ballack was not at his best in several games , including the final .
people should be able to expect more of a top player than that . germany 's much-praised strikers , miroslav klose and mario gomez , did n't manage to achieve much .
the only ones that fulfilled expectations - at least to some extent - were bastian schweinsteiger , lukas podolski and philipp lahm .
but even they did n't shine . germany 's reaching the final should not cover up the fact that the german team is able to do much more than it showed during euro 2008 . the team should focus on strengths that have been developed in recent years : to base attacks with quick combination moves on a sound defense and close the deal decisively . the spanish played like this in the final .

the court has not yet set a date to rule on the challenges . koehler 's functions are mainly ceremonial , but he has sometimes used his limited powers to block government legislation . the lisbon treaty which was rejected by irish voters in a referendum recently , plunging the bloc into constitutional crisis , is meant to streamline the eu 's institutions , simplify decision-making and give the eu more clout on the world stage . it also provides for a new double majority voting mechanism seen as essential if the 27-member bloc is to expand .
all 27 member states must approve the text before it can enter into force . koehler 's move has put germany in a tricky situation given that the european heavyweight had pressed eu nations to ratify the treaty as soon as possible after the irish rejection . ireland was the only eu member to hold a referendum on the treaty , in all other eu nations , the decision will be taken by the parliament .
nineteen nations have ratified the embattled lisbon treaty in parliament so far , most recently britain . challenge from the left in germany , both houses of parliament passed the law ratifiying the lisbon treaty with the two-thirds majority needed earlier this year . but it needs president koehler 's signature for the law to come into force . however , the lisbon treaty faces a challenge in germany by the left , a radical left-wing opposition party , and a member of the ultra-conservative christian social union . the left says the treaty infringes the principle of democracy and the rights of members of the german parliament .
it sees the treaty as giving too much power to the european council , the council of the heads of state and government , at the expense of national parliaments and the european parliament . in 2006 , koehler also delayed in signing off on a forerunner of the lisbon treaty .
that constitutional treaty subsequently collapsed when it was rejected by dutch and french voters . dw staff -lrb- sp -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

all 27 member states must approve the text before it can enter into force . koehler 's move has put germany in a tricky situation given that the european heavyweight had pressed eu nations to ratify the treaty as soon as possible after the irish rejection . ireland was the only eu member to hold a referendum on the treaty , in all other eu nations , the decision will be taken by the parliament .
nineteen nations have ratified the embattled lisbon treaty in parliament so far , most recently britain . challenge from the left in germany , both houses of parliament passed the law ratifiying the lisbon treaty with the two-thirds majority needed earlier this year . but it needs president koehler 's signature for the law to come into force . however , the lisbon treaty faces a challenge in germany by the left , a radical left-wing opposition party , and a member of the ultra-conservative christian social union . the left says the treaty infringes the principle of democracy and the rights of members of the german parliament .
it sees the treaty as giving too much power to the european council , the council of the heads of state and government , at the expense of national parliaments and the european parliament . in 2006 , koehler also delayed in signing off on a forerunner of the lisbon treaty .
that constitutional treaty subsequently collapsed when it was rejected by dutch and french voters . dw staff -lrb- sp -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

she was not ill , but afraid of having to go to a nursing home . robert kusch told reporters that the woman , from the city of wuerzburg , identified in press reports as bettina sch . , took a tranquilizer and malaria medication she obtained herself to end her life on saturday .
in order to prove that the woman , a former x-ray technician , had wanted to die , kusch showed reporters interviews with her which he had videotaped . " i have campaigned for a long time for self-determination until the very end , " he said to reporters in hamburg on monday , june 30 .
he said making one 's own decisions about life and death was a " central pillar of a modern society " and that determining one 's own end of life should not be something " only theoretically discussed in seminars . " robert kusch already stirred controversy in march of this year when he unveiled his " suicide machine , " a device that could deliver a deadly infusion of potassium chloride .
however , in this case , the machine was not used . sharp criticism the german hospice foundation has expressed indignation over kusch 's action , saying he is primarily interested in drawing attention to himself . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : robert kusch and his " suicide machine " " there is a right to life , there is also a right to die , but there is not a right to kill , " said eugen brysch , the foundation 's director , accusing kusch of abuse " people 's fears of old-age care " out of a " deep sense of narcissism . " according to german law , it is not illegal if someone is present at a person 's suicide , brysch said .
however , obtaining lethal medication for that individuals does violate the legal code .
brysch said that the upper house of parliament , the bundesrat , would discuss on friday a draft law that would ban commercial suicide services . policiticians and church leaders have also sharply criticized kusch .
green party politician and vice-president of the bundestag , katrin göring-eckardt , called kusch 's action " completely inacceptable . " the protestant bishop of hamburg , maria jepsen , told the epd news agency that her church rejects kusch 's approach , saying the form of assisted suicide he is endorsing violates human dignity and christian responsibility . hamburg 's prosecutor 's office has begun a preliminary investigation into kusch 's action . dw staff -lrb- jam -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

that 's just fine , says dw 's stefan nestler . the tournament 's best team is european champion .
enough said .
the spanish have overcome their tournament trauma and have finally been rewarded for their fascinating soccer .
they were the strongest of all 16 teams .
they offered refreshing , modern offensive soccer at the highest technical level .
they did so not just in a couple of matches , but throughout the entire tournament . the spanish were simply too much to handle for the german team .
in fact , the defeat should have been much clearer .
apart from 15 good minutes at the beginning , ballack and co. were completely disappointing . from a german point of view , the final was almost a logical end to the past three weeks . the " mountain tour " ended up in several valleys before getting stuck just below the summit .
a promising start against poland was followed by an unacceptable defeat against croatia .
a rather weak austria helped to build up the germans , who outdid themselves in the quarter-final match against portugal , one of the tournament favorites . in the semi-final , germany shrank back to a team that made the most out of very little .
it clearly was n't enough to surprise , let along defeat the outstanding spanish . what 's true for the team is also true for individual players .
no one was constantly good and all had their weak moments .
goalkeeper jens lehmann fluttered more than the ball up to the semi-final .
defender christoph metzelder 's beard might have grown during the tournament , but he did n't get any faster .
per mertesacker also seemed too slow too many times .
midfielder michael ballack was not at his best in several games , including the final .
people should be able to expect more of a top player than that . germany 's much-praised strikers , miroslav klose and mario gomez , did n't manage to achieve much .
the only ones that fulfilled expectations - at least to some extent - were bastian schweinsteiger , lukas podolski and philipp lahm .
but even they did n't shine . germany 's reaching the final should not cover up the fact that the german team is able to do much more than it showed during euro 2008 . the team should focus on strengths that have been developed in recent years : to base attacks with quick combination moves on a sound defense and close the deal decisively . the spanish played like this in the final .
the germans did n't . stefan nestler covers sports for dw-radio -lrb- win -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

that 's just fine , says dw 's stefan nestler . the tournament 's best team is european champion .
enough said .
the spanish have overcome their tournament trauma and have finally been rewarded for their fascinating soccer .
they were the strongest of all 16 teams .
they offered refreshing , modern offensive soccer at the highest technical level .
they did so not just in a couple of matches , but throughout the entire tournament . the spanish were simply too much to handle for the german team .
in fact , the defeat should have been much clearer .
apart from 15 good minutes at the beginning , ballack and co. were completely disappointing . from a german point of view , the final was almost a logical end to the past three weeks . the " mountain tour " ended up in several valleys before getting stuck just below the summit .
a promising start against poland was followed by an unacceptable defeat against croatia .
a rather weak austria helped to build up the germans , who outdid themselves in the quarter-final match against portugal , one of the tournament favorites . in the semi-final , germany shrank back to a team that made the most out of very little .
it clearly was n't enough to surprise , let along defeat the outstanding spanish . what 's true for the team is also true for individual players .
no one was constantly good and all had their weak moments .
goalkeeper jens lehmann fluttered more than the ball up to the semi-final .
defender christoph metzelder 's beard might have grown during the tournament , but he did n't get any faster .
per mertesacker also seemed too slow too many times .
midfielder michael ballack was not at his best in several games , including the final .
people should be able to expect more of a top player than that . germany 's much-praised strikers , miroslav klose and mario gomez , did n't manage to achieve much .
the only ones that fulfilled expectations - at least to some extent - were bastian schweinsteiger , lukas podolski and philipp lahm .
but even they did n't shine . germany 's reaching the final should not cover up the fact that the german team is able to do much more than it showed during euro 2008 . the team should focus on strengths that have been developed in recent years : to base attacks with quick combination moves on a sound defense and close the deal decisively . the spanish played like this in the final .

michael reagan , a talk-show host and columnist in the us , is presenting his ideas in berlin on monday , june 30 . while ronald reagan 's famous speech at the brandenburg gate on june 12 , 1987 has entered the history books , the only commemoration of it is a few words on a plaque near the gate .
his son would like for berlin to see a commemorative object put up in berlin to mark what he sees as his father 's contribution to ending the cold war . " we can envisage a large statue or bust , " reagan , 63 , told the german daily bild .
michael reagan is the founder the reagan legacy foundation , a non-profit organization whose goal is to promote his father 's ideas and memorialize his accomplishments .
ronald reagan died in 2004 . michael reagan is in berlin to put forward his plan and leading a discussion about a commemoration at berlin 's cafe einstein , a restaurant frequented by journalists . " we are just at the beginning of the process , " he said .
" our foundation believes that an appropriate monument for president reagan 's speech at the brandenburg gate is of great historical value for berliners . " ' tear down this wall ! ' bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : reagan had addressed his remarks in the speece to soviet leader mikhail gorbachev , right .
ronald reagan made his historic speech during a five-hour visit to berlin on a podium near the brandenburg gate , which was then cut off from west berlin by the berlin wall .
during the speech made in front of tens of thousands of west berlin residents , reagan addressed the then-soviet leader when he said : " mr. gorbachev , open this gate !
mr. gorbachev , tear down this wall ! " the berlin wall actually did fall 881 days later , an event that shocked the world . " i would welcome a visible remembrance of this great friend of the germans , " said frank henkel , secretary-general of the conservative christian democrats in berlin .
" i can image a large commemorative plaque with that quotation between the new us embassy and the brandenburg gate . " however , during president reagan 's visit , police were faced with massive protests against his rearmament policies .
large parts of kreuzberg district , a traditional enclave of the left in west berlin , were sealed off to prevent rioting . an editorial monday in the left-wing daily neues deutschland said reagan 's terms in office were marked by military build-up , the " star wars " missile defense project , weapons deals with iran , and the invasion of grenada .

midfielder bastian schweinsteiger appeared to cries of " schweini schweini " from many of the young girls among the crowd as captain michael ballack and stars , lukas podolski and miroslav klose too were cheered on enthusiastically .
" the atmosphere in germany was fantastic .
we hope to bring home a cup in the future , " schweinsteiger , the popular bayern munich midfielder , said .
" you are the best " read one of the countless banners in the crowd of some 300,000 and some fans had even brought a replica of the cup with the writing " thank you " on it .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : ballack waves to his supporters " we would have not made it without the fans .
it is important for our young team , " ballack said .
" it is great for us that we could delight the fans even though we lost .
it is an amazing feeling and gives me goose bumps , " goalkeeper jens lehmann said .
germany full of praise for spain despite not always shining on the pitch , the german team had created another soccer frenzy in germany which sometimes came close to that from the 2006 home world cup in which germany finished third .
hundreds of thousands of fans watched the games from austria and switzerland in the country 's public viewing areas , with more than 500,000 on hand in berlin alone for the german 3-2 semi-final win over turkey and the final .
the fans at least partly cheered up the players , but no complaints were heard and read in the country after germany not simply lost the euro 2008 final 1-0 to spain but was comprehensively outplayed on sunday in vienna .
" spain 's victory .
the best team wins the tournament , " was the front page headline of the sueddeutsche zeitung -lrb- sz -rrb- daily under a photo of match-winner fernando torres and other players holding the cup in the air .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : spanish players holding up the euro trophy the sz was just one paper which named spain " the clearly better team " and praised its " brilliant passing " which kept the german defense on their toes .
the paper said that " soccer was the winner " on the night as the german euphoria somewhat hid the fact that the team had only rarely showed its class in the six matches in austria and switzerland .
former germany coach juergen klinsmann said that spain was " considerably better " on the night and german soccer icon franz beckenbauer said in his monday column for the bild daily that " spain dominated the tournament from the first match ... until yesterday 's final . "
other papers acknowledged as well that the better team had won but also looked back at germany 's run to the final .
" the end of the dream .
we are still proud of you , but spain was the better team , " said daily bild .
the hamburger abendblatt said : " only second - but it was still nice . "
slowly getting there the abendblatt recalled the soccer frenzy which had gripped the nation like at the 2006 home world cup and looked ahead , saying " maybe the happy end follows in 2010 " at the world cup in south africa , as germany was third at the 2006 world cup and now second at euro .
german chancellor angela merkel struck a similar note after attending the game in the vienna stadium .
" third at the world cup and now second , that is something .
maybe we will improve again in south africa , " said merkel .
" i told ballack that we have to wait a little longer until we can celebrate together but that we are slowly getting there . "
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : german soccer fans at the berlin fan mile large numbers of germans had celebrated in the fan zones ahead of the match , with the berlin zone closed some three hours before the kickoff as it was filled to its capacity with more than 600,000 fans .
" the fans left the fan zone very quietly , very peacefully and in very well-behaved way , " said a berlin fan zone official after the match .
that was not quite the case in the eastern part of the country , with incidents recorded in magdeburg and other towns when several hundred troublemakers rioted in city centers and fought police .
police said on monday that 25 officers were injured and 60 people arrested .
berlin saw 59 arrests , but , according to a spokesman , all for minor offences . dpa news agency -lrb- sp -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

midfielder bastian schweinsteiger appeared to cries of " schweini schweini " from many of the young girls among the crowd as captain michael ballack and stars , lukas podolski and miroslav klose too were cheered on enthusiastically .
" the atmosphere in germany was fantastic .
we hope to bring home a cup in the future , " schweinsteiger , the popular bayern munich midfielder , said .
" you are the best " read one of the countless banners in the crowd of some 300,000 and some fans had even brought a replica of the cup with the writing " thank you " on it .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : ballack waves to his supporters " we would have not made it without the fans .
it is important for our young team , " ballack said .
" it is great for us that we could delight the fans even though we lost .
it is an amazing feeling and gives me goose bumps , " goalkeeper jens lehmann said .
germany full of praise for spain despite not always shining on the pitch , the german team had created another soccer frenzy in germany which sometimes came close to that from the 2006 home world cup in which germany finished third .
hundreds of thousands of fans watched the games from austria and switzerland in the country 's public viewing areas , with more than 500,000 on hand in berlin alone for the german 3-2 semi-final win over turkey and the final .
the fans at least partly cheered up the players , but no complaints were heard and read in the country after germany not simply lost the euro 2008 final 1-0 to spain but was comprehensively outplayed on sunday in vienna .
" spain 's victory .
the best team wins the tournament , " was the front page headline of the sueddeutsche zeitung -lrb- sz -rrb- daily under a photo of match-winner fernando torres and other players holding the cup in the air .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : spanish players holding up the euro trophy the sz was just one paper which named spain " the clearly better team " and praised its " brilliant passing " which kept the german defense on their toes .
the paper said that " soccer was the winner " on the night as the german euphoria somewhat hid the fact that the team had only rarely showed its class in the six matches in austria and switzerland .
former germany coach juergen klinsmann said that spain was " considerably better " on the night and german soccer icon franz beckenbauer said in his monday column for the bild daily that " spain dominated the tournament from the first match ... until yesterday 's final . "
other papers acknowledged as well that the better team had won but also looked back at germany 's run to the final .
" the end of the dream .
we are still proud of you , but spain was the better team , " said daily bild .
the hamburger abendblatt said : " only second - but it was still nice . "
slowly getting there the abendblatt recalled the soccer frenzy which had gripped the nation like at the 2006 home world cup and looked ahead , saying " maybe the happy end follows in 2010 " at the world cup in south africa , as germany was third at the 2006 world cup and now second at euro .
german chancellor angela merkel struck a similar note after attending the game in the vienna stadium .
" third at the world cup and now second , that is something .
maybe we will improve again in south africa , " said merkel .
" i told ballack that we have to wait a little longer until we can celebrate together but that we are slowly getting there . "
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : german soccer fans at the berlin fan mile large numbers of germans had celebrated in the fan zones ahead of the match , with the berlin zone closed some three hours before the kickoff as it was filled to its capacity with more than 600,000 fans .
" the fans left the fan zone very quietly , very peacefully and in very well-behaved way , " said a berlin fan zone official after the match .
that was not quite the case in the eastern part of the country , with incidents recorded in magdeburg and other towns when several hundred troublemakers rioted in city centers and fought police .
police said on monday that 25 officers were injured and 60 people arrested .
berlin saw 59 arrests , but , according to a spokesman , all for minor offences . dpa news agency -lrb- sp -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

" we want to bring forward two components : a very intensive training on the pitch and off it as well where we want to move them forward as humans , " klinsmann told the bundesliga champions ' club website .
" the coaching staff is excited , neither real madrid nor barcelona have this .
we are very proud of it . "
klinsmann was mainly referring to the revamped player facilities , but there is far more to it then a few rooms as bayern have set their sites on international fame and fortune after dominating in germany with three league and cup doubles in the past four seasons .
a top placing in the champions league , where munich has been in the final since lifting the trophy in 2001 , as a key aim .
klinsmann revived the german national team during his reign 2004-2006 and then in january signed a two-year contract for munich to do exactly the same there .
klinsmann brought in to introduce new culture bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : klinsmann is the man to change the way bayern works " we took this step deliberately .
we needed a man who dares to make changes .
juergen is the right man for that , " said chairman karl-heinz rummenigge .
" not even i know what he will still change .
but this is a new culture for the bundesliga . "
after overhauling the team last summer by hiring the likes of france star franck ribery , italy striker luca toni and germany forward miroslav klose , munich now want klinsmann to bring the coaching structures up to modern standard .
klinsmann , who played for munich 1995-1997 , brought sweeping changes to the national team with new methods including american fitness gurus and has the same in mind in munich .
klinsmann 's team in munich includes mexican assistant coach martin vasquez , former player christian nerlinger is somewhere between the team and hoeness , and former bundesliga goalkeeper philipp laux ready to work with frustrated players as a sports psychologist .
working days to be extended bayern players faced an eight-hour day with training , lunch and wellness areas in the new facilities from monday onwards .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : klinsi 's techniques with germany will be used at bayern dutchman mark van bommel was the most prominent player to get a first taste of klinsmann 's training , while ribery , toni , turkey 's hamit altintop and the germans klose , bastian schweinsteiger , lukas podolski , philipp lahm and the other euro international enjoyed a holiday before starting pre-season training .
klinsmann watched germany lose the final 1-0 to spain on sunday in vienna and admitted that spain were " considerably better . "
spain 's philosophy of attacking football with neat one-touch passes matches exactly that of klinsmann , who will try to introduce it in germany - from which the national team could profit as well . dw staff / dpa news agency -lrb- nda -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

the mediation follows a widely condemned one-candidate election . germany said on monday , june 30 , it hoped south africa , whose president thabo mbeki is heading the talks , would also back the nomination of a second mediator . " we will in the next days and weeks be watching very closely how things in southern africa develop , " said german foreign ministry spokesman martin jaeger . mbeki was called on to steer talks with the zimbabwean government after 84-year-old incumbent president robert mugabe won a landslide re-election last week .
the single-candidate poll , boycotted by opposition candidate morgan tsvangirai due to violent attacks on his supporters , has been panned a farce by the un and the much of the international community . the eu on monday denounced the vote as an " exercise in power-grabbing . " zimbabwe opposition appeals to african union bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : tsvangirai pulled out of the presidential race , leaving just one candidate mbeki , who has close personal ties to mugabe , has been widely criticized for his quiet diplomacy toward the zimbabwean regime .
mugabe has been accused of widespread human rights abuses and of driving his country 's economy into the ground . the zimbabwean opposition movement for democratic change -lrb- mdc -rrb- on monday called on african union leaders , currently at a summit in egypt , to name a second mediator to join in the talks in a move to sideline mbeki 's much criticized efforts . " we want an au envoy who is a permanent mediator between the mdc and the zanu-pf to assist president mbeki , " said mdc spokesman george sibotshiwe . the situation in zimbabwe has topped the agenda at the egypt summit .

midfielder bastian schweinsteiger appeared to cries of " schweini schweini " from many of the young girls among the crowd as captain michael ballack and stars , lukas podolski and miroslav klose too were cheered on enthusiastically .
" the atmosphere in germany was fantastic .
we hope to bring home a cup in the future , " schweinsteiger , the popular bayern munich midfielder , said .

it is important for our young team , " ballack said .
" it is great for us that we could delight the fans even though we lost .

germany full of praise for spain despite not always shining on the pitch , the german team had created another soccer frenzy in germany which sometimes came close to that from the 2006 home world cup in which germany finished third .
hundreds of thousands of fans watched the games from austria and switzerland in the country 's public viewing areas , with more than 500,000 on hand in berlin alone for the german 3-2 semi-final win over turkey and the final .
the fans at least partly cheered up the players , but no complaints were heard and read in the country after germany not simply lost the euro 2008 final 1-0 to spain but was comprehensively outplayed on sunday in vienna .
" spain 's victory .
the best team wins the tournament , " was the front page headline of the sueddeutsche zeitung -lrb- sz -rrb- daily under a photo of match-winner fernando torres and other players holding the cup in the air .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : spanish players holding up the euro trophy the sz was just one paper which named spain " the clearly better team " and praised its " brilliant passing " which kept the german defense on their toes .
the paper said that " soccer was the winner " on the night as the german euphoria somewhat hid the fact that the team had only rarely showed its class in the six matches in austria and switzerland .
former germany coach juergen klinsmann said that spain was " considerably better " on the night and german soccer icon franz beckenbauer said in his monday column for the bild daily that " spain dominated the tournament from the first match ... until yesterday 's final . "
other papers acknowledged as well that the better team had won but also looked back at germany 's run to the final .
" the end of the dream .
we are still proud of you , but spain was the better team , " said daily bild .
the hamburger abendblatt said : " only second - but it was still nice . "
slowly getting there the abendblatt recalled the soccer frenzy which had gripped the nation like at the 2006 home world cup and looked ahead , saying " maybe the happy end follows in 2010 " at the world cup in south africa , as germany was third at the 2006 world cup and now second at euro .
german chancellor angela merkel struck a similar note after attending the game in the vienna stadium .
" third at the world cup and now second , that is something .
maybe we will improve again in south africa , " said merkel .
" i told ballack that we have to wait a little longer until we can celebrate together but that we are slowly getting there . "
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : german soccer fans at the berlin fan mile large numbers of germans had celebrated in the fan zones ahead of the match , with the berlin zone closed some three hours before the kickoff as it was filled to its capacity with more than 600,000 fans .

" heister told deutsche presse-agentur dpa that a german judge denied permission to tap the phones of heim relatives because it had not satisfied criteria under german criminal-investigation laws , and this had been confirmed on appeal . this setback was being taken out of context , he said . " we are very committed to this investigation and are working intensively on it , " the spokesman said , adding the german judges had mounted 11 requests since 2005 for foreign legal assistance as they try to track heim down . heim , who performed gruesome , fatal experiments on concentration-camp inmates , vanished in 1962 as arrest loomed and is suspected to be still alive and living under an assumed name in spain or latin america . heim tops the list of the 10 most-sought nazi criminals put out by the simon wiesenthal centre in jerusalem . a member of the ss force , heim was known for his sadism as a doctor at the nazi 's mauthausen concentration camp in austria .
heim is alleged to have killed hundreds of inmates in authausen with injections into their hearts .
a total of 310,000 euros is being offered as a reward for his arrest . there have been reported sightings of him over the years .

until now , norway has provided soldiers for a qrf in the region but now the scandinavians want to focus on rebuilding afghanistan and strengthening their civil reconstruction teams . heightened danger germany currently has 3,500 troops in afghanistan .
an additional 1,000 troops are expected to join them in autumn . the qrf will be at the disposal of the regional command of the nato-led international security and assistance force -lrb- isaf -rrb- in northern afghanistan and its main job will be to provide emergency help to nato troops .
that will include defending against attacks by a resurgent taliban and other radical groups and could involve offensive deployments against insurgents . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : dutch soldiers on patrol in kunduz equipped with armoured vehicles and tanks , the qrf is expected to be mobile and quick .
it will include experts in deactivating mines and booby traps . though the commander of the german qrf , gunnar bruegner said the deployment did not involve heightened dangers , the departing head of the norwegian force said the german army had to be prepared for more casualties . the norwegians did not lose a single soldier since the force took up operations in early 2006 but rune solberg said threat levels had significantly increased recently in northern afghanistan . reports of rising threats from the taliban have been fuelled by the approach taken by the new government in neighboring pakistan to negotiate with taliban militants .
that stance , western experts , say have emboldened taliban insurgents in afghanistan . german defense minister franz josef jung had warned the qrf force when he saw it off at the beginning of june of a dangerous deployment with " life-threatening risks . " at the time , jung said : " every soldier who goes to afghanistan must be in a position to fight . " more troops needed sending troops into combat in afghanistan remains a sensitive topic in germany with opinion polls showing the majority of the population against the step . nato partners , particularly the united states , have pressured germany to send more troops to afghanistan .
they also want more german soldiers sent to the dangerous south to help fight a more powerful taliban . there are about 60,000 foreign troops in afghanistan , most of them part of the nato-led isaf force .
yet despite the heavy nato involvement , some 6,000 people were killed in 2007 , the deadliest year since the taliban was forced from power in 2001 .
german nato general egon ramms said last week he urgently needs an additional 5,000 to 6,000 troops in afghanistan . dw staff -lrb- sp -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

the court has not yet set a date to rule on the challenges . koehler 's functions are mainly ceremonial , but he has sometimes used his limited powers to block government legislation . the lisbon treaty which was rejected by irish voters in a referendum recently , plunging the bloc into constitutional crisis , is meant to streamline the eu 's institutions , simplify decision-making and give the eu more clout on the world stage . it also provides for a new double majority voting mechanism seen as essential if the 27-member bloc is to expand .
all 27 member states must approve the text before it can enter into force . koehler 's move has put germany in a tricky situation given that the european heavyweight had pressed eu nations to ratify the treaty as soon as possible after the irish rejection . ireland was the only eu member to hold a referendum on the treaty , in all other eu nations , the decision will be taken by the parliament .
nineteen nations have ratified the embattled lisbon treaty in parliament so far , most recently britain . challenge from the left in germany , both houses of parliament passed the law ratifiying the lisbon treaty with the two-thirds majority needed earlier this year . but it needs president koehler 's signature for the law to come into force . however , the lisbon treaty faces a challenge in germany by the left , a radical left-wing opposition party , and a member of the ultra-conservative christian social union . the left says the treaty infringes the principle of democracy and the rights of members of the german parliament .
it sees the treaty as giving too much power to the european council , the council of the heads of state and government , at the expense of national parliaments and the european parliament . in 2006 , koehler also delayed in signing off on a forerunner of the lisbon treaty .
that constitutional treaty subsequently collapsed when it was rejected by dutch and french voters . dw staff -lrb- sp -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

but the crisis of the irish no vote overshadowed slovenia 's term . at the beginning of the year , slovenia set out to prove that a small country could successfully take on the european union presidency . indeed , the recent eu member showed that " things would n't go disastrously wrong and that they could manage it effectively , " said jacki davis from the european policy center , a leading think-tank in brussels . " i think they 've done that and that 's really the best one could have asked for , " she said . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : slovenia advocated for kosovo , while still trying to keep serbia on board it may be a small country , but slovenia tackled major issues during its six-month presidency , which it is set to hand over to france on july 1 .
among them : balkan diplomacy and the birth of the kosovar state . drawing the balkans closer to europe as a former yugoslav state itself , it came as no huge surprise that slovenia vehemently encouraged the eu not only to recognize kosovo as an independent state but also to smooth the way for serbia 's future membership in the bloc . after snap elections in serbia , tensions relaxed a bit and the eu signed a stabilization and association agreement with both serbia and bosnia-herzegovina - a major step toward eu membership for both countries . as for kosovo , russian concerns prevented the eu from taking over the political supervision of the fledgling country , but the bloc continues to be integrally involved in the un mission . slovenia " handled -lsb- kosovo 's independence -rsb- well , considering the initial qualms and divisions between eu member states or whether to recognize or not , " said davis . irish no a blow to eu leaders bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : slovenia was n't blamed for the irish no to the lisbon treaty the second major issue dominating the slovenian presidency was the irish no vote in june on the bloc 's lisbon treaty .
davis said the vote , which raised existential concerns over the bloc 's future , " had to do with conditions in ireland " and could n't be blamed on slovenia . slovenian prime minister janez jansa said he regrets that he and the bloc 's 26 other heads-of-state were n't able to sufficiently promote europe to its residents . " we need to change the negative attitude toward european institutions , " he said .
" we need a european identity . " mep questions eu connection to the people jansa and his relatively small team managed to push through new laws on unified work times for eu institutions - after 14 years of discussion on the matter .
they also put in motion the first part of a common asylum law , founded a joint eu-mediterranean university , and opened dialogue with latin america on climate change , food production and energy security . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : jansa said a stronger european identity is needed eu parliamentarian jo leinen , a member of germany 's social democratic party , said that slovenia and the rest of the eu states have n't recognized the people 's true concerns . " food prices , energy prices , credit crisis , and high managers ' salaries - the people are worried about lots of things , but we either get around to them too late or just make half-hearted decisions , " he said .
" europe has to be useful to the people , it has to protect the people , and then they will also support and follow us . " a euro team at the next euro ? european commission president jose manuel barroso , on the other hand , praised the slovenian presidency for its effectiveness - a quality some observers in brussels do n't expect from its french successors . " if all the member states applied the same principles -lsb- as slovenia -rsb- , the european union would overcome many of its difficulties , " said barroso . in his final speech as head of 27-member bloc , which coincided with the end of the european soccer championship , jansa quipped that the eu should send its own soccer team to the next euro . then at least the eu would get a little attention . bernd riegert -lrb- kjb -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

michael reagan , a talk-show host and columnist in the us , is presenting his ideas in berlin on monday , june 30 . while ronald reagan 's famous speech at the brandenburg gate on june 12 , 1987 has entered the history books , the only commemoration of it is a few words on a plaque near the gate .
his son would like for berlin to see a commemorative object put up in berlin to mark what he sees as his father 's contribution to ending the cold war . " we can envisage a large statue or bust , " reagan , 63 , told the german daily bild .
michael reagan is the founder the reagan legacy foundation , a non-profit organization whose goal is to promote his father 's ideas and memorialize his accomplishments .
ronald reagan died in 2004 . michael reagan is in berlin to put forward his plan and leading a discussion about a commemoration at berlin 's cafe einstein , a restaurant frequented by journalists . " we are just at the beginning of the process , " he said .
" our foundation believes that an appropriate monument for president reagan 's speech at the brandenburg gate is of great historical value for berliners . " ' tear down this wall ! ' bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : reagan had addressed his remarks in the speece to soviet leader mikhail gorbachev , right .
ronald reagan made his historic speech during a five-hour visit to berlin on a podium near the brandenburg gate , which was then cut off from west berlin by the berlin wall .
during the speech made in front of tens of thousands of west berlin residents , reagan addressed the then-soviet leader when he said : " mr. gorbachev , open this gate !
mr. gorbachev , tear down this wall ! " the berlin wall actually did fall 881 days later , an event that shocked the world . " i would welcome a visible remembrance of this great friend of the germans , " said frank henkel , secretary-general of the conservative christian democrats in berlin .
" i can image a large commemorative plaque with that quotation between the new us embassy and the brandenburg gate . " however , during president reagan 's visit , police were faced with massive protests against his rearmament policies .
large parts of kreuzberg district , a traditional enclave of the left in west berlin , were sealed off to prevent rioting . an editorial monday in the left-wing daily neues deutschland said reagan 's terms in office were marked by military build-up , the " star wars " missile defense project , weapons deals with iran , and the invasion of grenada .
the paper said reagan already has a us navy aircraft carrier named after him , which is more appropriate than a commemorate plaque or statue in berlin . dw staff -lrb- jam -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

michael reagan , a talk-show host and columnist in the us , is presenting his ideas in berlin on monday , june 30 . while ronald reagan 's famous speech at the brandenburg gate on june 12 , 1987 has entered the history books , the only commemoration of it is a few words on a plaque near the gate .
his son would like for berlin to see a commemorative object put up in berlin to mark what he sees as his father 's contribution to ending the cold war . " we can envisage a large statue or bust , " reagan , 63 , told the german daily bild .
michael reagan is the founder the reagan legacy foundation , a non-profit organization whose goal is to promote his father 's ideas and memorialize his accomplishments .
ronald reagan died in 2004 . michael reagan is in berlin to put forward his plan and leading a discussion about a commemoration at berlin 's cafe einstein , a restaurant frequented by journalists . " we are just at the beginning of the process , " he said .
" our foundation believes that an appropriate monument for president reagan 's speech at the brandenburg gate is of great historical value for berliners . " ' tear down this wall ! ' bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : reagan had addressed his remarks in the speece to soviet leader mikhail gorbachev , right .
ronald reagan made his historic speech during a five-hour visit to berlin on a podium near the brandenburg gate , which was then cut off from west berlin by the berlin wall .
during the speech made in front of tens of thousands of west berlin residents , reagan addressed the then-soviet leader when he said : " mr. gorbachev , open this gate !
mr. gorbachev , tear down this wall ! " the berlin wall actually did fall 881 days later , an event that shocked the world . " i would welcome a visible remembrance of this great friend of the germans , " said frank henkel , secretary-general of the conservative christian democrats in berlin .
" i can image a large commemorative plaque with that quotation between the new us embassy and the brandenburg gate . " however , during president reagan 's visit , police were faced with massive protests against his rearmament policies .
large parts of kreuzberg district , a traditional enclave of the left in west berlin , were sealed off to prevent rioting . an editorial monday in the left-wing daily neues deutschland said reagan 's terms in office were marked by military build-up , the " star wars " missile defense project , weapons deals with iran , and the invasion of grenada .
the paper said reagan already has a us navy aircraft carrier named after him , which is more appropriate than a commemorate plaque or statue in berlin . dw staff -lrb- jam -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

" i think we have to recognize the greater quality of the spanish team today , " germany coach joachim loew said after his side lost 1-0 to spain . " it -lrb- the defeat -rrb- will encourage us to continue working over the next two years and to improve some things ... in order to get to the 2010 world cup and to play a similar role here . " " possession and one-touch passes are the key in soccer , and that at high speed and under stress .
spain showed that it masters it very well , " loew said . " the best team won " german newspapers too were full of praise for spain , saying the side outclassed the germans on every count . " the artists from spain would n't let themselves be bullied around , " munich-based sueddeutsche zeitung wrote . " after a strong start germany lost their way . "
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : there was no stopping fernando torres as he scored in the 33rd minute " title dreams dashed , " the hamburger morgenpost wrote .
" after 60 minutes of sleep-inducing football and lots of defensive problems the team came to life too late .
thanks to lehmann because it could have been worse . "
germany 's most popular television soccer analyst , guenter netzer said in the end the best team won on sunday .
" congratulations to spain but also i tip my hat in respect to germany for even reaching the final , " netzer , who helped west germany win the european crown in 1972 , said .
" that 's a great success for the team .
spain were the best team throughout the tournament .
they played the best football , " he said .
" they showed us how limited we are , they showed us how to play soccer .
spain showed we have a lot of room to improve . "
germans started well , with miroslav klose missing a glorious opportunity after just four minutes , but then spain soon started to take control and on 33 minutes torres put spain ahead . germany had their chances in the second half but spain remained dangerous and held their nerve to win the championship 1-0 .
one mistake too many germany had come to euro 2008 with lots of ambitions but failed to make a lasting impression apart from a classy 3-2 against portugal in the quarter-finals .
the team was outwitted in a 2-1 defeat against croatia and outplayed for most of the match in the semi-final with turkey where only the famed fighting spirit earned them a 3-2 win .
captain michael ballack scored two goals but was unable to stamp his authority on the team as he finished runner-up for the 10th time in his career .
and there were only flashes of genius from the likes of lukas podolski or bastian schweinsteiger .
" it is always disappointing to reach and final and then lose , " ballack said on sunday , adding that the team " made one or two errors too many . "
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : ballack , left , and spain 's marco senna fight for the ball on sunday , the germans fumbled once too often with the ball , their play marked by flawed passes and defense lapses - a weakness ruthlessly exploited by their technically superior opponents .
midfielder thomas hitzlsperger too said his side 's inaccuracy proved their undoing .
" when you make mistakes at this level you get punished .
the spanish side are so good , so you ca n't afford to make any mistakes , " hitzlsperger said .
" we made too many that is why we lost . "
crushed fans the defeat led to disappointment for millions of german fans raring to celebrate their side 's triumph on sunday night .
fernando torres ' 33rd-minute winner silenced the more than 600,000 fans who crowded into the public viewing area near the brandenburg gate in berlin .
spain 's complete domination from midway in the second half onwards until the final whistle was greeted with admiration .
the final whistle resulted in no trouble as police in berlin and elsewhere said the fans left without incident . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : germany 's euro party ended with a whimper on sunday many fans even left before the final whistle , subdued or to beat the crowd on the way home as there was nothing to celebrate when the henri delaunay trophy was eventually given to spain captain iker casillas and not ballack . apart from the more than 600,000 in berlin , 70,000 fans watched the game in munich , frankfurt recorded 50,000 fans and hamburg 42,000 . despite the disappointment , hundreds of thousands of fans are set to turn up in berlin once again on monday when the team presents itself at the fan zone - empty-handed just like after the 2006 world cup third-place finish . uphill battle for loew coach loew now has his work cut out as he looks to preparing the team for the 2010 world cup in south africa . loew 's ideal is a fast game similar to that of spain , the netherlands or russia , but he faces an uphill battle because change must also come from an overly-hyped bundesliga . the showings of german clubs in europe highlights the problem , with bayer leverkusen and bayern munich blown away by andrei arshavin and his uefa cup-winning zenit st petersburg teammates .
germany last won a european title from bayern munich in 2001 and has not had a team in a continental final since 2002 .
munich has shown some class and a new trend in the league could start there as well now that former national coach juergen klinsmann starts his job as munich coach .
klinsmann revolutionized the germany team during his reign 2004-2006 and his assistant loew is now continuing his legacy as boss .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : loew faces challenges as he looks towards the 2010 world cup " jogi loew should continue his way , " german soccer icon franz beckenbauer wrote in his monday column for the bild daily .
apart from goalkeeper jens lehmann , whose future is unclear , loew has a core of a team which has now played two major events , some like ballack and defender christoph metzelder even featuring in the 2002 world cup final .
podolski and schweinsteiger will only be in their mid-20s by the time of the 2010 world cup , and newcomers who were n't quite good enough to make the euro squad - such as marko marin , jermaine jones and patrick helmes - could by then be regulars .
german chancellor angela merkel , who was in the stadium for the final said the team was gradually building on its play .
" third at the world cup and now second , that is something .
maybe we will improve again in south africa , " merkel said . " i told ballack that we have to wait a little longer until we can celebrate together , but that we are slowly getting there . " loew and his boys will have two excellent opportunities to check on any possible improvement - on october 11 and almost a year later on october 10 , 2009 , in the two world cup qualifying matches against russia . dw staff -lrb- sp -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

" we want to bring forward two components : a very intensive training on the pitch and off it as well where we want to move them forward as humans , " klinsmann told the bundesliga champions ' club website .
" the coaching staff is excited , neither real madrid nor barcelona have this .
we are very proud of it . "
klinsmann was mainly referring to the revamped player facilities , but there is far more to it then a few rooms as bayern have set their sites on international fame and fortune after dominating in germany with three league and cup doubles in the past four seasons .
a top placing in the champions league , where munich has been in the final since lifting the trophy in 2001 , as a key aim .
klinsmann revived the german national team during his reign 2004-2006 and then in january signed a two-year contract for munich to do exactly the same there .
klinsmann brought in to introduce new culture bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : klinsmann is the man to change the way bayern works " we took this step deliberately .
we needed a man who dares to make changes .
juergen is the right man for that , " said chairman karl-heinz rummenigge .
" not even i know what he will still change .
but this is a new culture for the bundesliga . "
after overhauling the team last summer by hiring the likes of france star franck ribery , italy striker luca toni and germany forward miroslav klose , munich now want klinsmann to bring the coaching structures up to modern standard .
klinsmann , who played for munich 1995-1997 , brought sweeping changes to the national team with new methods including american fitness gurus and has the same in mind in munich .
klinsmann 's team in munich includes mexican assistant coach martin vasquez , former player christian nerlinger is somewhere between the team and hoeness , and former bundesliga goalkeeper philipp laux ready to work with frustrated players as a sports psychologist .
working days to be extended bayern players faced an eight-hour day with training , lunch and wellness areas in the new facilities from monday onwards .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : klinsi 's techniques with germany will be used at bayern dutchman mark van bommel was the most prominent player to get a first taste of klinsmann 's training , while ribery , toni , turkey 's hamit altintop and the germans klose , bastian schweinsteiger , lukas podolski , philipp lahm and the other euro international enjoyed a holiday before starting pre-season training .
klinsmann watched germany lose the final 1-0 to spain on sunday in vienna and admitted that spain were " considerably better . "
spain 's philosophy of attacking football with neat one-touch passes matches exactly that of klinsmann , who will try to introduce it in germany - from which the national team could profit as well . dw staff / dpa news agency -lrb- nda -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

michael reagan , a talk-show host and columnist in the us , is presenting his ideas in berlin on monday , june 30 . while ronald reagan 's famous speech at the brandenburg gate on june 12 , 1987 has entered the history books , the only commemoration of it is a few words on a plaque near the gate .
his son would like for berlin to see a commemorative object put up in berlin to mark what he sees as his father 's contribution to ending the cold war . " we can envisage a large statue or bust , " reagan , 63 , told the german daily bild .
michael reagan is the founder the reagan legacy foundation , a non-profit organization whose goal is to promote his father 's ideas and memorialize his accomplishments .
ronald reagan died in 2004 . michael reagan is in berlin to put forward his plan and leading a discussion about a commemoration at berlin 's cafe einstein , a restaurant frequented by journalists . " we are just at the beginning of the process , " he said .
" our foundation believes that an appropriate monument for president reagan 's speech at the brandenburg gate is of great historical value for berliners . " ' tear down this wall ! ' bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : reagan had addressed his remarks in the speece to soviet leader mikhail gorbachev , right .
ronald reagan made his historic speech during a five-hour visit to berlin on a podium near the brandenburg gate , which was then cut off from west berlin by the berlin wall .
during the speech made in front of tens of thousands of west berlin residents , reagan addressed the then-soviet leader when he said : " mr. gorbachev , open this gate !
mr. gorbachev , tear down this wall ! " the berlin wall actually did fall 881 days later , an event that shocked the world . " i would welcome a visible remembrance of this great friend of the germans , " said frank henkel , secretary-general of the conservative christian democrats in berlin .
" i can image a large commemorative plaque with that quotation between the new us embassy and the brandenburg gate . " however , during president reagan 's visit , police were faced with massive protests against his rearmament policies .

she was not ill , but afraid of having to go to a nursing home . robert kusch told reporters that the woman , from the city of wuerzburg , identified in press reports as bettina sch . , took a tranquilizer and malaria medication she obtained herself to end her life on saturday .
in order to prove that the woman , a former x-ray technician , had wanted to die , kusch showed reporters interviews with her which he had videotaped . " i have campaigned for a long time for self-determination until the very end , " he said to reporters in hamburg on monday , june 30 .
he said making one 's own decisions about life and death was a " central pillar of a modern society " and that determining one 's own end of life should not be something " only theoretically discussed in seminars . " robert kusch already stirred controversy in march of this year when he unveiled his " suicide machine , " a device that could deliver a deadly infusion of potassium chloride .
however , in this case , the machine was not used . sharp criticism the german hospice foundation has expressed indignation over kusch 's action , saying he is primarily interested in drawing attention to himself . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : robert kusch and his " suicide machine " " there is a right to life , there is also a right to die , but there is not a right to kill , " said eugen brysch , the foundation 's director , accusing kusch of abuse " people 's fears of old-age care " out of a " deep sense of narcissism . " according to german law , it is not illegal if someone is present at a person 's suicide , brysch said .
however , obtaining lethal medication for that individuals does violate the legal code .
brysch said that the upper house of parliament , the bundesrat , would discuss on friday a draft law that would ban commercial suicide services . policiticians and church leaders have also sharply criticized kusch .
green party politician and vice-president of the bundestag , katrin göring-eckardt , called kusch 's action " completely inacceptable . " the protestant bishop of hamburg , maria jepsen , told the epd news agency that her church rejects kusch 's approach , saying the form of assisted suicide he is endorsing violates human dignity and christian responsibility . hamburg 's prosecutor 's office has begun a preliminary investigation into kusch 's action . dw staff -lrb- jam -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

michael reagan , a talk-show host and columnist in the us , is presenting his ideas in berlin on monday , june 30 . while ronald reagan 's famous speech at the brandenburg gate on june 12 , 1987 has entered the history books , the only commemoration of it is a few words on a plaque near the gate .
his son would like for berlin to see a commemorative object put up in berlin to mark what he sees as his father 's contribution to ending the cold war . " we can envisage a large statue or bust , " reagan , 63 , told the german daily bild .
michael reagan is the founder the reagan legacy foundation , a non-profit organization whose goal is to promote his father 's ideas and memorialize his accomplishments .
ronald reagan died in 2004 . michael reagan is in berlin to put forward his plan and leading a discussion about a commemoration at berlin 's cafe einstein , a restaurant frequented by journalists . " we are just at the beginning of the process , " he said .
" our foundation believes that an appropriate monument for president reagan 's speech at the brandenburg gate is of great historical value for berliners . " ' tear down this wall ! ' bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : reagan had addressed his remarks in the speece to soviet leader mikhail gorbachev , right .
ronald reagan made his historic speech during a five-hour visit to berlin on a podium near the brandenburg gate , which was then cut off from west berlin by the berlin wall .
during the speech made in front of tens of thousands of west berlin residents , reagan addressed the then-soviet leader when he said : " mr. gorbachev , open this gate !
mr. gorbachev , tear down this wall ! " the berlin wall actually did fall 881 days later , an event that shocked the world . " i would welcome a visible remembrance of this great friend of the germans , " said frank henkel , secretary-general of the conservative christian democrats in berlin .
" i can image a large commemorative plaque with that quotation between the new us embassy and the brandenburg gate . " however , during president reagan 's visit , police were faced with massive protests against his rearmament policies .
large parts of kreuzberg district , a traditional enclave of the left in west berlin , were sealed off to prevent rioting . an editorial monday in the left-wing daily neues deutschland said reagan 's terms in office were marked by military build-up , the " star wars " missile defense project , weapons deals with iran , and the invasion of grenada .

that 's just fine , says dw 's stefan nestler . the tournament 's best team is european champion .
enough said .
the spanish have overcome their tournament trauma and have finally been rewarded for their fascinating soccer .
they were the strongest of all 16 teams .
they offered refreshing , modern offensive soccer at the highest technical level .
they did so not just in a couple of matches , but throughout the entire tournament . the spanish were simply too much to handle for the german team .
in fact , the defeat should have been much clearer .
apart from 15 good minutes at the beginning , ballack and co. were completely disappointing . from a german point of view , the final was almost a logical end to the past three weeks . the " mountain tour " ended up in several valleys before getting stuck just below the summit .
a promising start against poland was followed by an unacceptable defeat against croatia .
a rather weak austria helped to build up the germans , who outdid themselves in the quarter-final match against portugal , one of the tournament favorites . in the semi-final , germany shrank back to a team that made the most out of very little .
it clearly was n't enough to surprise , let along defeat the outstanding spanish . what 's true for the team is also true for individual players .
no one was constantly good and all had their weak moments .
goalkeeper jens lehmann fluttered more than the ball up to the semi-final .
defender christoph metzelder 's beard might have grown during the tournament , but he did n't get any faster .
per mertesacker also seemed too slow too many times .
midfielder michael ballack was not at his best in several games , including the final .
people should be able to expect more of a top player than that . germany 's much-praised strikers , miroslav klose and mario gomez , did n't manage to achieve much .
the only ones that fulfilled expectations - at least to some extent - were bastian schweinsteiger , lukas podolski and philipp lahm .
but even they did n't shine . germany 's reaching the final should not cover up the fact that the german team is able to do much more than it showed during euro 2008 . the team should focus on strengths that have been developed in recent years : to base attacks with quick combination moves on a sound defense and close the deal decisively . the spanish played like this in the final .
the germans did n't . stefan nestler covers sports for dw-radio -lrb- win -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

the court has not yet set a date to rule on the challenges . koehler 's functions are mainly ceremonial , but he has sometimes used his limited powers to block government legislation . the lisbon treaty which was rejected by irish voters in a referendum recently , plunging the bloc into constitutional crisis , is meant to streamline the eu 's institutions , simplify decision-making and give the eu more clout on the world stage . it also provides for a new double majority voting mechanism seen as essential if the 27-member bloc is to expand .
all 27 member states must approve the text before it can enter into force . koehler 's move has put germany in a tricky situation given that the european heavyweight had pressed eu nations to ratify the treaty as soon as possible after the irish rejection . ireland was the only eu member to hold a referendum on the treaty , in all other eu nations , the decision will be taken by the parliament .
nineteen nations have ratified the embattled lisbon treaty in parliament so far , most recently britain . challenge from the left in germany , both houses of parliament passed the law ratifiying the lisbon treaty with the two-thirds majority needed earlier this year . but it needs president koehler 's signature for the law to come into force . however , the lisbon treaty faces a challenge in germany by the left , a radical left-wing opposition party , and a member of the ultra-conservative christian social union . the left says the treaty infringes the principle of democracy and the rights of members of the german parliament .
it sees the treaty as giving too much power to the european council , the council of the heads of state and government , at the expense of national parliaments and the european parliament . in 2006 , koehler also delayed in signing off on a forerunner of the lisbon treaty .
that constitutional treaty subsequently collapsed when it was rejected by dutch and french voters . dw staff -lrb- sp -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

she was not ill , but afraid of having to go to a nursing home . robert kusch told reporters that the woman , from the city of wuerzburg , identified in press reports as bettina sch . , took a tranquilizer and malaria medication she obtained herself to end her life on saturday .
in order to prove that the woman , a former x-ray technician , had wanted to die , kusch showed reporters interviews with her which he had videotaped . " i have campaigned for a long time for self-determination until the very end , " he said to reporters in hamburg on monday , june 30 .
he said making one 's own decisions about life and death was a " central pillar of a modern society " and that determining one 's own end of life should not be something " only theoretically discussed in seminars . " robert kusch already stirred controversy in march of this year when he unveiled his " suicide machine , " a device that could deliver a deadly infusion of potassium chloride .
however , in this case , the machine was not used . sharp criticism the german hospice foundation has expressed indignation over kusch 's action , saying he is primarily interested in drawing attention to himself . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : robert kusch and his " suicide machine " " there is a right to life , there is also a right to die , but there is not a right to kill , " said eugen brysch , the foundation 's director , accusing kusch of abuse " people 's fears of old-age care " out of a " deep sense of narcissism . " according to german law , it is not illegal if someone is present at a person 's suicide , brysch said .
however , obtaining lethal medication for that individuals does violate the legal code .
brysch said that the upper house of parliament , the bundesrat , would discuss on friday a draft law that would ban commercial suicide services . policiticians and church leaders have also sharply criticized kusch .
green party politician and vice-president of the bundestag , katrin göring-eckardt , called kusch 's action " completely inacceptable . " the protestant bishop of hamburg , maria jepsen , told the epd news agency that her church rejects kusch 's approach , saying the form of assisted suicide he is endorsing violates human dignity and christian responsibility . hamburg 's prosecutor 's office has begun a preliminary investigation into kusch 's action . dw staff -lrb- jam -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

midfielder bastian schweinsteiger appeared to cries of " schweini schweini " from many of the young girls among the crowd as captain michael ballack and stars , lukas podolski and miroslav klose too were cheered on enthusiastically .
" the atmosphere in germany was fantastic .
we hope to bring home a cup in the future , " schweinsteiger , the popular bayern munich midfielder , said .
" you are the best " read one of the countless banners in the crowd of some 300,000 and some fans had even brought a replica of the cup with the writing " thank you " on it .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : ballack waves to his supporters " we would have not made it without the fans .
it is important for our young team , " ballack said .
" it is great for us that we could delight the fans even though we lost .
it is an amazing feeling and gives me goose bumps , " goalkeeper jens lehmann said .
germany full of praise for spain despite not always shining on the pitch , the german team had created another soccer frenzy in germany which sometimes came close to that from the 2006 home world cup in which germany finished third .
hundreds of thousands of fans watched the games from austria and switzerland in the country 's public viewing areas , with more than 500,000 on hand in berlin alone for the german 3-2 semi-final win over turkey and the final .
the fans at least partly cheered up the players , but no complaints were heard and read in the country after germany not simply lost the euro 2008 final 1-0 to spain but was comprehensively outplayed on sunday in vienna .
" spain 's victory .
the best team wins the tournament , " was the front page headline of the sueddeutsche zeitung -lrb- sz -rrb- daily under a photo of match-winner fernando torres and other players holding the cup in the air .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : spanish players holding up the euro trophy the sz was just one paper which named spain " the clearly better team " and praised its " brilliant passing " which kept the german defense on their toes .
the paper said that " soccer was the winner " on the night as the german euphoria somewhat hid the fact that the team had only rarely showed its class in the six matches in austria and switzerland .
former germany coach juergen klinsmann said that spain was " considerably better " on the night and german soccer icon franz beckenbauer said in his monday column for the bild daily that " spain dominated the tournament from the first match ... until yesterday 's final . "
other papers acknowledged as well that the better team had won but also looked back at germany 's run to the final .
" the end of the dream .
we are still proud of you , but spain was the better team , " said daily bild .
the hamburger abendblatt said : " only second - but it was still nice . "
slowly getting there the abendblatt recalled the soccer frenzy which had gripped the nation like at the 2006 home world cup and looked ahead , saying " maybe the happy end follows in 2010 " at the world cup in south africa , as germany was third at the 2006 world cup and now second at euro .
german chancellor angela merkel struck a similar note after attending the game in the vienna stadium .
" third at the world cup and now second , that is something .
maybe we will improve again in south africa , " said merkel .
" i told ballack that we have to wait a little longer until we can celebrate together but that we are slowly getting there . "
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : german soccer fans at the berlin fan mile large numbers of germans had celebrated in the fan zones ahead of the match , with the berlin zone closed some three hours before the kickoff as it was filled to its capacity with more than 600,000 fans .
" the fans left the fan zone very quietly , very peacefully and in very well-behaved way , " said a berlin fan zone official after the match .
that was not quite the case in the eastern part of the country , with incidents recorded in magdeburg and other towns when several hundred troublemakers rioted in city centers and fought police .
police said on monday that 25 officers were injured and 60 people arrested .
berlin saw 59 arrests , but , according to a spokesman , all for minor offences . dpa news agency -lrb- sp -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?
dw-world.de germany to learn from euro mistakes for future success disappointment in germany at losing the euro 2008 final gave way monday to admiration for the superior spanish side and hope that coach joachim loew can raise the team 's performance for the 2010 world cup .

that 's just fine , says dw 's stefan nestler . the tournament 's best team is european champion .
enough said .
the spanish have overcome their tournament trauma and have finally been rewarded for their fascinating soccer .
they were the strongest of all 16 teams .
they offered refreshing , modern offensive soccer at the highest technical level .
they did so not just in a couple of matches , but throughout the entire tournament . the spanish were simply too much to handle for the german team .
in fact , the defeat should have been much clearer .
apart from 15 good minutes at the beginning , ballack and co. were completely disappointing . from a german point of view , the final was almost a logical end to the past three weeks . the " mountain tour " ended up in several valleys before getting stuck just below the summit .
a promising start against poland was followed by an unacceptable defeat against croatia .
a rather weak austria helped to build up the germans , who outdid themselves in the quarter-final match against portugal , one of the tournament favorites . in the semi-final , germany shrank back to a team that made the most out of very little .
it clearly was n't enough to surprise , let along defeat the outstanding spanish . what 's true for the team is also true for individual players .
no one was constantly good and all had their weak moments .
goalkeeper jens lehmann fluttered more than the ball up to the semi-final .
defender christoph metzelder 's beard might have grown during the tournament , but he did n't get any faster .
per mertesacker also seemed too slow too many times .
midfielder michael ballack was not at his best in several games , including the final .
people should be able to expect more of a top player than that . germany 's much-praised strikers , miroslav klose and mario gomez , did n't manage to achieve much .
the only ones that fulfilled expectations - at least to some extent - were bastian schweinsteiger , lukas podolski and philipp lahm .
but even they did n't shine . germany 's reaching the final should not cover up the fact that the german team is able to do much more than it showed during euro 2008 . the team should focus on strengths that have been developed in recent years : to base attacks with quick combination moves on a sound defense and close the deal decisively . the spanish played like this in the final .

michael reagan , a talk-show host and columnist in the us , is presenting his ideas in berlin on monday , june 30 . while ronald reagan 's famous speech at the brandenburg gate on june 12 , 1987 has entered the history books , the only commemoration of it is a few words on a plaque near the gate .
his son would like for berlin to see a commemorative object put up in berlin to mark what he sees as his father 's contribution to ending the cold war . " we can envisage a large statue or bust , " reagan , 63 , told the german daily bild .
michael reagan is the founder the reagan legacy foundation , a non-profit organization whose goal is to promote his father 's ideas and memorialize his accomplishments .
ronald reagan died in 2004 . michael reagan is in berlin to put forward his plan and leading a discussion about a commemoration at berlin 's cafe einstein , a restaurant frequented by journalists . " we are just at the beginning of the process , " he said .
" our foundation believes that an appropriate monument for president reagan 's speech at the brandenburg gate is of great historical value for berliners . " ' tear down this wall ! ' bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : reagan had addressed his remarks in the speece to soviet leader mikhail gorbachev , right .
ronald reagan made his historic speech during a five-hour visit to berlin on a podium near the brandenburg gate , which was then cut off from west berlin by the berlin wall .
during the speech made in front of tens of thousands of west berlin residents , reagan addressed the then-soviet leader when he said : " mr. gorbachev , open this gate !
mr. gorbachev , tear down this wall ! " the berlin wall actually did fall 881 days later , an event that shocked the world . " i would welcome a visible remembrance of this great friend of the germans , " said frank henkel , secretary-general of the conservative christian democrats in berlin .
" i can image a large commemorative plaque with that quotation between the new us embassy and the brandenburg gate . " however , during president reagan 's visit , police were faced with massive protests against his rearmament policies .
large parts of kreuzberg district , a traditional enclave of the left in west berlin , were sealed off to prevent rioting . an editorial monday in the left-wing daily neues deutschland said reagan 's terms in office were marked by military build-up , the " star wars " missile defense project , weapons deals with iran , and the invasion of grenada .
the paper said reagan already has a us navy aircraft carrier named after him , which is more appropriate than a commemorate plaque or statue in berlin . dw staff -lrb- jam -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

" i think we have to recognize the greater quality of the spanish team today , " germany coach joachim loew said after his side lost 1-0 to spain . " it -lrb- the defeat -rrb- will encourage us to continue working over the next two years and to improve some things ... in order to get to the 2010 world cup and to play a similar role here . " " possession and one-touch passes are the key in soccer , and that at high speed and under stress .
spain showed that it masters it very well , " loew said . " the best team won " german newspapers too were full of praise for spain , saying the side outclassed the germans on every count . " the artists from spain would n't let themselves be bullied around , " munich-based sueddeutsche zeitung wrote . " after a strong start germany lost their way . "
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : there was no stopping fernando torres as he scored in the 33rd minute " title dreams dashed , " the hamburger morgenpost wrote .
" after 60 minutes of sleep-inducing football and lots of defensive problems the team came to life too late .
thanks to lehmann because it could have been worse . "
germany 's most popular television soccer analyst , guenter netzer said in the end the best team won on sunday .
" congratulations to spain but also i tip my hat in respect to germany for even reaching the final , " netzer , who helped west germany win the european crown in 1972 , said .
" that 's a great success for the team .
spain were the best team throughout the tournament .
they played the best football , " he said .
" they showed us how limited we are , they showed us how to play soccer .
spain showed we have a lot of room to improve . "
germans started well , with miroslav klose missing a glorious opportunity after just four minutes , but then spain soon started to take control and on 33 minutes torres put spain ahead . germany had their chances in the second half but spain remained dangerous and held their nerve to win the championship 1-0 .
one mistake too many germany had come to euro 2008 with lots of ambitions but failed to make a lasting impression apart from a classy 3-2 against portugal in the quarter-finals .
the team was outwitted in a 2-1 defeat against croatia and outplayed for most of the match in the semi-final with turkey where only the famed fighting spirit earned them a 3-2 win .
captain michael ballack scored two goals but was unable to stamp his authority on the team as he finished runner-up for the 10th time in his career .
and there were only flashes of genius from the likes of lukas podolski or bastian schweinsteiger .
" it is always disappointing to reach and final and then lose , " ballack said on sunday , adding that the team " made one or two errors too many . "
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : ballack , left , and spain 's marco senna fight for the ball on sunday , the germans fumbled once too often with the ball , their play marked by flawed passes and defense lapses - a weakness ruthlessly exploited by their technically superior opponents .
midfielder thomas hitzlsperger too said his side 's inaccuracy proved their undoing .
" when you make mistakes at this level you get punished .
the spanish side are so good , so you ca n't afford to make any mistakes , " hitzlsperger said .
" we made too many that is why we lost . "
crushed fans the defeat led to disappointment for millions of german fans raring to celebrate their side 's triumph on sunday night .
fernando torres ' 33rd-minute winner silenced the more than 600,000 fans who crowded into the public viewing area near the brandenburg gate in berlin .
spain 's complete domination from midway in the second half onwards until the final whistle was greeted with admiration .
the final whistle resulted in no trouble as police in berlin and elsewhere said the fans left without incident . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : germany 's euro party ended with a whimper on sunday many fans even left before the final whistle , subdued or to beat the crowd on the way home as there was nothing to celebrate when the henri delaunay trophy was eventually given to spain captain iker casillas and not ballack . apart from the more than 600,000 in berlin , 70,000 fans watched the game in munich , frankfurt recorded 50,000 fans and hamburg 42,000 . despite the disappointment , hundreds of thousands of fans are set to turn up in berlin once again on monday when the team presents itself at the fan zone - empty-handed just like after the 2006 world cup third-place finish . uphill battle for loew coach loew now has his work cut out as he looks to preparing the team for the 2010 world cup in south africa . loew 's ideal is a fast game similar to that of spain , the netherlands or russia , but he faces an uphill battle because change must also come from an overly-hyped bundesliga . the showings of german clubs in europe highlights the problem , with bayer leverkusen and bayern munich blown away by andrei arshavin and his uefa cup-winning zenit st petersburg teammates .
germany last won a european title from bayern munich in 2001 and has not had a team in a continental final since 2002 .
munich has shown some class and a new trend in the league could start there as well now that former national coach juergen klinsmann starts his job as munich coach .
klinsmann revolutionized the germany team during his reign 2004-2006 and his assistant loew is now continuing his legacy as boss .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : loew faces challenges as he looks towards the 2010 world cup " jogi loew should continue his way , " german soccer icon franz beckenbauer wrote in his monday column for the bild daily .
apart from goalkeeper jens lehmann , whose future is unclear , loew has a core of a team which has now played two major events , some like ballack and defender christoph metzelder even featuring in the 2002 world cup final .
podolski and schweinsteiger will only be in their mid-20s by the time of the 2010 world cup , and newcomers who were n't quite good enough to make the euro squad - such as marko marin , jermaine jones and patrick helmes - could by then be regulars .
german chancellor angela merkel , who was in the stadium for the final said the team was gradually building on its play .
" third at the world cup and now second , that is something .
maybe we will improve again in south africa , " merkel said . " i told ballack that we have to wait a little longer until we can celebrate together , but that we are slowly getting there . " loew and his boys will have two excellent opportunities to check on any possible improvement - on october 11 and almost a year later on october 10 , 2009 , in the two world cup qualifying matches against russia . dw staff -lrb- sp -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

deutsche welle 's wolfgang van kann has these thoughts . that was it - the 13th european championship .

most of all , however , the austrians and the swiss just did n't quite come through as hosts like the germans did two years ago . while the germans had opened their doors and hearts to guests from around the world , the austrians and swiss withdrew into their own four walls and observed the whole spectacle with suspicion . the fans did n't feel like it was " a time to make friends , " like the german motto in 2006 said . nevertheless , soccer was the focal point and , without a doubt , we experienced the best european soccer championship of all time .
the triumph of the defensive was celebrated in portugal in 2004 , but the euro 2008 was definitely the most offense-driven international tournament fans have ever seen . striking was the name of the game .
those who just tried not to lose a match were punished in the end - especially greece , the 2004 european champions .
statistics show that there were more scoring chances in the euro 2008 than in any other tournament and the final count of 77 goals in 31 games speaks for itself . great soccer , good sports bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : spain can celebrate ; uefa needs to look at what worked and what did n't for the most part , we saw beautiful , fast soccer played by real teams working together .
of course the top teams have their stars , but stars alone ca n't win a match these days .
they can only shine within a team that functions as a whole and presents itself as a single unit .

european soccer is apparently going through a generational shift .
the old stars have had their time in the limelight and new names are come to the fore - like russia 's arshavin and pavlyuchenko or turkey 's nihat . what 's more , a strong start evidently does n't mean everything in a tournament and sending in the b-team can only backfire .
being the favorite is often too heavy a burden .

next to the 2006 world champions and vice-world champions , italy and france , the biggest loser in the euro 2008 is uefa itself . uefa stumbles that may seem paradoxical , considering the 700-million-euro profit the european soccer association made from the event .
still , there are a few scratches on the shiny surface . of course , uefa could n't do anything about the bad weather that led to an embarrassing interruption of the global television broadcast .
but uefa is responsible for stipulating that all the cables had to run through vienna and that there was no viable backup . it 's also uefa 's fault that the quality of the grass was n't great and apparently had n't been tested under extreme conditions . uefa 's regulation overkill ruffled feathers in the austrian and swiss business communities and came to a head on the pitch with the completely senseless and unbearable patronizing of coaches on the sidelines - something germany coach joachim loew experienced personally . and finally , tv viewers felt they got the short end of the stick when they found out that uefa had prevented images it did n't like - such as those of a streaker or illegal fireworks in a stadium - from being broadcast . the 13th european championship is now history .

what kind of a tournament did it turn out to be ?
deutsche welle 's wolfgang van kann has these thoughts . that was it - the 13th european championship .
and , for the germans at least , it was n't quite the summer fairytale the 2006 world cup was . the weather gods were partly responsible for spoiling it , as were the small stadiums , which could n't draw as many fans into the two host countries .
most of all , however , the austrians and the swiss just did n't quite come through as hosts like the germans did two years ago . while the germans had opened their doors and hearts to guests from around the world , the austrians and swiss withdrew into their own four walls and observed the whole spectacle with suspicion . the fans did n't feel like it was " a time to make friends , " like the german motto in 2006 said . nevertheless , soccer was the focal point and , without a doubt , we experienced the best european soccer championship of all time .
the triumph of the defensive was celebrated in portugal in 2004 , but the euro 2008 was definitely the most offense-driven international tournament fans have ever seen . striking was the name of the game .
those who just tried not to lose a match were punished in the end - especially greece , the 2004 european champions .
statistics show that there were more scoring chances in the euro 2008 than in any other tournament and the final count of 77 goals in 31 games speaks for itself . great soccer , good sports bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : spain can celebrate ; uefa needs to look at what worked and what did n't for the most part , we saw beautiful , fast soccer played by real teams working together .
of course the top teams have their stars , but stars alone ca n't win a match these days .
they can only shine within a team that functions as a whole and presents itself as a single unit .
the alpine event marked the continuation of a trend that has been evident for some time . the euro was also quite sportsmanlike ; there was little hostility on the pitch and just three relatively painless red cards . what did we learn ?
european soccer is apparently going through a generational shift .
the old stars have had their time in the limelight and new names are come to the fore - like russia 's arshavin and pavlyuchenko or turkey 's nihat . what 's more , a strong start evidently does n't mean everything in a tournament and sending in the b-team can only backfire .

next to the 2006 world champions and vice-world champions , italy and france , the biggest loser in the euro 2008 is uefa itself . uefa stumbles that may seem paradoxical , considering the 700-million-euro profit the european soccer association made from the event .
still , there are a few scratches on the shiny surface . of course , uefa could n't do anything about the bad weather that led to an embarrassing interruption of the global television broadcast .

" i think we have to recognize the greater quality of the spanish team today , " germany coach joachim loew said after his side lost 1-0 to spain . " it -lrb- the defeat -rrb- will encourage us to continue working over the next two years and to improve some things ... in order to get to the 2010 world cup and to play a similar role here . " " possession and one-touch passes are the key in soccer , and that at high speed and under stress .
spain showed that it masters it very well , " loew said . " the best team won " german newspapers too were full of praise for spain , saying the side outclassed the germans on every count . " the artists from spain would n't let themselves be bullied around , " munich-based sueddeutsche zeitung wrote . " after a strong start germany lost their way . "
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : there was no stopping fernando torres as he scored in the 33rd minute " title dreams dashed , " the hamburger morgenpost wrote .
" after 60 minutes of sleep-inducing football and lots of defensive problems the team came to life too late .
thanks to lehmann because it could have been worse . "
germany 's most popular television soccer analyst , guenter netzer said in the end the best team won on sunday .
" congratulations to spain but also i tip my hat in respect to germany for even reaching the final , " netzer , who helped west germany win the european crown in 1972 , said .
" that 's a great success for the team .
spain were the best team throughout the tournament .
they played the best football , " he said .
" they showed us how limited we are , they showed us how to play soccer .
spain showed we have a lot of room to improve . "
germans started well , with miroslav klose missing a glorious opportunity after just four minutes , but then spain soon started to take control and on 33 minutes torres put spain ahead . germany had their chances in the second half but spain remained dangerous and held their nerve to win the championship 1-0 .
one mistake too many germany had come to euro 2008 with lots of ambitions but failed to make a lasting impression apart from a classy 3-2 against portugal in the quarter-finals .
the team was outwitted in a 2-1 defeat against croatia and outplayed for most of the match in the semi-final with turkey where only the famed fighting spirit earned them a 3-2 win .
captain michael ballack scored two goals but was unable to stamp his authority on the team as he finished runner-up for the 10th time in his career .
and there were only flashes of genius from the likes of lukas podolski or bastian schweinsteiger .
" it is always disappointing to reach and final and then lose , " ballack said on sunday , adding that the team " made one or two errors too many . "
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : ballack , left , and spain 's marco senna fight for the ball on sunday , the germans fumbled once too often with the ball , their play marked by flawed passes and defense lapses - a weakness ruthlessly exploited by their technically superior opponents .
midfielder thomas hitzlsperger too said his side 's inaccuracy proved their undoing .
" when you make mistakes at this level you get punished .
the spanish side are so good , so you ca n't afford to make any mistakes , " hitzlsperger said .
" we made too many that is why we lost . "
crushed fans the defeat led to disappointment for millions of german fans raring to celebrate their side 's triumph on sunday night .
fernando torres ' 33rd-minute winner silenced the more than 600,000 fans who crowded into the public viewing area near the brandenburg gate in berlin .
spain 's complete domination from midway in the second half onwards until the final whistle was greeted with admiration .
the final whistle resulted in no trouble as police in berlin and elsewhere said the fans left without incident . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : germany 's euro party ended with a whimper on sunday many fans even left before the final whistle , subdued or to beat the crowd on the way home as there was nothing to celebrate when the henri delaunay trophy was eventually given to spain captain iker casillas and not ballack . apart from the more than 600,000 in berlin , 70,000 fans watched the game in munich , frankfurt recorded 50,000 fans and hamburg 42,000 . despite the disappointment , hundreds of thousands of fans are set to turn up in berlin once again on monday when the team presents itself at the fan zone - empty-handed just like after the 2006 world cup third-place finish . uphill battle for loew coach loew now has his work cut out as he looks to preparing the team for the 2010 world cup in south africa . loew 's ideal is a fast game similar to that of spain , the netherlands or russia , but he faces an uphill battle because change must also come from an overly-hyped bundesliga . the showings of german clubs in europe highlights the problem , with bayer leverkusen and bayern munich blown away by andrei arshavin and his uefa cup-winning zenit st petersburg teammates .
germany last won a european title from bayern munich in 2001 and has not had a team in a continental final since 2002 .
munich has shown some class and a new trend in the league could start there as well now that former national coach juergen klinsmann starts his job as munich coach .
klinsmann revolutionized the germany team during his reign 2004-2006 and his assistant loew is now continuing his legacy as boss .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : loew faces challenges as he looks towards the 2010 world cup " jogi loew should continue his way , " german soccer icon franz beckenbauer wrote in his monday column for the bild daily .
apart from goalkeeper jens lehmann , whose future is unclear , loew has a core of a team which has now played two major events , some like ballack and defender christoph metzelder even featuring in the 2002 world cup final .
podolski and schweinsteiger will only be in their mid-20s by the time of the 2010 world cup , and newcomers who were n't quite good enough to make the euro squad - such as marko marin , jermaine jones and patrick helmes - could by then be regulars .
german chancellor angela merkel , who was in the stadium for the final said the team was gradually building on its play .
" third at the world cup and now second , that is something .
maybe we will improve again in south africa , " merkel said . " i told ballack that we have to wait a little longer until we can celebrate together , but that we are slowly getting there . " loew and his boys will have two excellent opportunities to check on any possible improvement - on october 11 and almost a year later on october 10 , 2009 , in the two world cup qualifying matches against russia . dw staff -lrb- sp -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

" heister told deutsche presse-agentur dpa that a german judge denied permission to tap the phones of heim relatives because it had not satisfied criteria under german criminal-investigation laws , and this had been confirmed on appeal . this setback was being taken out of context , he said . " we are very committed to this investigation and are working intensively on it , " the spokesman said , adding the german judges had mounted 11 requests since 2005 for foreign legal assistance as they try to track heim down . heim , who performed gruesome , fatal experiments on concentration-camp inmates , vanished in 1962 as arrest loomed and is suspected to be still alive and living under an assumed name in spain or latin america . heim tops the list of the 10 most-sought nazi criminals put out by the simon wiesenthal centre in jerusalem . a member of the ss force , heim was known for his sadism as a doctor at the nazi 's mauthausen concentration camp in austria .
heim is alleged to have killed hundreds of inmates in authausen with injections into their hearts .
a total of 310,000 euros is being offered as a reward for his arrest . there have been reported sightings of him over the years .

" heister told deutsche presse-agentur dpa that a german judge denied permission to tap the phones of heim relatives because it had not satisfied criteria under german criminal-investigation laws , and this had been confirmed on appeal . this setback was being taken out of context , he said . " we are very committed to this investigation and are working intensively on it , " the spokesman said , adding the german judges had mounted 11 requests since 2005 for foreign legal assistance as they try to track heim down . heim , who performed gruesome , fatal experiments on concentration-camp inmates , vanished in 1962 as arrest loomed and is suspected to be still alive and living under an assumed name in spain or latin america . heim tops the list of the 10 most-sought nazi criminals put out by the simon wiesenthal centre in jerusalem . a member of the ss force , heim was known for his sadism as a doctor at the nazi 's mauthausen concentration camp in austria .
heim is alleged to have killed hundreds of inmates in authausen with injections into their hearts .
a total of 310,000 euros is being offered as a reward for his arrest . there have been reported sightings of him over the years .
if he is still alive , he would have celebrated his 94th birthday on saturday . dpa news agency -lrb- sp -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

the court has not yet set a date to rule on the challenges . koehler 's functions are mainly ceremonial , but he has sometimes used his limited powers to block government legislation . the lisbon treaty which was rejected by irish voters in a referendum recently , plunging the bloc into constitutional crisis , is meant to streamline the eu 's institutions , simplify decision-making and give the eu more clout on the world stage . it also provides for a new double majority voting mechanism seen as essential if the 27-member bloc is to expand .
all 27 member states must approve the text before it can enter into force . koehler 's move has put germany in a tricky situation given that the european heavyweight had pressed eu nations to ratify the treaty as soon as possible after the irish rejection . ireland was the only eu member to hold a referendum on the treaty , in all other eu nations , the decision will be taken by the parliament .
nineteen nations have ratified the embattled lisbon treaty in parliament so far , most recently britain . challenge from the left in germany , both houses of parliament passed the law ratifiying the lisbon treaty with the two-thirds majority needed earlier this year . but it needs president koehler 's signature for the law to come into force . however , the lisbon treaty faces a challenge in germany by the left , a radical left-wing opposition party , and a member of the ultra-conservative christian social union . the left says the treaty infringes the principle of democracy and the rights of members of the german parliament .
it sees the treaty as giving too much power to the european council , the council of the heads of state and government , at the expense of national parliaments and the european parliament . in 2006 , koehler also delayed in signing off on a forerunner of the lisbon treaty .
that constitutional treaty subsequently collapsed when it was rejected by dutch and french voters . dw staff -lrb- sp -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

" i think we have to recognize the greater quality of the spanish team today , " germany coach joachim loew said after his side lost 1-0 to spain . " it -lrb- the defeat -rrb- will encourage us to continue working over the next two years and to improve some things ... in order to get to the 2010 world cup and to play a similar role here . " " possession and one-touch passes are the key in soccer , and that at high speed and under stress .
spain showed that it masters it very well , " loew said . " the best team won " german newspapers too were full of praise for spain , saying the side outclassed the germans on every count . " the artists from spain would n't let themselves be bullied around , " munich-based sueddeutsche zeitung wrote . " after a strong start germany lost their way . "
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : there was no stopping fernando torres as he scored in the 33rd minute " title dreams dashed , " the hamburger morgenpost wrote .
" after 60 minutes of sleep-inducing football and lots of defensive problems the team came to life too late .
thanks to lehmann because it could have been worse . "
germany 's most popular television soccer analyst , guenter netzer said in the end the best team won on sunday .
" congratulations to spain but also i tip my hat in respect to germany for even reaching the final , " netzer , who helped west germany win the european crown in 1972 , said .
" that 's a great success for the team .
spain were the best team throughout the tournament .
they played the best football , " he said .
" they showed us how limited we are , they showed us how to play soccer .
spain showed we have a lot of room to improve . "
germans started well , with miroslav klose missing a glorious opportunity after just four minutes , but then spain soon started to take control and on 33 minutes torres put spain ahead . germany had their chances in the second half but spain remained dangerous and held their nerve to win the championship 1-0 .
one mistake too many germany had come to euro 2008 with lots of ambitions but failed to make a lasting impression apart from a classy 3-2 against portugal in the quarter-finals .
the team was outwitted in a 2-1 defeat against croatia and outplayed for most of the match in the semi-final with turkey where only the famed fighting spirit earned them a 3-2 win .
captain michael ballack scored two goals but was unable to stamp his authority on the team as he finished runner-up for the 10th time in his career .
and there were only flashes of genius from the likes of lukas podolski or bastian schweinsteiger .
" it is always disappointing to reach and final and then lose , " ballack said on sunday , adding that the team " made one or two errors too many . "
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : ballack , left , and spain 's marco senna fight for the ball on sunday , the germans fumbled once too often with the ball , their play marked by flawed passes and defense lapses - a weakness ruthlessly exploited by their technically superior opponents .
midfielder thomas hitzlsperger too said his side 's inaccuracy proved their undoing .
" when you make mistakes at this level you get punished .
the spanish side are so good , so you ca n't afford to make any mistakes , " hitzlsperger said .
" we made too many that is why we lost . "
crushed fans the defeat led to disappointment for millions of german fans raring to celebrate their side 's triumph on sunday night .
fernando torres ' 33rd-minute winner silenced the more than 600,000 fans who crowded into the public viewing area near the brandenburg gate in berlin .
spain 's complete domination from midway in the second half onwards until the final whistle was greeted with admiration .
the final whistle resulted in no trouble as police in berlin and elsewhere said the fans left without incident . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : germany 's euro party ended with a whimper on sunday many fans even left before the final whistle , subdued or to beat the crowd on the way home as there was nothing to celebrate when the henri delaunay trophy was eventually given to spain captain iker casillas and not ballack . apart from the more than 600,000 in berlin , 70,000 fans watched the game in munich , frankfurt recorded 50,000 fans and hamburg 42,000 . despite the disappointment , hundreds of thousands of fans are set to turn up in berlin once again on monday when the team presents itself at the fan zone - empty-handed just like after the 2006 world cup third-place finish . uphill battle for loew coach loew now has his work cut out as he looks to preparing the team for the 2010 world cup in south africa . loew 's ideal is a fast game similar to that of spain , the netherlands or russia , but he faces an uphill battle because change must also come from an overly-hyped bundesliga . the showings of german clubs in europe highlights the problem , with bayer leverkusen and bayern munich blown away by andrei arshavin and his uefa cup-winning zenit st petersburg teammates .
germany last won a european title from bayern munich in 2001 and has not had a team in a continental final since 2002 .
munich has shown some class and a new trend in the league could start there as well now that former national coach juergen klinsmann starts his job as munich coach .
klinsmann revolutionized the germany team during his reign 2004-2006 and his assistant loew is now continuing his legacy as boss .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : loew faces challenges as he looks towards the 2010 world cup " jogi loew should continue his way , " german soccer icon franz beckenbauer wrote in his monday column for the bild daily .
apart from goalkeeper jens lehmann , whose future is unclear , loew has a core of a team which has now played two major events , some like ballack and defender christoph metzelder even featuring in the 2002 world cup final .
podolski and schweinsteiger will only be in their mid-20s by the time of the 2010 world cup , and newcomers who were n't quite good enough to make the euro squad - such as marko marin , jermaine jones and patrick helmes - could by then be regulars .
german chancellor angela merkel , who was in the stadium for the final said the team was gradually building on its play .
" third at the world cup and now second , that is something .
maybe we will improve again in south africa , " merkel said . " i told ballack that we have to wait a little longer until we can celebrate together , but that we are slowly getting there . " loew and his boys will have two excellent opportunities to check on any possible improvement - on october 11 and almost a year later on october 10 , 2009 , in the two world cup qualifying matches against russia . dw staff -lrb- sp -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

germany full of praise for spain despite not always shining on the pitch , the german team had created another soccer frenzy in germany which sometimes came close to that from the 2006 home world cup in which germany finished third .
hundreds of thousands of fans watched the games from austria and switzerland in the country 's public viewing areas , with more than 500,000 on hand in berlin alone for the german 3-2 semi-final win over turkey and the final .
the fans at least partly cheered up the players , but no complaints were heard and read in the country after germany not simply lost the euro 2008 final 1-0 to spain but was comprehensively outplayed on sunday in vienna .
" spain 's victory .
the best team wins the tournament , " was the front page headline of the sueddeutsche zeitung -lrb- sz -rrb- daily under a photo of match-winner fernando torres and other players holding the cup in the air .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : spanish players holding up the euro trophy the sz was just one paper which named spain " the clearly better team " and praised its " brilliant passing " which kept the german defense on their toes .
the paper said that " soccer was the winner " on the night as the german euphoria somewhat hid the fact that the team had only rarely showed its class in the six matches in austria and switzerland .
former germany coach juergen klinsmann said that spain was " considerably better " on the night and german soccer icon franz beckenbauer said in his monday column for the bild daily that " spain dominated the tournament from the first match ... until yesterday 's final . "
other papers acknowledged as well that the better team had won but also looked back at germany 's run to the final .
" the end of the dream .
we are still proud of you , but spain was the better team , " said daily bild .
the hamburger abendblatt said : " only second - but it was still nice . "
slowly getting there the abendblatt recalled the soccer frenzy which had gripped the nation like at the 2006 home world cup and looked ahead , saying " maybe the happy end follows in 2010 " at the world cup in south africa , as germany was third at the 2006 world cup and now second at euro .
german chancellor angela merkel struck a similar note after attending the game in the vienna stadium .
" third at the world cup and now second , that is something .
maybe we will improve again in south africa , " said merkel .
" i told ballack that we have to wait a little longer until we can celebrate together but that we are slowly getting there . "

midfielder bastian schweinsteiger appeared to cries of " schweini schweini " from many of the young girls among the crowd as captain michael ballack and stars , lukas podolski and miroslav klose too were cheered on enthusiastically .
" the atmosphere in germany was fantastic .
we hope to bring home a cup in the future , " schweinsteiger , the popular bayern munich midfielder , said .
" you are the best " read one of the countless banners in the crowd of some 300,000 and some fans had even brought a replica of the cup with the writing " thank you " on it .

germany full of praise for spain despite not always shining on the pitch , the german team had created another soccer frenzy in germany which sometimes came close to that from the 2006 home world cup in which germany finished third .
hundreds of thousands of fans watched the games from austria and switzerland in the country 's public viewing areas , with more than 500,000 on hand in berlin alone for the german 3-2 semi-final win over turkey and the final .

michael reagan , a talk-show host and columnist in the us , is presenting his ideas in berlin on monday , june 30 . while ronald reagan 's famous speech at the brandenburg gate on june 12 , 1987 has entered the history books , the only commemoration of it is a few words on a plaque near the gate .
his son would like for berlin to see a commemorative object put up in berlin to mark what he sees as his father 's contribution to ending the cold war . " we can envisage a large statue or bust , " reagan , 63 , told the german daily bild .
michael reagan is the founder the reagan legacy foundation , a non-profit organization whose goal is to promote his father 's ideas and memorialize his accomplishments .
ronald reagan died in 2004 . michael reagan is in berlin to put forward his plan and leading a discussion about a commemoration at berlin 's cafe einstein , a restaurant frequented by journalists . " we are just at the beginning of the process , " he said .
" our foundation believes that an appropriate monument for president reagan 's speech at the brandenburg gate is of great historical value for berliners . " ' tear down this wall ! ' bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : reagan had addressed his remarks in the speece to soviet leader mikhail gorbachev , right .
ronald reagan made his historic speech during a five-hour visit to berlin on a podium near the brandenburg gate , which was then cut off from west berlin by the berlin wall .
during the speech made in front of tens of thousands of west berlin residents , reagan addressed the then-soviet leader when he said : " mr. gorbachev , open this gate !
mr. gorbachev , tear down this wall ! " the berlin wall actually did fall 881 days later , an event that shocked the world . " i would welcome a visible remembrance of this great friend of the germans , " said frank henkel , secretary-general of the conservative christian democrats in berlin .
" i can image a large commemorative plaque with that quotation between the new us embassy and the brandenburg gate . " however , during president reagan 's visit , police were faced with massive protests against his rearmament policies .
large parts of kreuzberg district , a traditional enclave of the left in west berlin , were sealed off to prevent rioting . an editorial monday in the left-wing daily neues deutschland said reagan 's terms in office were marked by military build-up , the " star wars " missile defense project , weapons deals with iran , and the invasion of grenada .
the paper said reagan already has a us navy aircraft carrier named after him , which is more appropriate than a commemorate plaque or statue in berlin . dw staff -lrb- jam -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

" i think we have to recognize the greater quality of the spanish team today , " germany coach joachim loew said after his side lost 1-0 to spain . " it -lrb- the defeat -rrb- will encourage us to continue working over the next two years and to improve some things ... in order to get to the 2010 world cup and to play a similar role here . " " possession and one-touch passes are the key in soccer , and that at high speed and under stress .
spain showed that it masters it very well , " loew said . " the best team won " german newspapers too were full of praise for spain , saying the side outclassed the germans on every count . " the artists from spain would n't let themselves be bullied around , " munich-based sueddeutsche zeitung wrote . " after a strong start germany lost their way . "
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : there was no stopping fernando torres as he scored in the 33rd minute " title dreams dashed , " the hamburger morgenpost wrote .
" after 60 minutes of sleep-inducing football and lots of defensive problems the team came to life too late .
thanks to lehmann because it could have been worse . "
germany 's most popular television soccer analyst , guenter netzer said in the end the best team won on sunday .
" congratulations to spain but also i tip my hat in respect to germany for even reaching the final , " netzer , who helped west germany win the european crown in 1972 , said .
" that 's a great success for the team .
spain were the best team throughout the tournament .
they played the best football , " he said .
" they showed us how limited we are , they showed us how to play soccer .
spain showed we have a lot of room to improve . "
germans started well , with miroslav klose missing a glorious opportunity after just four minutes , but then spain soon started to take control and on 33 minutes torres put spain ahead . germany had their chances in the second half but spain remained dangerous and held their nerve to win the championship 1-0 .
one mistake too many germany had come to euro 2008 with lots of ambitions but failed to make a lasting impression apart from a classy 3-2 against portugal in the quarter-finals .
the team was outwitted in a 2-1 defeat against croatia and outplayed for most of the match in the semi-final with turkey where only the famed fighting spirit earned them a 3-2 win .
captain michael ballack scored two goals but was unable to stamp his authority on the team as he finished runner-up for the 10th time in his career .
and there were only flashes of genius from the likes of lukas podolski or bastian schweinsteiger .
" it is always disappointing to reach and final and then lose , " ballack said on sunday , adding that the team " made one or two errors too many . "
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : ballack , left , and spain 's marco senna fight for the ball on sunday , the germans fumbled once too often with the ball , their play marked by flawed passes and defense lapses - a weakness ruthlessly exploited by their technically superior opponents .
midfielder thomas hitzlsperger too said his side 's inaccuracy proved their undoing .
" when you make mistakes at this level you get punished .
the spanish side are so good , so you ca n't afford to make any mistakes , " hitzlsperger said .
" we made too many that is why we lost . "
crushed fans the defeat led to disappointment for millions of german fans raring to celebrate their side 's triumph on sunday night .
fernando torres ' 33rd-minute winner silenced the more than 600,000 fans who crowded into the public viewing area near the brandenburg gate in berlin .
spain 's complete domination from midway in the second half onwards until the final whistle was greeted with admiration .
the final whistle resulted in no trouble as police in berlin and elsewhere said the fans left without incident . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : germany 's euro party ended with a whimper on sunday many fans even left before the final whistle , subdued or to beat the crowd on the way home as there was nothing to celebrate when the henri delaunay trophy was eventually given to spain captain iker casillas and not ballack . apart from the more than 600,000 in berlin , 70,000 fans watched the game in munich , frankfurt recorded 50,000 fans and hamburg 42,000 . despite the disappointment , hundreds of thousands of fans are set to turn up in berlin once again on monday when the team presents itself at the fan zone - empty-handed just like after the 2006 world cup third-place finish . uphill battle for loew coach loew now has his work cut out as he looks to preparing the team for the 2010 world cup in south africa . loew 's ideal is a fast game similar to that of spain , the netherlands or russia , but he faces an uphill battle because change must also come from an overly-hyped bundesliga . the showings of german clubs in europe highlights the problem , with bayer leverkusen and bayern munich blown away by andrei arshavin and his uefa cup-winning zenit st petersburg teammates .
germany last won a european title from bayern munich in 2001 and has not had a team in a continental final since 2002 .
munich has shown some class and a new trend in the league could start there as well now that former national coach juergen klinsmann starts his job as munich coach .
klinsmann revolutionized the germany team during his reign 2004-2006 and his assistant loew is now continuing his legacy as boss .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : loew faces challenges as he looks towards the 2010 world cup " jogi loew should continue his way , " german soccer icon franz beckenbauer wrote in his monday column for the bild daily .
apart from goalkeeper jens lehmann , whose future is unclear , loew has a core of a team which has now played two major events , some like ballack and defender christoph metzelder even featuring in the 2002 world cup final .
podolski and schweinsteiger will only be in their mid-20s by the time of the 2010 world cup , and newcomers who were n't quite good enough to make the euro squad - such as marko marin , jermaine jones and patrick helmes - could by then be regulars .
german chancellor angela merkel , who was in the stadium for the final said the team was gradually building on its play .
" third at the world cup and now second , that is something .
maybe we will improve again in south africa , " merkel said . " i told ballack that we have to wait a little longer until we can celebrate together , but that we are slowly getting there . " loew and his boys will have two excellent opportunities to check on any possible improvement - on october 11 and almost a year later on october 10 , 2009 , in the two world cup qualifying matches against russia . dw staff -lrb- sp -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : there was no stopping fernando torres as he scored in the 33rd minute " title dreams dashed , " the hamburger morgenpost wrote .
" after 60 minutes of sleep-inducing football and lots of defensive problems the team came to life too late .
thanks to lehmann because it could have been worse . "
germany 's most popular television soccer analyst , guenter netzer said in the end the best team won on sunday .
" congratulations to spain but also i tip my hat in respect to germany for even reaching the final , " netzer , who helped west germany win the european crown in 1972 , said .
" that 's a great success for the team .
spain were the best team throughout the tournament .
they played the best football , " he said .
" they showed us how limited we are , they showed us how to play soccer .
spain showed we have a lot of room to improve . "
germans started well , with miroslav klose missing a glorious opportunity after just four minutes , but then spain soon started to take control and on 33 minutes torres put spain ahead . germany had their chances in the second half but spain remained dangerous and held their nerve to win the championship 1-0 .
one mistake too many germany had come to euro 2008 with lots of ambitions but failed to make a lasting impression apart from a classy 3-2 against portugal in the quarter-finals .
the team was outwitted in a 2-1 defeat against croatia and outplayed for most of the match in the semi-final with turkey where only the famed fighting spirit earned them a 3-2 win .
captain michael ballack scored two goals but was unable to stamp his authority on the team as he finished runner-up for the 10th time in his career .
and there were only flashes of genius from the likes of lukas podolski or bastian schweinsteiger .
" it is always disappointing to reach and final and then lose , " ballack said on sunday , adding that the team " made one or two errors too many . "
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : ballack , left , and spain 's marco senna fight for the ball on sunday , the germans fumbled once too often with the ball , their play marked by flawed passes and defense lapses - a weakness ruthlessly exploited by their technically superior opponents .
midfielder thomas hitzlsperger too said his side 's inaccuracy proved their undoing .
" when you make mistakes at this level you get punished .
the spanish side are so good , so you ca n't afford to make any mistakes , " hitzlsperger said .
" we made too many that is why we lost . "
crushed fans the defeat led to disappointment for millions of german fans raring to celebrate their side 's triumph on sunday night .
fernando torres ' 33rd-minute winner silenced the more than 600,000 fans who crowded into the public viewing area near the brandenburg gate in berlin .
spain 's complete domination from midway in the second half onwards until the final whistle was greeted with admiration .
the final whistle resulted in no trouble as police in berlin and elsewhere said the fans left without incident . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : germany 's euro party ended with a whimper on sunday many fans even left before the final whistle , subdued or to beat the crowd on the way home as there was nothing to celebrate when the henri delaunay trophy was eventually given to spain captain iker casillas and not ballack . apart from the more than 600,000 in berlin , 70,000 fans watched the game in munich , frankfurt recorded 50,000 fans and hamburg 42,000 . despite the disappointment , hundreds of thousands of fans are set to turn up in berlin once again on monday when the team presents itself at the fan zone - empty-handed just like after the 2006 world cup third-place finish . uphill battle for loew coach loew now has his work cut out as he looks to preparing the team for the 2010 world cup in south africa . loew 's ideal is a fast game similar to that of spain , the netherlands or russia , but he faces an uphill battle because change must also come from an overly-hyped bundesliga . the showings of german clubs in europe highlights the problem , with bayer leverkusen and bayern munich blown away by andrei arshavin and his uefa cup-winning zenit st petersburg teammates .
germany last won a european title from bayern munich in 2001 and has not had a team in a continental final since 2002 .
munich has shown some class and a new trend in the league could start there as well now that former national coach juergen klinsmann starts his job as munich coach .
klinsmann revolutionized the germany team during his reign 2004-2006 and his assistant loew is now continuing his legacy as boss .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : loew faces challenges as he looks towards the 2010 world cup " jogi loew should continue his way , " german soccer icon franz beckenbauer wrote in his monday column for the bild daily .
apart from goalkeeper jens lehmann , whose future is unclear , loew has a core of a team which has now played two major events , some like ballack and defender christoph metzelder even featuring in the 2002 world cup final .
podolski and schweinsteiger will only be in their mid-20s by the time of the 2010 world cup , and newcomers who were n't quite good enough to make the euro squad - such as marko marin , jermaine jones and patrick helmes - could by then be regulars .
german chancellor angela merkel , who was in the stadium for the final said the team was gradually building on its play .
" third at the world cup and now second , that is something .
maybe we will improve again in south africa , " merkel said . " i told ballack that we have to wait a little longer until we can celebrate together , but that we are slowly getting there .

michael reagan , a talk-show host and columnist in the us , is presenting his ideas in berlin on monday , june 30 . while ronald reagan 's famous speech at the brandenburg gate on june 12 , 1987 has entered the history books , the only commemoration of it is a few words on a plaque near the gate .
his son would like for berlin to see a commemorative object put up in berlin to mark what he sees as his father 's contribution to ending the cold war . " we can envisage a large statue or bust , " reagan , 63 , told the german daily bild .
michael reagan is the founder the reagan legacy foundation , a non-profit organization whose goal is to promote his father 's ideas and memorialize his accomplishments .
ronald reagan died in 2004 . michael reagan is in berlin to put forward his plan and leading a discussion about a commemoration at berlin 's cafe einstein , a restaurant frequented by journalists . " we are just at the beginning of the process , " he said .

ronald reagan made his historic speech during a five-hour visit to berlin on a podium near the brandenburg gate , which was then cut off from west berlin by the berlin wall .
during the speech made in front of tens of thousands of west berlin residents , reagan addressed the then-soviet leader when he said : " mr. gorbachev , open this gate !
mr. gorbachev , tear down this wall ! " the berlin wall actually did fall 881 days later , an event that shocked the world . " i would welcome a visible remembrance of this great friend of the germans , " said frank henkel , secretary-general of the conservative christian democrats in berlin .
" i can image a large commemorative plaque with that quotation between the new us embassy and the brandenburg gate . " however , during president reagan 's visit , police were faced with massive protests against his rearmament policies .

" we want to bring forward two components : a very intensive training on the pitch and off it as well where we want to move them forward as humans , " klinsmann told the bundesliga champions ' club website .
" the coaching staff is excited , neither real madrid nor barcelona have this .
we are very proud of it . "
klinsmann was mainly referring to the revamped player facilities , but there is far more to it then a few rooms as bayern have set their sites on international fame and fortune after dominating in germany with three league and cup doubles in the past four seasons .
a top placing in the champions league , where munich has been in the final since lifting the trophy in 2001 , as a key aim .
klinsmann revived the german national team during his reign 2004-2006 and then in january signed a two-year contract for munich to do exactly the same there .
klinsmann brought in to introduce new culture bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : klinsmann is the man to change the way bayern works " we took this step deliberately .
we needed a man who dares to make changes .
juergen is the right man for that , " said chairman karl-heinz rummenigge .
" not even i know what he will still change .
but this is a new culture for the bundesliga . "
after overhauling the team last summer by hiring the likes of france star franck ribery , italy striker luca toni and germany forward miroslav klose , munich now want klinsmann to bring the coaching structures up to modern standard .
klinsmann , who played for munich 1995-1997 , brought sweeping changes to the national team with new methods including american fitness gurus and has the same in mind in munich .
klinsmann 's team in munich includes mexican assistant coach martin vasquez , former player christian nerlinger is somewhere between the team and hoeness , and former bundesliga goalkeeper philipp laux ready to work with frustrated players as a sports psychologist .
working days to be extended bayern players faced an eight-hour day with training , lunch and wellness areas in the new facilities from monday onwards .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : klinsi 's techniques with germany will be used at bayern dutchman mark van bommel was the most prominent player to get a first taste of klinsmann 's training , while ribery , toni , turkey 's hamit altintop and the germans klose , bastian schweinsteiger , lukas podolski , philipp lahm and the other euro international enjoyed a holiday before starting pre-season training .
klinsmann watched germany lose the final 1-0 to spain on sunday in vienna and admitted that spain were " considerably better . "
spain 's philosophy of attacking football with neat one-touch passes matches exactly that of klinsmann , who will try to introduce it in germany - from which the national team could profit as well . dw staff / dpa news agency -lrb- nda -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

but the crisis of the irish no vote overshadowed slovenia 's term . at the beginning of the year , slovenia set out to prove that a small country could successfully take on the european union presidency . indeed , the recent eu member showed that " things would n't go disastrously wrong and that they could manage it effectively , " said jacki davis from the european policy center , a leading think-tank in brussels . " i think they 've done that and that 's really the best one could have asked for , " she said . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : slovenia advocated for kosovo , while still trying to keep serbia on board it may be a small country , but slovenia tackled major issues during its six-month presidency , which it is set to hand over to france on july 1 .
among them : balkan diplomacy and the birth of the kosovar state . drawing the balkans closer to europe as a former yugoslav state itself , it came as no huge surprise that slovenia vehemently encouraged the eu not only to recognize kosovo as an independent state but also to smooth the way for serbia 's future membership in the bloc . after snap elections in serbia , tensions relaxed a bit and the eu signed a stabilization and association agreement with both serbia and bosnia-herzegovina - a major step toward eu membership for both countries . as for kosovo , russian concerns prevented the eu from taking over the political supervision of the fledgling country , but the bloc continues to be integrally involved in the un mission . slovenia " handled -lsb- kosovo 's independence -rsb- well , considering the initial qualms and divisions between eu member states or whether to recognize or not , " said davis . irish no a blow to eu leaders bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : slovenia was n't blamed for the irish no to the lisbon treaty the second major issue dominating the slovenian presidency was the irish no vote in june on the bloc 's lisbon treaty .
davis said the vote , which raised existential concerns over the bloc 's future , " had to do with conditions in ireland " and could n't be blamed on slovenia . slovenian prime minister janez jansa said he regrets that he and the bloc 's 26 other heads-of-state were n't able to sufficiently promote europe to its residents .

" the atmosphere in germany was fantastic .
we hope to bring home a cup in the future , " schweinsteiger , the popular bayern munich midfielder , said .

germany full of praise for spain despite not always shining on the pitch , the german team had created another soccer frenzy in germany which sometimes came close to that from the 2006 home world cup in which germany finished third .
hundreds of thousands of fans watched the games from austria and switzerland in the country 's public viewing areas , with more than 500,000 on hand in berlin alone for the german 3-2 semi-final win over turkey and the final .
the fans at least partly cheered up the players , but no complaints were heard and read in the country after germany not simply lost the euro 2008 final 1-0 to spain but was comprehensively outplayed on sunday in vienna .

former germany coach juergen klinsmann said that spain was " considerably better " on the night and german soccer icon franz beckenbauer said in his monday column for the bild daily that " spain dominated the tournament from the first match ... until yesterday 's final . "
other papers acknowledged as well that the better team had won but also looked back at germany 's run to the final .

german chancellor angela merkel struck a similar note after attending the game in the vienna stadium .
" third at the world cup and now second , that is something .
maybe we will improve again in south africa , " said merkel .
" i told ballack that we have to wait a little longer until we can celebrate together but that we are slowly getting there . "

the mediation follows a widely condemned one-candidate election . germany said on monday , june 30 , it hoped south africa , whose president thabo mbeki is heading the talks , would also back the nomination of a second mediator . " we will in the next days and weeks be watching very closely how things in southern africa develop , " said german foreign ministry spokesman martin jaeger . mbeki was called on to steer talks with the zimbabwean government after 84-year-old incumbent president robert mugabe won a landslide re-election last week .
the single-candidate poll , boycotted by opposition candidate morgan tsvangirai due to violent attacks on his supporters , has been panned a farce by the un and the much of the international community . the eu on monday denounced the vote as an " exercise in power-grabbing . " zimbabwe opposition appeals to african union bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : tsvangirai pulled out of the presidential race , leaving just one candidate mbeki , who has close personal ties to mugabe , has been widely criticized for his quiet diplomacy toward the zimbabwean regime .
mugabe has been accused of widespread human rights abuses and of driving his country 's economy into the ground . the zimbabwean opposition movement for democratic change -lrb- mdc -rrb- on monday called on african union leaders , currently at a summit in egypt , to name a second mediator to join in the talks in a move to sideline mbeki 's much criticized efforts . " we want an au envoy who is a permanent mediator between the mdc and the zanu-pf to assist president mbeki , " said mdc spokesman george sibotshiwe . the situation in zimbabwe has topped the agenda at the egypt summit .

but the crisis of the irish no vote overshadowed slovenia 's term . at the beginning of the year , slovenia set out to prove that a small country could successfully take on the european union presidency . indeed , the recent eu member showed that " things would n't go disastrously wrong and that they could manage it effectively , " said jacki davis from the european policy center , a leading think-tank in brussels . " i think they 've done that and that 's really the best one could have asked for , " she said . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : slovenia advocated for kosovo , while still trying to keep serbia on board it may be a small country , but slovenia tackled major issues during its six-month presidency , which it is set to hand over to france on july 1 .
among them : balkan diplomacy and the birth of the kosovar state . drawing the balkans closer to europe as a former yugoslav state itself , it came as no huge surprise that slovenia vehemently encouraged the eu not only to recognize kosovo as an independent state but also to smooth the way for serbia 's future membership in the bloc . after snap elections in serbia , tensions relaxed a bit and the eu signed a stabilization and association agreement with both serbia and bosnia-herzegovina - a major step toward eu membership for both countries . as for kosovo , russian concerns prevented the eu from taking over the political supervision of the fledgling country , but the bloc continues to be integrally involved in the un mission . slovenia " handled -lsb- kosovo 's independence -rsb- well , considering the initial qualms and divisions between eu member states or whether to recognize or not , " said davis . irish no a blow to eu leaders bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : slovenia was n't blamed for the irish no to the lisbon treaty the second major issue dominating the slovenian presidency was the irish no vote in june on the bloc 's lisbon treaty .
davis said the vote , which raised existential concerns over the bloc 's future , " had to do with conditions in ireland " and could n't be blamed on slovenia . slovenian prime minister janez jansa said he regrets that he and the bloc 's 26 other heads-of-state were n't able to sufficiently promote europe to its residents . " we need to change the negative attitude toward european institutions , " he said .
" we need a european identity . " mep questions eu connection to the people jansa and his relatively small team managed to push through new laws on unified work times for eu institutions - after 14 years of discussion on the matter .
they also put in motion the first part of a common asylum law , founded a joint eu-mediterranean university , and opened dialogue with latin america on climate change , food production and energy security . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : jansa said a stronger european identity is needed eu parliamentarian jo leinen , a member of germany 's social democratic party , said that slovenia and the rest of the eu states have n't recognized the people 's true concerns . " food prices , energy prices , credit crisis , and high managers ' salaries - the people are worried about lots of things , but we either get around to them too late or just make half-hearted decisions , " he said .
" europe has to be useful to the people , it has to protect the people , and then they will also support and follow us . " a euro team at the next euro ? european commission president jose manuel barroso , on the other hand , praised the slovenian presidency for its effectiveness - a quality some observers in brussels do n't expect from its french successors . " if all the member states applied the same principles -lsb- as slovenia -rsb- , the european union would overcome many of its difficulties , " said barroso . in his final speech as head of 27-member bloc , which coincided with the end of the european soccer championship , jansa quipped that the eu should send its own soccer team to the next euro . then at least the eu would get a little attention . bernd riegert -lrb- kjb -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

" heister told deutsche presse-agentur dpa that a german judge denied permission to tap the phones of heim relatives because it had not satisfied criteria under german criminal-investigation laws , and this had been confirmed on appeal . this setback was being taken out of context , he said . " we are very committed to this investigation and are working intensively on it , " the spokesman said , adding the german judges had mounted 11 requests since 2005 for foreign legal assistance as they try to track heim down . heim , who performed gruesome , fatal experiments on concentration-camp inmates , vanished in 1962 as arrest loomed and is suspected to be still alive and living under an assumed name in spain or latin america . heim tops the list of the 10 most-sought nazi criminals put out by the simon wiesenthal centre in jerusalem . a member of the ss force , heim was known for his sadism as a doctor at the nazi 's mauthausen concentration camp in austria .
heim is alleged to have killed hundreds of inmates in authausen with injections into their hearts .
a total of 310,000 euros is being offered as a reward for his arrest . there have been reported sightings of him over the years .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de european union -pipe- 30.06.2008 slovenia 's strong eu presidency sets stage for small countries großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : slovenia hands the rotating eu presidency to france on july 1 , 2008 slovenia , the first former communist country to hold the rotating eu presidency , oversaw positive developments in the balkans over the last six months .
but the crisis of the irish no vote overshadowed slovenia 's term . at the beginning of the year , slovenia set out to prove that a small country could successfully take on the european union presidency . indeed , the recent eu member showed that " things would n't go disastrously wrong and that they could manage it effectively , " said jacki davis from the european policy center , a leading think-tank in brussels . " i think they 've done that and that 's really the best one could have asked for , " she said . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : slovenia advocated for kosovo , while still trying to keep serbia on board it may be a small country , but slovenia tackled major issues during its six-month presidency , which it is set to hand over to france on july 1 .
among them : balkan diplomacy and the birth of the kosovar state . drawing the balkans closer to europe as a former yugoslav state itself , it came as no huge surprise that slovenia vehemently encouraged the eu not only to recognize kosovo as an independent state but also to smooth the way for serbia 's future membership in the bloc . after snap elections in serbia , tensions relaxed a bit and the eu signed a stabilization and association agreement with both serbia and bosnia-herzegovina - a major step toward eu membership for both countries . as for kosovo , russian concerns prevented the eu from taking over the political supervision of the fledgling country , but the bloc continues to be integrally involved in the un mission . slovenia " handled -lsb- kosovo 's independence -rsb- well , considering the initial qualms and divisions between eu member states or whether to recognize or not , " said davis . irish no a blow to eu leaders bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : slovenia was n't blamed for the irish no to the lisbon treaty the second major issue dominating the slovenian presidency was the irish no vote in june on the bloc 's lisbon treaty .
davis said the vote , which raised existential concerns over the bloc 's future , " had to do with conditions in ireland " and could n't be blamed on slovenia . slovenian prime minister janez jansa said he regrets that he and the bloc 's 26 other heads-of-state were n't able to sufficiently promote europe to its residents . " we need to change the negative attitude toward european institutions , " he said .
" we need a european identity . " mep questions eu connection to the people jansa and his relatively small team managed to push through new laws on unified work times for eu institutions - after 14 years of discussion on the matter .
they also put in motion the first part of a common asylum law , founded a joint eu-mediterranean university , and opened dialogue with latin america on climate change , food production and energy security . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : jansa said a stronger european identity is needed eu parliamentarian jo leinen , a member of germany 's social democratic party , said that slovenia and the rest of the eu states have n't recognized the people 's true concerns . " food prices , energy prices , credit crisis , and high managers ' salaries - the people are worried about lots of things , but we either get around to them too late or just make half-hearted decisions , " he said .
" europe has to be useful to the people , it has to protect the people , and then they will also support and follow us . " a euro team at the next euro ? european commission president jose manuel barroso , on the other hand , praised the slovenian presidency for its effectiveness - a quality some observers in brussels do n't expect from its french successors . " if all the member states applied the same principles -lsb- as slovenia -rsb- , the european union would overcome many of its difficulties , " said barroso . in his final speech as head of 27-member bloc , which coincided with the end of the european soccer championship , jansa quipped that the eu should send its own soccer team to the next euro . then at least the eu would get a little attention . bernd riegert -lrb- kjb -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

the mediation follows a widely condemned one-candidate election . germany said on monday , june 30 , it hoped south africa , whose president thabo mbeki is heading the talks , would also back the nomination of a second mediator . " we will in the next days and weeks be watching very closely how things in southern africa develop , " said german foreign ministry spokesman martin jaeger . mbeki was called on to steer talks with the zimbabwean government after 84-year-old incumbent president robert mugabe won a landslide re-election last week .

" we want an au envoy who is a permanent mediator between the mdc and the zanu-pf to assist president mbeki , " said mdc spokesman george sibotshiwe . the situation in zimbabwe has topped the agenda at the egypt summit .
african leaders criticized the vote , urging mugabe 's zanu-pf party to form a unity government with the mdc .
they are reportedly writing up possible power-sharing plans for the two parties . " africa must fully shoulder its responsibility and do everything in its power to help the zimbabwe parties work together so as to overcome current challenges , " au commission chief jean ping said at the opening of the summit . the union 's 53 members have yet to reach consensus on what action to take . europe open to zimbabwe sanctions the german foreign ministry spokesman added on monday that the situation in zimbabwe was being closely followed in the eu . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : mugabe , freshly sworn into office once again , attended the african union summit in egypt " the french presidency of the eu , which is taking up its duties tomorrow -lrb- tuesday -rrb- has taken up the question and we will discuss together what further steps we can take , " he said . while us president george w. bush has already called on the united nations for an arms embargo against zimbabwe , the eu has said it would not rule out the possibility of sanctions against the southern african country . past sanctions have only resulted in fuelling the determination of the country 's elite to maintain power . dw staf -lrb- kjb -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

" we want to bring forward two components : a very intensive training on the pitch and off it as well where we want to move them forward as humans , " klinsmann told the bundesliga champions ' club website .
" the coaching staff is excited , neither real madrid nor barcelona have this .
we are very proud of it . "
klinsmann was mainly referring to the revamped player facilities , but there is far more to it then a few rooms as bayern have set their sites on international fame and fortune after dominating in germany with three league and cup doubles in the past four seasons .
a top placing in the champions league , where munich has been in the final since lifting the trophy in 2001 , as a key aim .
klinsmann revived the german national team during his reign 2004-2006 and then in january signed a two-year contract for munich to do exactly the same there .
klinsmann brought in to introduce new culture bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : klinsmann is the man to change the way bayern works " we took this step deliberately .
we needed a man who dares to make changes .
juergen is the right man for that , " said chairman karl-heinz rummenigge .
" not even i know what he will still change .
but this is a new culture for the bundesliga . "
after overhauling the team last summer by hiring the likes of france star franck ribery , italy striker luca toni and germany forward miroslav klose , munich now want klinsmann to bring the coaching structures up to modern standard .
klinsmann , who played for munich 1995-1997 , brought sweeping changes to the national team with new methods including american fitness gurus and has the same in mind in munich .
klinsmann 's team in munich includes mexican assistant coach martin vasquez , former player christian nerlinger is somewhere between the team and hoeness , and former bundesliga goalkeeper philipp laux ready to work with frustrated players as a sports psychologist .
working days to be extended bayern players faced an eight-hour day with training , lunch and wellness areas in the new facilities from monday onwards .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : klinsi 's techniques with germany will be used at bayern dutchman mark van bommel was the most prominent player to get a first taste of klinsmann 's training , while ribery , toni , turkey 's hamit altintop and the germans klose , bastian schweinsteiger , lukas podolski , philipp lahm and the other euro international enjoyed a holiday before starting pre-season training .
klinsmann watched germany lose the final 1-0 to spain on sunday in vienna and admitted that spain were " considerably better . "
spain 's philosophy of attacking football with neat one-touch passes matches exactly that of klinsmann , who will try to introduce it in germany - from which the national team could profit as well . dw staff / dpa news agency -lrb- nda -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

until now , norway has provided soldiers for a qrf in the region but now the scandinavians want to focus on rebuilding afghanistan and strengthening their civil reconstruction teams . heightened danger germany currently has 3,500 troops in afghanistan .
an additional 1,000 troops are expected to join them in autumn . the qrf will be at the disposal of the regional command of the nato-led international security and assistance force -lrb- isaf -rrb- in northern afghanistan and its main job will be to provide emergency help to nato troops .
that will include defending against attacks by a resurgent taliban and other radical groups and could involve offensive deployments against insurgents . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : dutch soldiers on patrol in kunduz equipped with armoured vehicles and tanks , the qrf is expected to be mobile and quick .
it will include experts in deactivating mines and booby traps . though the commander of the german qrf , gunnar bruegner said the deployment did not involve heightened dangers , the departing head of the norwegian force said the german army had to be prepared for more casualties . the norwegians did not lose a single soldier since the force took up operations in early 2006 but rune solberg said threat levels had significantly increased recently in northern afghanistan . reports of rising threats from the taliban have been fuelled by the approach taken by the new government in neighboring pakistan to negotiate with taliban militants .
that stance , western experts , say have emboldened taliban insurgents in afghanistan . german defense minister franz josef jung had warned the qrf force when he saw it off at the beginning of june of a dangerous deployment with " life-threatening risks . " at the time , jung said : " every soldier who goes to afghanistan must be in a position to fight . " more troops needed sending troops into combat in afghanistan remains a sensitive topic in germany with opinion polls showing the majority of the population against the step . nato partners , particularly the united states , have pressured germany to send more troops to afghanistan .
they also want more german soldiers sent to the dangerous south to help fight a more powerful taliban . there are about 60,000 foreign troops in afghanistan , most of them part of the nato-led isaf force .
yet despite the heavy nato involvement , some 6,000 people were killed in 2007 , the deadliest year since the taliban was forced from power in 2001 .
german nato general egon ramms said last week he urgently needs an additional 5,000 to 6,000 troops in afghanistan . dw staff -lrb- sp -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

" i think we have to recognize the greater quality of the spanish team today , " germany coach joachim loew said after his side lost 1-0 to spain . " it -lrb- the defeat -rrb- will encourage us to continue working over the next two years and to improve some things ... in order to get to the 2010 world cup and to play a similar role here . " " possession and one-touch passes are the key in soccer , and that at high speed and under stress .
spain showed that it masters it very well , " loew said . " the best team won " german newspapers too were full of praise for spain , saying the side outclassed the germans on every count . " the artists from spain would n't let themselves be bullied around , " munich-based sueddeutsche zeitung wrote . " after a strong start germany lost their way . "
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : there was no stopping fernando torres as he scored in the 33rd minute " title dreams dashed , " the hamburger morgenpost wrote .
" after 60 minutes of sleep-inducing football and lots of defensive problems the team came to life too late .
thanks to lehmann because it could have been worse . "
germany 's most popular television soccer analyst , guenter netzer said in the end the best team won on sunday .
" congratulations to spain but also i tip my hat in respect to germany for even reaching the final , " netzer , who helped west germany win the european crown in 1972 , said .
" that 's a great success for the team .
spain were the best team throughout the tournament .
they played the best football , " he said .
" they showed us how limited we are , they showed us how to play soccer .
spain showed we have a lot of room to improve . "
germans started well , with miroslav klose missing a glorious opportunity after just four minutes , but then spain soon started to take control and on 33 minutes torres put spain ahead . germany had their chances in the second half but spain remained dangerous and held their nerve to win the championship 1-0 .
one mistake too many germany had come to euro 2008 with lots of ambitions but failed to make a lasting impression apart from a classy 3-2 against portugal in the quarter-finals .
the team was outwitted in a 2-1 defeat against croatia and outplayed for most of the match in the semi-final with turkey where only the famed fighting spirit earned them a 3-2 win .
captain michael ballack scored two goals but was unable to stamp his authority on the team as he finished runner-up for the 10th time in his career .
and there were only flashes of genius from the likes of lukas podolski or bastian schweinsteiger .
" it is always disappointing to reach and final and then lose , " ballack said on sunday , adding that the team " made one or two errors too many . "
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : ballack , left , and spain 's marco senna fight for the ball on sunday , the germans fumbled once too often with the ball , their play marked by flawed passes and defense lapses - a weakness ruthlessly exploited by their technically superior opponents .
midfielder thomas hitzlsperger too said his side 's inaccuracy proved their undoing .
" when you make mistakes at this level you get punished .
the spanish side are so good , so you ca n't afford to make any mistakes , " hitzlsperger said .
" we made too many that is why we lost . "
crushed fans the defeat led to disappointment for millions of german fans raring to celebrate their side 's triumph on sunday night .
fernando torres ' 33rd-minute winner silenced the more than 600,000 fans who crowded into the public viewing area near the brandenburg gate in berlin .
spain 's complete domination from midway in the second half onwards until the final whistle was greeted with admiration .
the final whistle resulted in no trouble as police in berlin and elsewhere said the fans left without incident . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : germany 's euro party ended with a whimper on sunday many fans even left before the final whistle , subdued or to beat the crowd on the way home as there was nothing to celebrate when the henri delaunay trophy was eventually given to spain captain iker casillas and not ballack . apart from the more than 600,000 in berlin , 70,000 fans watched the game in munich , frankfurt recorded 50,000 fans and hamburg 42,000 . despite the disappointment , hundreds of thousands of fans are set to turn up in berlin once again on monday when the team presents itself at the fan zone - empty-handed just like after the 2006 world cup third-place finish . uphill battle for loew coach loew now has his work cut out as he looks to preparing the team for the 2010 world cup in south africa . loew 's ideal is a fast game similar to that of spain , the netherlands or russia , but he faces an uphill battle because change must also come from an overly-hyped bundesliga . the showings of german clubs in europe highlights the problem , with bayer leverkusen and bayern munich blown away by andrei arshavin and his uefa cup-winning zenit st petersburg teammates .
germany last won a european title from bayern munich in 2001 and has not had a team in a continental final since 2002 .
munich has shown some class and a new trend in the league could start there as well now that former national coach juergen klinsmann starts his job as munich coach .
klinsmann revolutionized the germany team during his reign 2004-2006 and his assistant loew is now continuing his legacy as boss .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : loew faces challenges as he looks towards the 2010 world cup " jogi loew should continue his way , " german soccer icon franz beckenbauer wrote in his monday column for the bild daily .
apart from goalkeeper jens lehmann , whose future is unclear , loew has a core of a team which has now played two major events , some like ballack and defender christoph metzelder even featuring in the 2002 world cup final .
podolski and schweinsteiger will only be in their mid-20s by the time of the 2010 world cup , and newcomers who were n't quite good enough to make the euro squad - such as marko marin , jermaine jones and patrick helmes - could by then be regulars .
german chancellor angela merkel , who was in the stadium for the final said the team was gradually building on its play .
" third at the world cup and now second , that is something .
maybe we will improve again in south africa , " merkel said . " i told ballack that we have to wait a little longer until we can celebrate together , but that we are slowly getting there . " loew and his boys will have two excellent opportunities to check on any possible improvement - on october 11 and almost a year later on october 10 , 2009 , in the two world cup qualifying matches against russia . dw staff -lrb- sp -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

most of all , however , the austrians and the swiss just did n't quite come through as hosts like the germans did two years ago . while the germans had opened their doors and hearts to guests from around the world , the austrians and swiss withdrew into their own four walls and observed the whole spectacle with suspicion . the fans did n't feel like it was " a time to make friends , " like the german motto in 2006 said . nevertheless , soccer was the focal point and , without a doubt , we experienced the best european soccer championship of all time .
the triumph of the defensive was celebrated in portugal in 2004 , but the euro 2008 was definitely the most offense-driven international tournament fans have ever seen . striking was the name of the game .
those who just tried not to lose a match were punished in the end - especially greece , the 2004 european champions .

european soccer is apparently going through a generational shift .
the old stars have had their time in the limelight and new names are come to the fore - like russia 's arshavin and pavlyuchenko or turkey 's nihat . what 's more , a strong start evidently does n't mean everything in a tournament and sending in the b-team can only backfire .

still , there are a few scratches on the shiny surface . of course , uefa could n't do anything about the bad weather that led to an embarrassing interruption of the global television broadcast .
but uefa is responsible for stipulating that all the cables had to run through vienna and that there was no viable backup . it 's also uefa 's fault that the quality of the grass was n't great and apparently had n't been tested under extreme conditions . uefa 's regulation overkill ruffled feathers in the austrian and swiss business communities and came to a head on the pitch with the completely senseless and unbearable patronizing of coaches on the sidelines - something germany coach joachim loew experienced personally . and finally , tv viewers felt they got the short end of the stick when they found out that uefa had prevented images it did n't like - such as those of a streaker or illegal fireworks in a stadium - from being broadcast . the 13th european championship is now history .

those who just tried not to lose a match were punished in the end - especially greece , the 2004 european champions .
statistics show that there were more scoring chances in the euro 2008 than in any other tournament and the final count of 77 goals in 31 games speaks for itself . great soccer , good sports bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : spain can celebrate ; uefa needs to look at what worked and what did n't for the most part , we saw beautiful , fast soccer played by real teams working together .
of course the top teams have their stars , but stars alone ca n't win a match these days .
they can only shine within a team that functions as a whole and presents itself as a single unit .
the alpine event marked the continuation of a trend that has been evident for some time . the euro was also quite sportsmanlike ; there was little hostility on the pitch and just three relatively painless red cards . what did we learn ?
european soccer is apparently going through a generational shift .
the old stars have had their time in the limelight and new names are come to the fore - like russia 's arshavin and pavlyuchenko or turkey 's nihat . what 's more , a strong start evidently does n't mean everything in a tournament and sending in the b-team can only backfire .
being the favorite is often too heavy a burden .
and turkey showed that a match really can last a whole 90 , or even 120 minutes , as former national coach sepp herberger once warned . but a tournament would n't be a tournament without losers .
next to the 2006 world champions and vice-world champions , italy and france , the biggest loser in the euro 2008 is uefa itself . uefa stumbles that may seem paradoxical , considering the 700-million-euro profit the european soccer association made from the event .
still , there are a few scratches on the shiny surface . of course , uefa could n't do anything about the bad weather that led to an embarrassing interruption of the global television broadcast .
but uefa is responsible for stipulating that all the cables had to run through vienna and that there was no viable backup . it 's also uefa 's fault that the quality of the grass was n't great and apparently had n't been tested under extreme conditions . uefa 's regulation overkill ruffled feathers in the austrian and swiss business communities and came to a head on the pitch with the completely senseless and unbearable patronizing of coaches on the sidelines - something germany coach joachim loew experienced personally . and finally , tv viewers felt they got the short end of the stick when they found out that uefa had prevented images it did n't like - such as those of a streaker or illegal fireworks in a stadium - from being broadcast . the 13th european championship is now history .
players and fans throughout europe , especially those in spain , can now celebrate .
it 's only those in uefa 's offices that should now take some time to ruminate and perhaps rework a few things for the next time . wolfgang van kann covers sports for deutsche welle -lrb- kjb , jam -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

his son would like for berlin to see a commemorative object put up in berlin to mark what he sees as his father 's contribution to ending the cold war . " we can envisage a large statue or bust , " reagan , 63 , told the german daily bild .
michael reagan is the founder the reagan legacy foundation , a non-profit organization whose goal is to promote his father 's ideas and memorialize his accomplishments .
ronald reagan died in 2004 . michael reagan is in berlin to put forward his plan and leading a discussion about a commemoration at berlin 's cafe einstein , a restaurant frequented by journalists . " we are just at the beginning of the process , " he said .

ronald reagan made his historic speech during a five-hour visit to berlin on a podium near the brandenburg gate , which was then cut off from west berlin by the berlin wall .
during the speech made in front of tens of thousands of west berlin residents , reagan addressed the then-soviet leader when he said : " mr. gorbachev , open this gate !
mr. gorbachev , tear down this wall ! " the berlin wall actually did fall 881 days later , an event that shocked the world . " i would welcome a visible remembrance of this great friend of the germans , " said frank henkel , secretary-general of the conservative christian democrats in berlin .
" i can image a large commemorative plaque with that quotation between the new us embassy and the brandenburg gate . " however , during president reagan 's visit , police were faced with massive protests against his rearmament policies .
large parts of kreuzberg district , a traditional enclave of the left in west berlin , were sealed off to prevent rioting . an editorial monday in the left-wing daily neues deutschland said reagan 's terms in office were marked by military build-up , the " star wars " missile defense project , weapons deals with iran , and the invasion of grenada .
the paper said reagan already has a us navy aircraft carrier named after him , which is more appropriate than a commemorate plaque or statue in berlin . dw staff -lrb- jam -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

michael reagan , a talk-show host and columnist in the us , is presenting his ideas in berlin on monday , june 30 . while ronald reagan 's famous speech at the brandenburg gate on june 12 , 1987 has entered the history books , the only commemoration of it is a few words on a plaque near the gate .
his son would like for berlin to see a commemorative object put up in berlin to mark what he sees as his father 's contribution to ending the cold war . " we can envisage a large statue or bust , " reagan , 63 , told the german daily bild .
michael reagan is the founder the reagan legacy foundation , a non-profit organization whose goal is to promote his father 's ideas and memorialize his accomplishments .
ronald reagan died in 2004 . michael reagan is in berlin to put forward his plan and leading a discussion about a commemoration at berlin 's cafe einstein , a restaurant frequented by journalists . " we are just at the beginning of the process , " he said .
" our foundation believes that an appropriate monument for president reagan 's speech at the brandenburg gate is of great historical value for berliners . " ' tear down this wall !

" i think we have to recognize the greater quality of the spanish team today , " germany coach joachim loew said after his side lost 1-0 to spain . " it -lrb- the defeat -rrb- will encourage us to continue working over the next two years and to improve some things ... in order to get to the 2010 world cup and to play a similar role here . " " possession and one-touch passes are the key in soccer , and that at high speed and under stress .
spain showed that it masters it very well , " loew said . " the best team won " german newspapers too were full of praise for spain , saying the side outclassed the germans on every count . " the artists from spain would n't let themselves be bullied around , " munich-based sueddeutsche zeitung wrote . " after a strong start germany lost their way . "
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : there was no stopping fernando torres as he scored in the 33rd minute " title dreams dashed , " the hamburger morgenpost wrote .
" after 60 minutes of sleep-inducing football and lots of defensive problems the team came to life too late .
thanks to lehmann because it could have been worse . "
germany 's most popular television soccer analyst , guenter netzer said in the end the best team won on sunday .
" congratulations to spain but also i tip my hat in respect to germany for even reaching the final , " netzer , who helped west germany win the european crown in 1972 , said .
" that 's a great success for the team .
spain were the best team throughout the tournament .
they played the best football , " he said .
" they showed us how limited we are , they showed us how to play soccer .
spain showed we have a lot of room to improve . "
germans started well , with miroslav klose missing a glorious opportunity after just four minutes , but then spain soon started to take control and on 33 minutes torres put spain ahead . germany had their chances in the second half but spain remained dangerous and held their nerve to win the championship 1-0 .
one mistake too many germany had come to euro 2008 with lots of ambitions but failed to make a lasting impression apart from a classy 3-2 against portugal in the quarter-finals .
the team was outwitted in a 2-1 defeat against croatia and outplayed for most of the match in the semi-final with turkey where only the famed fighting spirit earned them a 3-2 win .
captain michael ballack scored two goals but was unable to stamp his authority on the team as he finished runner-up for the 10th time in his career .
and there were only flashes of genius from the likes of lukas podolski or bastian schweinsteiger .
" it is always disappointing to reach and final and then lose , " ballack said on sunday , adding that the team " made one or two errors too many . "
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : ballack , left , and spain 's marco senna fight for the ball on sunday , the germans fumbled once too often with the ball , their play marked by flawed passes and defense lapses - a weakness ruthlessly exploited by their technically superior opponents .
midfielder thomas hitzlsperger too said his side 's inaccuracy proved their undoing .
" when you make mistakes at this level you get punished .
the spanish side are so good , so you ca n't afford to make any mistakes , " hitzlsperger said .
" we made too many that is why we lost . "
crushed fans the defeat led to disappointment for millions of german fans raring to celebrate their side 's triumph on sunday night .
fernando torres ' 33rd-minute winner silenced the more than 600,000 fans who crowded into the public viewing area near the brandenburg gate in berlin .
spain 's complete domination from midway in the second half onwards until the final whistle was greeted with admiration .
the final whistle resulted in no trouble as police in berlin and elsewhere said the fans left without incident . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : germany 's euro party ended with a whimper on sunday many fans even left before the final whistle , subdued or to beat the crowd on the way home as there was nothing to celebrate when the henri delaunay trophy was eventually given to spain captain iker casillas and not ballack . apart from the more than 600,000 in berlin , 70,000 fans watched the game in munich , frankfurt recorded 50,000 fans and hamburg 42,000 . despite the disappointment , hundreds of thousands of fans are set to turn up in berlin once again on monday when the team presents itself at the fan zone - empty-handed just like after the 2006 world cup third-place finish . uphill battle for loew coach loew now has his work cut out as he looks to preparing the team for the 2010 world cup in south africa . loew 's ideal is a fast game similar to that of spain , the netherlands or russia , but he faces an uphill battle because change must also come from an overly-hyped bundesliga . the showings of german clubs in europe highlights the problem , with bayer leverkusen and bayern munich blown away by andrei arshavin and his uefa cup-winning zenit st petersburg teammates .
germany last won a european title from bayern munich in 2001 and has not had a team in a continental final since 2002 .
munich has shown some class and a new trend in the league could start there as well now that former national coach juergen klinsmann starts his job as munich coach .
klinsmann revolutionized the germany team during his reign 2004-2006 and his assistant loew is now continuing his legacy as boss .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : loew faces challenges as he looks towards the 2010 world cup " jogi loew should continue his way , " german soccer icon franz beckenbauer wrote in his monday column for the bild daily .
apart from goalkeeper jens lehmann , whose future is unclear , loew has a core of a team which has now played two major events , some like ballack and defender christoph metzelder even featuring in the 2002 world cup final .
podolski and schweinsteiger will only be in their mid-20s by the time of the 2010 world cup , and newcomers who were n't quite good enough to make the euro squad - such as marko marin , jermaine jones and patrick helmes - could by then be regulars .
german chancellor angela merkel , who was in the stadium for the final said the team was gradually building on its play .
" third at the world cup and now second , that is something .
maybe we will improve again in south africa , " merkel said . " i told ballack that we have to wait a little longer until we can celebrate together , but that we are slowly getting there . " loew and his boys will have two excellent opportunities to check on any possible improvement - on october 11 and almost a year later on october 10 , 2009 , in the two world cup qualifying matches against russia . dw staff -lrb- sp -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

the court has not yet set a date to rule on the challenges . koehler 's functions are mainly ceremonial , but he has sometimes used his limited powers to block government legislation . the lisbon treaty which was rejected by irish voters in a referendum recently , plunging the bloc into constitutional crisis , is meant to streamline the eu 's institutions , simplify decision-making and give the eu more clout on the world stage . it also provides for a new double majority voting mechanism seen as essential if the 27-member bloc is to expand .
all 27 member states must approve the text before it can enter into force . koehler 's move has put germany in a tricky situation given that the european heavyweight had pressed eu nations to ratify the treaty as soon as possible after the irish rejection . ireland was the only eu member to hold a referendum on the treaty , in all other eu nations , the decision will be taken by the parliament .
nineteen nations have ratified the embattled lisbon treaty in parliament so far , most recently britain . challenge from the left in germany , both houses of parliament passed the law ratifiying the lisbon treaty with the two-thirds majority needed earlier this year . but it needs president koehler 's signature for the law to come into force . however , the lisbon treaty faces a challenge in germany by the left , a radical left-wing opposition party , and a member of the ultra-conservative christian social union . the left says the treaty infringes the principle of democracy and the rights of members of the german parliament .
it sees the treaty as giving too much power to the european council , the council of the heads of state and government , at the expense of national parliaments and the european parliament . in 2006 , koehler also delayed in signing off on a forerunner of the lisbon treaty .
that constitutional treaty subsequently collapsed when it was rejected by dutch and french voters . dw staff -lrb- sp -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

" i think we have to recognize the greater quality of the spanish team today , " germany coach joachim loew said after his side lost 1-0 to spain . " it -lrb- the defeat -rrb- will encourage us to continue working over the next two years and to improve some things ... in order to get to the 2010 world cup and to play a similar role here . " " possession and one-touch passes are the key in soccer , and that at high speed and under stress .
spain showed that it masters it very well , " loew said . " the best team won " german newspapers too were full of praise for spain , saying the side outclassed the germans on every count . " the artists from spain would n't let themselves be bullied around , " munich-based sueddeutsche zeitung wrote . " after a strong start germany lost their way . "
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : there was no stopping fernando torres as he scored in the 33rd minute " title dreams dashed , " the hamburger morgenpost wrote .
" after 60 minutes of sleep-inducing football and lots of defensive problems the team came to life too late .
thanks to lehmann because it could have been worse . "
germany 's most popular television soccer analyst , guenter netzer said in the end the best team won on sunday .
" congratulations to spain but also i tip my hat in respect to germany for even reaching the final , " netzer , who helped west germany win the european crown in 1972 , said .
" that 's a great success for the team .
spain were the best team throughout the tournament .
they played the best football , " he said .
" they showed us how limited we are , they showed us how to play soccer .
spain showed we have a lot of room to improve . "
germans started well , with miroslav klose missing a glorious opportunity after just four minutes , but then spain soon started to take control and on 33 minutes torres put spain ahead . germany had their chances in the second half but spain remained dangerous and held their nerve to win the championship 1-0 .
one mistake too many germany had come to euro 2008 with lots of ambitions but failed to make a lasting impression apart from a classy 3-2 against portugal in the quarter-finals .
the team was outwitted in a 2-1 defeat against croatia and outplayed for most of the match in the semi-final with turkey where only the famed fighting spirit earned them a 3-2 win .
captain michael ballack scored two goals but was unable to stamp his authority on the team as he finished runner-up for the 10th time in his career .
and there were only flashes of genius from the likes of lukas podolski or bastian schweinsteiger .
" it is always disappointing to reach and final and then lose , " ballack said on sunday , adding that the team " made one or two errors too many . "
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : ballack , left , and spain 's marco senna fight for the ball on sunday , the germans fumbled once too often with the ball , their play marked by flawed passes and defense lapses - a weakness ruthlessly exploited by their technically superior opponents .
midfielder thomas hitzlsperger too said his side 's inaccuracy proved their undoing .
" when you make mistakes at this level you get punished .
the spanish side are so good , so you ca n't afford to make any mistakes , " hitzlsperger said .
" we made too many that is why we lost . "
crushed fans the defeat led to disappointment for millions of german fans raring to celebrate their side 's triumph on sunday night .
fernando torres ' 33rd-minute winner silenced the more than 600,000 fans who crowded into the public viewing area near the brandenburg gate in berlin .
spain 's complete domination from midway in the second half onwards until the final whistle was greeted with admiration .
the final whistle resulted in no trouble as police in berlin and elsewhere said the fans left without incident . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : germany 's euro party ended with a whimper on sunday many fans even left before the final whistle , subdued or to beat the crowd on the way home as there was nothing to celebrate when the henri delaunay trophy was eventually given to spain captain iker casillas and not ballack . apart from the more than 600,000 in berlin , 70,000 fans watched the game in munich , frankfurt recorded 50,000 fans and hamburg 42,000 . despite the disappointment , hundreds of thousands of fans are set to turn up in berlin once again on monday when the team presents itself at the fan zone - empty-handed just like after the 2006 world cup third-place finish . uphill battle for loew coach loew now has his work cut out as he looks to preparing the team for the 2010 world cup in south africa . loew 's ideal is a fast game similar to that of spain , the netherlands or russia , but he faces an uphill battle because change must also come from an overly-hyped bundesliga . the showings of german clubs in europe highlights the problem , with bayer leverkusen and bayern munich blown away by andrei arshavin and his uefa cup-winning zenit st petersburg teammates .
germany last won a european title from bayern munich in 2001 and has not had a team in a continental final since 2002 .
munich has shown some class and a new trend in the league could start there as well now that former national coach juergen klinsmann starts his job as munich coach .
klinsmann revolutionized the germany team during his reign 2004-2006 and his assistant loew is now continuing his legacy as boss .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : loew faces challenges as he looks towards the 2010 world cup " jogi loew should continue his way , " german soccer icon franz beckenbauer wrote in his monday column for the bild daily .
apart from goalkeeper jens lehmann , whose future is unclear , loew has a core of a team which has now played two major events , some like ballack and defender christoph metzelder even featuring in the 2002 world cup final .
podolski and schweinsteiger will only be in their mid-20s by the time of the 2010 world cup , and newcomers who were n't quite good enough to make the euro squad - such as marko marin , jermaine jones and patrick helmes - could by then be regulars .
german chancellor angela merkel , who was in the stadium for the final said the team was gradually building on its play .
" third at the world cup and now second , that is something .
maybe we will improve again in south africa , " merkel said . " i told ballack that we have to wait a little longer until we can celebrate together , but that we are slowly getting there . " loew and his boys will have two excellent opportunities to check on any possible improvement - on october 11 and almost a year later on october 10 , 2009 , in the two world cup qualifying matches against russia . dw staff -lrb- sp -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

she was not ill , but afraid of having to go to a nursing home . robert kusch told reporters that the woman , from the city of wuerzburg , identified in press reports as bettina sch . , took a tranquilizer and malaria medication she obtained herself to end her life on saturday .
in order to prove that the woman , a former x-ray technician , had wanted to die , kusch showed reporters interviews with her which he had videotaped . " i have campaigned for a long time for self-determination until the very end , " he said to reporters in hamburg on monday , june 30 .
he said making one 's own decisions about life and death was a " central pillar of a modern society " and that determining one 's own end of life should not be something " only theoretically discussed in seminars . " robert kusch already stirred controversy in march of this year when he unveiled his " suicide machine , " a device that could deliver a deadly infusion of potassium chloride .
however , in this case , the machine was not used . sharp criticism the german hospice foundation has expressed indignation over kusch 's action , saying he is primarily interested in drawing attention to himself . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : robert kusch and his " suicide machine " " there is a right to life , there is also a right to die , but there is not a right to kill , " said eugen brysch , the foundation 's director , accusing kusch of abuse " people 's fears of old-age care " out of a " deep sense of narcissism . " according to german law , it is not illegal if someone is present at a person 's suicide , brysch said .
however , obtaining lethal medication for that individuals does violate the legal code .
brysch said that the upper house of parliament , the bundesrat , would discuss on friday a draft law that would ban commercial suicide services . policiticians and church leaders have also sharply criticized kusch .

the mediation follows a widely condemned one-candidate election . germany said on monday , june 30 , it hoped south africa , whose president thabo mbeki is heading the talks , would also back the nomination of a second mediator . " we will in the next days and weeks be watching very closely how things in southern africa develop , " said german foreign ministry spokesman martin jaeger . mbeki was called on to steer talks with the zimbabwean government after 84-year-old incumbent president robert mugabe won a landslide re-election last week .
the single-candidate poll , boycotted by opposition candidate morgan tsvangirai due to violent attacks on his supporters , has been panned a farce by the un and the much of the international community . the eu on monday denounced the vote as an " exercise in power-grabbing .

mugabe has been accused of widespread human rights abuses and of driving his country 's economy into the ground . the zimbabwean opposition movement for democratic change -lrb- mdc -rrb- on monday called on african union leaders , currently at a summit in egypt , to name a second mediator to join in the talks in a move to sideline mbeki 's much criticized efforts . " we want an au envoy who is a permanent mediator between the mdc and the zanu-pf to assist president mbeki , " said mdc spokesman george sibotshiwe . the situation in zimbabwe has topped the agenda at the egypt summit .

" heister told deutsche presse-agentur dpa that a german judge denied permission to tap the phones of heim relatives because it had not satisfied criteria under german criminal-investigation laws , and this had been confirmed on appeal . this setback was being taken out of context , he said . " we are very committed to this investigation and are working intensively on it , " the spokesman said , adding the german judges had mounted 11 requests since 2005 for foreign legal assistance as they try to track heim down . heim , who performed gruesome , fatal experiments on concentration-camp inmates , vanished in 1962 as arrest loomed and is suspected to be still alive and living under an assumed name in spain or latin america . heim tops the list of the 10 most-sought nazi criminals put out by the simon wiesenthal centre in jerusalem . a member of the ss force , heim was known for his sadism as a doctor at the nazi 's mauthausen concentration camp in austria .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de euro 2008 -pipe- 30.06.2008 opinion : uefa biggest loser in euro 2008 großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : with a victory for spain against germany in the final , euro 2008 has come to an end .
what kind of a tournament did it turn out to be ?
deutsche welle 's wolfgang van kann has these thoughts . that was it - the 13th european championship .
and , for the germans at least , it was n't quite the summer fairytale the 2006 world cup was . the weather gods were partly responsible for spoiling it , as were the small stadiums , which could n't draw as many fans into the two host countries .
most of all , however , the austrians and the swiss just did n't quite come through as hosts like the germans did two years ago . while the germans had opened their doors and hearts to guests from around the world , the austrians and swiss withdrew into their own four walls and observed the whole spectacle with suspicion . the fans did n't feel like it was " a time to make friends , " like the german motto in 2006 said . nevertheless , soccer was the focal point and , without a doubt , we experienced the best european soccer championship of all time .
the triumph of the defensive was celebrated in portugal in 2004 , but the euro 2008 was definitely the most offense-driven international tournament fans have ever seen . striking was the name of the game .
those who just tried not to lose a match were punished in the end - especially greece , the 2004 european champions .
statistics show that there were more scoring chances in the euro 2008 than in any other tournament and the final count of 77 goals in 31 games speaks for itself . great soccer , good sports bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : spain can celebrate ; uefa needs to look at what worked and what did n't for the most part , we saw beautiful , fast soccer played by real teams working together .
of course the top teams have their stars , but stars alone ca n't win a match these days .
they can only shine within a team that functions as a whole and presents itself as a single unit .
the alpine event marked the continuation of a trend that has been evident for some time . the euro was also quite sportsmanlike ; there was little hostility on the pitch and just three relatively painless red cards . what did we learn ?
european soccer is apparently going through a generational shift .
the old stars have had their time in the limelight and new names are come to the fore - like russia 's arshavin and pavlyuchenko or turkey 's nihat . what 's more , a strong start evidently does n't mean everything in a tournament and sending in the b-team can only backfire .
being the favorite is often too heavy a burden .
and turkey showed that a match really can last a whole 90 , or even 120 minutes , as former national coach sepp herberger once warned . but a tournament would n't be a tournament without losers .
next to the 2006 world champions and vice-world champions , italy and france , the biggest loser in the euro 2008 is uefa itself . uefa stumbles that may seem paradoxical , considering the 700-million-euro profit the european soccer association made from the event .
still , there are a few scratches on the shiny surface . of course , uefa could n't do anything about the bad weather that led to an embarrassing interruption of the global television broadcast .
but uefa is responsible for stipulating that all the cables had to run through vienna and that there was no viable backup . it 's also uefa 's fault that the quality of the grass was n't great and apparently had n't been tested under extreme conditions . uefa 's regulation overkill ruffled feathers in the austrian and swiss business communities and came to a head on the pitch with the completely senseless and unbearable patronizing of coaches on the sidelines - something germany coach joachim loew experienced personally . and finally , tv viewers felt they got the short end of the stick when they found out that uefa had prevented images it did n't like - such as those of a streaker or illegal fireworks in a stadium - from being broadcast . the 13th european championship is now history .
players and fans throughout europe , especially those in spain , can now celebrate .
it 's only those in uefa 's offices that should now take some time to ruminate and perhaps rework a few things for the next time . wolfgang van kann covers sports for deutsche welle -lrb- kjb , jam -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

" heister told deutsche presse-agentur dpa that a german judge denied permission to tap the phones of heim relatives because it had not satisfied criteria under german criminal-investigation laws , and this had been confirmed on appeal . this setback was being taken out of context , he said . " we are very committed to this investigation and are working intensively on it , " the spokesman said , adding the german judges had mounted 11 requests since 2005 for foreign legal assistance as they try to track heim down . heim , who performed gruesome , fatal experiments on concentration-camp inmates , vanished in 1962 as arrest loomed and is suspected to be still alive and living under an assumed name in spain or latin america . heim tops the list of the 10 most-sought nazi criminals put out by the simon wiesenthal centre in jerusalem . a member of the ss force , heim was known for his sadism as a doctor at the nazi 's mauthausen concentration camp in austria .
heim is alleged to have killed hundreds of inmates in authausen with injections into their hearts .
a total of 310,000 euros is being offered as a reward for his arrest . there have been reported sightings of him over the years .
if he is still alive , he would have celebrated his 94th birthday on saturday . dpa news agency -lrb- sp -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

what kind of a tournament did it turn out to be ?
deutsche welle 's wolfgang van kann has these thoughts . that was it - the 13th european championship .
and , for the germans at least , it was n't quite the summer fairytale the 2006 world cup was . the weather gods were partly responsible for spoiling it , as were the small stadiums , which could n't draw as many fans into the two host countries .
most of all , however , the austrians and the swiss just did n't quite come through as hosts like the germans did two years ago . while the germans had opened their doors and hearts to guests from around the world , the austrians and swiss withdrew into their own four walls and observed the whole spectacle with suspicion . the fans did n't feel like it was " a time to make friends , " like the german motto in 2006 said . nevertheless , soccer was the focal point and , without a doubt , we experienced the best european soccer championship of all time .
the triumph of the defensive was celebrated in portugal in 2004 , but the euro 2008 was definitely the most offense-driven international tournament fans have ever seen . striking was the name of the game .
those who just tried not to lose a match were punished in the end - especially greece , the 2004 european champions .
statistics show that there were more scoring chances in the euro 2008 than in any other tournament and the final count of 77 goals in 31 games speaks for itself . great soccer , good sports bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : spain can celebrate ; uefa needs to look at what worked and what did n't for the most part , we saw beautiful , fast soccer played by real teams working together .
of course the top teams have their stars , but stars alone ca n't win a match these days .
they can only shine within a team that functions as a whole and presents itself as a single unit .
the alpine event marked the continuation of a trend that has been evident for some time . the euro was also quite sportsmanlike ; there was little hostility on the pitch and just three relatively painless red cards . what did we learn ?
european soccer is apparently going through a generational shift .
the old stars have had their time in the limelight and new names are come to the fore - like russia 's arshavin and pavlyuchenko or turkey 's nihat . what 's more , a strong start evidently does n't mean everything in a tournament and sending in the b-team can only backfire .
being the favorite is often too heavy a burden .
and turkey showed that a match really can last a whole 90 , or even 120 minutes , as former national coach sepp herberger once warned . but a tournament would n't be a tournament without losers .
next to the 2006 world champions and vice-world champions , italy and france , the biggest loser in the euro 2008 is uefa itself . uefa stumbles that may seem paradoxical , considering the 700-million-euro profit the european soccer association made from the event .
still , there are a few scratches on the shiny surface . of course , uefa could n't do anything about the bad weather that led to an embarrassing interruption of the global television broadcast .
but uefa is responsible for stipulating that all the cables had to run through vienna and that there was no viable backup . it 's also uefa 's fault that the quality of the grass was n't great and apparently had n't been tested under extreme conditions . uefa 's regulation overkill ruffled feathers in the austrian and swiss business communities and came to a head on the pitch with the completely senseless and unbearable patronizing of coaches on the sidelines - something germany coach joachim loew experienced personally . and finally , tv viewers felt they got the short end of the stick when they found out that uefa had prevented images it did n't like - such as those of a streaker or illegal fireworks in a stadium - from being broadcast . the 13th european championship is now history .
players and fans throughout europe , especially those in spain , can now celebrate .

what kind of a tournament did it turn out to be ?
deutsche welle 's wolfgang van kann has these thoughts . that was it - the 13th european championship .
and , for the germans at least , it was n't quite the summer fairytale the 2006 world cup was . the weather gods were partly responsible for spoiling it , as were the small stadiums , which could n't draw as many fans into the two host countries .
most of all , however , the austrians and the swiss just did n't quite come through as hosts like the germans did two years ago . while the germans had opened their doors and hearts to guests from around the world , the austrians and swiss withdrew into their own four walls and observed the whole spectacle with suspicion . the fans did n't feel like it was " a time to make friends , " like the german motto in 2006 said . nevertheless , soccer was the focal point and , without a doubt , we experienced the best european soccer championship of all time .
the triumph of the defensive was celebrated in portugal in 2004 , but the euro 2008 was definitely the most offense-driven international tournament fans have ever seen . striking was the name of the game .
those who just tried not to lose a match were punished in the end - especially greece , the 2004 european champions .
statistics show that there were more scoring chances in the euro 2008 than in any other tournament and the final count of 77 goals in 31 games speaks for itself . great soccer , good sports bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : spain can celebrate ; uefa needs to look at what worked and what did n't for the most part , we saw beautiful , fast soccer played by real teams working together .
of course the top teams have their stars , but stars alone ca n't win a match these days .
they can only shine within a team that functions as a whole and presents itself as a single unit .
the alpine event marked the continuation of a trend that has been evident for some time . the euro was also quite sportsmanlike ; there was little hostility on the pitch and just three relatively painless red cards . what did we learn ?
european soccer is apparently going through a generational shift .
the old stars have had their time in the limelight and new names are come to the fore - like russia 's arshavin and pavlyuchenko or turkey 's nihat . what 's more , a strong start evidently does n't mean everything in a tournament and sending in the b-team can only backfire .
being the favorite is often too heavy a burden .
and turkey showed that a match really can last a whole 90 , or even 120 minutes , as former national coach sepp herberger once warned . but a tournament would n't be a tournament without losers .
next to the 2006 world champions and vice-world champions , italy and france , the biggest loser in the euro 2008 is uefa itself . uefa stumbles that may seem paradoxical , considering the 700-million-euro profit the european soccer association made from the event .
still , there are a few scratches on the shiny surface . of course , uefa could n't do anything about the bad weather that led to an embarrassing interruption of the global television broadcast .
but uefa is responsible for stipulating that all the cables had to run through vienna and that there was no viable backup . it 's also uefa 's fault that the quality of the grass was n't great and apparently had n't been tested under extreme conditions . uefa 's regulation overkill ruffled feathers in the austrian and swiss business communities and came to a head on the pitch with the completely senseless and unbearable patronizing of coaches on the sidelines - something germany coach joachim loew experienced personally . and finally , tv viewers felt they got the short end of the stick when they found out that uefa had prevented images it did n't like - such as those of a streaker or illegal fireworks in a stadium - from being broadcast . the 13th european championship is now history .
players and fans throughout europe , especially those in spain , can now celebrate .
it 's only those in uefa 's offices that should now take some time to ruminate and perhaps rework a few things for the next time . wolfgang van kann covers sports for deutsche welle -lrb- kjb , jam -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

that 's just fine , says dw 's stefan nestler . the tournament 's best team is european champion .
enough said .
the spanish have overcome their tournament trauma and have finally been rewarded for their fascinating soccer .
they were the strongest of all 16 teams .
they offered refreshing , modern offensive soccer at the highest technical level .
they did so not just in a couple of matches , but throughout the entire tournament . the spanish were simply too much to handle for the german team .
in fact , the defeat should have been much clearer .
apart from 15 good minutes at the beginning , ballack and co. were completely disappointing . from a german point of view , the final was almost a logical end to the past three weeks . the " mountain tour " ended up in several valleys before getting stuck just below the summit .
a promising start against poland was followed by an unacceptable defeat against croatia .
a rather weak austria helped to build up the germans , who outdid themselves in the quarter-final match against portugal , one of the tournament favorites . in the semi-final , germany shrank back to a team that made the most out of very little .
it clearly was n't enough to surprise , let along defeat the outstanding spanish . what 's true for the team is also true for individual players .
no one was constantly good and all had their weak moments .
goalkeeper jens lehmann fluttered more than the ball up to the semi-final .
defender christoph metzelder 's beard might have grown during the tournament , but he did n't get any faster .
per mertesacker also seemed too slow too many times .
midfielder michael ballack was not at his best in several games , including the final .
people should be able to expect more of a top player than that . germany 's much-praised strikers , miroslav klose and mario gomez , did n't manage to achieve much .
the only ones that fulfilled expectations - at least to some extent - were bastian schweinsteiger , lukas podolski and philipp lahm .
but even they did n't shine . germany 's reaching the final should not cover up the fact that the german team is able to do much more than it showed during euro 2008 . the team should focus on strengths that have been developed in recent years : to base attacks with quick combination moves on a sound defense and close the deal decisively . the spanish played like this in the final .

that 's just fine , says dw 's stefan nestler . the tournament 's best team is european champion .
enough said .
the spanish have overcome their tournament trauma and have finally been rewarded for their fascinating soccer .
they were the strongest of all 16 teams .
they offered refreshing , modern offensive soccer at the highest technical level .
they did so not just in a couple of matches , but throughout the entire tournament . the spanish were simply too much to handle for the german team .
in fact , the defeat should have been much clearer .
apart from 15 good minutes at the beginning , ballack and co. were completely disappointing . from a german point of view , the final was almost a logical end to the past three weeks . the " mountain tour " ended up in several valleys before getting stuck just below the summit .
a promising start against poland was followed by an unacceptable defeat against croatia .
a rather weak austria helped to build up the germans , who outdid themselves in the quarter-final match against portugal , one of the tournament favorites . in the semi-final , germany shrank back to a team that made the most out of very little .
it clearly was n't enough to surprise , let along defeat the outstanding spanish . what 's true for the team is also true for individual players .
no one was constantly good and all had their weak moments .
goalkeeper jens lehmann fluttered more than the ball up to the semi-final .
defender christoph metzelder 's beard might have grown during the tournament , but he did n't get any faster .
per mertesacker also seemed too slow too many times .
midfielder michael ballack was not at his best in several games , including the final .
people should be able to expect more of a top player than that . germany 's much-praised strikers , miroslav klose and mario gomez , did n't manage to achieve much .
the only ones that fulfilled expectations - at least to some extent - were bastian schweinsteiger , lukas podolski and philipp lahm .
but even they did n't shine . germany 's reaching the final should not cover up the fact that the german team is able to do much more than it showed during euro 2008 . the team should focus on strengths that have been developed in recent years : to base attacks with quick combination moves on a sound defense and close the deal decisively . the spanish played like this in the final .

his son would like for berlin to see a commemorative object put up in berlin to mark what he sees as his father 's contribution to ending the cold war . " we can envisage a large statue or bust , " reagan , 63 , told the german daily bild .
michael reagan is the founder the reagan legacy foundation , a non-profit organization whose goal is to promote his father 's ideas and memorialize his accomplishments .
ronald reagan died in 2004 . michael reagan is in berlin to put forward his plan and leading a discussion about a commemoration at berlin 's cafe einstein , a restaurant frequented by journalists . " we are just at the beginning of the process , " he said .

" i think we have to recognize the greater quality of the spanish team today , " germany coach joachim loew said after his side lost 1-0 to spain . " it -lrb- the defeat -rrb- will encourage us to continue working over the next two years and to improve some things ... in order to get to the 2010 world cup and to play a similar role here . " " possession and one-touch passes are the key in soccer , and that at high speed and under stress .
spain showed that it masters it very well , " loew said . " the best team won " german newspapers too were full of praise for spain , saying the side outclassed the germans on every count . " the artists from spain would n't let themselves be bullied around , " munich-based sueddeutsche zeitung wrote . " after a strong start germany lost their way . "
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : there was no stopping fernando torres as he scored in the 33rd minute " title dreams dashed , " the hamburger morgenpost wrote .
" after 60 minutes of sleep-inducing football and lots of defensive problems the team came to life too late .
thanks to lehmann because it could have been worse . "
germany 's most popular television soccer analyst , guenter netzer said in the end the best team won on sunday .
" congratulations to spain but also i tip my hat in respect to germany for even reaching the final , " netzer , who helped west germany win the european crown in 1972 , said .
" that 's a great success for the team .
spain were the best team throughout the tournament .
they played the best football , " he said .
" they showed us how limited we are , they showed us how to play soccer .
spain showed we have a lot of room to improve . "
germans started well , with miroslav klose missing a glorious opportunity after just four minutes , but then spain soon started to take control and on 33 minutes torres put spain ahead . germany had their chances in the second half but spain remained dangerous and held their nerve to win the championship 1-0 .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de european union -pipe- 30.06.2008 german president suspends ratification of eu lisbon treaty großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : germany is a strong proponent of eu reform and the lisbon treaty german president koehler has put on hold his country 's ratification of the eu 's lisbon treaty until the highest court has ruled on legal challenges to the text in a move that imperils germany 's eu reform plans . german president horst koehler will not sign off on the ratification of the embattled eu 's lisbon treaty until the country 's constitutional court decides whether the reform accord is compatible with the country 's basic law , his office said on monday , june 30 . koehler has decided to heed a request from the constitutional court not to add his signature to the embattled reform treaty pending its ruling , his office said in a statement . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : koehler 's move has put pro-eu reform germany in an awkward situation " the president is respecting the request of the constitutional court , " the statement added .
the court has not yet set a date to rule on the challenges . koehler 's functions are mainly ceremonial , but he has sometimes used his limited powers to block government legislation . the lisbon treaty which was rejected by irish voters in a referendum recently , plunging the bloc into constitutional crisis , is meant to streamline the eu 's institutions , simplify decision-making and give the eu more clout on the world stage . it also provides for a new double majority voting mechanism seen as essential if the 27-member bloc is to expand .
all 27 member states must approve the text before it can enter into force . koehler 's move has put germany in a tricky situation given that the european heavyweight had pressed eu nations to ratify the treaty as soon as possible after the irish rejection . ireland was the only eu member to hold a referendum on the treaty , in all other eu nations , the decision will be taken by the parliament .

" i think we have to recognize the greater quality of the spanish team today , " germany coach joachim loew said after his side lost 1-0 to spain . " it -lrb- the defeat -rrb- will encourage us to continue working over the next two years and to improve some things ... in order to get to the 2010 world cup and to play a similar role here . " " possession and one-touch passes are the key in soccer , and that at high speed and under stress .
spain showed that it masters it very well , " loew said . " the best team won " german newspapers too were full of praise for spain , saying the side outclassed the germans on every count . " the artists from spain would n't let themselves be bullied around , " munich-based sueddeutsche zeitung wrote . " after a strong start germany lost their way . "
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : there was no stopping fernando torres as he scored in the 33rd minute " title dreams dashed , " the hamburger morgenpost wrote .
" after 60 minutes of sleep-inducing football and lots of defensive problems the team came to life too late .
thanks to lehmann because it could have been worse . "
germany 's most popular television soccer analyst , guenter netzer said in the end the best team won on sunday .
" congratulations to spain but also i tip my hat in respect to germany for even reaching the final , " netzer , who helped west germany win the european crown in 1972 , said .
" that 's a great success for the team .
spain were the best team throughout the tournament .
they played the best football , " he said .
" they showed us how limited we are , they showed us how to play soccer .
spain showed we have a lot of room to improve . "
germans started well , with miroslav klose missing a glorious opportunity after just four minutes , but then spain soon started to take control and on 33 minutes torres put spain ahead . germany had their chances in the second half but spain remained dangerous and held their nerve to win the championship 1-0 .
one mistake too many germany had come to euro 2008 with lots of ambitions but failed to make a lasting impression apart from a classy 3-2 against portugal in the quarter-finals .
the team was outwitted in a 2-1 defeat against croatia and outplayed for most of the match in the semi-final with turkey where only the famed fighting spirit earned them a 3-2 win .
captain michael ballack scored two goals but was unable to stamp his authority on the team as he finished runner-up for the 10th time in his career .
and there were only flashes of genius from the likes of lukas podolski or bastian schweinsteiger .
" it is always disappointing to reach and final and then lose , " ballack said on sunday , adding that the team " made one or two errors too many . "
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : ballack , left , and spain 's marco senna fight for the ball on sunday , the germans fumbled once too often with the ball , their play marked by flawed passes and defense lapses - a weakness ruthlessly exploited by their technically superior opponents .
midfielder thomas hitzlsperger too said his side 's inaccuracy proved their undoing .
" when you make mistakes at this level you get punished .
the spanish side are so good , so you ca n't afford to make any mistakes , " hitzlsperger said .
" we made too many that is why we lost . "
crushed fans the defeat led to disappointment for millions of german fans raring to celebrate their side 's triumph on sunday night .
fernando torres ' 33rd-minute winner silenced the more than 600,000 fans who crowded into the public viewing area near the brandenburg gate in berlin .
spain 's complete domination from midway in the second half onwards until the final whistle was greeted with admiration .
the final whistle resulted in no trouble as police in berlin and elsewhere said the fans left without incident . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : germany 's euro party ended with a whimper on sunday many fans even left before the final whistle , subdued or to beat the crowd on the way home as there was nothing to celebrate when the henri delaunay trophy was eventually given to spain captain iker casillas and not ballack . apart from the more than 600,000 in berlin , 70,000 fans watched the game in munich , frankfurt recorded 50,000 fans and hamburg 42,000 . despite the disappointment , hundreds of thousands of fans are set to turn up in berlin once again on monday when the team presents itself at the fan zone - empty-handed just like after the 2006 world cup third-place finish . uphill battle for loew coach loew now has his work cut out as he looks to preparing the team for the 2010 world cup in south africa . loew 's ideal is a fast game similar to that of spain , the netherlands or russia , but he faces an uphill battle because change must also come from an overly-hyped bundesliga . the showings of german clubs in europe highlights the problem , with bayer leverkusen and bayern munich blown away by andrei arshavin and his uefa cup-winning zenit st petersburg teammates .
germany last won a european title from bayern munich in 2001 and has not had a team in a continental final since 2002 .
munich has shown some class and a new trend in the league could start there as well now that former national coach juergen klinsmann starts his job as munich coach .
klinsmann revolutionized the germany team during his reign 2004-2006 and his assistant loew is now continuing his legacy as boss .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : loew faces challenges as he looks towards the 2010 world cup " jogi loew should continue his way , " german soccer icon franz beckenbauer wrote in his monday column for the bild daily .
apart from goalkeeper jens lehmann , whose future is unclear , loew has a core of a team which has now played two major events , some like ballack and defender christoph metzelder even featuring in the 2002 world cup final .
podolski and schweinsteiger will only be in their mid-20s by the time of the 2010 world cup , and newcomers who were n't quite good enough to make the euro squad - such as marko marin , jermaine jones and patrick helmes - could by then be regulars .
german chancellor angela merkel , who was in the stadium for the final said the team was gradually building on its play .
" third at the world cup and now second , that is something .
maybe we will improve again in south africa , " merkel said . " i told ballack that we have to wait a little longer until we can celebrate together , but that we are slowly getting there . " loew and his boys will have two excellent opportunities to check on any possible improvement - on october 11 and almost a year later on october 10 , 2009 , in the two world cup qualifying matches against russia . dw staff -lrb- sp -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

" i think we have to recognize the greater quality of the spanish team today , " germany coach joachim loew said after his side lost 1-0 to spain . " it -lrb- the defeat -rrb- will encourage us to continue working over the next two years and to improve some things ... in order to get to the 2010 world cup and to play a similar role here . " " possession and one-touch passes are the key in soccer , and that at high speed and under stress .
spain showed that it masters it very well , " loew said . " the best team won " german newspapers too were full of praise for spain , saying the side outclassed the germans on every count . " the artists from spain would n't let themselves be bullied around , " munich-based sueddeutsche zeitung wrote . " after a strong start germany lost their way . "
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : there was no stopping fernando torres as he scored in the 33rd minute " title dreams dashed , " the hamburger morgenpost wrote .
" after 60 minutes of sleep-inducing football and lots of defensive problems the team came to life too late .
thanks to lehmann because it could have been worse . "
germany 's most popular television soccer analyst , guenter netzer said in the end the best team won on sunday .
" congratulations to spain but also i tip my hat in respect to germany for even reaching the final , " netzer , who helped west germany win the european crown in 1972 , said .
" that 's a great success for the team .
spain were the best team throughout the tournament .
they played the best football , " he said .
" they showed us how limited we are , they showed us how to play soccer .
spain showed we have a lot of room to improve . "
germans started well , with miroslav klose missing a glorious opportunity after just four minutes , but then spain soon started to take control and on 33 minutes torres put spain ahead . germany had their chances in the second half but spain remained dangerous and held their nerve to win the championship 1-0 .
one mistake too many germany had come to euro 2008 with lots of ambitions but failed to make a lasting impression apart from a classy 3-2 against portugal in the quarter-finals .
the team was outwitted in a 2-1 defeat against croatia and outplayed for most of the match in the semi-final with turkey where only the famed fighting spirit earned them a 3-2 win .
captain michael ballack scored two goals but was unable to stamp his authority on the team as he finished runner-up for the 10th time in his career .
and there were only flashes of genius from the likes of lukas podolski or bastian schweinsteiger .
" it is always disappointing to reach and final and then lose , " ballack said on sunday , adding that the team " made one or two errors too many . "
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : ballack , left , and spain 's marco senna fight for the ball on sunday , the germans fumbled once too often with the ball , their play marked by flawed passes and defense lapses - a weakness ruthlessly exploited by their technically superior opponents .
midfielder thomas hitzlsperger too said his side 's inaccuracy proved their undoing .
" when you make mistakes at this level you get punished .
the spanish side are so good , so you ca n't afford to make any mistakes , " hitzlsperger said .
" we made too many that is why we lost . "
crushed fans the defeat led to disappointment for millions of german fans raring to celebrate their side 's triumph on sunday night .
fernando torres ' 33rd-minute winner silenced the more than 600,000 fans who crowded into the public viewing area near the brandenburg gate in berlin .
spain 's complete domination from midway in the second half onwards until the final whistle was greeted with admiration .
the final whistle resulted in no trouble as police in berlin and elsewhere said the fans left without incident . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : germany 's euro party ended with a whimper on sunday many fans even left before the final whistle , subdued or to beat the crowd on the way home as there was nothing to celebrate when the henri delaunay trophy was eventually given to spain captain iker casillas and not ballack . apart from the more than 600,000 in berlin , 70,000 fans watched the game in munich , frankfurt recorded 50,000 fans and hamburg 42,000 . despite the disappointment , hundreds of thousands of fans are set to turn up in berlin once again on monday when the team presents itself at the fan zone - empty-handed just like after the 2006 world cup third-place finish . uphill battle for loew coach loew now has his work cut out as he looks to preparing the team for the 2010 world cup in south africa . loew 's ideal is a fast game similar to that of spain , the netherlands or russia , but he faces an uphill battle because change must also come from an overly-hyped bundesliga . the showings of german clubs in europe highlights the problem , with bayer leverkusen and bayern munich blown away by andrei arshavin and his uefa cup-winning zenit st petersburg teammates .
germany last won a european title from bayern munich in 2001 and has not had a team in a continental final since 2002 .
munich has shown some class and a new trend in the league could start there as well now that former national coach juergen klinsmann starts his job as munich coach .
klinsmann revolutionized the germany team during his reign 2004-2006 and his assistant loew is now continuing his legacy as boss .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : loew faces challenges as he looks towards the 2010 world cup " jogi loew should continue his way , " german soccer icon franz beckenbauer wrote in his monday column for the bild daily .
apart from goalkeeper jens lehmann , whose future is unclear , loew has a core of a team which has now played two major events , some like ballack and defender christoph metzelder even featuring in the 2002 world cup final .
podolski and schweinsteiger will only be in their mid-20s by the time of the 2010 world cup , and newcomers who were n't quite good enough to make the euro squad - such as marko marin , jermaine jones and patrick helmes - could by then be regulars .
german chancellor angela merkel , who was in the stadium for the final said the team was gradually building on its play .
" third at the world cup and now second , that is something .
maybe we will improve again in south africa , " merkel said . " i told ballack that we have to wait a little longer until we can celebrate together , but that we are slowly getting there . " loew and his boys will have two excellent opportunities to check on any possible improvement - on october 11 and almost a year later on october 10 , 2009 , in the two world cup qualifying matches against russia . dw staff -lrb- sp -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

she was not ill , but afraid of having to go to a nursing home . robert kusch told reporters that the woman , from the city of wuerzburg , identified in press reports as bettina sch . , took a tranquilizer and malaria medication she obtained herself to end her life on saturday .

he said making one 's own decisions about life and death was a " central pillar of a modern society " and that determining one 's own end of life should not be something " only theoretically discussed in seminars . " robert kusch already stirred controversy in march of this year when he unveiled his " suicide machine , " a device that could deliver a deadly infusion of potassium chloride .

" according to german law , it is not illegal if someone is present at a person 's suicide , brysch said .
however , obtaining lethal medication for that individuals does violate the legal code .
brysch said that the upper house of parliament , the bundesrat , would discuss on friday a draft law that would ban commercial suicide services . policiticians and church leaders have also sharply criticized kusch .
green party politician and vice-president of the bundestag , katrin göring-eckardt , called kusch 's action " completely inacceptable . " the protestant bishop of hamburg , maria jepsen , told the epd news agency that her church rejects kusch 's approach , saying the form of assisted suicide he is endorsing violates human dignity and christian responsibility . hamburg 's prosecutor 's office has begun a preliminary investigation into kusch 's action . dw staff -lrb- jam -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

deutsche welle 's wolfgang van kann has these thoughts . that was it - the 13th european championship .
and , for the germans at least , it was n't quite the summer fairytale the 2006 world cup was . the weather gods were partly responsible for spoiling it , as were the small stadiums , which could n't draw as many fans into the two host countries .
most of all , however , the austrians and the swiss just did n't quite come through as hosts like the germans did two years ago . while the germans had opened their doors and hearts to guests from around the world , the austrians and swiss withdrew into their own four walls and observed the whole spectacle with suspicion . the fans did n't feel like it was " a time to make friends , " like the german motto in 2006 said . nevertheless , soccer was the focal point and , without a doubt , we experienced the best european soccer championship of all time .
the triumph of the defensive was celebrated in portugal in 2004 , but the euro 2008 was definitely the most offense-driven international tournament fans have ever seen . striking was the name of the game .
those who just tried not to lose a match were punished in the end - especially greece , the 2004 european champions .
statistics show that there were more scoring chances in the euro 2008 than in any other tournament and the final count of 77 goals in 31 games speaks for itself . great soccer , good sports bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : spain can celebrate ; uefa needs to look at what worked and what did n't for the most part , we saw beautiful , fast soccer played by real teams working together .
of course the top teams have their stars , but stars alone ca n't win a match these days .
they can only shine within a team that functions as a whole and presents itself as a single unit .
the alpine event marked the continuation of a trend that has been evident for some time . the euro was also quite sportsmanlike ; there was little hostility on the pitch and just three relatively painless red cards . what did we learn ?
european soccer is apparently going through a generational shift .
the old stars have had their time in the limelight and new names are come to the fore - like russia 's arshavin and pavlyuchenko or turkey 's nihat . what 's more , a strong start evidently does n't mean everything in a tournament and sending in the b-team can only backfire .
being the favorite is often too heavy a burden .
and turkey showed that a match really can last a whole 90 , or even 120 minutes , as former national coach sepp herberger once warned . but a tournament would n't be a tournament without losers .
next to the 2006 world champions and vice-world champions , italy and france , the biggest loser in the euro 2008 is uefa itself . uefa stumbles that may seem paradoxical , considering the 700-million-euro profit the european soccer association made from the event .
still , there are a few scratches on the shiny surface . of course , uefa could n't do anything about the bad weather that led to an embarrassing interruption of the global television broadcast .
but uefa is responsible for stipulating that all the cables had to run through vienna and that there was no viable backup . it 's also uefa 's fault that the quality of the grass was n't great and apparently had n't been tested under extreme conditions . uefa 's regulation overkill ruffled feathers in the austrian and swiss business communities and came to a head on the pitch with the completely senseless and unbearable patronizing of coaches on the sidelines - something germany coach joachim loew experienced personally . and finally , tv viewers felt they got the short end of the stick when they found out that uefa had prevented images it did n't like - such as those of a streaker or illegal fireworks in a stadium - from being broadcast . the 13th european championship is now history .
players and fans throughout europe , especially those in spain , can now celebrate .
it 's only those in uefa 's offices that should now take some time to ruminate and perhaps rework a few things for the next time . wolfgang van kann covers sports for deutsche welle -lrb- kjb , jam -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

" heister told deutsche presse-agentur dpa that a german judge denied permission to tap the phones of heim relatives because it had not satisfied criteria under german criminal-investigation laws , and this had been confirmed on appeal . this setback was being taken out of context , he said . " we are very committed to this investigation and are working intensively on it , " the spokesman said , adding the german judges had mounted 11 requests since 2005 for foreign legal assistance as they try to track heim down . heim , who performed gruesome , fatal experiments on concentration-camp inmates , vanished in 1962 as arrest loomed and is suspected to be still alive and living under an assumed name in spain or latin america . heim tops the list of the 10 most-sought nazi criminals put out by the simon wiesenthal centre in jerusalem . a member of the ss force , heim was known for his sadism as a doctor at the nazi 's mauthausen concentration camp in austria .
heim is alleged to have killed hundreds of inmates in authausen with injections into their hearts .
a total of 310,000 euros is being offered as a reward for his arrest . there have been reported sightings of him over the years .
if he is still alive , he would have celebrated his 94th birthday on saturday . dpa news agency -lrb- sp -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

among them : balkan diplomacy and the birth of the kosovar state . drawing the balkans closer to europe as a former yugoslav state itself , it came as no huge surprise that slovenia vehemently encouraged the eu not only to recognize kosovo as an independent state but also to smooth the way for serbia 's future membership in the bloc . after snap elections in serbia , tensions relaxed a bit and the eu signed a stabilization and association agreement with both serbia and bosnia-herzegovina - a major step toward eu membership for both countries . as for kosovo , russian concerns prevented the eu from taking over the political supervision of the fledgling country , but the bloc continues to be integrally involved in the un mission . slovenia " handled -lsb- kosovo 's independence -rsb- well , considering the initial qualms and divisions between eu member states or whether to recognize or not , " said davis . irish no a blow to eu leaders bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : slovenia was n't blamed for the irish no to the lisbon treaty the second major issue dominating the slovenian presidency was the irish no vote in june on the bloc 's lisbon treaty .
davis said the vote , which raised existential concerns over the bloc 's future , " had to do with conditions in ireland " and could n't be blamed on slovenia . slovenian prime minister janez jansa said he regrets that he and the bloc 's 26 other heads-of-state were n't able to sufficiently promote europe to its residents . " we need to change the negative attitude toward european institutions , " he said .
" we need a european identity . " mep questions eu connection to the people jansa and his relatively small team managed to push through new laws on unified work times for eu institutions - after 14 years of discussion on the matter .
they also put in motion the first part of a common asylum law , founded a joint eu-mediterranean university , and opened dialogue with latin america on climate change , food production and energy security . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : jansa said a stronger european identity is needed eu parliamentarian jo leinen , a member of germany 's social democratic party , said that slovenia and the rest of the eu states have n't recognized the people 's true concerns . " food prices , energy prices , credit crisis , and high managers ' salaries - the people are worried about lots of things , but we either get around to them too late or just make half-hearted decisions , " he said .
" europe has to be useful to the people , it has to protect the people , and then they will also support and follow us . " a euro team at the next euro ? european commission president jose manuel barroso , on the other hand , praised the slovenian presidency for its effectiveness - a quality some observers in brussels do n't expect from its french successors . " if all the member states applied the same principles -lsb- as slovenia -rsb- , the european union would overcome many of its difficulties , " said barroso . in his final speech as head of 27-member bloc , which coincided with the end of the european soccer championship , jansa quipped that the eu should send its own soccer team to the next euro . then at least the eu would get a little attention . bernd riegert -lrb- kjb -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

midfielder bastian schweinsteiger appeared to cries of " schweini schweini " from many of the young girls among the crowd as captain michael ballack and stars , lukas podolski and miroslav klose too were cheered on enthusiastically .
" the atmosphere in germany was fantastic .
we hope to bring home a cup in the future , " schweinsteiger , the popular bayern munich midfielder , said .
" you are the best " read one of the countless banners in the crowd of some 300,000 and some fans had even brought a replica of the cup with the writing " thank you " on it .

it is important for our young team , " ballack said .
" it is great for us that we could delight the fans even though we lost .
it is an amazing feeling and gives me goose bumps , " goalkeeper jens lehmann said .
germany full of praise for spain despite not always shining on the pitch , the german team had created another soccer frenzy in germany which sometimes came close to that from the 2006 home world cup in which germany finished third .
hundreds of thousands of fans watched the games from austria and switzerland in the country 's public viewing areas , with more than 500,000 on hand in berlin alone for the german 3-2 semi-final win over turkey and the final .
the fans at least partly cheered up the players , but no complaints were heard and read in the country after germany not simply lost the euro 2008 final 1-0 to spain but was comprehensively outplayed on sunday in vienna .
" spain 's victory .

the paper said that " soccer was the winner " on the night as the german euphoria somewhat hid the fact that the team had only rarely showed its class in the six matches in austria and switzerland .
former germany coach juergen klinsmann said that spain was " considerably better " on the night and german soccer icon franz beckenbauer said in his monday column for the bild daily that " spain dominated the tournament from the first match ... until yesterday 's final . "
other papers acknowledged as well that the better team had won but also looked back at germany 's run to the final .
" the end of the dream .
we are still proud of you , but spain was the better team , " said daily bild .
the hamburger abendblatt said : " only second - but it was still nice . "
slowly getting there the abendblatt recalled the soccer frenzy which had gripped the nation like at the 2006 home world cup and looked ahead , saying " maybe the happy end follows in 2010 " at the world cup in south africa , as germany was third at the 2006 world cup and now second at euro .
german chancellor angela merkel struck a similar note after attending the game in the vienna stadium .
" third at the world cup and now second , that is something .
maybe we will improve again in south africa , " said merkel .
" i told ballack that we have to wait a little longer until we can celebrate together but that we are slowly getting there . "
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : german soccer fans at the berlin fan mile large numbers of germans had celebrated in the fan zones ahead of the match , with the berlin zone closed some three hours before the kickoff as it was filled to its capacity with more than 600,000 fans .

the mediation follows a widely condemned one-candidate election . germany said on monday , june 30 , it hoped south africa , whose president thabo mbeki is heading the talks , would also back the nomination of a second mediator . " we will in the next days and weeks be watching very closely how things in southern africa develop , " said german foreign ministry spokesman martin jaeger . mbeki was called on to steer talks with the zimbabwean government after 84-year-old incumbent president robert mugabe won a landslide re-election last week .
the single-candidate poll , boycotted by opposition candidate morgan tsvangirai due to violent attacks on his supporters , has been panned a farce by the un and the much of the international community . the eu on monday denounced the vote as an " exercise in power-grabbing . " zimbabwe opposition appeals to african union bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : tsvangirai pulled out of the presidential race , leaving just one candidate mbeki , who has close personal ties to mugabe , has been widely criticized for his quiet diplomacy toward the zimbabwean regime .
mugabe has been accused of widespread human rights abuses and of driving his country 's economy into the ground . the zimbabwean opposition movement for democratic change -lrb- mdc -rrb- on monday called on african union leaders , currently at a summit in egypt , to name a second mediator to join in the talks in a move to sideline mbeki 's much criticized efforts . " we want an au envoy who is a permanent mediator between the mdc and the zanu-pf to assist president mbeki , " said mdc spokesman george sibotshiwe . the situation in zimbabwe has topped the agenda at the egypt summit .
african leaders criticized the vote , urging mugabe 's zanu-pf party to form a unity government with the mdc .
they are reportedly writing up possible power-sharing plans for the two parties . " africa must fully shoulder its responsibility and do everything in its power to help the zimbabwe parties work together so as to overcome current challenges , " au commission chief jean ping said at the opening of the summit . the union 's 53 members have yet to reach consensus on what action to take . europe open to zimbabwe sanctions the german foreign ministry spokesman added on monday that the situation in zimbabwe was being closely followed in the eu . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : mugabe , freshly sworn into office once again , attended the african union summit in egypt " the french presidency of the eu , which is taking up its duties tomorrow -lrb- tuesday -rrb- has taken up the question and we will discuss together what further steps we can take , " he said . while us president george w. bush has already called on the united nations for an arms embargo against zimbabwe , the eu has said it would not rule out the possibility of sanctions against the southern african country . past sanctions have only resulted in fuelling the determination of the country 's elite to maintain power . dw staf -lrb- kjb -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

the mediation follows a widely condemned one-candidate election . germany said on monday , june 30 , it hoped south africa , whose president thabo mbeki is heading the talks , would also back the nomination of a second mediator . " we will in the next days and weeks be watching very closely how things in southern africa develop , " said german foreign ministry spokesman martin jaeger . mbeki was called on to steer talks with the zimbabwean government after 84-year-old incumbent president robert mugabe won a landslide re-election last week .

african leaders criticized the vote , urging mugabe 's zanu-pf party to form a unity government with the mdc .
they are reportedly writing up possible power-sharing plans for the two parties .

" we want to bring forward two components : a very intensive training on the pitch and off it as well where we want to move them forward as humans , " klinsmann told the bundesliga champions ' club website .
" the coaching staff is excited , neither real madrid nor barcelona have this .
we are very proud of it . "
klinsmann was mainly referring to the revamped player facilities , but there is far more to it then a few rooms as bayern have set their sites on international fame and fortune after dominating in germany with three league and cup doubles in the past four seasons .
a top placing in the champions league , where munich has been in the final since lifting the trophy in 2001 , as a key aim .
klinsmann revived the german national team during his reign 2004-2006 and then in january signed a two-year contract for munich to do exactly the same there .
klinsmann brought in to introduce new culture bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : klinsmann is the man to change the way bayern works " we took this step deliberately .
we needed a man who dares to make changes .
juergen is the right man for that , " said chairman karl-heinz rummenigge .
" not even i know what he will still change .
but this is a new culture for the bundesliga . "
after overhauling the team last summer by hiring the likes of france star franck ribery , italy striker luca toni and germany forward miroslav klose , munich now want klinsmann to bring the coaching structures up to modern standard .
klinsmann , who played for munich 1995-1997 , brought sweeping changes to the national team with new methods including american fitness gurus and has the same in mind in munich .
klinsmann 's team in munich includes mexican assistant coach martin vasquez , former player christian nerlinger is somewhere between the team and hoeness , and former bundesliga goalkeeper philipp laux ready to work with frustrated players as a sports psychologist .
working days to be extended bayern players faced an eight-hour day with training , lunch and wellness areas in the new facilities from monday onwards .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : klinsi 's techniques with germany will be used at bayern dutchman mark van bommel was the most prominent player to get a first taste of klinsmann 's training , while ribery , toni , turkey 's hamit altintop and the germans klose , bastian schweinsteiger , lukas podolski , philipp lahm and the other euro international enjoyed a holiday before starting pre-season training .
klinsmann watched germany lose the final 1-0 to spain on sunday in vienna and admitted that spain were " considerably better . "
spain 's philosophy of attacking football with neat one-touch passes matches exactly that of klinsmann , who will try to introduce it in germany - from which the national team could profit as well . dw staff / dpa news agency -lrb- nda -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

" heister told deutsche presse-agentur dpa that a german judge denied permission to tap the phones of heim relatives because it had not satisfied criteria under german criminal-investigation laws , and this had been confirmed on appeal . this setback was being taken out of context , he said . " we are very committed to this investigation and are working intensively on it , " the spokesman said , adding the german judges had mounted 11 requests since 2005 for foreign legal assistance as they try to track heim down . heim , who performed gruesome , fatal experiments on concentration-camp inmates , vanished in 1962 as arrest loomed and is suspected to be still alive and living under an assumed name in spain or latin america . heim tops the list of the 10 most-sought nazi criminals put out by the simon wiesenthal centre in jerusalem . a member of the ss force , heim was known for his sadism as a doctor at the nazi 's mauthausen concentration camp in austria .
heim is alleged to have killed hundreds of inmates in authausen with injections into their hearts .
a total of 310,000 euros is being offered as a reward for his arrest . there have been reported sightings of him over the years .
if he is still alive , he would have celebrated his 94th birthday on saturday . dpa news agency -lrb- sp -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

the court has not yet set a date to rule on the challenges . koehler 's functions are mainly ceremonial , but he has sometimes used his limited powers to block government legislation . the lisbon treaty which was rejected by irish voters in a referendum recently , plunging the bloc into constitutional crisis , is meant to streamline the eu 's institutions , simplify decision-making and give the eu more clout on the world stage . it also provides for a new double majority voting mechanism seen as essential if the 27-member bloc is to expand .

" i think we have to recognize the greater quality of the spanish team today , " germany coach joachim loew said after his side lost 1-0 to spain . " it -lrb- the defeat -rrb- will encourage us to continue working over the next two years and to improve some things ... in order to get to the 2010 world cup and to play a similar role here . " " possession and one-touch passes are the key in soccer , and that at high speed and under stress .
spain showed that it masters it very well , " loew said . " the best team won " german newspapers too were full of praise for spain , saying the side outclassed the germans on every count . " the artists from spain would n't let themselves be bullied around , " munich-based sueddeutsche zeitung wrote . " after a strong start germany lost their way . "
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : there was no stopping fernando torres as he scored in the 33rd minute " title dreams dashed , " the hamburger morgenpost wrote .
" after 60 minutes of sleep-inducing football and lots of defensive problems the team came to life too late .
thanks to lehmann because it could have been worse . "
germany 's most popular television soccer analyst , guenter netzer said in the end the best team won on sunday .
" congratulations to spain but also i tip my hat in respect to germany for even reaching the final , " netzer , who helped west germany win the european crown in 1972 , said .
" that 's a great success for the team .
spain were the best team throughout the tournament .
they played the best football , " he said .
" they showed us how limited we are , they showed us how to play soccer .
spain showed we have a lot of room to improve . "
germans started well , with miroslav klose missing a glorious opportunity after just four minutes , but then spain soon started to take control and on 33 minutes torres put spain ahead . germany had their chances in the second half but spain remained dangerous and held their nerve to win the championship 1-0 .
one mistake too many germany had come to euro 2008 with lots of ambitions but failed to make a lasting impression apart from a classy 3-2 against portugal in the quarter-finals .
the team was outwitted in a 2-1 defeat against croatia and outplayed for most of the match in the semi-final with turkey where only the famed fighting spirit earned them a 3-2 win .
captain michael ballack scored two goals but was unable to stamp his authority on the team as he finished runner-up for the 10th time in his career .
and there were only flashes of genius from the likes of lukas podolski or bastian schweinsteiger .
" it is always disappointing to reach and final and then lose , " ballack said on sunday , adding that the team " made one or two errors too many . "
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : ballack , left , and spain 's marco senna fight for the ball on sunday , the germans fumbled once too often with the ball , their play marked by flawed passes and defense lapses - a weakness ruthlessly exploited by their technically superior opponents .
midfielder thomas hitzlsperger too said his side 's inaccuracy proved their undoing .
" when you make mistakes at this level you get punished .
the spanish side are so good , so you ca n't afford to make any mistakes , " hitzlsperger said .
" we made too many that is why we lost . "
crushed fans the defeat led to disappointment for millions of german fans raring to celebrate their side 's triumph on sunday night .

one mistake too many germany had come to euro 2008 with lots of ambitions but failed to make a lasting impression apart from a classy 3-2 against portugal in the quarter-finals .

captain michael ballack scored two goals but was unable to stamp his authority on the team as he finished runner-up for the 10th time in his career .
and there were only flashes of genius from the likes of lukas podolski or bastian schweinsteiger .

" i think we have to recognize the greater quality of the spanish team today , " germany coach joachim loew said after his side lost 1-0 to spain . " it -lrb- the defeat -rrb- will encourage us to continue working over the next two years and to improve some things ... in order to get to the 2010 world cup and to play a similar role here . " " possession and one-touch passes are the key in soccer , and that at high speed and under stress .
spain showed that it masters it very well , " loew said . " the best team won " german newspapers too were full of praise for spain , saying the side outclassed the germans on every count . " the artists from spain would n't let themselves be bullied around , " munich-based sueddeutsche zeitung wrote . " after a strong start germany lost their way . "
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : there was no stopping fernando torres as he scored in the 33rd minute " title dreams dashed , " the hamburger morgenpost wrote .

thanks to lehmann because it could have been worse . "
germany 's most popular television soccer analyst , guenter netzer said in the end the best team won on sunday .
" congratulations to spain but also i tip my hat in respect to germany for even reaching the final , " netzer , who helped west germany win the european crown in 1972 , said .
" that 's a great success for the team .
spain were the best team throughout the tournament .

" they showed us how limited we are , they showed us how to play soccer .
spain showed we have a lot of room to improve . "

one mistake too many germany had come to euro 2008 with lots of ambitions but failed to make a lasting impression apart from a classy 3-2 against portugal in the quarter-finals .
the team was outwitted in a 2-1 defeat against croatia and outplayed for most of the match in the semi-final with turkey where only the famed fighting spirit earned them a 3-2 win .
captain michael ballack scored two goals but was unable to stamp his authority on the team as he finished runner-up for the 10th time in his career .
and there were only flashes of genius from the likes of lukas podolski or bastian schweinsteiger .
" it is always disappointing to reach and final and then lose , " ballack said on sunday , adding that the team " made one or two errors too many . "

" when you make mistakes at this level you get punished .
the spanish side are so good , so you ca n't afford to make any mistakes , " hitzlsperger said .

the final whistle resulted in no trouble as police in berlin and elsewhere said the fans left without incident . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : germany 's euro party ended with a whimper on sunday many fans even left before the final whistle , subdued or to beat the crowd on the way home as there was nothing to celebrate when the henri delaunay trophy was eventually given to spain captain iker casillas and not ballack . apart from the more than 600,000 in berlin , 70,000 fans watched the game in munich , frankfurt recorded 50,000 fans and hamburg 42,000 . despite the disappointment , hundreds of thousands of fans are set to turn up in berlin once again on monday when the team presents itself at the fan zone - empty-handed just like after the 2006 world cup third-place finish . uphill battle for loew coach loew now has his work cut out as he looks to preparing the team for the 2010 world cup in south africa . loew 's ideal is a fast game similar to that of spain , the netherlands or russia , but he faces an uphill battle because change must also come from an overly-hyped bundesliga . the showings of german clubs in europe highlights the problem , with bayer leverkusen and bayern munich blown away by andrei arshavin and his uefa cup-winning zenit st petersburg teammates .
germany last won a european title from bayern munich in 2001 and has not had a team in a continental final since 2002 .
munich has shown some class and a new trend in the league could start there as well now that former national coach juergen klinsmann starts his job as munich coach .
klinsmann revolutionized the germany team during his reign 2004-2006 and his assistant loew is now continuing his legacy as boss .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : loew faces challenges as he looks towards the 2010 world cup " jogi loew should continue his way , " german soccer icon franz beckenbauer wrote in his monday column for the bild daily .
apart from goalkeeper jens lehmann , whose future is unclear , loew has a core of a team which has now played two major events , some like ballack and defender christoph metzelder even featuring in the 2002 world cup final .
podolski and schweinsteiger will only be in their mid-20s by the time of the 2010 world cup , and newcomers who were n't quite good enough to make the euro squad - such as marko marin , jermaine jones and patrick helmes - could by then be regulars .
german chancellor angela merkel , who was in the stadium for the final said the team was gradually building on its play .
" third at the world cup and now second , that is something .
maybe we will improve again in south africa , " merkel said . " i told ballack that we have to wait a little longer until we can celebrate together , but that we are slowly getting there . " loew and his boys will have two excellent opportunities to check on any possible improvement - on october 11 and almost a year later on october 10 , 2009 , in the two world cup qualifying matches against russia . dw staff -lrb- sp -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

that 's just fine , says dw 's stefan nestler . the tournament 's best team is european champion .
enough said .
the spanish have overcome their tournament trauma and have finally been rewarded for their fascinating soccer .
they were the strongest of all 16 teams .
they offered refreshing , modern offensive soccer at the highest technical level .
they did so not just in a couple of matches , but throughout the entire tournament . the spanish were simply too much to handle for the german team .
in fact , the defeat should have been much clearer .
apart from 15 good minutes at the beginning , ballack and co. were completely disappointing . from a german point of view , the final was almost a logical end to the past three weeks . the " mountain tour " ended up in several valleys before getting stuck just below the summit .
a promising start against poland was followed by an unacceptable defeat against croatia .
a rather weak austria helped to build up the germans , who outdid themselves in the quarter-final match against portugal , one of the tournament favorites . in the semi-final , germany shrank back to a team that made the most out of very little .
it clearly was n't enough to surprise , let along defeat the outstanding spanish . what 's true for the team is also true for individual players .
no one was constantly good and all had their weak moments .
goalkeeper jens lehmann fluttered more than the ball up to the semi-final .
defender christoph metzelder 's beard might have grown during the tournament , but he did n't get any faster .
per mertesacker also seemed too slow too many times .
midfielder michael ballack was not at his best in several games , including the final .
people should be able to expect more of a top player than that . germany 's much-praised strikers , miroslav klose and mario gomez , did n't manage to achieve much .
the only ones that fulfilled expectations - at least to some extent - were bastian schweinsteiger , lukas podolski and philipp lahm .
but even they did n't shine . germany 's reaching the final should not cover up the fact that the german team is able to do much more than it showed during euro 2008 . the team should focus on strengths that have been developed in recent years : to base attacks with quick combination moves on a sound defense and close the deal decisively . the spanish played like this in the final .

what kind of a tournament did it turn out to be ?
deutsche welle 's wolfgang van kann has these thoughts . that was it - the 13th european championship .
and , for the germans at least , it was n't quite the summer fairytale the 2006 world cup was . the weather gods were partly responsible for spoiling it , as were the small stadiums , which could n't draw as many fans into the two host countries .
most of all , however , the austrians and the swiss just did n't quite come through as hosts like the germans did two years ago . while the germans had opened their doors and hearts to guests from around the world , the austrians and swiss withdrew into their own four walls and observed the whole spectacle with suspicion . the fans did n't feel like it was " a time to make friends , " like the german motto in 2006 said . nevertheless , soccer was the focal point and , without a doubt , we experienced the best european soccer championship of all time .
the triumph of the defensive was celebrated in portugal in 2004 , but the euro 2008 was definitely the most offense-driven international tournament fans have ever seen . striking was the name of the game .
those who just tried not to lose a match were punished in the end - especially greece , the 2004 european champions .
statistics show that there were more scoring chances in the euro 2008 than in any other tournament and the final count of 77 goals in 31 games speaks for itself . great soccer , good sports bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : spain can celebrate ; uefa needs to look at what worked and what did n't for the most part , we saw beautiful , fast soccer played by real teams working together .
of course the top teams have their stars , but stars alone ca n't win a match these days .
they can only shine within a team that functions as a whole and presents itself as a single unit .
the alpine event marked the continuation of a trend that has been evident for some time . the euro was also quite sportsmanlike ; there was little hostility on the pitch and just three relatively painless red cards . what did we learn ?
european soccer is apparently going through a generational shift .
the old stars have had their time in the limelight and new names are come to the fore - like russia 's arshavin and pavlyuchenko or turkey 's nihat . what 's more , a strong start evidently does n't mean everything in a tournament and sending in the b-team can only backfire .
being the favorite is often too heavy a burden .
and turkey showed that a match really can last a whole 90 , or even 120 minutes , as former national coach sepp herberger once warned . but a tournament would n't be a tournament without losers .
next to the 2006 world champions and vice-world champions , italy and france , the biggest loser in the euro 2008 is uefa itself . uefa stumbles that may seem paradoxical , considering the 700-million-euro profit the european soccer association made from the event .
still , there are a few scratches on the shiny surface . of course , uefa could n't do anything about the bad weather that led to an embarrassing interruption of the global television broadcast .
but uefa is responsible for stipulating that all the cables had to run through vienna and that there was no viable backup . it 's also uefa 's fault that the quality of the grass was n't great and apparently had n't been tested under extreme conditions . uefa 's regulation overkill ruffled feathers in the austrian and swiss business communities and came to a head on the pitch with the completely senseless and unbearable patronizing of coaches on the sidelines - something germany coach joachim loew experienced personally . and finally , tv viewers felt they got the short end of the stick when they found out that uefa had prevented images it did n't like - such as those of a streaker or illegal fireworks in a stadium - from being broadcast . the 13th european championship is now history .
players and fans throughout europe , especially those in spain , can now celebrate .

what kind of a tournament did it turn out to be ?
deutsche welle 's wolfgang van kann has these thoughts . that was it - the 13th european championship .
and , for the germans at least , it was n't quite the summer fairytale the 2006 world cup was . the weather gods were partly responsible for spoiling it , as were the small stadiums , which could n't draw as many fans into the two host countries .
most of all , however , the austrians and the swiss just did n't quite come through as hosts like the germans did two years ago . while the germans had opened their doors and hearts to guests from around the world , the austrians and swiss withdrew into their own four walls and observed the whole spectacle with suspicion . the fans did n't feel like it was " a time to make friends , " like the german motto in 2006 said . nevertheless , soccer was the focal point and , without a doubt , we experienced the best european soccer championship of all time .
the triumph of the defensive was celebrated in portugal in 2004 , but the euro 2008 was definitely the most offense-driven international tournament fans have ever seen . striking was the name of the game .
those who just tried not to lose a match were punished in the end - especially greece , the 2004 european champions .
statistics show that there were more scoring chances in the euro 2008 than in any other tournament and the final count of 77 goals in 31 games speaks for itself . great soccer , good sports bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : spain can celebrate ; uefa needs to look at what worked and what did n't for the most part , we saw beautiful , fast soccer played by real teams working together .
of course the top teams have their stars , but stars alone ca n't win a match these days .
they can only shine within a team that functions as a whole and presents itself as a single unit .
the alpine event marked the continuation of a trend that has been evident for some time . the euro was also quite sportsmanlike ; there was little hostility on the pitch and just three relatively painless red cards . what did we learn ?
european soccer is apparently going through a generational shift .
the old stars have had their time in the limelight and new names are come to the fore - like russia 's arshavin and pavlyuchenko or turkey 's nihat . what 's more , a strong start evidently does n't mean everything in a tournament and sending in the b-team can only backfire .
being the favorite is often too heavy a burden .
and turkey showed that a match really can last a whole 90 , or even 120 minutes , as former national coach sepp herberger once warned . but a tournament would n't be a tournament without losers .
next to the 2006 world champions and vice-world champions , italy and france , the biggest loser in the euro 2008 is uefa itself . uefa stumbles that may seem paradoxical , considering the 700-million-euro profit the european soccer association made from the event .
still , there are a few scratches on the shiny surface . of course , uefa could n't do anything about the bad weather that led to an embarrassing interruption of the global television broadcast .
but uefa is responsible for stipulating that all the cables had to run through vienna and that there was no viable backup . it 's also uefa 's fault that the quality of the grass was n't great and apparently had n't been tested under extreme conditions . uefa 's regulation overkill ruffled feathers in the austrian and swiss business communities and came to a head on the pitch with the completely senseless and unbearable patronizing of coaches on the sidelines - something germany coach joachim loew experienced personally . and finally , tv viewers felt they got the short end of the stick when they found out that uefa had prevented images it did n't like - such as those of a streaker or illegal fireworks in a stadium - from being broadcast . the 13th european championship is now history .

most of all , however , the austrians and the swiss just did n't quite come through as hosts like the germans did two years ago . while the germans had opened their doors and hearts to guests from around the world , the austrians and swiss withdrew into their own four walls and observed the whole spectacle with suspicion . the fans did n't feel like it was " a time to make friends , " like the german motto in 2006 said . nevertheless , soccer was the focal point and , without a doubt , we experienced the best european soccer championship of all time .
the triumph of the defensive was celebrated in portugal in 2004 , but the euro 2008 was definitely the most offense-driven international tournament fans have ever seen . striking was the name of the game .
those who just tried not to lose a match were punished in the end - especially greece , the 2004 european champions .
statistics show that there were more scoring chances in the euro 2008 than in any other tournament and the final count of 77 goals in 31 games speaks for itself . great soccer , good sports bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : spain can celebrate ; uefa needs to look at what worked and what did n't for the most part , we saw beautiful , fast soccer played by real teams working together .
of course the top teams have their stars , but stars alone ca n't win a match these days .
they can only shine within a team that functions as a whole and presents itself as a single unit .
the alpine event marked the continuation of a trend that has been evident for some time . the euro was also quite sportsmanlike ; there was little hostility on the pitch and just three relatively painless red cards . what did we learn ?
european soccer is apparently going through a generational shift .
the old stars have had their time in the limelight and new names are come to the fore - like russia 's arshavin and pavlyuchenko or turkey 's nihat . what 's more , a strong start evidently does n't mean everything in a tournament and sending in the b-team can only backfire .
being the favorite is often too heavy a burden .
and turkey showed that a match really can last a whole 90 , or even 120 minutes , as former national coach sepp herberger once warned . but a tournament would n't be a tournament without losers .
next to the 2006 world champions and vice-world champions , italy and france , the biggest loser in the euro 2008 is uefa itself . uefa stumbles that may seem paradoxical , considering the 700-million-euro profit the european soccer association made from the event .
still , there are a few scratches on the shiny surface . of course , uefa could n't do anything about the bad weather that led to an embarrassing interruption of the global television broadcast .
but uefa is responsible for stipulating that all the cables had to run through vienna and that there was no viable backup . it 's also uefa 's fault that the quality of the grass was n't great and apparently had n't been tested under extreme conditions . uefa 's regulation overkill ruffled feathers in the austrian and swiss business communities and came to a head on the pitch with the completely senseless and unbearable patronizing of coaches on the sidelines - something germany coach joachim loew experienced personally . and finally , tv viewers felt they got the short end of the stick when they found out that uefa had prevented images it did n't like - such as those of a streaker or illegal fireworks in a stadium - from being broadcast . the 13th european championship is now history .

investigators thought von metzler was still alive and a high-ranking frankfurt police official told one of his subordinates to threaten to inflict pain on gaefgen if he did not reveal where he was holding the boy . in reality , gaefgen had already killed von metzler . gaefgen has been sentence to life imprisonment .

investigators thought von metzler was still alive and a high-ranking frankfurt police official told one of his subordinates to threaten to inflict pain on gaefgen if he did not reveal where he was holding the boy . in reality , gaefgen had already killed von metzler . gaefgen has been sentence to life imprisonment .
he had appealed his case all the way to the german high court , but without success . dw staff -lrb- jam -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

she was not ill , but afraid of having to go to a nursing home . robert kusch told reporters that the woman , from the city of wuerzburg , identified in press reports as bettina sch . , took a tranquilizer and malaria medication she obtained herself to end her life on saturday .
in order to prove that the woman , a former x-ray technician , had wanted to die , kusch showed reporters interviews with her which he had videotaped . " i have campaigned for a long time for self-determination until the very end , " he said to reporters in hamburg on monday , june 30 .
he said making one 's own decisions about life and death was a " central pillar of a modern society " and that determining one 's own end of life should not be something " only theoretically discussed in seminars . " robert kusch already stirred controversy in march of this year when he unveiled his " suicide machine , " a device that could deliver a deadly infusion of potassium chloride .
however , in this case , the machine was not used . sharp criticism the german hospice foundation has expressed indignation over kusch 's action , saying he is primarily interested in drawing attention to himself . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : robert kusch and his " suicide machine " " there is a right to life , there is also a right to die , but there is not a right to kill , " said eugen brysch , the foundation 's director , accusing kusch of abuse " people 's fears of old-age care " out of a " deep sense of narcissism . " according to german law , it is not illegal if someone is present at a person 's suicide , brysch said .
however , obtaining lethal medication for that individuals does violate the legal code .
brysch said that the upper house of parliament , the bundesrat , would discuss on friday a draft law that would ban commercial suicide services . policiticians and church leaders have also sharply criticized kusch .
green party politician and vice-president of the bundestag , katrin göring-eckardt , called kusch 's action " completely inacceptable . " the protestant bishop of hamburg , maria jepsen , told the epd news agency that her church rejects kusch 's approach , saying the form of assisted suicide he is endorsing violates human dignity and christian responsibility . hamburg 's prosecutor 's office has begun a preliminary investigation into kusch 's action . dw staff -lrb- jam -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

midfielder bastian schweinsteiger appeared to cries of " schweini schweini " from many of the young girls among the crowd as captain michael ballack and stars , lukas podolski and miroslav klose too were cheered on enthusiastically .
" the atmosphere in germany was fantastic .
we hope to bring home a cup in the future , " schweinsteiger , the popular bayern munich midfielder , said .
" you are the best " read one of the countless banners in the crowd of some 300,000 and some fans had even brought a replica of the cup with the writing " thank you " on it .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : ballack waves to his supporters " we would have not made it without the fans .
it is important for our young team , " ballack said .
" it is great for us that we could delight the fans even though we lost .
it is an amazing feeling and gives me goose bumps , " goalkeeper jens lehmann said .
germany full of praise for spain despite not always shining on the pitch , the german team had created another soccer frenzy in germany which sometimes came close to that from the 2006 home world cup in which germany finished third .
hundreds of thousands of fans watched the games from austria and switzerland in the country 's public viewing areas , with more than 500,000 on hand in berlin alone for the german 3-2 semi-final win over turkey and the final .
the fans at least partly cheered up the players , but no complaints were heard and read in the country after germany not simply lost the euro 2008 final 1-0 to spain but was comprehensively outplayed on sunday in vienna .
" spain 's victory .
the best team wins the tournament , " was the front page headline of the sueddeutsche zeitung -lrb- sz -rrb- daily under a photo of match-winner fernando torres and other players holding the cup in the air .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : spanish players holding up the euro trophy the sz was just one paper which named spain " the clearly better team " and praised its " brilliant passing " which kept the german defense on their toes .
the paper said that " soccer was the winner " on the night as the german euphoria somewhat hid the fact that the team had only rarely showed its class in the six matches in austria and switzerland .
former germany coach juergen klinsmann said that spain was " considerably better " on the night and german soccer icon franz beckenbauer said in his monday column for the bild daily that " spain dominated the tournament from the first match ... until yesterday 's final . "
other papers acknowledged as well that the better team had won but also looked back at germany 's run to the final .
" the end of the dream .
we are still proud of you , but spain was the better team , " said daily bild .
the hamburger abendblatt said : " only second - but it was still nice . "
slowly getting there the abendblatt recalled the soccer frenzy which had gripped the nation like at the 2006 home world cup and looked ahead , saying " maybe the happy end follows in 2010 " at the world cup in south africa , as germany was third at the 2006 world cup and now second at euro .
german chancellor angela merkel struck a similar note after attending the game in the vienna stadium .
" third at the world cup and now second , that is something .
maybe we will improve again in south africa , " said merkel .
" i told ballack that we have to wait a little longer until we can celebrate together but that we are slowly getting there . "

former germany coach juergen klinsmann said that spain was " considerably better " on the night and german soccer icon franz beckenbauer said in his monday column for the bild daily that " spain dominated the tournament from the first match ... until yesterday 's final . "
other papers acknowledged as well that the better team had won but also looked back at germany 's run to the final .
" the end of the dream .
we are still proud of you , but spain was the better team , " said daily bild .
the hamburger abendblatt said : " only second - but it was still nice . "
slowly getting there the abendblatt recalled the soccer frenzy which had gripped the nation like at the 2006 home world cup and looked ahead , saying " maybe the happy end follows in 2010 " at the world cup in south africa , as germany was third at the 2006 world cup and now second at euro .
german chancellor angela merkel struck a similar note after attending the game in the vienna stadium .
" third at the world cup and now second , that is something .
maybe we will improve again in south africa , " said merkel .
" i told ballack that we have to wait a little longer until we can celebrate together but that we are slowly getting there . "
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : german soccer fans at the berlin fan mile large numbers of germans had celebrated in the fan zones ahead of the match , with the berlin zone closed some three hours before the kickoff as it was filled to its capacity with more than 600,000 fans .
" the fans left the fan zone very quietly , very peacefully and in very well-behaved way , " said a berlin fan zone official after the match .
that was not quite the case in the eastern part of the country , with incidents recorded in magdeburg and other towns when several hundred troublemakers rioted in city centers and fought police .
police said on monday that 25 officers were injured and 60 people arrested .
berlin saw 59 arrests , but , according to a spokesman , all for minor offences . dpa news agency -lrb- sp -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

until now , norway has provided soldiers for a qrf in the region but now the scandinavians want to focus on rebuilding afghanistan and strengthening their civil reconstruction teams . heightened danger germany currently has 3,500 troops in afghanistan .
an additional 1,000 troops are expected to join them in autumn . the qrf will be at the disposal of the regional command of the nato-led international security and assistance force -lrb- isaf -rrb- in northern afghanistan and its main job will be to provide emergency help to nato troops .
that will include defending against attacks by a resurgent taliban and other radical groups and could involve offensive deployments against insurgents . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : dutch soldiers on patrol in kunduz equipped with armoured vehicles and tanks , the qrf is expected to be mobile and quick .
it will include experts in deactivating mines and booby traps . though the commander of the german qrf , gunnar bruegner said the deployment did not involve heightened dangers , the departing head of the norwegian force said the german army had to be prepared for more casualties . the norwegians did not lose a single soldier since the force took up operations in early 2006 but rune solberg said threat levels had significantly increased recently in northern afghanistan . reports of rising threats from the taliban have been fuelled by the approach taken by the new government in neighboring pakistan to negotiate with taliban militants .
that stance , western experts , say have emboldened taliban insurgents in afghanistan . german defense minister franz josef jung had warned the qrf force when he saw it off at the beginning of june of a dangerous deployment with " life-threatening risks . " at the time , jung said : " every soldier who goes to afghanistan must be in a position to fight . " more troops needed sending troops into combat in afghanistan remains a sensitive topic in germany with opinion polls showing the majority of the population against the step . nato partners , particularly the united states , have pressured germany to send more troops to afghanistan .
they also want more german soldiers sent to the dangerous south to help fight a more powerful taliban . there are about 60,000 foreign troops in afghanistan , most of them part of the nato-led isaf force .
yet despite the heavy nato involvement , some 6,000 people were killed in 2007 , the deadliest year since the taliban was forced from power in 2001 .
german nato general egon ramms said last week he urgently needs an additional 5,000 to 6,000 troops in afghanistan . dw staff -lrb- sp -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

" heister told deutsche presse-agentur dpa that a german judge denied permission to tap the phones of heim relatives because it had not satisfied criteria under german criminal-investigation laws , and this had been confirmed on appeal . this setback was being taken out of context , he said . " we are very committed to this investigation and are working intensively on it , " the spokesman said , adding the german judges had mounted 11 requests since 2005 for foreign legal assistance as they try to track heim down . heim , who performed gruesome , fatal experiments on concentration-camp inmates , vanished in 1962 as arrest loomed and is suspected to be still alive and living under an assumed name in spain or latin america . heim tops the list of the 10 most-sought nazi criminals put out by the simon wiesenthal centre in jerusalem . a member of the ss force , heim was known for his sadism as a doctor at the nazi 's mauthausen concentration camp in austria .
heim is alleged to have killed hundreds of inmates in authausen with injections into their hearts .
a total of 310,000 euros is being offered as a reward for his arrest . there have been reported sightings of him over the years .

for some researchers they are fascinating for other reasons as well : because the growth of the reefs is influenced by environmental conditions , their structure can provide information about the climate in the past .
extreme changes in the environment can be deadly ; in more than 20 percent of the reefs , the corals have died out .
in the course of her expeditions claudia wienberg made a remarkable discovery .
in the gulf of cadiz off the spanish coast she found giant fields of coral remains .
now she is devoting part of her research to finding out the causes of the coral death .
her initial hypothesis is that over the past centuries the water temperature and nutrient levels have changed drastically .
the results of wienberg ’ s study may help predict the fate of the living cold water corals found off the norwegian or irish coasts . send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

a survey of 6,381 people showed half of respondents were not saving enough for a comfortable life after work .
the survey is part of a report by life insurer scottish widows which suggests people are worried about how they will cope when they give up work .
the bbc 's richard scott says the rising cost of living and the credit crunch seem to be affecting saving abilities .
almost 60 % of those surveyed said they would not be able to increase their savings over the next year , with about 40 % saying they felt better off five years ago .
just 51 % of people are setting aside enough money to provide an adequate income during retirement , according to scottish widows .
the survey was carried out by yougov in march .
the bbc 's personal finance reporter richard scott said the authors of the report admitted recent rises in petrol and falls in house prices might mean the picture is even gloomier today .
' save early ' those who are paying enough into a pension are most likely to be male , over 50 , working in the public sector , and earning between £ 30,000 and £ 50,000 .
by contrast , women are far more likely to be failing to make any pension provision than men , as are people with children under five , the self-employed and those with debt .
the research , which monitors the retirement provision of people aged 30 plus , earning at least £ 10,000 a year , found there had been a slight increase - up 2 % from last year - in the number of people making adequate retirement provision .
it found uk workers , who were not expecting to get their main pension income from a defined benefit scheme , were setting aside an average of 8.7 % of their pay towards retirement , up from 7.9 % in 2007 .
ian naismith , of scottish widows , said : " while pensions savings are slowly starting to rise , there is still the real worry that in the current economic environment the nation is not doing enough to prepare for retirement . "
pensions minister mike o 'brien welcomed the news that pension saving was rising .
" the message must be clear - people should save and save early .
this will make all the difference to their retirement incomes . "

a survey of 6,381 people showed half of respondents were not saving enough for a comfortable life after work .
the survey is part of a report by life insurer scottish widows which suggests people are worried about how they will cope when they give up work .
the bbc 's richard scott says the rising cost of living and the credit crunch seem to be affecting saving abilities .
almost 60 % of those surveyed said they would not be able to increase their savings over the next year , with about 40 % saying they felt better off five years ago .
just 51 % of people are setting aside enough money to provide an adequate income during retirement , according to scottish widows .
the survey was carried out by yougov in march .
the bbc 's personal finance reporter richard scott said the authors of the report admitted recent rises in petrol and falls in house prices might mean the picture is even gloomier today .
' save early ' those who are paying enough into a pension are most likely to be male , over 50 , working in the public sector , and earning between £ 30,000 and £ 50,000 .
by contrast , women are far more likely to be failing to make any pension provision than men , as are people with children under five , the self-employed and those with debt .
the research , which monitors the retirement provision of people aged 30 plus , earning at least £ 10,000 a year , found there had been a slight increase - up 2 % from last year - in the number of people making adequate retirement provision .
it found uk workers , who were not expecting to get their main pension income from a defined benefit scheme , were setting aside an average of 8.7 % of their pay towards retirement , up from 7.9 % in 2007 .
ian naismith , of scottish widows , said : " while pensions savings are slowly starting to rise , there is still the real worry that in the current economic environment the nation is not doing enough to prepare for retirement . "
pensions minister mike o 'brien welcomed the news that pension saving was rising .
" the message must be clear - people should save and save early .
this will make all the difference to their retirement incomes . "

" we have got a grip of this problem , but i am not surprised that people feel concerned " alan johnson health secretary professor john appleby , chief economist of the independent think thank the king 's fund , said media coverage had fuelled fears about hospital infections .
" the good news from the nhs to the public is that in the last four years it has reduced the numbers of mrsa infections to a risk that is half the chance of getting four correct numbers in the lottery . "
a department of health spokeswoman said it had " come a long way in tackling infections , but any avoidable infection is one too many " .
" we have introduced a raft of measures that we know will reduce infection and are already having an impact , " she said .
find out more as the nhs turns 60 , bbc news is giving it a health check .
watch out for reports , features and analysis on tv , radio and the web .
" we have implemented stringent hand-washing guidance for the nhs , a bare-below-the-elbows dress code , putting matrons back in charge of cleanliness on their wards and an ongoing deep clean of every ward . "
health secretary alan johnson said hospital-acquired infections had always been a problem , but attention on the subject had become more intense .
" the latest statistics show that mrsa is down by 30 % on this time last year , and c.diff is down by 23 % .
" we have got a grip of this problem , but i am not surprised that people feel concerned . "

dink and james swim off into the ocean two loggerhead turtles , which were washed up on the south-west uk coast this winter , have been flown to gran canaria and released back into the sea .
twenty-three loggerheads have been stranded on uk and irish coasts this year , an unprecedented number .
" dink " and " james " were the only survivors .
having tenderly nursed the turtles back to health , blue reef aquarium curator matt slater said he was " delighted " .
loggerheads -lrb- caretta caretta -rrb- are categorised as endangered .
" hopefully , we wo n't be seeing you again .
have many , many years of swimming in the ocean , " mr slater called out to dink and james as they disappeared into the clear water .
after six months of rehabilitation at blue reef aquarium , newquay , the two loggerheads have been returned to the sea off a beach in las palmas , gran canaria .
" it was absolutely beautiful .
let 's hope no more turtles get stranded , but if they do we know we can look after them , " mr slater said .
both turtles have been microchipped .
if they are ever spotted again , by fishermen or on the beach , a tag in their flipper can be used for identification .
otherwise , their adventures in the vast atlantic ocean will be unknown .
" i hope they will be ok , " mr slater mused .
" in their lifetime , things will change a lot .
the future for turtles in general is not great . "
future dangers after arriving in gran canaria , dink and james were checked over and given the all-clear at the wildlife recovery centre of tafira .
some 150 injured turtles from around the canary islands are taken here each year .
turtle diary : return to the wild " seventy-five percent of the sea turtles that we receive have been hurt because of man 's activities , " said pascual calabuig , the centre 's director .
he added : " we see turtles damaged by hooks , nets , pollution , oil and plastic bags .
turtles damaged by boats are the worst to recover .
we try to patch up their shells with fibreglass , but survival rates are low .
" through diagnosis , treatment , operations , protein-rich food , fluid and antibiotics , we help save 80 % of the turtles that we receive , " said mr calabuig .
along with industrial fisheries , habitat loss and climate change are the main threats facing turtles .
it was mr calabuig 's excellent reputation and his centre 's track record that helped blue reef decide to choose gran canaria as the release site .
" we could also get cheap flights and the canary islands are the nearest land point to the loggerheads ' migration route around the atlantic , " explained mr slater .
drifting on the current loggerheads breed on the beaches of the mediterranean , west africa , brazil and along the south-east coasts of the us .
florida has the largest loggerhead population .
" within 24 hours hatchlings swim into the open water of the atlantic ocean , " explained peter richardson , biodiversity programme manager at the marine conservation society .
loggerheads travel around the large ocean currents in a wide loop .
from nesting beaches in florida , they follow the gulf stream across the atlantic to madeira , and then head south to the canary islands and cape verde isles , before heading back to the south-east coast of the us .
mr richardson added : " they join the north atlantic gyre 's circulatory system for three to five years before coming inshore .
they then gradually move towards a nesting beach in the vicinity of where they were born . "
he continued : " we are not 100 % sure how turtles navigate this route .
they have some geo-magnetic understanding , for broad-scale navigation , and can use chemical cues coming off of islands , such as windblown dust , as a homing device . "
why uk strandings ?
scientists are uncertain why loggerhead turtles have been stranding on uk and ireland coasts in record numbers this year .
most agree that extreme weather systems over the uk may be a cause .
" from december to february we had strong and persistent south-westerly winds towards uk shores .
small or compromised turtles in the north-east atlantic may have drifted off-course because of this , " explained mr richardson .
loggerhead turtles are hard-shelled and unable to raise their body temperature in order to survive in the cold uk waters .
mr richardson adds : " at 15c -lrb- 59f -rrb- the turtles stop feeding and at 10c -lrb- 50f -rrb- they shut down . "
unable to feed , the loggerheads became lethargic and drifted inland .
mr richardson also suggests a rare unseasonable jellyfish bloom at the end of november off the west coast of the uk may also have contributed to an increase in strandings .
" juvenile loggerheads are opportunistic feeders .
the jellyfish may have attracted them off their normal course .
then they may have got caught in a weather system and blown over . "
mr brendan godley , a conservation biologist at the university of exeter , suggests another possibility : " it may simply be because there are more hatchlings in the open water .
" the florida population of loggerheads has increased since the 70s because of good conservation .
the more hatchlings there are out there , the more likely that some may be stranded . "

advertisement curator matt slater followed dink and james on their journey back to the wild .
james was stranded on blackrock beach , bude , on 26 january this year , and dink a week later further up the coast at putsborough beach , woolacombe .
" they were both in a poor state when they arrived , " explained mr slater .
" james was particularly bad .
it was touch and go for a while .
" being a larger , more powerful turtle , james is thought to have battled the strong currents , which left him exhausted .
dink , being younger , probably endured less stress as he just drifted on the current and arrived inland faster . "
james was suffering from pneumonia , dehydration and a lung infection when he arrived .
both turtles had hypothermia .
james had to be tube fed when he first arrived at blue reef dink and james were warmed up steadily but slowly .
the water temperature of their rehabilitation tanks was increased from 10c , the temperature of the uk sea in january , to 25c .
" as a result , their metabolism speeded up and they are able to heal faster , " said mr slater .
" james was put on a course of antibiotics and anti-fungals to cure infection .
when he first took food by himself , after two weeks of tube feeding , we knew he was on the road to recovery . "
after six months of dedicated rehabilitation , the turtles had reached peak condition and were ready for repatriation .
they flew to las palmas , gran canaria , on monday 23 june and were released on a beach two days later .
while the cetacean stranding investigation programme -lrb- csip -rrb- is funded to investigate cause of death in marine animals that strand around the uk , no such funding is available for animals that strand alive .
james and dink were given their second chance back in the ocean through generosity and goodwill .

dink and james swim off into the ocean " everyone is going to be very emotional today , " matt says as dink and james are once again crated for the quick drive to the beach .
children gather around the boxes on the black sand .
some collect seawater in their play buckets and pour it over the turtles ' backs to cool them down in the midday sun .
freedom : tiny dink swims off into the ocean it is dink 's turn first .
he crawls down a few metres of beach into the gently breaking waves - and is off .
he is going so fast he gently bumps into a few rocks underwater .
matt snorkels next to him until dink disappears into the blue .
james is next .
as matt lifts up the 15kg turtle and carries him to the water , james starts flapping his flippers together .
the sound of clapping echoes along the beach .
" i think he knows where he is .
good luck boy - hopefully we wo n't be seeing you again .
have many , many years of swimming in the ocean , " matt calls out .
day 3 : flight recovery dink takes the day to rest and acclimatise to gran canaria we follow the turtles ' example and chill out and relax .
it is st john 's day in las palmas , a national holiday which commemorates the foundation of the city .
as everything is closed , we drive to the south of the island to explore the exotic beaches , made from black sand of volcanic rocks , and enjoy a seafood paella .
day 2 : gatwick to las palmas 0330 : the sun is rising as we arrive at the animal care centre , gatwick .
dink is still full of energy .
james goes into the hold .
have a safe flight " it 's been quite noisy in the back ; dink has been wriggling around a lot - like driving with children , but at least they are not screaming ! "
matt remarks .
with the help of thomas cook check-in and security , things run smoothly .
wearing fluorescent jackets , we are ushered airside to see dink and james being loaded into a temperature-controlled and pressurised hold .
matt looks a little anxious : " i hope they will be ok , they are very special to us .
it 's pretty deafening out here but soon they will be tucked up nice and warm . " 0810 : " i would like to welcome aboard some very special guests called dink and james , " the pilot 's message plays over the tannoy before take-off .
after being awake for around 23 hours , we all try to get some sleep on the three-and-a-half-hour flight .
basking in the 26c -lrb- 79f -rrb- temperatures , we watch the turtle crates trundle down a conveyer belt from the plane 's hold at las palmas .
in a white van , with the turtles in the back , we are whizzed out of the airport , bypassing the terminal building .
after much gesticulating and " spanlish " , we zoom back into the airport to find our luggage .
recepción a las palmas ! 1400 : a big sign of relief .
dink and james are looking happy and healthy .
at the wildlife recovery centre of tafira , the government vet pascual calabuig checks them over .
their caramel and chocolate shells glisten in the sun as they explore their new tanks .
dink and james will rest here for a day before their release .
day 1 : newquay to gatwick 1300 : gusty winds greet us when we arrive at blackrock beach in bude , cornwall .
the team battling the wind on bude beach looking down at the lines of sharp black rocks and tumbling surf , it is amazing that james , the older of the two loggerheads , was found alive .
he was stranded here on 26 january in very poor condition ; with holes in his shell and oil over his back .
dink , the other loggerhead , who has also been nursed back to health by blue reef aquarium , newquay , stranded just one week later further up the coast , at woolacombe .
richard , bbc breakfast 's reporter , and cameraman matt , have to shout at each other to be heard above the howling wind .
1700 : we arrive at blue reef aquarium to an air of anticipation and excitement .
matt slater , blue reef 's curator , introduces us to dink and james .

advertisement curator matt slater packs james and dink up for their journey back to the wild .
at around five years old , dink is a curious toddler , full of energy as he zooms around the tank .
james , at approximately 15 , is a sleepy teenager .
he lodges himself between the rocks at the bottom of his ocean tank and naps between gulps of air .
trying to catch james and not be stung by a pesky ray time comes to secure the turtles into their specially designed crates .
dink is easily caught , but james is a little tricky .
matt entices him to the surface with his favourite food - squid .
unfortunately this also attracts the attention of a stingray which flaps around his feet .
eventually , dink and james are loaded into the car - their journey to warmer waters has begun .

advertisement returning home .
dink and james swim off into the ocean " everyone is going to be very emotional today , " matt says as dink and james are once again crated for the quick drive to the beach .
children gather around the boxes on the black sand .
some collect seawater in their play buckets and pour it over the turtles ' backs to cool them down in the midday sun .
freedom : tiny dink swims off into the ocean it is dink 's turn first .
he crawls down a few metres of beach into the gently breaking waves - and is off .
he is going so fast he gently bumps into a few rocks underwater .
matt snorkels next to him until dink disappears into the blue .
james is next .
as matt lifts up the 15kg turtle and carries him to the water , james starts flapping his flippers together .
the sound of clapping echoes along the beach .
" i think he knows where he is .
good luck boy - hopefully we wo n't be seeing you again .
have many , many years of swimming in the ocean , " matt calls out .
day 3 : flight recovery dink takes the day to rest and acclimatise to gran canaria we follow the turtles ' example and chill out and relax .
it is st john 's day in las palmas , a national holiday which commemorates the foundation of the city .
as everything is closed , we drive to the south of the island to explore the exotic beaches , made from black sand of volcanic rocks , and enjoy a seafood paella .
day 2 : gatwick to las palmas 0330 : the sun is rising as we arrive at the animal care centre , gatwick .
dink is still full of energy .
james goes into the hold .
have a safe flight " it 's been quite noisy in the back ; dink has been wriggling around a lot - like driving with children , but at least they are not screaming ! "
matt remarks .
with the help of thomas cook check-in and security , things run smoothly .
wearing fluorescent jackets , we are ushered airside to see dink and james being loaded into a temperature-controlled and pressurised hold .
matt looks a little anxious : " i hope they will be ok , they are very special to us .
it 's pretty deafening out here but soon they will be tucked up nice and warm . " 0810 : " i would like to welcome aboard some very special guests called dink and james , " the pilot 's message plays over the tannoy before take-off .
after being awake for around 23 hours , we all try to get some sleep on the three-and-a-half-hour flight .
basking in the 26c -lrb- 79f -rrb- temperatures , we watch the turtle crates trundle down a conveyer belt from the plane 's hold at las palmas .
in a white van , with the turtles in the back , we are whizzed out of the airport , bypassing the terminal building .
after much gesticulating and " spanlish " , we zoom back into the airport to find our luggage .
recepción a las palmas ! 1400 : a big sign of relief .
dink and james are looking happy and healthy .
at the wildlife recovery centre of tafira , the government vet pascual calabuig checks them over .
their caramel and chocolate shells glisten in the sun as they explore their new tanks .
dink and james will rest here for a day before their release .
day 1 : newquay to gatwick 1300 : gusty winds greet us when we arrive at blackrock beach in bude , cornwall .
the team battling the wind on bude beach looking down at the lines of sharp black rocks and tumbling surf , it is amazing that james , the older of the two loggerheads , was found alive .
he was stranded here on 26 january in very poor condition ; with holes in his shell and oil over his back .
dink , the other loggerhead , who has also been nursed back to health by blue reef aquarium , newquay , stranded just one week later further up the coast , at woolacombe .
richard , bbc breakfast 's reporter , and cameraman matt , have to shout at each other to be heard above the howling wind .
1700 : we arrive at blue reef aquarium to an air of anticipation and excitement .
matt slater , blue reef 's curator , introduces us to dink and james .

advertisement curator matt slater packs james and dink up for their journey back to the wild .
at around five years old , dink is a curious toddler , full of energy as he zooms around the tank .
james , at approximately 15 , is a sleepy teenager .
he lodges himself between the rocks at the bottom of his ocean tank and naps between gulps of air .
trying to catch james and not be stung by a pesky ray time comes to secure the turtles into their specially designed crates .
dink is easily caught , but james is a little tricky .
matt entices him to the surface with his favourite food - squid .
unfortunately this also attracts the attention of a stingray which flaps around his feet .
eventually , dink and james are loaded into the car - their journey to warmer waters has begun .

dink and james swim off into the ocean two loggerhead turtles , which were washed up on the south-west uk coast this winter , have been flown to gran canaria and released back into the sea .
twenty-three loggerheads have been stranded on uk and irish coasts this year , an unprecedented number .
" dink " and " james " were the only survivors .
having tenderly nursed the turtles back to health , blue reef aquarium curator matt slater said he was " delighted " .
loggerheads -lrb- caretta caretta -rrb- are categorised as endangered .
" hopefully , we wo n't be seeing you again .
have many , many years of swimming in the ocean , " mr slater called out to dink and james as they disappeared into the clear water .
after six months of rehabilitation at blue reef aquarium , newquay , the two loggerheads have been returned to the sea off a beach in las palmas , gran canaria .
" it was absolutely beautiful .
let 's hope no more turtles get stranded , but if they do we know we can look after them , " mr slater said .
both turtles have been microchipped .
if they are ever spotted again , by fishermen or on the beach , a tag in their flipper can be used for identification .
otherwise , their adventures in the vast atlantic ocean will be unknown .
" i hope they will be ok , " mr slater mused .
" in their lifetime , things will change a lot .
the future for turtles in general is not great . "
future dangers after arriving in gran canaria , dink and james were checked over and given the all-clear at the wildlife recovery centre of tafira .
some 150 injured turtles from around the canary islands are taken here each year .
turtle diary : return to the wild " seventy-five percent of the sea turtles that we receive have been hurt because of man 's activities , " said pascual calabuig , the centre 's director .
he added : " we see turtles damaged by hooks , nets , pollution , oil and plastic bags .
turtles damaged by boats are the worst to recover .
we try to patch up their shells with fibreglass , but survival rates are low .
" through diagnosis , treatment , operations , protein-rich food , fluid and antibiotics , we help save 80 % of the turtles that we receive , " said mr calabuig .
along with industrial fisheries , habitat loss and climate change are the main threats facing turtles .
it was mr calabuig 's excellent reputation and his centre 's track record that helped blue reef decide to choose gran canaria as the release site .
" we could also get cheap flights and the canary islands are the nearest land point to the loggerheads ' migration route around the atlantic , " explained mr slater .
drifting on the current loggerheads breed on the beaches of the mediterranean , west africa , brazil and along the south-east coasts of the us .
florida has the largest loggerhead population .
" within 24 hours hatchlings swim into the open water of the atlantic ocean , " explained peter richardson , biodiversity programme manager at the marine conservation society .
loggerheads travel around the large ocean currents in a wide loop .
from nesting beaches in florida , they follow the gulf stream across the atlantic to madeira , and then head south to the canary islands and cape verde isles , before heading back to the south-east coast of the us .
mr richardson added : " they join the north atlantic gyre 's circulatory system for three to five years before coming inshore .
they then gradually move towards a nesting beach in the vicinity of where they were born . "
he continued : " we are not 100 % sure how turtles navigate this route .
they have some geo-magnetic understanding , for broad-scale navigation , and can use chemical cues coming off of islands , such as windblown dust , as a homing device . "
why uk strandings ?
scientists are uncertain why loggerhead turtles have been stranding on uk and ireland coasts in record numbers this year .
most agree that extreme weather systems over the uk may be a cause .
" from december to february we had strong and persistent south-westerly winds towards uk shores .
small or compromised turtles in the north-east atlantic may have drifted off-course because of this , " explained mr richardson .
loggerhead turtles are hard-shelled and unable to raise their body temperature in order to survive in the cold uk waters .
mr richardson adds : " at 15c -lrb- 59f -rrb- the turtles stop feeding and at 10c -lrb- 50f -rrb- they shut down . "
unable to feed , the loggerheads became lethargic and drifted inland .
mr richardson also suggests a rare unseasonable jellyfish bloom at the end of november off the west coast of the uk may also have contributed to an increase in strandings .
" juvenile loggerheads are opportunistic feeders .
the jellyfish may have attracted them off their normal course .
then they may have got caught in a weather system and blown over . "
mr brendan godley , a conservation biologist at the university of exeter , suggests another possibility : " it may simply be because there are more hatchlings in the open water .
" the florida population of loggerheads has increased since the 70s because of good conservation .
the more hatchlings there are out there , the more likely that some may be stranded . "

james was stranded on blackrock beach , bude , on 26 january this year , and dink a week later further up the coast at putsborough beach , woolacombe .
" they were both in a poor state when they arrived , " explained mr slater .
" james was particularly bad .
it was touch and go for a while .
" being a larger , more powerful turtle , james is thought to have battled the strong currents , which left him exhausted .
dink , being younger , probably endured less stress as he just drifted on the current and arrived inland faster . "
james was suffering from pneumonia , dehydration and a lung infection when he arrived .
both turtles had hypothermia .
james had to be tube fed when he first arrived at blue reef dink and james were warmed up steadily but slowly .
the water temperature of their rehabilitation tanks was increased from 10c , the temperature of the uk sea in january , to 25c .
" as a result , their metabolism speeded up and they are able to heal faster , " said mr slater .
" james was put on a course of antibiotics and anti-fungals to cure infection .
when he first took food by himself , after two weeks of tube feeding , we knew he was on the road to recovery . "
after six months of dedicated rehabilitation , the turtles had reached peak condition and were ready for repatriation .
they flew to las palmas , gran canaria , on monday 23 june and were released on a beach two days later .
while the cetacean stranding investigation programme -lrb- csip -rrb- is funded to investigate cause of death in marine animals that strand around the uk , no such funding is available for animals that strand alive .
james and dink were given their second chance back in the ocean through generosity and goodwill .

dink and james swim off into the ocean two loggerhead turtles , which were washed up on the south-west uk coast this winter , have been flown to gran canaria and released back into the sea .
twenty-three loggerheads have been stranded on uk and irish coasts this year , an unprecedented number .
" dink " and " james " were the only survivors .
having tenderly nursed the turtles back to health , blue reef aquarium curator matt slater said he was " delighted " .
loggerheads -lrb- caretta caretta -rrb- are categorised as endangered .
" hopefully , we wo n't be seeing you again .
have many , many years of swimming in the ocean , " mr slater called out to dink and james as they disappeared into the clear water .
after six months of rehabilitation at blue reef aquarium , newquay , the two loggerheads have been returned to the sea off a beach in las palmas , gran canaria .
" it was absolutely beautiful .
let 's hope no more turtles get stranded , but if they do we know we can look after them , " mr slater said .
both turtles have been microchipped .
if they are ever spotted again , by fishermen or on the beach , a tag in their flipper can be used for identification .
otherwise , their adventures in the vast atlantic ocean will be unknown .
" i hope they will be ok , " mr slater mused .
" in their lifetime , things will change a lot .
the future for turtles in general is not great . "
future dangers after arriving in gran canaria , dink and james were checked over and given the all-clear at the wildlife recovery centre of tafira .
some 150 injured turtles from around the canary islands are taken here each year .
turtle diary : return to the wild " seventy-five percent of the sea turtles that we receive have been hurt because of man 's activities , " said pascual calabuig , the centre 's director .
he added : " we see turtles damaged by hooks , nets , pollution , oil and plastic bags .
turtles damaged by boats are the worst to recover .
we try to patch up their shells with fibreglass , but survival rates are low .
" through diagnosis , treatment , operations , protein-rich food , fluid and antibiotics , we help save 80 % of the turtles that we receive , " said mr calabuig .
along with industrial fisheries , habitat loss and climate change are the main threats facing turtles .
it was mr calabuig 's excellent reputation and his centre 's track record that helped blue reef decide to choose gran canaria as the release site .
" we could also get cheap flights and the canary islands are the nearest land point to the loggerheads ' migration route around the atlantic , " explained mr slater .
drifting on the current loggerheads breed on the beaches of the mediterranean , west africa , brazil and along the south-east coasts of the us .
florida has the largest loggerhead population .
" within 24 hours hatchlings swim into the open water of the atlantic ocean , " explained peter richardson , biodiversity programme manager at the marine conservation society .
loggerheads travel around the large ocean currents in a wide loop .
from nesting beaches in florida , they follow the gulf stream across the atlantic to madeira , and then head south to the canary islands and cape verde isles , before heading back to the south-east coast of the us .
mr richardson added : " they join the north atlantic gyre 's circulatory system for three to five years before coming inshore .
they then gradually move towards a nesting beach in the vicinity of where they were born . "
he continued : " we are not 100 % sure how turtles navigate this route .
they have some geo-magnetic understanding , for broad-scale navigation , and can use chemical cues coming off of islands , such as windblown dust , as a homing device . "
why uk strandings ?
scientists are uncertain why loggerhead turtles have been stranding on uk and ireland coasts in record numbers this year .
most agree that extreme weather systems over the uk may be a cause .
" from december to february we had strong and persistent south-westerly winds towards uk shores .
small or compromised turtles in the north-east atlantic may have drifted off-course because of this , " explained mr richardson .
loggerhead turtles are hard-shelled and unable to raise their body temperature in order to survive in the cold uk waters .
mr richardson adds : " at 15c -lrb- 59f -rrb- the turtles stop feeding and at 10c -lrb- 50f -rrb- they shut down . "
unable to feed , the loggerheads became lethargic and drifted inland .
mr richardson also suggests a rare unseasonable jellyfish bloom at the end of november off the west coast of the uk may also have contributed to an increase in strandings .
" juvenile loggerheads are opportunistic feeders .
the jellyfish may have attracted them off their normal course .
then they may have got caught in a weather system and blown over . "
mr brendan godley , a conservation biologist at the university of exeter , suggests another possibility : " it may simply be because there are more hatchlings in the open water .
" the florida population of loggerheads has increased since the 70s because of good conservation .
the more hatchlings there are out there , the more likely that some may be stranded . "

advertisement curator matt slater followed dink and james on their journey back to the wild .
james was stranded on blackrock beach , bude , on 26 january this year , and dink a week later further up the coast at putsborough beach , woolacombe .
" they were both in a poor state when they arrived , " explained mr slater .
" james was particularly bad .
it was touch and go for a while .
" being a larger , more powerful turtle , james is thought to have battled the strong currents , which left him exhausted .
dink , being younger , probably endured less stress as he just drifted on the current and arrived inland faster . "
james was suffering from pneumonia , dehydration and a lung infection when he arrived .
both turtles had hypothermia .
james had to be tube fed when he first arrived at blue reef dink and james were warmed up steadily but slowly .
the water temperature of their rehabilitation tanks was increased from 10c , the temperature of the uk sea in january , to 25c .
" as a result , their metabolism speeded up and they are able to heal faster , " said mr slater .
" james was put on a course of antibiotics and anti-fungals to cure infection .
when he first took food by himself , after two weeks of tube feeding , we knew he was on the road to recovery . "
after six months of dedicated rehabilitation , the turtles had reached peak condition and were ready for repatriation .
they flew to las palmas , gran canaria , on monday 23 june and were released on a beach two days later .
while the cetacean stranding investigation programme -lrb- csip -rrb- is funded to investigate cause of death in marine animals that strand around the uk , no such funding is available for animals that strand alive .
james and dink were given their second chance back in the ocean through generosity and goodwill .

these lucky loggerheads were the only two survivors of 23 that have been washed up on uk and ireland coasts this year .
day 4 : freedom " everyone is going to be very emotional today , " matt says as dink and james are once again crated for the quick drive to the beach .
children gather around the boxes on the black sand .
some collect seawater in their play buckets and pour it over the turtles ' backs to cool them down in the midday sun .
it is dink 's turn first .
he crawls down a few metres of beach into the gently breaking waves - and is off .
he is going so fast he gently bumps into a few rocks underwater .
matt snorkels next to him until dink disappears into the blue .
james is next .
as matt lifts up the 15kg turtle and carries him to the water , james starts flapping his flippers together .
the sound of clapping echoes along the beach .
" i think he knows where he is .
good luck boy - hopefully we wo n't be seeing you again .
have many , many years of swimming in the ocean , " matt calls out .
day 3 : flight recovery we follow the turtles ' example and chill out and relax .
it is st john 's day in las palmas , a national holiday which commemorates the foundation of the city .
as everything is closed , we drive to the south of the island to explore the exotic beaches , made from black sand of volcanic rocks , and enjoy a seafood paella .
day 2 : gatwick to las palmas 0330 : the sun is rising as we arrive at the animal care centre , gatwick .
dink is still full of energy .
" it 's been quite noisy in the back ; dink has been wriggling around a lot - like driving with children , but at least they are not screaming ! "
matt remarks .
with the help of thomas cook check-in and security , things run smoothly .
wearing fluorescent jackets , we are ushered airside to see dink and james being loaded into a temperature-controlled and pressurised hold .
matt looks a little anxious : " i hope they will be ok , they are very special to us .
it 's pretty deafening out here but soon they will be tucked up nice and warm . " 0810 : " i would like to welcome aboard some very special guests called dink and james , " the pilot 's message plays over the tannoy before take-off .
after being awake for around 23 hours , we all try to get some sleep on the three-and-a-half-hour flight .
basking in the 26c -lrb- 79f -rrb- temperatures , we watch the turtle crates trundle down a conveyer belt from the plane 's hold at las palmas .
in a white van , with the turtles in the back , we are whizzed out of the airport , bypassing the terminal building .
after much gesticulating and " spanlish " , we zoom back into the airport to find our luggage .
recepción a las palmas ! 1400 : a big sign of relief .
dink and james are looking happy and healthy .
at the wildlife recovery centre of tafira , the government vet pascual calabuig checks them over .
their caramel and chocolate shells glisten in the sun as they explore their new tanks .
dink and james will rest here for a day before their release .
day 1 : newquay to gatwick 1300 : gusty winds greet us when we arrive at blackrock beach in bude , cornwall .
looking down at the lines of sharp black rocks and tumbling surf , it is amazing that james , the older of the two loggerheads , was found alive .
he was stranded here on 26 january in very poor condition ; with holes in his shell and oil over his back .
dink , the other loggerhead , who has also been nursed back to health by blue reef aquarium , newquay , stranded just one week later further up the coast , at woolacombe .
richard , bbc breakfast 's reporter , and cameraman matt , have to shout at each other to be heard above the howling wind .
1700 : we arrive at blue reef aquarium to an air of anticipation and excitement .
matt slater , blue reef 's curator , introduces us to dink and james .
at around five years old , dink is a curious toddler , full of energy as he zooms around the tank .
james , at approximately 15 , is a sleepy teenager .
he lodges himself between the rocks at the bottom of his ocean tank and naps between gulps of air .
time comes to secure the turtles into their specially designed crates .
dink is easily caught , but james is a little tricky .
matt entices him to the surface with his favourite food - squid .
unfortunately this also attracts the attention of a stingray which flaps around his feet .
eventually , dink and james are loaded into the car - their journey to warmer waters has begun .

advertisement how the fernau family 's lives were shaped by the nhs from the cradle to the grave - that was the bold claim from the labour government in 1948 about the nhs .
universal health care was to be free at the point of need .
in the last 60 years the nhs has had a dramatic impact on millions of lives and on three generations of one family in particular .
sitting round a small table in winchelsea in sussex are barbara fernau , 86 , her granddaughter victoria , 23 , and anthony ferneau .
in front of them a cake with the words " happy birthday " and 60 .
anthony will be 60 on 5 july - the same day the nhs started .
it was a difficult birth .
barbara was rushed to ashford hospital in kent with high blood pressure .
life saver anthony was born with blue asphyxia .
today he is convinced the nhs saved his life - and that of his mother .
" what would have happened if i had been born the day before the nhs started ? " he asked his mother .
" if i had been at home i do n't think i would have survived if i had n't gone into hospital . " said barbara .
victoria fernau is worried about the future of the nhs " i 'm very lucky to be alive - and so are you . "
most of us can not remember life before the nhs .
there were insurance schemes for some workers - but they did not extend to wives and children .
your health depended largely on your ability to pay .
as a child barbara fernau had tuberculosis and was bed bound for three years .
" all the time i was a child and i was ill my father had to pay huge doctors bills , " she said .
" you just had to pay for everything and as we were always being all it must have been very expensive . "
dramatic changes anthony has seen dramatic changes in the last 60 years , from mass vaccinations for illnesses like polio to medical advances like keyhole surgery .
find out more as the nhs turns 60 , bbc news is giving it a health check .
watch out for reports , features and analysis on tv , radio and the web .
now at almost 60 anthony has a heart condition .
it was quickly diagnosed and treated on the nhs .
" if you look at the cost of the treatment i 've had over the last ten years with my heart problem and other problems it would have been a struggle to fund the treatment for that , " he said .
so what of the future ?
victoria fernau is worried about spiralling costs in the nhs and whether it will be able to provide universal care in 60 years time .
she is also worried about how the nhs might change .
as the population gets older and get fatter the nhs is likely to become much more involved in peoples lives .
perhaps even telling them how to exercise what to eat .
" everyone knows it 's right to diet and exercise , " she said .
" but i do n't think you can tell people what to eat .
" that goes against peoples freedom and i do n't think that is right . "
whatever the challenges ahead - and there are many - the fernau family is celebrating the nhs .
for them it is a unique british institution and a life saver .

advertisement how the fernau family 's lives were shaped by the nhs from the cradle to the grave - that was the bold claim from the labour government in 1948 about the nhs .
universal health care was to be free at the point of need .
in the last 60 years the nhs has had a dramatic impact on millions of lives and on three generations of one family in particular .
sitting round a small table in winchelsea in sussex are barbara fernau , 86 , her granddaughter victoria , 23 , and anthony ferneau .
in front of them a cake with the words " happy birthday " and 60 .
anthony will be 60 on 5 july - the same day the nhs started .
it was a difficult birth .
barbara was rushed to ashford hospital in kent with high blood pressure .
life saver anthony was born with blue asphyxia .
today he is convinced the nhs saved his life - and that of his mother .
" what would have happened if i had been born the day before the nhs started ? " he asked his mother .
" if i had been at home i do n't think i would have survived if i had n't gone into hospital . " said barbara .
victoria fernau is worried about the future of the nhs " i 'm very lucky to be alive - and so are you . "
most of us can not remember life before the nhs .
there were insurance schemes for some workers - but they did not extend to wives and children .
your health depended largely on your ability to pay .
as a child barbara fernau had tuberculosis and was bed bound for three years .
" all the time i was a child and i was ill my father had to pay huge doctors bills , " she said .
" you just had to pay for everything and as we were always being all it must have been very expensive . "
dramatic changes anthony has seen dramatic changes in the last 60 years , from mass vaccinations for illnesses like polio to medical advances like keyhole surgery .
find out more as the nhs turns 60 , bbc news is giving it a health check .
watch out for reports , features and analysis on tv , radio and the web .
now at almost 60 anthony has a heart condition .
it was quickly diagnosed and treated on the nhs .
" if you look at the cost of the treatment i 've had over the last ten years with my heart problem and other problems it would have been a struggle to fund the treatment for that , " he said .
so what of the future ?
victoria fernau is worried about spiralling costs in the nhs and whether it will be able to provide universal care in 60 years time .
she is also worried about how the nhs might change .
as the population gets older and get fatter the nhs is likely to become much more involved in peoples lives .

but it has not forgotten that the victory took place under a military government that kidnapped , tortured and killed tens of thousands of argentines .
members of the team that lifted the trophy in 1978 have taken part in a commemorative match for the victims .
they were joined by human rights activists and survivors of what became known as the dirty war .
the match , called the other final , was played in the same stadium in buenos aires where argentina beat holland 3-1 in 1978 .
when they played a game over the speakers , it was very contradictory - because the executioners , those who tortured us , and us the victims both cried ' goal argentina ! '
adolfo perez esquivel , torture victim only this time , where the military had sat , there was a flag commemorating the tens of thousands of argentine victims of the military government .
there were fewer fans this time , but they sang songs about liberty and justice as well as the more traditional football songs .

they played the national under-20 team .

nobel peace prize winner adolfo perez esquivel was a prisoner during the final and joined the march : " when they played a game over the speakers , it was very contradictory - because the executioners , those who tortured us , and us the victims both cried ' goal argentina ! " ' he said .
and we know that they took prisoners out when there were distractions caused by the world cup and shot them , " he said .
to say that football in argentina is important is a huge understatement .
the military government used the 1978 world cup finals and their team 's victory as a political propaganda tool - in much the same way as adolf hitler used the 1936 berlin olympics .
many argentines were excluded from the celebrations then , but with the other final they have laid some of their ghosts to rest .

dr alan merson talks about the early days of the nhs dr alan merson has worked as a gp in the nhs since its inception in 1948 - and 60 years later he is still there .
he is the first to admit , however , that he has never been its biggest fan .
he thought the introduction of the nhs was too hurried and that it has failed in many of its goals .
dr merson , believed to be the uk 's longest serving gp , even wrote a letter to william beveridge , whose 1942 report pre-empted the foundation of a free national health service .
i had one chap come in who had cut his finger and wanted a prescription for a piece of elastoplast dr alan merson " i said ' in my opinion you are bringing it in too soon and neither the doctors nor the public have been educated in how to use it , " dr merson said .
he said the teething period was very difficult , with some patients trying to take advantage of the free services .
" when it first started i had one chap come in who had cut his finger and wanted a prescription for a piece of elastoplast .
" then i had another fellow ring up on the very first day and he told my staff ' i want the doctor to come at once - the kid is poorly ' .
" my staff said i would come after surgery as i was in the middle of seeing patients .
he said ' if he is not here in an hour i will report him .
we are in charge now . '
dr alan merson born 22 may 1922 at west park house , dewsbury his father 's clinic was in the house - so he was born at the surgery where he later worked worked before and after the foundation of the nhs in west park house now working at albion street , where the surgery moved last year " i apologised to the staff and went out to see him .
the kid had a bit of tonsillitis .
i gave him a prescription and then told him to find another doctor , because i did n't want him talking to my staff like that .
" but it settled down after that . "
dr merson , aged 86 , still feels that the nhs has never really fulfilled its potential .
" the nhs has never really got off the ground as such has it ? " he said .
" the idea was originally when it first started that it would cost so many billions .
" the principle was that people were afraid to go to the doctor before because they could not afford it .
now they would all go and everyone 's health would improve , so eventually it would cost less .
" but it never did , because , of course , advances in medicine have become so expensive . "
find out more as the nhs turns 60 , bbc news is giving it a health check .
watch out for reports , features and analysis on tv , radio and the web .
dr merson , who works three days a week , plans to retire from the practice his father set up in dewsbury this august , but says he still hopes to do the odd locum shift .
" when i was in spain i met this lady who was doing some medical work at 92 and i thought i ca n't let her beat me , " he laughed .
he had originally been destined to be a rolls royce apprentice until his father bribed him to swap for medicine with the offer of a car to get to leeds to study .
he joined the practice in april 1948 , just a few months before the start of the nhs , and still remembers the old system where patients were charged for services .
" when somebody came to the surgery you saw them , made a diagnosis , decided what you were going to treat them with and you wrote all this down in a great big ledger .
" then after the surgery you would go into the dispensary and make up the medicines .
wrap them in cartridge paper , seal them with sealing wax .
after surgery the surgery boy used to come round on his bicycle and take the medicines out to the various houses .
" then you would send a bill out at the end of the month .
" some would pay and some would n't so we had a ' doctor man ' who used to go round and collect the money . "
government pressure dr merson says he has loved his career , but feels the nhs is now too heavily influenced by politicians .
dr merson had to join the university home guard " the best thing about the nhs is that it is possible , in time , to have almost any surgical procedure or any medical procedure , diagnosis is a lot better now than it used to be , which is a good thing .
" but the bad thing is that doctors are becoming civil servants almost and government committees are telling you what to do .
" the politicians should leave well alone .
" i am quite happy to retire in one way because as far as i am concerned the government is destroying family doctors - they want everyone to go into big centres .
" i am not keen on these big practices - polyclinics - you go one day with a sore throat they will say ' you had better see doctor so-and-so , he is a throat man ' .
" then the next time you go with a pain in your knee you are told ' you had better see doctor so-and-so , he is the arthritis man .
" you are not going to get what i call ' continuation of treatment ' with one fellow - but maybe i am wrong . "

yesterday 's catch is still on his mind .
the 50kg crates were filled to the brim with fresh sea bass , cod and plaice , and there were 10 of them - enough to earn him and his brother chris a healthy return for the day .
chris is equally ebullient as the boat makes way towards today 's fishing grounds , just a couple of miles off the suffolk coastline .
" too many people would want to get into it , had it been like this all the time , " cheers chris as he looks towards lowestoft , still visible in the distance .
unlucky fishermen but there are good reasons why steve , 38 , and chris , 33 , are amongst the last of lowestoft 's fishermen . "
we bought our boat just as the beam trawlers were going out of business and the port was taking another downturn " steve wightman , fisherman days like these are the exception , and theirs is not an easy life even now .
long before most people will be reaching for their alarm clocks this morning , the two brothers are out at sea , digging into large tin baths of ready-baited fishing line which they slowly release abaft .
two-and-a-half miles of line , weighed down by a series of short chains and small anchors , is released in one direction before skipper steve turns their boat maximus to release a second line the same length .
by 0830 , just as the weather begins to turn and the two brothers wriggle into their oilskins , it is time to reverse the operation to see what they have caught .
but as the line is swiftly pulled in by a machine , glistening hooks devoid of fish ping over the starboard side of the boat at eight feet intervals , a clear demonstration of how longline fishing is really hunting rather than gathering .
" skipper 's not very happy at the moment , " grins steve bitterly as he impatiently taps the deck with his large boots .
and then one of the anchors catches on the bottom and the line snaps .
total commitment four years ago , the two brothers scraped together more than £ 100,000 to buy maximus , an inshore boat complete with satellite navigation equipment and a powerful engine that " gives us an extra two or three hours of home time a day " , steve says .
but even so , he remains a foul-weather father who rarely sees his three children while the sun shines .
" when the weather is good , we fish everyday , " explains his brother chris , whose first child is due later this year .
the brothers ' commitment to fishing is total .
" fishing is in our blood , " says chris , gazing up the seagulls that circle over the boat .
" we like to say that they 're all our ancestors . "
adds steve : " we bought our boat just as the beam trawlers were going out of business and the port was taking another downturn . "
at the time there were still seven or eight trawlers here , as well as some 20 inshore boats .
these days , there are no trawlers left , their quotas having been sold to dutch trawlers .
and most of the inshore boats have all but given up , not least because of escalating fuel costs .
" we use about 700 litres of diesel a week , " says steve .
" when we first ordered the boat , it was 25p a litre . "
these days , they pay more than 70p a litre , so their weekly fuel bill has almost tripled to about £ 500 .
rising costs frustrated at the bad start to the day , steve revs the engines and races over to the other end of the line .
all is not lost , and soon their luck turns . "
the fish we catch , if we were to sell it as fish and chips , we 'd be millionaires " chris wightman , fisherman the line is rolling in fast now , and steve taps it eagerly with the long handle of a home-made hook , knocking off the seaweed , ready to hook in the fish as one by one they break the water 's surface .
behind him , chris stands ready to immediately kill and gut the fish as they come in .
specimens that are too small or species for which there is no market - such as smooth-hounds , a small shark that is abundant in these waters - are thrown back alive .
chris decides to keep one of the smooth-hounds .
" it 's good for kids , ' cos there are no bones in ' em , " he says .
" anything you can do with a chicken , you can do with this . "
complicated quotas with popular fish , most notably cod , at risk of extinction , steve and chris believe consumers should be more adventurous and try new species , thereby helping to reduce the pressure on others . "
you can sometimes go weeks without a wage , and then you make a month 's wage in a day " chris wightman , fisherman the two see themselves as keen conservationists and insist they are all in favour of measures that help preserve the fish stock , on which they rely for their livelihoods .
yet they have nothing good to say about the fisheries quota system , which they say is overly complicated and restrictive , " but they have n't saved any fish " .
" they put the quota system down each year , and then they base their quotas on the landing figures , " says chris , who believes small , inshore fishing vessels such as maximus have a very small impact on the overall levels of fish stocks .
for this reason , some scientists say it might be possible to relax the quota system for inshore vessels .
maximus is one of 30 boats taking part in a research programme , fishing outside the quota system for a year , to find out whether this would be viable in future .
small-scale fishermen are excited by the prospect , as the most crippling expense they face is the quota system .
when they were initially introduced , the quotas were awarded to fishermen and trawler operators based on how much fish they were already landing .
these quotas have become tradable assets that can be bought by and subsequently rented out by anyone .
beyond the quotas returning to lowestoft in the early afternoon , maximus is greeted by an empty port .
like the rest of lowestoft 's dwindling fleet of boats under 10m , steve and chris used up what they describe as a meagre quota before easter .
many have decided to cut back sharply on the number of days spent at sea .
steve and chris are more ambitious than most , so they have decided to buy extra quota , even though this means they having to pay about £ 1 / kg for the cod they land .
with some 40 % of the price they get for the fish from the merchants being paid directly to the quota owners , there is precious little left to cover costs and wages - not least since the prices they receive for their fish is already very low .
" prices vary according to how much fish is in the whole country , not just this port , " explains chris , pointing to how a large sea bass that might earn them £ 10 could provide several restaurant meals costing £ 30 a portion .
" the fish we catch , if we were to sell it as fish and chips , we 'd be millionaires . "
high costs , low prices , a shortage of quota and tough restrictions on fishing have combined to bring about the sharp decline in the fisheries industry , chris believes .
" it makes it very difficult for young people like ourselves to get on in the industry , " says chris , surveying the day 's catch .
" enough to pay the bills , but nothing for us today , " concludes chris as he hoists four boxes of fish onto the dock .
" you can sometimes go weeks without a wage , and then you make a month 's wage in a day . "

total commitment four years ago , the two brothers scraped together more than £ 100,000 to buy maximus , an inshore boat complete with satellite navigation equipment and a powerful engine that " gives us an extra two or three hours of home time a day " , steve says .
the fish is pulled in quickly , then killed and gutted immediately in pictures but even so , he remains a foul-weather father who rarely sees his three children while the sun shines .
" when the weather is good , we fish everyday , " explains his brother chris , whose first child is due later this year .
the brothers ' commitment to fishing is total .
" fishing is in our blood , " says chris , gazing up the seagulls that circle over the boat .
" we like to say that they 're all our ancestors . "
adds steve : " we bought our boat just as the beam trawlers were going out of business and the port was taking another downturn . "
at the time there were still seven or eight trawlers here , as well as some 20 inshore boats .
these days , there are no trawlers left , their quotas having been sold to dutch trawlers .
and most of the inshore boats have all but given up , not least because of escalating fuel costs .
" we use about 700 litres of diesel a week , " says steve .
" when we first ordered the boat , it was 25p a litre . "
these days , they pay more than 70p a litre , so their weekly fuel bill has almost tripled to about £ 500 .
rising costs frustrated at the bad start to the day , steve revs the engines and races over to the other end of the line .
all is not lost , and soon their luck turns .
the fish we catch , if we were to sell it as fish and chips , we 'd be millionaires chris wightman , fisherman the line is rolling in fast now , and steve taps it eagerly with the long handle of a home-made hook , knocking off the seaweed , ready to hook in the fish as one by one they break the water 's surface .
behind him , chris stands ready to immediately kill and gut the fish as they come in .
specimens that are too small or species for which there is no market - such as smooth-hounds , a small shark that is abundant in these waters - are thrown back alive .
chris decides to keep one of the smooth-hounds .
" it 's good for kids , ' cos there are no bones in ' em , " he says .
" anything you can do with a chicken , you can do with this . "
complicated quotas with popular fish , most notably cod , at risk of extinction , steve and chris believe consumers should be more adventurous and try new species , thereby helping to reduce the pressure on others .
you can sometimes go weeks without a wage , and then you make a month 's wage in a day chris wightman , fisherman the two see themselves as keen conservationists and insist they are all in favour of measures that help preserve the fish stock , on which they rely for their livelihoods .
yet they have nothing good to say about the fisheries quota system , which they say is overly complicated and restrictive , " but they have n't saved any fish " .
" they put the quota system down each year , and then they base their quotas on the landing figures , " says chris , who believes small , inshore fishing vessels such as maximus have a very small impact on the overall levels of fish stocks .
for this reason , some scientists say it might be possible to relax the quota system for inshore vessels .
maximus is one of 30 boats taking part in a research programme , fishing outside the quota system for a year , to find out whether this would be viable in future .
small-scale fishermen are excited by the prospect , as the most crippling expense they face is the quota system .
when they were initially introduced , the quotas were awarded to fishermen and trawler operators based on how much fish they were already landing .
these quotas have become tradable assets that can be bought by and subsequently rented out by anyone .
beyond the quotas returning to lowestoft in the early afternoon , maximus is greeted by an empty port .
lowestoft fishing port is largely deserted these days like the rest of lowestoft 's dwindling fleet of boats under 10m , steve and chris used up what they describe as a meagre quota before easter .
many have decided to cut back sharply on the number of days spent at sea .
steve and chris are more ambitious than most , so they have decided to buy extra quota , even though this means they having to pay about £ 1 / kg for the cod they land .
with some 40 % of the price they get for the fish from the merchants being paid directly to the quota owners , there is precious little left to cover costs and wages - not least since the prices they receive for their fish is already very low .
" prices vary according to how much fish is in the whole country , not just this port , " explains chris , pointing to how a large sea bass that might earn them £ 10 could provide several restaurant meals costing £ 30 a portion .
" the fish we catch , if we were to sell it as fish and chips , we 'd be millionaires . "
high costs , low prices , a shortage of quota and tough restrictions on fishing have combined to bring about the sharp decline in the fisheries industry , chris believes .
" it makes it very difficult for young people like ourselves to get on in the industry , " says chris , surveying the day 's catch .
" enough to pay the bills , but nothing for us today , " concludes chris as he hoists four boxes of fish onto the dock .
" you can sometimes go weeks without a wage , and then you make a month 's wage in a day . "

steve has high hopes as he sets out to sea yesterday 's catch is still on his mind .
the 50kg crates were filled to the brim with fresh sea bass , cod and plaice , and there were 10 of them - enough to earn him and his brother chris a healthy return for the day .
chris is equally ebullient as the boat makes way towards today 's fishing grounds , just a couple of miles off the suffolk coastline .
" too many people would want to get into it , had it been like this all the time , " cheers chris as he looks towards lowestoft , still visible in the distance .
unlucky fishermen but there are good reasons why steve , 38 , and chris , 33 , are amongst the last of lowestoft 's fishermen .
we bought our boat just as the beam trawlers were going out of business and the port was taking another downturn steve wightman , fisherman days like these are the exception , and theirs is not an easy life even now .
long before most people will be reaching for their alarm clocks this morning , the two brothers are out at sea , digging into large tin baths of ready-baited fishing line which they slowly release abaft .
two-and-a-half miles of line , weighed down by a series of short chains and small anchors , is released in one direction before skipper steve turns their boat maximus to release a second line the same length .
by 0830 , just as the weather begins to turn and the two brothers wriggle into their oilskins , it is time to reverse the operation to see what they have caught .
but as the line is swiftly pulled in by a machine , glistening hooks devoid of fish ping over the starboard side of the boat at eight feet intervals , a clear demonstration of how longline fishing is really hunting rather than gathering .
" skipper 's not very happy at the moment , " grins steve bitterly as he impatiently taps the deck with his large boots .
and then one of the anchors catches on the bottom and the line snaps .
total commitment four years ago , the two brothers scraped together more than £ 100,000 to buy maximus , an inshore boat complete with satellite navigation equipment and a powerful engine that " gives us an extra two or three hours of home time a day " , steve says .

gays , lesbians and transgender people gathered in the central connaught place area in what was the country 's largest ever display of gay pride .
activists also marched in the cities of calcutta , which has seen similar events in the past , and bangalore .
the marchers were demanding an end to discrimination in a society where homosexuality is still illegal .
the gay pride marches are a global event held in the last week of june every year .
they commemorate the anniversary of the 1969 stonewall riots in new york which broke out after police raided a gay bar .
' celebrating sexuality ' marchers in delhi on sunday shouted " long live queer movement " and danced merrily and waved the rainbow flag , revered by sexual minorities around the world .
" this is for the first time delhi is organising a pride festival to celebrate sexuality and people of all sexualities , " student mario depeno was quoted by news agency reuters as saying .
" gays , lesbians , bisexuals , transgender and even straight are coming together here to talk and to celebrate , it 's a party , to celebrate themselves , " he said .
in the eastern city of calcutta , thousands of people gathered to watch the march which has now become an annual event .
" this is a space , this is a public space , this is a space for reclaiming , " reuters quoted one participant , anindya , as saying .
" this is a rally to reclaim our space , the right to live without violence , without coercion , the right to live freely with equality and with dignity , " he said .
homosexuality is illegal in india and various groups are lobbying the government and the courts for a change in the law , which has been in place for more than 145 years .
brought in under british rule , the legal system recognises gay and lesbian relationships " as an unnatural offence " .
in some indian states people have taken their own lives because they have found the law unbearable .
the us-based group human rights watch has also expressed concern about india 's colonial-era law .

the first band to play at the inaugural glastonbury festival have returned to perform at the event 38 years on .
stackridge opened and closed the show in its first year in 1970 .
the psychedelic folk group came back to play on the acoustic stage on sunday .
their set included the first song ever played at glastonbury , tea time .
" i really enjoyed it , " said singer and flautist mutter slater , from bridport , dorset .
" the scale of it now is completely different to the first one . "
the group , now an eight-piece , split up in 1976 but reformed last year .
the first glastonbury was all in one field with a stage made out of scaffolding , slater said .
' hippy dream brigade ' " there was one bloke doing security and two policemen .
some people say there were 1,000 people there but it never looked that many .
" the changing rooms were -lsb- festival founder -rsb- michael eavis ' kitchen and living room in the farmhouse . "
the crowd was mainly made up of " the hippy dream brigade " , he recalled .
" you did n't get the cross section of people you get now , " he said .
on sunday , the band played three or four of the tunes they performed on that day in september 1970 .
this year was the first time slater had been back to the festival and he said he " was n't really looking forward " to seeing what the event had become .
" but i 'm really pleased , " he said .
" it 's a really nice atmosphere .
everyone 's happy and going along their way .
" i thought with all the things going on it was n't going to work , but everyone has their favourite venues and areas .

she spent two hours with him last december after pursuing the zimbabwean president for months .
this is her description of that encounter .
while i waited outside robert mugabe 's office in the foyer of state house , his spokesman hissed at me to get to my feet .
jumping up , i followed the frozen gaze of a dozen officials who stood to attention suddenly .
behind my chair , zimbabwe 's president had appeared in a doorway , motionless and staring straight at me .
i smiled but he stared passively back .

the british spoilt things for the whites " robert mugabe as one of the world 's most reviled leaders continued to study his visitor silently , i realised mr mugabe was almost as wary of me as i was of him .
the six officials in attendance did not move a muscle .
the tension in the room remained suffocating until i was invited by his spokesman to describe the book i was writing .
mr mugabe laughed uproariously when i related an anecdote from my interview with lady mary soames , widow of britain 's last governor in rhodesia .
she told me how her english friends had urged her to send a disapproving letter to mr mugabe , with whom she once socialised , and how she explained to them that , having taken zimbabwe 's president off her christmas card list , she could do no more .

what is lacking now are goods on the shelves - that is all " robert mugabe mr mugabe admitted having no lifelong friends and , as a lonely , bookish child , he recalled " talking to myself , reciting little poems and reading things aloud to myself . "
tears gleamed in his eyes when he recalled the cordial relations he once enjoyed with britain 's royal family .
he talked a lot about his " sacrifice and suffering " , words reminiscent of the christian concepts he imbibed as a child in a catholic mission school .
he told me that his granny was regarded as a heathen , explaining that he could only visit her when the european priests allowed it .
one of them became a surrogate parent after his own father abandoned the family .
i first met mr mugabe in 1975 , shortly before he crossed the border from what was then rhodesia into mozambique to wage war against white minority rule .
he came to dinner at my house , not to meet me but to talk to a constitutional expert , who was my friend .
he was quiet and pleasant , though he became agitated when his lift did not arrive and he thought he would miss his train at 2100 .
seeing my friend could not drive , i decided to take mr mugabe to the station myself , leaving my baby at home alone .
driving fast and in a panic , i told him that i had left my son unattended .
the next day , he phoned from a public call box to thank me for dinner and to ask if my baby was okay .
in contrast to his vitriolic public speeches , underneath there is a shy , softly-spoken man .
when i met him again last year , he remained the same , albeit more severe and distilled .
bubble of denial when discussing his infamous land grab , he referred pointedly to the country 's dispossessed land owners as " british farmers " and made it clear that he held britain responsible for the bloody 15-year-long war with his predecessor ian smith .
mr mugabe is obsessed with his sense of betrayal by the british .
" it was the british who spoilt things for the whites , " he told me .
on his reasoning behind the land invasions , he said : " we had hoped that the british would take notice of it and that they would say : ' let 's meet and discuss this " ' it became clear that mr mugabe has arranged himself in a bubble of denial to avoid facing what he has done in zimbabwe .
when i suggested that his policies had caused the economy to collapse , he sat up straight , his eyes flashing .
" our economy is a hundred times better , than the average african economy .
outside south africa , what country is -lsb- as good as -rsb- zimbabwe ? ... what is lacking now are goods on the shelves - that is all . "
it seemed to me that mr mugabe was showing he was completely out of touch with reality .

she spent two hours with him last december after pursuing the zimbabwean president for months .
this is her description of that encounter .
robert mugabe speaking to heidi holland during the interview while i waited outside robert mugabe 's office in the foyer of state house , his spokesman hissed at me to get to my feet .
jumping up , i followed the frozen gaze of a dozen officials who stood to attention suddenly .
behind my chair , zimbabwe 's president had appeared in a doorway , motionless and staring straight at me .
i smiled but he stared passively back .
his eyes never left my face .
i felt he was trying to get the measure of me .
i had heard from his niece how he used silence as a weapon to unnerve his enemies and ensure that nobody knew what he was thinking .
once i faced mr mugabe across his big desk , he apologised for keeping me waiting in a harare hotel for five weeks .
his face remained expressionless , which is presumably why , having neither frown nor laughter lines , he looks so much younger than his 84 years .
the british spoilt things for the whites robert mugabe as one of the world 's most reviled leaders continued to study his visitor silently , i realised mr mugabe was almost as wary of me as i was of him .
the six officials in attendance did not move a muscle .
the tension in the room remained suffocating until i was invited by his spokesman to describe the book i was writing .
mr mugabe laughed uproariously when i related an anecdote from my interview with lady mary soames , widow of britain 's last governor in rhodesia .
she told me how her english friends had urged her to send a disapproving letter to mr mugabe , with whom she once socialised , and how she explained to them that , having taken zimbabwe 's president off her christmas card list , she could do no more .
lonely child earlier , i had spotted a massive banner inside the presidency on which the words ' mugabe is right ' were emblazoned .
his staff 's obsequious laughter each time he made a sarcastic remark confirmed that their conditions of service included internalising the idea that he can do no wrong .
what is lacking now are goods on the shelves - that is all robert mugabe mr mugabe admitted having no lifelong friends and , as a lonely , bookish child , he recalled " talking to myself , reciting little poems and reading things aloud to myself . "
tears gleamed in his eyes when he recalled the cordial relations he once enjoyed with britain 's royal family .
he talked a lot about his " sacrifice and suffering " , words reminiscent of the christian concepts he imbibed as a child in a catholic mission school .
he told me that his granny was regarded as a heathen , explaining that he could only visit her when the european priests allowed it .
one of them became a surrogate parent after his own father abandoned the family .
i first met mr mugabe in 1975 , shortly before he crossed the border from what was then rhodesia into mozambique to wage war against white minority rule .
he came to dinner at my house , not to meet me but to talk to a constitutional expert , who was my friend .

seeing my friend could not drive , i decided to take mr mugabe to the station myself , leaving my baby at home alone .

it follows a death threat against australia 's top diplomat in fiji , the third in recent weeks .
australia has been a frequent critic of fiji 's military government , which staged a bloodless coup in 2006 .
it has questioned whether leader frank bainimarama will fulfil his promise to hold democratic elections by 2009 .
protection officers the latest threat against australia 's diplomatic staff in fiji arrived in the post on friday .
it is believed to have been made by people unhappy with canberra 's policies towards the south pacific country , and in particular its frequent criticism of the interim military government .
the death threat was sent to high commissioner james batley and was described by officials as a " serious , credible and a disturbing development " .
it is the third time in recent months that threats have been made against him - one was delivered to the high commission in suva by taxi .
mr batley has temporarily left the country , but was due to do so in any case on personal leave which had been arranged earlier .
the fijian government is believed to have stepped up security around the australian compound , but the rudd government would like it to do much more .
in particular , it wants to send in close personal protection officers from the australian federal police - it has done for some time , but its request has not yet been granted .
relations between the two countries have further soured in recent weeks .
earlier this month , australian foreign minister stephen smith said he doubted the commitment of the fijian military to hold elections by 2009 , despite the appointment of a poll advisor .

it follows a death threat against australia 's top diplomat in fiji , the third in recent weeks .
australia has been a frequent critic of fiji 's military government , which staged a bloodless coup in 2006 .
it has questioned whether leader frank bainimarama will fulfil his promise to hold democratic elections by 2009 .
protection officers the latest threat against australia 's diplomatic staff in fiji arrived in the post on friday .
it is believed to have been made by people unhappy with canberra 's policies towards the south pacific country , and in particular its frequent criticism of the interim military government .
the death threat was sent to high commissioner james batley and was described by officials as a " serious , credible and a disturbing development " .
it is the third time in recent months that threats have been made against him - one was delivered to the high commission in suva by taxi .
mr batley has temporarily left the country , but was due to do so in any case on personal leave which had been arranged earlier .
the fijian government is believed to have stepped up security around the australian compound , but the rudd government would like it to do much more .
in particular , it wants to send in close personal protection officers from the australian federal police - it has done for some time , but its request has not yet been granted .
relations between the two countries have further soured in recent weeks .
earlier this month , australian foreign minister stephen smith said he doubted the commitment of the fijian military to hold elections by 2009 , despite the appointment of a poll advisor .
