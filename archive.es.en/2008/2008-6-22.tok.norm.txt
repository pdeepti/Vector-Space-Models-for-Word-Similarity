experts believe the site at al-kibar was used to produce nuclear material the iranian regime needed to make a bomb , the magazine reported . north korean scientists worked alongside syrians and iranians at the site , where a reactor was being built to produce weapons-grade plutonium , der spiegel quoted the intelligence reports as saying . the report said iranian scientists had made progress in enriching uranium but had no experience with plutonium and sought the help of the north koreans . watchdog group to go to syria inspectors from the international atomic energy agency , the united nations nuclear watchdog , are due to travel to syria on sunday to investigate whether the country was building an undeclared reactor . documents and photographs that were sent by washington in april to the iaea backed up the suspicions , but syria has described the allegations as " ridiculous .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de euro 2008 -pipe- 22.06.2008 goalkeepers could be key in germany-turkey semi-final großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : it may all come down to who 's the better keeper turkey may have stolen the show from germany when it comes to fighting spirit at euro 2008 , but the germans could still win their semi-final date because they appear to have the better goalkeeper . jens lehmann has defied the critics with good showings when it mattered , while turkey have to cope with the suspension of volkan demirel and the erratic performance of his replacement rustu recber .
both men have spent long periods of the past season on the substitutes ' bench , lehmann at england 's arsenal and recber at fenerbahce . the 38-year-old lehmann has risen to the occasion when it mattered , playing solidly in germany 's 1-0 win over austria and also in thursday 's 3-2 quarter-final success against portugal . " the bigger the pressure the better jens becomes .
the last games showed that , " said germany goalkeeping coach andreas koepke . " i did n't see jens as critically as others .
we have seen other goalkeepers make errors here .
jens was very strong against austria .
he played a very , very good match against portugal .
he is playing the way we expected him to do and is also a team leader . " lehmann has seemingly calmed down as the tournament progressed .
he met the german media in a very aggressive mood at the start of euro after criticism of his showings in tune-up games .
in contrast , he was very relaxed earlier this week .
experience is n't everything bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : referee peter frojdfeldt sends demirel off the field while lehmann only became germany no. 1 ahead of the 2006 world cup , rustu 's biggest moment was the third-place finish with turkey at the 2002 world cup .
he is now only in goal owing to volkan 's red-card suspension and put in a mixed performance in the quarter-finals against croatia , when he won his 117th cap . rustu looked like he might be the villain of the piece when his blunder allowed ivan klasnic give croatia the lead in the 119th minute , but turkey levelled through semih senturk .
rustu ended up as the hero in the penalty shoot-out when his save from mladen petric clinched the upset in vienna . " rustu is very experienced but not always good , " said germany defender arne friedrich of the 35-year-old . rustu has said he will retire from the national team after euro .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : rene adler is waiting for his chance many in germany expect lehmann to do the same and give way to a younger man .
new blood in training currently , 30-year-old robert enke from hanover and bayer leverkusen 's rene adler , 23 , are in the frame to continue germany 's tradition of great goalkeepers . koepke readily admitted that the future was at stake and enke and adler were training hard in the euro 2008 camp in case lehmann gets injured . " both are doing a really good job .
no one knows what happens after euro .
this is about positioning as well for after euro - and to be fully fit if something happens to jens , " said koepke . dpa news agency -lrb- ncy -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

both men have spent long periods of the past season on the substitutes ' bench , lehmann at england 's arsenal and recber at fenerbahce . the 38-year-old lehmann has risen to the occasion when it mattered , playing solidly in germany 's 1-0 win over austria and also in thursday 's 3-2 quarter-final success against portugal . " the bigger the pressure the better jens becomes .
the last games showed that , " said germany goalkeeping coach andreas koepke . " i did n't see jens as critically as others .
we have seen other goalkeepers make errors here .
jens was very strong against austria .
he played a very , very good match against portugal .
he is playing the way we expected him to do and is also a team leader . " lehmann has seemingly calmed down as the tournament progressed .
he met the german media in a very aggressive mood at the start of euro after criticism of his showings in tune-up games .
in contrast , he was very relaxed earlier this week .

he is now only in goal owing to volkan 's red-card suspension and put in a mixed performance in the quarter-finals against croatia , when he won his 117th cap . rustu looked like he might be the villain of the piece when his blunder allowed ivan klasnic give croatia the lead in the 119th minute , but turkey levelled through semih senturk .
rustu ended up as the hero in the penalty shoot-out when his save from mladen petric clinched the upset in vienna . " rustu is very experienced but not always good , " said germany defender arne friedrich of the 35-year-old . rustu has said he will retire from the national team after euro .

new blood in training currently , 30-year-old robert enke from hanover and bayer leverkusen 's rene adler , 23 , are in the frame to continue germany 's tradition of great goalkeepers . koepke readily admitted that the future was at stake and enke and adler were training hard in the euro 2008 camp in case lehmann gets injured .

both men have spent long periods of the past season on the substitutes ' bench , lehmann at england 's arsenal and recber at fenerbahce . the 38-year-old lehmann has risen to the occasion when it mattered , playing solidly in germany 's 1-0 win over austria and also in thursday 's 3-2 quarter-final success against portugal . " the bigger the pressure the better jens becomes .
the last games showed that , " said germany goalkeeping coach andreas koepke . " i did n't see jens as critically as others .
we have seen other goalkeepers make errors here .
jens was very strong against austria .
he played a very , very good match against portugal .
he is playing the way we expected him to do and is also a team leader . " lehmann has seemingly calmed down as the tournament progressed .
he met the german media in a very aggressive mood at the start of euro after criticism of his showings in tune-up games .
in contrast , he was very relaxed earlier this week .
experience is n't everything bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : referee peter frojdfeldt sends demirel off the field while lehmann only became germany no. 1 ahead of the 2006 world cup , rustu 's biggest moment was the third-place finish with turkey at the 2002 world cup .
he is now only in goal owing to volkan 's red-card suspension and put in a mixed performance in the quarter-finals against croatia , when he won his 117th cap . rustu looked like he might be the villain of the piece when his blunder allowed ivan klasnic give croatia the lead in the 119th minute , but turkey levelled through semih senturk .
rustu ended up as the hero in the penalty shoot-out when his save from mladen petric clinched the upset in vienna . " rustu is very experienced but not always good , " said germany defender arne friedrich of the 35-year-old . rustu has said he will retire from the national team after euro .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : rene adler is waiting for his chance many in germany expect lehmann to do the same and give way to a younger man .
new blood in training currently , 30-year-old robert enke from hanover and bayer leverkusen 's rene adler , 23 , are in the frame to continue germany 's tradition of great goalkeepers . koepke readily admitted that the future was at stake and enke and adler were training hard in the euro 2008 camp in case lehmann gets injured . " both are doing a really good job .
no one knows what happens after euro .
this is about positioning as well for after euro - and to be fully fit if something happens to jens , " said koepke . dpa news agency -lrb- ncy -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

" where people have to fear for their lives because they vote for the opposition then democracy is a farce , " the minister said . " i appeal to those in power in zimbabwe to stop using violence and intimidation as a political instrument and create conditions in which human rights are respected and economic progress is possible , " he added . germany 's development minister was more critical , accusing africa of reacting " too late and too indecisively " to events in zimbabwe .

" under these conditions , the elections would have been a parody of democracy that is unworthy of today 's africa , " he added . solana also praised the african union and the southern african development community -lrb- sadc -rrb- for " having attempted to bring zimbabwe to reason .

" where people have to fear for their lives because they vote for the opposition then democracy is a farce , " the minister said . " i appeal to those in power in zimbabwe to stop using violence and intimidation as a political instrument and create conditions in which human rights are respected and economic progress is possible , " he added . germany 's development minister was more critical , accusing africa of reacting " too late and too indecisively " to events in zimbabwe .
heidemarie wieczorek-zeul said on monday it is time for the world to " answer zimbabwe 's cry for help " after opposition leader morgan tsvangirai pulled out of the country 's violence-wracked presidential runoff sunday .
she said in a statement monday that the southern african development community and the african union " have dealt too late and too indecisively with the escalating situation . "
mounting violence earlier sunday , tsvangirai pulled out of zimbabwe 's election run-off , saying violence had made a fair vote impossible , in a move that virtually hands victory to president robert mugabe . tsvangirai 's movement for democratic change -lrb- mdc -rrb- says at least 70 of its supporters have been killed in recent weeks and 25,000 forced from their homes in a state-sponsored campaign of violence .
one of its top leaders , tendai biti , has also been charged with treason and subversion .
the charges carry a possible death sentence . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : mugabe is accused of orchestrating violent attacks against opposition supporters tsvangirai made his announcement after hundreds of stick-wielding youths gathered at the venue of his party 's main pre-election rally , and following a meeting of his movement for democratic change to decide whether to withdraw from the election . up to 1,000 youths gathered at the rally grounds in the capital harare before moving on to the nearby headquarters of the ruling zanu-pf party , witnesses and afp journalists said . police officers and election observers had taken up positions nearby . tsvangirai beat mugabe in the march first round of the vote - and the ruling party lost its parliamentary majority for the first time since independence . but official results showed the mdc leader failed to achieve an outright majority of votes needed to become head of state without a run-off . eu calls vote a parody " the eu 's chief diplomat , javier solana , has expressed sympathy for the decision of zimbabwe 's opposition not to take part in the second round of the country 's presidential elections , calling the vote a " parody . " the " systematic campaign of violence , interference and intimidation by the zimbabwean authorities " made clear the reasoning behind the opposition move , solana said in a statement from brussels . " under these conditions , the elections would have been a parody of democracy that is unworthy of today 's africa , " he added . solana also praised the african union and the southern african development community -lrb- sadc -rrb- for " having attempted to bring zimbabwe to reason . " us , britain to raise concerns with un zimbabwe 's violent electoral crisis has sparked international condemnation with both london and washington saying they were prepared to raise their concerns in the united nations security council on monday .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : protests against mugabe outside the zimbabwean embassy in london british foreign secretary david miliband said zimbabwe would lack " legitimate " leadership if mugabe stayed in charge , and accused him of using violence to cling to power .
" a government which violates the constitution in zimbabwe can not be held as the legitimate representative of the zimbabwean people , " miliband said , referring to mugabe 's slowness to hold a run-off after the march 29 election .
miliband described the violence as " state-sponsored on a very large scale with one very clear motivation " - to keep mugabe in power . "
white house spokesman carlton carroll urged zimbabwe to halt violence following reports that mugabe loyalists had beaten , burned and killed opposition supporters .
" the government of zimbabwe and its thugs must stop the violence now , " carroll said in a statement .
" the mugabe regime reinforces its illegitimacy every day .
the senseless acts of violence against the opposition as well as election monitors must stop . " dw staff -lrb- sp -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

both men have spent long periods of the past season on the substitutes ' bench , lehmann at england 's arsenal and recber at fenerbahce . the 38-year-old lehmann has risen to the occasion when it mattered , playing solidly in germany 's 1-0 win over austria and also in thursday 's 3-2 quarter-final success against portugal . " the bigger the pressure the better jens becomes .
the last games showed that , " said germany goalkeeping coach andreas koepke . " i did n't see jens as critically as others .
we have seen other goalkeepers make errors here .
jens was very strong against austria .
he played a very , very good match against portugal .
he is playing the way we expected him to do and is also a team leader . " lehmann has seemingly calmed down as the tournament progressed .
he met the german media in a very aggressive mood at the start of euro after criticism of his showings in tune-up games .
in contrast , he was very relaxed earlier this week .

he is now only in goal owing to volkan 's red-card suspension and put in a mixed performance in the quarter-finals against croatia , when he won his 117th cap . rustu looked like he might be the villain of the piece when his blunder allowed ivan klasnic give croatia the lead in the 119th minute , but turkey levelled through semih senturk .
rustu ended up as the hero in the penalty shoot-out when his save from mladen petric clinched the upset in vienna . " rustu is very experienced but not always good , " said germany defender arne friedrich of the 35-year-old . rustu has said he will retire from the national team after euro .

new blood in training currently , 30-year-old robert enke from hanover and bayer leverkusen 's rene adler , 23 , are in the frame to continue germany 's tradition of great goalkeepers . koepke readily admitted that the future was at stake and enke and adler were training hard in the euro 2008 camp in case lehmann gets injured .

" where people have to fear for their lives because they vote for the opposition then democracy is a farce , " the minister said . " i appeal to those in power in zimbabwe to stop using violence and intimidation as a political instrument and create conditions in which human rights are respected and economic progress is possible , " he added . germany 's development minister was more critical , accusing africa of reacting " too late and too indecisively " to events in zimbabwe .
heidemarie wieczorek-zeul said on monday it is time for the world to " answer zimbabwe 's cry for help " after opposition leader morgan tsvangirai pulled out of the country 's violence-wracked presidential runoff sunday .
she said in a statement monday that the southern african development community and the african union " have dealt too late and too indecisively with the escalating situation . "
mounting violence earlier sunday , tsvangirai pulled out of zimbabwe 's election run-off , saying violence had made a fair vote impossible , in a move that virtually hands victory to president robert mugabe . tsvangirai 's movement for democratic change -lrb- mdc -rrb- says at least 70 of its supporters have been killed in recent weeks and 25,000 forced from their homes in a state-sponsored campaign of violence .
one of its top leaders , tendai biti , has also been charged with treason and subversion .
the charges carry a possible death sentence . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : mugabe is accused of orchestrating violent attacks against opposition supporters tsvangirai made his announcement after hundreds of stick-wielding youths gathered at the venue of his party 's main pre-election rally , and following a meeting of his movement for democratic change to decide whether to withdraw from the election . up to 1,000 youths gathered at the rally grounds in the capital harare before moving on to the nearby headquarters of the ruling zanu-pf party , witnesses and afp journalists said . police officers and election observers had taken up positions nearby . tsvangirai beat mugabe in the march first round of the vote - and the ruling party lost its parliamentary majority for the first time since independence . but official results showed the mdc leader failed to achieve an outright majority of votes needed to become head of state without a run-off . eu calls vote a parody " the eu 's chief diplomat , javier solana , has expressed sympathy for the decision of zimbabwe 's opposition not to take part in the second round of the country 's presidential elections , calling the vote a " parody . " the " systematic campaign of violence , interference and intimidation by the zimbabwean authorities " made clear the reasoning behind the opposition move , solana said in a statement from brussels . " under these conditions , the elections would have been a parody of democracy that is unworthy of today 's africa , " he added . solana also praised the african union and the southern african development community -lrb- sadc -rrb- for " having attempted to bring zimbabwe to reason . " us , britain to raise concerns with un zimbabwe 's violent electoral crisis has sparked international condemnation with both london and washington saying they were prepared to raise their concerns in the united nations security council on monday .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : protests against mugabe outside the zimbabwean embassy in london british foreign secretary david miliband said zimbabwe would lack " legitimate " leadership if mugabe stayed in charge , and accused him of using violence to cling to power .
" a government which violates the constitution in zimbabwe can not be held as the legitimate representative of the zimbabwean people , " miliband said , referring to mugabe 's slowness to hold a run-off after the march 29 election .
miliband described the violence as " state-sponsored on a very large scale with one very clear motivation " - to keep mugabe in power . "
white house spokesman carlton carroll urged zimbabwe to halt violence following reports that mugabe loyalists had beaten , burned and killed opposition supporters .
" the government of zimbabwe and its thugs must stop the violence now , " carroll said in a statement .
" the mugabe regime reinforces its illegitimacy every day .
the senseless acts of violence against the opposition as well as election monitors must stop . " dw staff -lrb- sp -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

but would a " fair trade " label influence people shopping for a vacation ? the " fair trade " seal of approval takes the guesswork out of finding groceries and clothing that meet high ethical standards .
despite the label 's popularity , the concept has yet to catch on in the tourism industry , as vacationers find it difficult to say which tour companies and hotels adhere to fair trade principles . still , some say the time is ripe for a wider analysis of fair trade in the tourism industry .
travelers worried about the ecological and sociological impact of their spending habits have fueled a trend toward responsible tourism . " people do not want to have a guilty conscience when they travel , " said rainer hartmann , a professor at bremen college .
he says there is a demand for fair trade travel , a trend that heinz fuchs of tourism watch , part of the bonn-based church development service , has also noticed . " transfair products increased by 30 percent in 2007 , " says fuchs .
" this idea is pretty widespread in other countries , but it 's just catching on here .

" employees should have health and accident insurance , as well as unemployment insurance . " there 's also widespread agreement that tour operators and companies should not get the seal .

not only would it have the bonus of providing a standard set of criteria , it would also add transparency .
" it would make it easier to convey that ' this trip is ok , " ' he said . still , not everyone is convinced a seal is the best idea . " certification is not cheap .
it costs several thousand euros , " said rolf pfeifer , chief executive officer of forum anders reisen , a group of travel operators dedicated to environmentally sound tourism . " a lot of hotels wo n't be able to afford it .

but would a " fair trade " label influence people shopping for a vacation ? the " fair trade " seal of approval takes the guesswork out of finding groceries and clothing that meet high ethical standards .
despite the label 's popularity , the concept has yet to catch on in the tourism industry , as vacationers find it difficult to say which tour companies and hotels adhere to fair trade principles . still , some say the time is ripe for a wider analysis of fair trade in the tourism industry .
travelers worried about the ecological and sociological impact of their spending habits have fueled a trend toward responsible tourism . " people do not want to have a guilty conscience when they travel , " said rainer hartmann , a professor at bremen college .
he says there is a demand for fair trade travel , a trend that heinz fuchs of tourism watch , part of the bonn-based church development service , has also noticed . " transfair products increased by 30 percent in 2007 , " says fuchs .
" this idea is pretty widespread in other countries , but it 's just catching on here .

south africa 's tourist organizations already use them and some european organizations are considering similar ideas . an international working group has been trying to lay down criteria for a seal here that would look at factors such as fair pay for workers . " there have to be set working hours , ” said fuchs .
" employees should have health and accident insurance , as well as unemployment insurance . " there 's also widespread agreement that tour operators and companies should not get the seal .
it should instead be awarded to products such as individual tours . the group has likewise agreed that the label should not focus on niche markets for do-gooders . " it should instead focus on mainstream tourism , " says fuchs . certification would raise consciousness , transparency bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : as with organic apples , a fair trade seal might make ethical selection easier hartmann said he sees the merit of such proposals .
" consciousness in this area has grown , just like the evolution of organic food products , which are now on sale at every discount store . " and just like organic apples , a seal of approval for fair trade travel would be useful , he adds .
not only would it have the bonus of providing a standard set of criteria , it would also add transparency .

experts believe the site at al-kibar was used to produce nuclear material the iranian regime needed to make a bomb , the magazine reported . north korean scientists worked alongside syrians and iranians at the site , where a reactor was being built to produce weapons-grade plutonium , der spiegel quoted the intelligence reports as saying . the report said iranian scientists had made progress in enriching uranium but had no experience with plutonium and sought the help of the north koreans . watchdog group to go to syria inspectors from the international atomic energy agency , the united nations nuclear watchdog , are due to travel to syria on sunday to investigate whether the country was building an undeclared reactor . documents and photographs that were sent by washington in april to the iaea backed up the suspicions , but syria has described the allegations as " ridiculous . " damascus maintains that the site , which satellite images show has since been razed , was a military installation and not a nuclear facility . bildunterschrift : satellite imagery showing a suspected nuclear facility before and after being destroyed by an israeli airstrike iran says its nuclear program is not geared towards making weapons but for electricity generation to meet the needs of its growing population .
tehran 's decision to begin enriching uranium in 2006 triggered western sanctions . iran on saturday stressed it will not negotiate with world powers over its nuclear program if it is required to suspend its uranium enrichment activities . der spiegel , which did not elaborate on al-assad 's reported change of heart , also said iran , syria and north korea had apparently been cooperating in the production of chemical weapons . it cited an explosion near the syrian city of aleppo in july 2007 , during which many were reported to have died when quantities of mustard gas and the nerve agent sarin escaped . in addition to 15 syrian military officials , dozens of iranian " rocket scientists " and three north koreans were among those killed , the magazine said .

" where people have to fear for their lives because they vote for the opposition then democracy is a farce , " the minister said . " i appeal to those in power in zimbabwe to stop using violence and intimidation as a political instrument and create conditions in which human rights are respected and economic progress is possible , " he added . germany 's development minister was more critical , accusing africa of reacting " too late and too indecisively " to events in zimbabwe .
heidemarie wieczorek-zeul said on monday it is time for the world to " answer zimbabwe 's cry for help " after opposition leader morgan tsvangirai pulled out of the country 's violence-wracked presidential runoff sunday .
she said in a statement monday that the southern african development community and the african union " have dealt too late and too indecisively with the escalating situation . "
mounting violence earlier sunday , tsvangirai pulled out of zimbabwe 's election run-off , saying violence had made a fair vote impossible , in a move that virtually hands victory to president robert mugabe . tsvangirai 's movement for democratic change -lrb- mdc -rrb- says at least 70 of its supporters have been killed in recent weeks and 25,000 forced from their homes in a state-sponsored campaign of violence .
one of its top leaders , tendai biti , has also been charged with treason and subversion .
the charges carry a possible death sentence . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : mugabe is accused of orchestrating violent attacks against opposition supporters tsvangirai made his announcement after hundreds of stick-wielding youths gathered at the venue of his party 's main pre-election rally , and following a meeting of his movement for democratic change to decide whether to withdraw from the election . up to 1,000 youths gathered at the rally grounds in the capital harare before moving on to the nearby headquarters of the ruling zanu-pf party , witnesses and afp journalists said . police officers and election observers had taken up positions nearby . tsvangirai beat mugabe in the march first round of the vote - and the ruling party lost its parliamentary majority for the first time since independence . but official results showed the mdc leader failed to achieve an outright majority of votes needed to become head of state without a run-off . eu calls vote a parody " the eu 's chief diplomat , javier solana , has expressed sympathy for the decision of zimbabwe 's opposition not to take part in the second round of the country 's presidential elections , calling the vote a " parody . " the " systematic campaign of violence , interference and intimidation by the zimbabwean authorities " made clear the reasoning behind the opposition move , solana said in a statement from brussels . " under these conditions , the elections would have been a parody of democracy that is unworthy of today 's africa , " he added . solana also praised the african union and the southern african development community -lrb- sadc -rrb- for " having attempted to bring zimbabwe to reason . " us , britain to raise concerns with un zimbabwe 's violent electoral crisis has sparked international condemnation with both london and washington saying they were prepared to raise their concerns in the united nations security council on monday .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : protests against mugabe outside the zimbabwean embassy in london british foreign secretary david miliband said zimbabwe would lack " legitimate " leadership if mugabe stayed in charge , and accused him of using violence to cling to power .
" a government which violates the constitution in zimbabwe can not be held as the legitimate representative of the zimbabwean people , " miliband said , referring to mugabe 's slowness to hold a run-off after the march 29 election .
miliband described the violence as " state-sponsored on a very large scale with one very clear motivation " - to keep mugabe in power . "
white house spokesman carlton carroll urged zimbabwe to halt violence following reports that mugabe loyalists had beaten , burned and killed opposition supporters .
" the government of zimbabwe and its thugs must stop the violence now , " carroll said in a statement .
" the mugabe regime reinforces its illegitimacy every day .
the senseless acts of violence against the opposition as well as election monitors must stop . " dw staff -lrb- sp -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

" regarding that and regarding the end of the game after 90 minutes , going into extra-time , what they did was a tremendous , unbelievable achievement , " he said . " i think the team was superior technically , in the control and passing , but also tactically , and also the physical part superior to the dutch game .
we were better in our opponents in all components of the game , " he said . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : pavlyuchenko scored the opening goal many commentators questioned hiddink 's decision to take arshavin to the tournament despite the suspension , but have been silenced by superlative displays from the zenit youngster against sweden and now the netherlands . russia were more artful , sophisticated and thoughtful than the bewildered dutch all night - and should have won without needing extra time .
van basten , van der sar leave the stage dutch coach marco van basten praised the russian performance and said they deserved their victory .
he now leaves the national side to take on an appointment with ajax . it was also an international farewell for dutch veteran keeper edwin van der sar .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : it was edwin van der sar 's last match " that 's part of football , " van basten said .
" i feel very sorry for edwin van der sar because i really wanted to give him a nice final in the national team .
he is such a great goalkeeper and he deserves winning a tournament like this .
we tried and did n't succeed . " " we did n't start well and did n't play football like we did in the first three matches .
i do n't know why .
they were a little bit nervous perhaps . " dutch veteran ruud van nistelrooy took the battle beautifully into extra-time with a headed equalizer four minutes from the end of normal time .
russians clearly fresher but the russians were not to be denied their fully deserved win , which sets them up for a semi-final clash on thursday against italy or spain . the three quarter-finals played so far have all been won by teams who finished second in their first-round group , despite having less time to prepare for the quarters than the first- placed teams . " normally you are handicapped when the other side scores such a late goal , but we were dominant .
we were physically and tactically dominant , " hiddink said . although van basten had the luxury of resting most of his first-choice players for their last group game , it was the russians who looked the fresher .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : van nistelrooy gave the dutch the equalizer " we had some physical problems .
my players simply had no more strength .
that is a pity , but the russians deserved the victory , they were clearly the better side . "
two goals in extra-time russia were far superior in the first half - with their excellent movement and precise passing - and should have taken the lead . their dominance continued after the interval .
pavlyuchenko 's volley took them ahead in the 56th minute , on a centre from the left from sergei semak . # bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : torbinski scored his side 's second goal russia then missed good chances to put the dutch out of their misery , and paid the price when van nistelrooy made it 1-1 by heading in a wesley sneijder free-kick in the 86th minute . in second half injury time russian denis kolodin was shown a second yellow card after fouling sneijder , but referee lubos michel was told by his assistant that the ball had already crossed the line , and the referee then withdrew the booking allowing kolodin to stay on the field . a dutch revival seemed on the cards .
instead , van basten 's team looked exhausted and russia took advantage to create several good chances on the break . eight minutes from the end of extra-time , with penalties looming , the magnificent arshavin centered for torbinksy to tap in from close range . arshavin then rounded off a remarkable performance by making it 3-1 with a cheeky shot that went through van der sar 's legs . dpa news agency -lrb- ncy -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de travel -pipe- 22.06.2008 european groups work to promote ethical travel großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : some in the travel industry want to increase ethical standards in the tourism sector the " fair trade " label is appearing on many goods nowadays - from coffee and chocolate to apples and apparel .
but would a " fair trade " label influence people shopping for a vacation ? the " fair trade " seal of approval takes the guesswork out of finding groceries and clothing that meet high ethical standards .
despite the label 's popularity , the concept has yet to catch on in the tourism industry , as vacationers find it difficult to say which tour companies and hotels adhere to fair trade principles . still , some say the time is ripe for a wider analysis of fair trade in the tourism industry .
travelers worried about the ecological and sociological impact of their spending habits have fueled a trend toward responsible tourism . " people do not want to have a guilty conscience when they travel , " said rainer hartmann , a professor at bremen college .
he says there is a demand for fair trade travel , a trend that heinz fuchs of tourism watch , part of the bonn-based church development service , has also noticed . " transfair products increased by 30 percent in 2007 , " says fuchs .
" this idea is pretty widespread in other countries , but it 's just catching on here . " working group establishing criteria bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the group wants to concentrate on mainstream tourism indeed , " fair trade " labels are not entirely new in the travel industry .
south africa 's tourist organizations already use them and some european organizations are considering similar ideas . an international working group has been trying to lay down criteria for a seal here that would look at factors such as fair pay for workers . " there have to be set working hours , ” said fuchs .
" employees should have health and accident insurance , as well as unemployment insurance . " there 's also widespread agreement that tour operators and companies should not get the seal .
it should instead be awarded to products such as individual tours . the group has likewise agreed that the label should not focus on niche markets for do-gooders . " it should instead focus on mainstream tourism , " says fuchs . certification would raise consciousness , transparency bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : as with organic apples , a fair trade seal might make ethical selection easier hartmann said he sees the merit of such proposals .
" consciousness in this area has grown , just like the evolution of organic food products , which are now on sale at every discount store . " and just like organic apples , a seal of approval for fair trade travel would be useful , he adds .
not only would it have the bonus of providing a standard set of criteria , it would also add transparency .
" it would make it easier to convey that ' this trip is ok , " ' he said . still , not everyone is convinced a seal is the best idea . " certification is not cheap .
it costs several thousand euros , " said rolf pfeifer , chief executive officer of forum anders reisen , a group of travel operators dedicated to environmentally sound tourism . " a lot of hotels wo n't be able to afford it .
nor will a lot of small operators . " pfeifer 's company recently completed a report on corporate social responsibility -lrb- csr -rrb- in tourism .
the report is meant to serve as the basis for sustainability reports for other organizers to show how they comply . a recent decision by the forum requires all members to get csr certification by the end of 2010 .
the certification would cover many of the same values covered by any fair trade seal . dw staff -lrb- cat -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

both men have spent long periods of the past season on the substitutes ' bench , lehmann at england 's arsenal and recber at fenerbahce . the 38-year-old lehmann has risen to the occasion when it mattered , playing solidly in germany 's 1-0 win over austria and also in thursday 's 3-2 quarter-final success against portugal . " the bigger the pressure the better jens becomes .
the last games showed that , " said germany goalkeeping coach andreas koepke . " i did n't see jens as critically as others .
we have seen other goalkeepers make errors here .
jens was very strong against austria .
he played a very , very good match against portugal .
he is playing the way we expected him to do and is also a team leader . " lehmann has seemingly calmed down as the tournament progressed .
he met the german media in a very aggressive mood at the start of euro after criticism of his showings in tune-up games .
in contrast , he was very relaxed earlier this week .
experience is n't everything bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : referee peter frojdfeldt sends demirel off the field while lehmann only became germany no. 1 ahead of the 2006 world cup , rustu 's biggest moment was the third-place finish with turkey at the 2002 world cup .
he is now only in goal owing to volkan 's red-card suspension and put in a mixed performance in the quarter-finals against croatia , when he won his 117th cap . rustu looked like he might be the villain of the piece when his blunder allowed ivan klasnic give croatia the lead in the 119th minute , but turkey levelled through semih senturk .
rustu ended up as the hero in the penalty shoot-out when his save from mladen petric clinched the upset in vienna . " rustu is very experienced but not always good , " said germany defender arne friedrich of the 35-year-old . rustu has said he will retire from the national team after euro .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : rene adler is waiting for his chance many in germany expect lehmann to do the same and give way to a younger man .
new blood in training currently , 30-year-old robert enke from hanover and bayer leverkusen 's rene adler , 23 , are in the frame to continue germany 's tradition of great goalkeepers . koepke readily admitted that the future was at stake and enke and adler were training hard in the euro 2008 camp in case lehmann gets injured . " both are doing a really good job .
no one knows what happens after euro .
this is about positioning as well for after euro - and to be fully fit if something happens to jens , " said koepke . dpa news agency -lrb- ncy -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

but would a " fair trade " label influence people shopping for a vacation ? the " fair trade " seal of approval takes the guesswork out of finding groceries and clothing that meet high ethical standards .
despite the label 's popularity , the concept has yet to catch on in the tourism industry , as vacationers find it difficult to say which tour companies and hotels adhere to fair trade principles . still , some say the time is ripe for a wider analysis of fair trade in the tourism industry .
travelers worried about the ecological and sociological impact of their spending habits have fueled a trend toward responsible tourism . " people do not want to have a guilty conscience when they travel , " said rainer hartmann , a professor at bremen college .
he says there is a demand for fair trade travel , a trend that heinz fuchs of tourism watch , part of the bonn-based church development service , has also noticed . " transfair products increased by 30 percent in 2007 , " says fuchs .
" this idea is pretty widespread in other countries , but it 's just catching on here . " working group establishing criteria bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the group wants to concentrate on mainstream tourism indeed , " fair trade " labels are not entirely new in the travel industry .
south africa 's tourist organizations already use them and some european organizations are considering similar ideas . an international working group has been trying to lay down criteria for a seal here that would look at factors such as fair pay for workers . " there have to be set working hours , ” said fuchs .
" employees should have health and accident insurance , as well as unemployment insurance . " there 's also widespread agreement that tour operators and companies should not get the seal .
it should instead be awarded to products such as individual tours . the group has likewise agreed that the label should not focus on niche markets for do-gooders . " it should instead focus on mainstream tourism , " says fuchs . certification would raise consciousness , transparency bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : as with organic apples , a fair trade seal might make ethical selection easier hartmann said he sees the merit of such proposals .
" consciousness in this area has grown , just like the evolution of organic food products , which are now on sale at every discount store . " and just like organic apples , a seal of approval for fair trade travel would be useful , he adds .
not only would it have the bonus of providing a standard set of criteria , it would also add transparency .
" it would make it easier to convey that ' this trip is ok , " ' he said . still , not everyone is convinced a seal is the best idea . " certification is not cheap .
it costs several thousand euros , " said rolf pfeifer , chief executive officer of forum anders reisen , a group of travel operators dedicated to environmentally sound tourism . " a lot of hotels wo n't be able to afford it .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de travel -pipe- 22.06.2008 european groups work to promote ethical travel großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : some in the travel industry want to increase ethical standards in the tourism sector the " fair trade " label is appearing on many goods nowadays - from coffee and chocolate to apples and apparel .
but would a " fair trade " label influence people shopping for a vacation ? the " fair trade " seal of approval takes the guesswork out of finding groceries and clothing that meet high ethical standards .
despite the label 's popularity , the concept has yet to catch on in the tourism industry , as vacationers find it difficult to say which tour companies and hotels adhere to fair trade principles . still , some say the time is ripe for a wider analysis of fair trade in the tourism industry .
travelers worried about the ecological and sociological impact of their spending habits have fueled a trend toward responsible tourism . " people do not want to have a guilty conscience when they travel , " said rainer hartmann , a professor at bremen college .
he says there is a demand for fair trade travel , a trend that heinz fuchs of tourism watch , part of the bonn-based church development service , has also noticed . " transfair products increased by 30 percent in 2007 , " says fuchs .
" this idea is pretty widespread in other countries , but it 's just catching on here . " working group establishing criteria bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the group wants to concentrate on mainstream tourism indeed , " fair trade " labels are not entirely new in the travel industry .
south africa 's tourist organizations already use them and some european organizations are considering similar ideas . an international working group has been trying to lay down criteria for a seal here that would look at factors such as fair pay for workers . " there have to be set working hours , ” said fuchs .
" employees should have health and accident insurance , as well as unemployment insurance . " there 's also widespread agreement that tour operators and companies should not get the seal .
it should instead be awarded to products such as individual tours . the group has likewise agreed that the label should not focus on niche markets for do-gooders . " it should instead focus on mainstream tourism , " says fuchs . certification would raise consciousness , transparency bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : as with organic apples , a fair trade seal might make ethical selection easier hartmann said he sees the merit of such proposals .
" consciousness in this area has grown , just like the evolution of organic food products , which are now on sale at every discount store . " and just like organic apples , a seal of approval for fair trade travel would be useful , he adds .
not only would it have the bonus of providing a standard set of criteria , it would also add transparency .
" it would make it easier to convey that ' this trip is ok , " ' he said . still , not everyone is convinced a seal is the best idea . " certification is not cheap .
it costs several thousand euros , " said rolf pfeifer , chief executive officer of forum anders reisen , a group of travel operators dedicated to environmentally sound tourism . " a lot of hotels wo n't be able to afford it .
nor will a lot of small operators . " pfeifer 's company recently completed a report on corporate social responsibility -lrb- csr -rrb- in tourism .
the report is meant to serve as the basis for sustainability reports for other organizers to show how they comply . a recent decision by the forum requires all members to get csr certification by the end of 2010 .
the certification would cover many of the same values covered by any fair trade seal . dw staff -lrb- cat -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de euro 2008 -pipe- 22.06.2008 goalkeepers could be key in germany-turkey semi-final großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : it may all come down to who 's the better keeper turkey may have stolen the show from germany when it comes to fighting spirit at euro 2008 , but the germans could still win their semi-final date because they appear to have the better goalkeeper . jens lehmann has defied the critics with good showings when it mattered , while turkey have to cope with the suspension of volkan demirel and the erratic performance of his replacement rustu recber .
both men have spent long periods of the past season on the substitutes ' bench , lehmann at england 's arsenal and recber at fenerbahce . the 38-year-old lehmann has risen to the occasion when it mattered , playing solidly in germany 's 1-0 win over austria and also in thursday 's 3-2 quarter-final success against portugal . " the bigger the pressure the better jens becomes .
the last games showed that , " said germany goalkeeping coach andreas koepke . " i did n't see jens as critically as others .
we have seen other goalkeepers make errors here .
jens was very strong against austria .
he played a very , very good match against portugal .
he is playing the way we expected him to do and is also a team leader . " lehmann has seemingly calmed down as the tournament progressed .
he met the german media in a very aggressive mood at the start of euro after criticism of his showings in tune-up games .
in contrast , he was very relaxed earlier this week .
experience is n't everything bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : referee peter frojdfeldt sends demirel off the field while lehmann only became germany no. 1 ahead of the 2006 world cup , rustu 's biggest moment was the third-place finish with turkey at the 2002 world cup .
he is now only in goal owing to volkan 's red-card suspension and put in a mixed performance in the quarter-finals against croatia , when he won his 117th cap . rustu looked like he might be the villain of the piece when his blunder allowed ivan klasnic give croatia the lead in the 119th minute , but turkey levelled through semih senturk .
rustu ended up as the hero in the penalty shoot-out when his save from mladen petric clinched the upset in vienna . " rustu is very experienced but not always good , " said germany defender arne friedrich of the 35-year-old . rustu has said he will retire from the national team after euro .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : rene adler is waiting for his chance many in germany expect lehmann to do the same and give way to a younger man .
new blood in training currently , 30-year-old robert enke from hanover and bayer leverkusen 's rene adler , 23 , are in the frame to continue germany 's tradition of great goalkeepers . koepke readily admitted that the future was at stake and enke and adler were training hard in the euro 2008 camp in case lehmann gets injured . " both are doing a really good job .
no one knows what happens after euro .
this is about positioning as well for after euro - and to be fully fit if something happens to jens , " said koepke . dpa news agency -lrb- ncy -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

both men have spent long periods of the past season on the substitutes ' bench , lehmann at england 's arsenal and recber at fenerbahce . the 38-year-old lehmann has risen to the occasion when it mattered , playing solidly in germany 's 1-0 win over austria and also in thursday 's 3-2 quarter-final success against portugal . " the bigger the pressure the better jens becomes .
the last games showed that , " said germany goalkeeping coach andreas koepke . " i did n't see jens as critically as others .
we have seen other goalkeepers make errors here .
jens was very strong against austria .
he played a very , very good match against portugal .
he is playing the way we expected him to do and is also a team leader . " lehmann has seemingly calmed down as the tournament progressed .
he met the german media in a very aggressive mood at the start of euro after criticism of his showings in tune-up games .
in contrast , he was very relaxed earlier this week .
experience is n't everything bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : referee peter frojdfeldt sends demirel off the field while lehmann only became germany no. 1 ahead of the 2006 world cup , rustu 's biggest moment was the third-place finish with turkey at the 2002 world cup .
he is now only in goal owing to volkan 's red-card suspension and put in a mixed performance in the quarter-finals against croatia , when he won his 117th cap . rustu looked like he might be the villain of the piece when his blunder allowed ivan klasnic give croatia the lead in the 119th minute , but turkey levelled through semih senturk .
rustu ended up as the hero in the penalty shoot-out when his save from mladen petric clinched the upset in vienna . " rustu is very experienced but not always good , " said germany defender arne friedrich of the 35-year-old . rustu has said he will retire from the national team after euro .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : rene adler is waiting for his chance many in germany expect lehmann to do the same and give way to a younger man .
new blood in training currently , 30-year-old robert enke from hanover and bayer leverkusen 's rene adler , 23 , are in the frame to continue germany 's tradition of great goalkeepers . koepke readily admitted that the future was at stake and enke and adler were training hard in the euro 2008 camp in case lehmann gets injured . " both are doing a really good job .
no one knows what happens after euro .

" regarding that and regarding the end of the game after 90 minutes , going into extra-time , what they did was a tremendous , unbelievable achievement , " he said . " i think the team was superior technically , in the control and passing , but also tactically , and also the physical part superior to the dutch game .
we were better in our opponents in all components of the game , " he said . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : pavlyuchenko scored the opening goal many commentators questioned hiddink 's decision to take arshavin to the tournament despite the suspension , but have been silenced by superlative displays from the zenit youngster against sweden and now the netherlands . russia were more artful , sophisticated and thoughtful than the bewildered dutch all night - and should have won without needing extra time .
van basten , van der sar leave the stage dutch coach marco van basten praised the russian performance and said they deserved their victory .
he now leaves the national side to take on an appointment with ajax . it was also an international farewell for dutch veteran keeper edwin van der sar .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : it was edwin van der sar 's last match " that 's part of football , " van basten said .
" i feel very sorry for edwin van der sar because i really wanted to give him a nice final in the national team .
he is such a great goalkeeper and he deserves winning a tournament like this .
we tried and did n't succeed . " " we did n't start well and did n't play football like we did in the first three matches .
i do n't know why .
they were a little bit nervous perhaps . " dutch veteran ruud van nistelrooy took the battle beautifully into extra-time with a headed equalizer four minutes from the end of normal time .
russians clearly fresher but the russians were not to be denied their fully deserved win , which sets them up for a semi-final clash on thursday against italy or spain . the three quarter-finals played so far have all been won by teams who finished second in their first-round group , despite having less time to prepare for the quarters than the first- placed teams . " normally you are handicapped when the other side scores such a late goal , but we were dominant .
we were physically and tactically dominant , " hiddink said . although van basten had the luxury of resting most of his first-choice players for their last group game , it was the russians who looked the fresher .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : van nistelrooy gave the dutch the equalizer " we had some physical problems .

" regarding that and regarding the end of the game after 90 minutes , going into extra-time , what they did was a tremendous , unbelievable achievement , " he said . " i think the team was superior technically , in the control and passing , but also tactically , and also the physical part superior to the dutch game .
we were better in our opponents in all components of the game , " he said . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : pavlyuchenko scored the opening goal many commentators questioned hiddink 's decision to take arshavin to the tournament despite the suspension , but have been silenced by superlative displays from the zenit youngster against sweden and now the netherlands . russia were more artful , sophisticated and thoughtful than the bewildered dutch all night - and should have won without needing extra time .
van basten , van der sar leave the stage dutch coach marco van basten praised the russian performance and said they deserved their victory .
he now leaves the national side to take on an appointment with ajax . it was also an international farewell for dutch veteran keeper edwin van der sar .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : it was edwin van der sar 's last match " that 's part of football , " van basten said .
" i feel very sorry for edwin van der sar because i really wanted to give him a nice final in the national team .
he is such a great goalkeeper and he deserves winning a tournament like this .
we tried and did n't succeed . " " we did n't start well and did n't play football like we did in the first three matches .
i do n't know why .
they were a little bit nervous perhaps . " dutch veteran ruud van nistelrooy took the battle beautifully into extra-time with a headed equalizer four minutes from the end of normal time .
russians clearly fresher but the russians were not to be denied their fully deserved win , which sets them up for a semi-final clash on thursday against italy or spain . the three quarter-finals played so far have all been won by teams who finished second in their first-round group , despite having less time to prepare for the quarters than the first- placed teams . " normally you are handicapped when the other side scores such a late goal , but we were dominant .
we were physically and tactically dominant , " hiddink said . although van basten had the luxury of resting most of his first-choice players for their last group game , it was the russians who looked the fresher .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : van nistelrooy gave the dutch the equalizer " we had some physical problems .
my players simply had no more strength .
that is a pity , but the russians deserved the victory , they were clearly the better side . "
two goals in extra-time russia were far superior in the first half - with their excellent movement and precise passing - and should have taken the lead . their dominance continued after the interval .
pavlyuchenko 's volley took them ahead in the 56th minute , on a centre from the left from sergei semak . # bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : torbinski scored his side 's second goal russia then missed good chances to put the dutch out of their misery , and paid the price when van nistelrooy made it 1-1 by heading in a wesley sneijder free-kick in the 86th minute . in second half injury time russian denis kolodin was shown a second yellow card after fouling sneijder , but referee lubos michel was told by his assistant that the ball had already crossed the line , and the referee then withdrew the booking allowing kolodin to stay on the field . a dutch revival seemed on the cards .
instead , van basten 's team looked exhausted and russia took advantage to create several good chances on the break . eight minutes from the end of extra-time , with penalties looming , the magnificent arshavin centered for torbinksy to tap in from close range . arshavin then rounded off a remarkable performance by making it 3-1 with a cheeky shot that went through van der sar 's legs . dpa news agency -lrb- ncy -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

" where people have to fear for their lives because they vote for the opposition then democracy is a farce , " the minister said . " i appeal to those in power in zimbabwe to stop using violence and intimidation as a political instrument and create conditions in which human rights are respected and economic progress is possible , " he added . germany 's development minister was more critical , accusing africa of reacting " too late and too indecisively " to events in zimbabwe .
heidemarie wieczorek-zeul said on monday it is time for the world to " answer zimbabwe 's cry for help " after opposition leader morgan tsvangirai pulled out of the country 's violence-wracked presidential runoff sunday .
she said in a statement monday that the southern african development community and the african union " have dealt too late and too indecisively with the escalating situation . "
mounting violence earlier sunday , tsvangirai pulled out of zimbabwe 's election run-off , saying violence had made a fair vote impossible , in a move that virtually hands victory to president robert mugabe . tsvangirai 's movement for democratic change -lrb- mdc -rrb- says at least 70 of its supporters have been killed in recent weeks and 25,000 forced from their homes in a state-sponsored campaign of violence .
one of its top leaders , tendai biti , has also been charged with treason and subversion .
the charges carry a possible death sentence . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : mugabe is accused of orchestrating violent attacks against opposition supporters tsvangirai made his announcement after hundreds of stick-wielding youths gathered at the venue of his party 's main pre-election rally , and following a meeting of his movement for democratic change to decide whether to withdraw from the election . up to 1,000 youths gathered at the rally grounds in the capital harare before moving on to the nearby headquarters of the ruling zanu-pf party , witnesses and afp journalists said . police officers and election observers had taken up positions nearby . tsvangirai beat mugabe in the march first round of the vote - and the ruling party lost its parliamentary majority for the first time since independence . but official results showed the mdc leader failed to achieve an outright majority of votes needed to become head of state without a run-off . eu calls vote a parody " the eu 's chief diplomat , javier solana , has expressed sympathy for the decision of zimbabwe 's opposition not to take part in the second round of the country 's presidential elections , calling the vote a " parody . " the " systematic campaign of violence , interference and intimidation by the zimbabwean authorities " made clear the reasoning behind the opposition move , solana said in a statement from brussels . " under these conditions , the elections would have been a parody of democracy that is unworthy of today 's africa , " he added . solana also praised the african union and the southern african development community -lrb- sadc -rrb- for " having attempted to bring zimbabwe to reason . " us , britain to raise concerns with un zimbabwe 's violent electoral crisis has sparked international condemnation with both london and washington saying they were prepared to raise their concerns in the united nations security council on monday .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : protests against mugabe outside the zimbabwean embassy in london british foreign secretary david miliband said zimbabwe would lack " legitimate " leadership if mugabe stayed in charge , and accused him of using violence to cling to power .
" a government which violates the constitution in zimbabwe can not be held as the legitimate representative of the zimbabwean people , " miliband said , referring to mugabe 's slowness to hold a run-off after the march 29 election .
miliband described the violence as " state-sponsored on a very large scale with one very clear motivation " - to keep mugabe in power . "
white house spokesman carlton carroll urged zimbabwe to halt violence following reports that mugabe loyalists had beaten , burned and killed opposition supporters .
" the government of zimbabwe and its thugs must stop the violence now , " carroll said in a statement .
" the mugabe regime reinforces its illegitimacy every day .
the senseless acts of violence against the opposition as well as election monitors must stop . " dw staff -lrb- sp -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

" where people have to fear for their lives because they vote for the opposition then democracy is a farce , " the minister said . " i appeal to those in power in zimbabwe to stop using violence and intimidation as a political instrument and create conditions in which human rights are respected and economic progress is possible , " he added . germany 's development minister was more critical , accusing africa of reacting " too late and too indecisively " to events in zimbabwe .
heidemarie wieczorek-zeul said on monday it is time for the world to " answer zimbabwe 's cry for help " after opposition leader morgan tsvangirai pulled out of the country 's violence-wracked presidential runoff sunday .
she said in a statement monday that the southern african development community and the african union " have dealt too late and too indecisively with the escalating situation . "
mounting violence earlier sunday , tsvangirai pulled out of zimbabwe 's election run-off , saying violence had made a fair vote impossible , in a move that virtually hands victory to president robert mugabe . tsvangirai 's movement for democratic change -lrb- mdc -rrb- says at least 70 of its supporters have been killed in recent weeks and 25,000 forced from their homes in a state-sponsored campaign of violence .

" the " systematic campaign of violence , interference and intimidation by the zimbabwean authorities " made clear the reasoning behind the opposition move , solana said in a statement from brussels . " under these conditions , the elections would have been a parody of democracy that is unworthy of today 's africa , " he added . solana also praised the african union and the southern african development community -lrb- sadc -rrb- for " having attempted to bring zimbabwe to reason . " us , britain to raise concerns with un zimbabwe 's violent electoral crisis has sparked international condemnation with both london and washington saying they were prepared to raise their concerns in the united nations security council on monday .

miliband described the violence as " state-sponsored on a very large scale with one very clear motivation " - to keep mugabe in power . "
white house spokesman carlton carroll urged zimbabwe to halt violence following reports that mugabe loyalists had beaten , burned and killed opposition supporters .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de travel -pipe- 22.06.2008 european groups work to promote ethical travel großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : some in the travel industry want to increase ethical standards in the tourism sector the " fair trade " label is appearing on many goods nowadays - from coffee and chocolate to apples and apparel .
but would a " fair trade " label influence people shopping for a vacation ? the " fair trade " seal of approval takes the guesswork out of finding groceries and clothing that meet high ethical standards .
despite the label 's popularity , the concept has yet to catch on in the tourism industry , as vacationers find it difficult to say which tour companies and hotels adhere to fair trade principles . still , some say the time is ripe for a wider analysis of fair trade in the tourism industry .
travelers worried about the ecological and sociological impact of their spending habits have fueled a trend toward responsible tourism . " people do not want to have a guilty conscience when they travel , " said rainer hartmann , a professor at bremen college .
he says there is a demand for fair trade travel , a trend that heinz fuchs of tourism watch , part of the bonn-based church development service , has also noticed . " transfair products increased by 30 percent in 2007 , " says fuchs .
" this idea is pretty widespread in other countries , but it 's just catching on here . " working group establishing criteria bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the group wants to concentrate on mainstream tourism indeed , " fair trade " labels are not entirely new in the travel industry .
south africa 's tourist organizations already use them and some european organizations are considering similar ideas . an international working group has been trying to lay down criteria for a seal here that would look at factors such as fair pay for workers . " there have to be set working hours , ” said fuchs .
" employees should have health and accident insurance , as well as unemployment insurance . " there 's also widespread agreement that tour operators and companies should not get the seal .
it should instead be awarded to products such as individual tours . the group has likewise agreed that the label should not focus on niche markets for do-gooders . " it should instead focus on mainstream tourism , " says fuchs . certification would raise consciousness , transparency bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : as with organic apples , a fair trade seal might make ethical selection easier hartmann said he sees the merit of such proposals .
" consciousness in this area has grown , just like the evolution of organic food products , which are now on sale at every discount store . " and just like organic apples , a seal of approval for fair trade travel would be useful , he adds .
not only would it have the bonus of providing a standard set of criteria , it would also add transparency .
" it would make it easier to convey that ' this trip is ok , " ' he said . still , not everyone is convinced a seal is the best idea . " certification is not cheap .
it costs several thousand euros , " said rolf pfeifer , chief executive officer of forum anders reisen , a group of travel operators dedicated to environmentally sound tourism . " a lot of hotels wo n't be able to afford it .
nor will a lot of small operators . " pfeifer 's company recently completed a report on corporate social responsibility -lrb- csr -rrb- in tourism .
the report is meant to serve as the basis for sustainability reports for other organizers to show how they comply . a recent decision by the forum requires all members to get csr certification by the end of 2010 .
the certification would cover many of the same values covered by any fair trade seal . dw staff -lrb- cat -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

but would a " fair trade " label influence people shopping for a vacation ? the " fair trade " seal of approval takes the guesswork out of finding groceries and clothing that meet high ethical standards .
despite the label 's popularity , the concept has yet to catch on in the tourism industry , as vacationers find it difficult to say which tour companies and hotels adhere to fair trade principles . still , some say the time is ripe for a wider analysis of fair trade in the tourism industry .
travelers worried about the ecological and sociological impact of their spending habits have fueled a trend toward responsible tourism . " people do not want to have a guilty conscience when they travel , " said rainer hartmann , a professor at bremen college .
he says there is a demand for fair trade travel , a trend that heinz fuchs of tourism watch , part of the bonn-based church development service , has also noticed . " transfair products increased by 30 percent in 2007 , " says fuchs .
" this idea is pretty widespread in other countries , but it 's just catching on here .

" there have to be set working hours , ” said fuchs .
" employees should have health and accident insurance , as well as unemployment insurance . " there 's also widespread agreement that tour operators and companies should not get the seal .
it should instead be awarded to products such as individual tours . the group has likewise agreed that the label should not focus on niche markets for do-gooders .

" consciousness in this area has grown , just like the evolution of organic food products , which are now on sale at every discount store . " and just like organic apples , a seal of approval for fair trade travel would be useful , he adds .
not only would it have the bonus of providing a standard set of criteria , it would also add transparency .
" it would make it easier to convey that ' this trip is ok , " ' he said . still , not everyone is convinced a seal is the best idea . " certification is not cheap .

experts believe the site at al-kibar was used to produce nuclear material the iranian regime needed to make a bomb , the magazine reported . north korean scientists worked alongside syrians and iranians at the site , where a reactor was being built to produce weapons-grade plutonium , der spiegel quoted the intelligence reports as saying . the report said iranian scientists had made progress in enriching uranium but had no experience with plutonium and sought the help of the north koreans . watchdog group to go to syria inspectors from the international atomic energy agency , the united nations nuclear watchdog , are due to travel to syria on sunday to investigate whether the country was building an undeclared reactor . documents and photographs that were sent by washington in april to the iaea backed up the suspicions , but syria has described the allegations as " ridiculous . " damascus maintains that the site , which satellite images show has since been razed , was a military installation and not a nuclear facility . bildunterschrift : satellite imagery showing a suspected nuclear facility before and after being destroyed by an israeli airstrike iran says its nuclear program is not geared towards making weapons but for electricity generation to meet the needs of its growing population .
tehran 's decision to begin enriching uranium in 2006 triggered western sanctions . iran on saturday stressed it will not negotiate with world powers over its nuclear program if it is required to suspend its uranium enrichment activities . der spiegel , which did not elaborate on al-assad 's reported change of heart , also said iran , syria and north korea had apparently been cooperating in the production of chemical weapons . it cited an explosion near the syrian city of aleppo in july 2007 , during which many were reported to have died when quantities of mustard gas and the nerve agent sarin escaped . in addition to 15 syrian military officials , dozens of iranian " rocket scientists " and three north koreans were among those killed , the magazine said . ' ball of fire ' the iaea chief warned on saturday that an attack on iran over its nuclear program would turn the region into a fireball . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : mohamed elbaradei mohamed elbaradei also warned that he would not be able to continue in his role as iaea director general if the islamic republic were attacked . his stark comments came as iran stressed yet again that it will not negotiate with world powers over its nuclear program if it is required to suspend uranium enrichment . " a military strike -lsb- against iran -rsb- would in my opinion be worse than anything else ...
it would transform the middle east region into a ball of fire , " elbaradei said in an interview with al-arabiya television . a report by the new york times on friday cited us officials as saying a major israeli military exercise earlier this month seemed to be a practice for any potential strike against iran 's nuclear facilities . dw staff -lrb- jam -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

both men have spent long periods of the past season on the substitutes ' bench , lehmann at england 's arsenal and recber at fenerbahce . the 38-year-old lehmann has risen to the occasion when it mattered , playing solidly in germany 's 1-0 win over austria and also in thursday 's 3-2 quarter-final success against portugal . " the bigger the pressure the better jens becomes .
the last games showed that , " said germany goalkeeping coach andreas koepke . " i did n't see jens as critically as others .
we have seen other goalkeepers make errors here .
jens was very strong against austria .
he played a very , very good match against portugal .
he is playing the way we expected him to do and is also a team leader . " lehmann has seemingly calmed down as the tournament progressed .
he met the german media in a very aggressive mood at the start of euro after criticism of his showings in tune-up games .
in contrast , he was very relaxed earlier this week .
experience is n't everything bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : referee peter frojdfeldt sends demirel off the field while lehmann only became germany no. 1 ahead of the 2006 world cup , rustu 's biggest moment was the third-place finish with turkey at the 2002 world cup .
he is now only in goal owing to volkan 's red-card suspension and put in a mixed performance in the quarter-finals against croatia , when he won his 117th cap . rustu looked like he might be the villain of the piece when his blunder allowed ivan klasnic give croatia the lead in the 119th minute , but turkey levelled through semih senturk .
rustu ended up as the hero in the penalty shoot-out when his save from mladen petric clinched the upset in vienna . " rustu is very experienced but not always good , " said germany defender arne friedrich of the 35-year-old . rustu has said he will retire from the national team after euro .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : rene adler is waiting for his chance many in germany expect lehmann to do the same and give way to a younger man .
new blood in training currently , 30-year-old robert enke from hanover and bayer leverkusen 's rene adler , 23 , are in the frame to continue germany 's tradition of great goalkeepers . koepke readily admitted that the future was at stake and enke and adler were training hard in the euro 2008 camp in case lehmann gets injured . " both are doing a really good job .
no one knows what happens after euro .
this is about positioning as well for after euro - and to be fully fit if something happens to jens , " said koepke . dpa news agency -lrb- ncy -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

both men have spent long periods of the past season on the substitutes ' bench , lehmann at england 's arsenal and recber at fenerbahce . the 38-year-old lehmann has risen to the occasion when it mattered , playing solidly in germany 's 1-0 win over austria and also in thursday 's 3-2 quarter-final success against portugal . " the bigger the pressure the better jens becomes .
the last games showed that , " said germany goalkeeping coach andreas koepke . " i did n't see jens as critically as others .
we have seen other goalkeepers make errors here .
jens was very strong against austria .
he played a very , very good match against portugal .
he is playing the way we expected him to do and is also a team leader . " lehmann has seemingly calmed down as the tournament progressed .
he met the german media in a very aggressive mood at the start of euro after criticism of his showings in tune-up games .
in contrast , he was very relaxed earlier this week .
experience is n't everything bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : referee peter frojdfeldt sends demirel off the field while lehmann only became germany no. 1 ahead of the 2006 world cup , rustu 's biggest moment was the third-place finish with turkey at the 2002 world cup .
he is now only in goal owing to volkan 's red-card suspension and put in a mixed performance in the quarter-finals against croatia , when he won his 117th cap . rustu looked like he might be the villain of the piece when his blunder allowed ivan klasnic give croatia the lead in the 119th minute , but turkey levelled through semih senturk .
rustu ended up as the hero in the penalty shoot-out when his save from mladen petric clinched the upset in vienna . " rustu is very experienced but not always good , " said germany defender arne friedrich of the 35-year-old . rustu has said he will retire from the national team after euro .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : rene adler is waiting for his chance many in germany expect lehmann to do the same and give way to a younger man .
new blood in training currently , 30-year-old robert enke from hanover and bayer leverkusen 's rene adler , 23 , are in the frame to continue germany 's tradition of great goalkeepers . koepke readily admitted that the future was at stake and enke and adler were training hard in the euro 2008 camp in case lehmann gets injured . " both are doing a really good job .
no one knows what happens after euro .
this is about positioning as well for after euro - and to be fully fit if something happens to jens , " said koepke . dpa news agency -lrb- ncy -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

experts believe the site at al-kibar was used to produce nuclear material the iranian regime needed to make a bomb , the magazine reported . north korean scientists worked alongside syrians and iranians at the site , where a reactor was being built to produce weapons-grade plutonium , der spiegel quoted the intelligence reports as saying . the report said iranian scientists had made progress in enriching uranium but had no experience with plutonium and sought the help of the north koreans . watchdog group to go to syria inspectors from the international atomic energy agency , the united nations nuclear watchdog , are due to travel to syria on sunday to investigate whether the country was building an undeclared reactor . documents and photographs that were sent by washington in april to the iaea backed up the suspicions , but syria has described the allegations as " ridiculous . " damascus maintains that the site , which satellite images show has since been razed , was a military installation and not a nuclear facility . bildunterschrift : satellite imagery showing a suspected nuclear facility before and after being destroyed by an israeli airstrike iran says its nuclear program is not geared towards making weapons but for electricity generation to meet the needs of its growing population .
tehran 's decision to begin enriching uranium in 2006 triggered western sanctions . iran on saturday stressed it will not negotiate with world powers over its nuclear program if it is required to suspend its uranium enrichment activities . der spiegel , which did not elaborate on al-assad 's reported change of heart , also said iran , syria and north korea had apparently been cooperating in the production of chemical weapons . it cited an explosion near the syrian city of aleppo in july 2007 , during which many were reported to have died when quantities of mustard gas and the nerve agent sarin escaped . in addition to 15 syrian military officials , dozens of iranian " rocket scientists " and three north koreans were among those killed , the magazine said . ' ball of fire ' the iaea chief warned on saturday that an attack on iran over its nuclear program would turn the region into a fireball . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : mohamed elbaradei mohamed elbaradei also warned that he would not be able to continue in his role as iaea director general if the islamic republic were attacked . his stark comments came as iran stressed yet again that it will not negotiate with world powers over its nuclear program if it is required to suspend uranium enrichment . " a military strike -lsb- against iran -rsb- would in my opinion be worse than anything else ...
it would transform the middle east region into a ball of fire , " elbaradei said in an interview with al-arabiya television . a report by the new york times on friday cited us officials as saying a major israeli military exercise earlier this month seemed to be a practice for any potential strike against iran 's nuclear facilities . dw staff -lrb- jam -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

" i appeal to those in power in zimbabwe to stop using violence and intimidation as a political instrument and create conditions in which human rights are respected and economic progress is possible , " he added . germany 's development minister was more critical , accusing africa of reacting " too late and too indecisively " to events in zimbabwe .
heidemarie wieczorek-zeul said on monday it is time for the world to " answer zimbabwe 's cry for help " after opposition leader morgan tsvangirai pulled out of the country 's violence-wracked presidential runoff sunday .
she said in a statement monday that the southern african development community and the african union " have dealt too late and too indecisively with the escalating situation . "
mounting violence earlier sunday , tsvangirai pulled out of zimbabwe 's election run-off , saying violence had made a fair vote impossible , in a move that virtually hands victory to president robert mugabe . tsvangirai 's movement for democratic change -lrb- mdc -rrb- says at least 70 of its supporters have been killed in recent weeks and 25,000 forced from their homes in a state-sponsored campaign of violence .

" the " systematic campaign of violence , interference and intimidation by the zimbabwean authorities " made clear the reasoning behind the opposition move , solana said in a statement from brussels . " under these conditions , the elections would have been a parody of democracy that is unworthy of today 's africa , " he added . solana also praised the african union and the southern african development community -lrb- sadc -rrb- for " having attempted to bring zimbabwe to reason .

but would a " fair trade " label influence people shopping for a vacation ? the " fair trade " seal of approval takes the guesswork out of finding groceries and clothing that meet high ethical standards .
despite the label 's popularity , the concept has yet to catch on in the tourism industry , as vacationers find it difficult to say which tour companies and hotels adhere to fair trade principles . still , some say the time is ripe for a wider analysis of fair trade in the tourism industry .
travelers worried about the ecological and sociological impact of their spending habits have fueled a trend toward responsible tourism . " people do not want to have a guilty conscience when they travel , " said rainer hartmann , a professor at bremen college .
he says there is a demand for fair trade travel , a trend that heinz fuchs of tourism watch , part of the bonn-based church development service , has also noticed . " transfair products increased by 30 percent in 2007 , " says fuchs .

" consciousness in this area has grown , just like the evolution of organic food products , which are now on sale at every discount store . " and just like organic apples , a seal of approval for fair trade travel would be useful , he adds .
not only would it have the bonus of providing a standard set of criteria , it would also add transparency .
" it would make it easier to convey that ' this trip is ok , " ' he said . still , not everyone is convinced a seal is the best idea . " certification is not cheap .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de travel -pipe- 22.06.2008 european groups work to promote ethical travel großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : some in the travel industry want to increase ethical standards in the tourism sector the " fair trade " label is appearing on many goods nowadays - from coffee and chocolate to apples and apparel .
but would a " fair trade " label influence people shopping for a vacation ? the " fair trade " seal of approval takes the guesswork out of finding groceries and clothing that meet high ethical standards .
despite the label 's popularity , the concept has yet to catch on in the tourism industry , as vacationers find it difficult to say which tour companies and hotels adhere to fair trade principles . still , some say the time is ripe for a wider analysis of fair trade in the tourism industry .
travelers worried about the ecological and sociological impact of their spending habits have fueled a trend toward responsible tourism . " people do not want to have a guilty conscience when they travel , " said rainer hartmann , a professor at bremen college .
he says there is a demand for fair trade travel , a trend that heinz fuchs of tourism watch , part of the bonn-based church development service , has also noticed . " transfair products increased by 30 percent in 2007 , " says fuchs .
" this idea is pretty widespread in other countries , but it 's just catching on here . " working group establishing criteria bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the group wants to concentrate on mainstream tourism indeed , " fair trade " labels are not entirely new in the travel industry .
south africa 's tourist organizations already use them and some european organizations are considering similar ideas . an international working group has been trying to lay down criteria for a seal here that would look at factors such as fair pay for workers . " there have to be set working hours , ” said fuchs .
" employees should have health and accident insurance , as well as unemployment insurance . " there 's also widespread agreement that tour operators and companies should not get the seal .
it should instead be awarded to products such as individual tours . the group has likewise agreed that the label should not focus on niche markets for do-gooders . " it should instead focus on mainstream tourism , " says fuchs . certification would raise consciousness , transparency bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : as with organic apples , a fair trade seal might make ethical selection easier hartmann said he sees the merit of such proposals .
" consciousness in this area has grown , just like the evolution of organic food products , which are now on sale at every discount store . " and just like organic apples , a seal of approval for fair trade travel would be useful , he adds .
not only would it have the bonus of providing a standard set of criteria , it would also add transparency .
" it would make it easier to convey that ' this trip is ok , " ' he said . still , not everyone is convinced a seal is the best idea . " certification is not cheap .
it costs several thousand euros , " said rolf pfeifer , chief executive officer of forum anders reisen , a group of travel operators dedicated to environmentally sound tourism . " a lot of hotels wo n't be able to afford it .

the report is meant to serve as the basis for sustainability reports for other organizers to show how they comply . a recent decision by the forum requires all members to get csr certification by the end of 2010 .

" where people have to fear for their lives because they vote for the opposition then democracy is a farce , " the minister said . " i appeal to those in power in zimbabwe to stop using violence and intimidation as a political instrument and create conditions in which human rights are respected and economic progress is possible , " he added . germany 's development minister was more critical , accusing africa of reacting " too late and too indecisively " to events in zimbabwe .
heidemarie wieczorek-zeul said on monday it is time for the world to " answer zimbabwe 's cry for help " after opposition leader morgan tsvangirai pulled out of the country 's violence-wracked presidential runoff sunday .
she said in a statement monday that the southern african development community and the african union " have dealt too late and too indecisively with the escalating situation . "
mounting violence earlier sunday , tsvangirai pulled out of zimbabwe 's election run-off , saying violence had made a fair vote impossible , in a move that virtually hands victory to president robert mugabe . tsvangirai 's movement for democratic change -lrb- mdc -rrb- says at least 70 of its supporters have been killed in recent weeks and 25,000 forced from their homes in a state-sponsored campaign of violence .
one of its top leaders , tendai biti , has also been charged with treason and subversion .
the charges carry a possible death sentence . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : mugabe is accused of orchestrating violent attacks against opposition supporters tsvangirai made his announcement after hundreds of stick-wielding youths gathered at the venue of his party 's main pre-election rally , and following a meeting of his movement for democratic change to decide whether to withdraw from the election . up to 1,000 youths gathered at the rally grounds in the capital harare before moving on to the nearby headquarters of the ruling zanu-pf party , witnesses and afp journalists said . police officers and election observers had taken up positions nearby . tsvangirai beat mugabe in the march first round of the vote - and the ruling party lost its parliamentary majority for the first time since independence . but official results showed the mdc leader failed to achieve an outright majority of votes needed to become head of state without a run-off . eu calls vote a parody " the eu 's chief diplomat , javier solana , has expressed sympathy for the decision of zimbabwe 's opposition not to take part in the second round of the country 's presidential elections , calling the vote a " parody . " the " systematic campaign of violence , interference and intimidation by the zimbabwean authorities " made clear the reasoning behind the opposition move , solana said in a statement from brussels . " under these conditions , the elections would have been a parody of democracy that is unworthy of today 's africa , " he added . solana also praised the african union and the southern african development community -lrb- sadc -rrb- for " having attempted to bring zimbabwe to reason . " us , britain to raise concerns with un zimbabwe 's violent electoral crisis has sparked international condemnation with both london and washington saying they were prepared to raise their concerns in the united nations security council on monday .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : protests against mugabe outside the zimbabwean embassy in london british foreign secretary david miliband said zimbabwe would lack " legitimate " leadership if mugabe stayed in charge , and accused him of using violence to cling to power .
" a government which violates the constitution in zimbabwe can not be held as the legitimate representative of the zimbabwean people , " miliband said , referring to mugabe 's slowness to hold a run-off after the march 29 election .
miliband described the violence as " state-sponsored on a very large scale with one very clear motivation " - to keep mugabe in power . "
white house spokesman carlton carroll urged zimbabwe to halt violence following reports that mugabe loyalists had beaten , burned and killed opposition supporters .
" the government of zimbabwe and its thugs must stop the violence now , " carroll said in a statement .
" the mugabe regime reinforces its illegitimacy every day .

" regarding that and regarding the end of the game after 90 minutes , going into extra-time , what they did was a tremendous , unbelievable achievement , " he said . " i think the team was superior technically , in the control and passing , but also tactically , and also the physical part superior to the dutch game .
we were better in our opponents in all components of the game , " he said . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : pavlyuchenko scored the opening goal many commentators questioned hiddink 's decision to take arshavin to the tournament despite the suspension , but have been silenced by superlative displays from the zenit youngster against sweden and now the netherlands . russia were more artful , sophisticated and thoughtful than the bewildered dutch all night - and should have won without needing extra time .
van basten , van der sar leave the stage dutch coach marco van basten praised the russian performance and said they deserved their victory .
he now leaves the national side to take on an appointment with ajax . it was also an international farewell for dutch veteran keeper edwin van der sar .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : it was edwin van der sar 's last match " that 's part of football , " van basten said .
" i feel very sorry for edwin van der sar because i really wanted to give him a nice final in the national team .
he is such a great goalkeeper and he deserves winning a tournament like this .
we tried and did n't succeed . " " we did n't start well and did n't play football like we did in the first three matches .
i do n't know why .
they were a little bit nervous perhaps . " dutch veteran ruud van nistelrooy took the battle beautifully into extra-time with a headed equalizer four minutes from the end of normal time .
russians clearly fresher but the russians were not to be denied their fully deserved win , which sets them up for a semi-final clash on thursday against italy or spain . the three quarter-finals played so far have all been won by teams who finished second in their first-round group , despite having less time to prepare for the quarters than the first- placed teams . " normally you are handicapped when the other side scores such a late goal , but we were dominant .
we were physically and tactically dominant , " hiddink said . although van basten had the luxury of resting most of his first-choice players for their last group game , it was the russians who looked the fresher .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : van nistelrooy gave the dutch the equalizer " we had some physical problems .
my players simply had no more strength .
that is a pity , but the russians deserved the victory , they were clearly the better side . "
two goals in extra-time russia were far superior in the first half - with their excellent movement and precise passing - and should have taken the lead . their dominance continued after the interval .
pavlyuchenko 's volley took them ahead in the 56th minute , on a centre from the left from sergei semak . # bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : torbinski scored his side 's second goal russia then missed good chances to put the dutch out of their misery , and paid the price when van nistelrooy made it 1-1 by heading in a wesley sneijder free-kick in the 86th minute . in second half injury time russian denis kolodin was shown a second yellow card after fouling sneijder , but referee lubos michel was told by his assistant that the ball had already crossed the line , and the referee then withdrew the booking allowing kolodin to stay on the field . a dutch revival seemed on the cards .
instead , van basten 's team looked exhausted and russia took advantage to create several good chances on the break . eight minutes from the end of extra-time , with penalties looming , the magnificent arshavin centered for torbinksy to tap in from close range . arshavin then rounded off a remarkable performance by making it 3-1 with a cheeky shot that went through van der sar 's legs . dpa news agency -lrb- ncy -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

" regarding that and regarding the end of the game after 90 minutes , going into extra-time , what they did was a tremendous , unbelievable achievement , " he said . " i think the team was superior technically , in the control and passing , but also tactically , and also the physical part superior to the dutch game .
we were better in our opponents in all components of the game , " he said . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : pavlyuchenko scored the opening goal many commentators questioned hiddink 's decision to take arshavin to the tournament despite the suspension , but have been silenced by superlative displays from the zenit youngster against sweden and now the netherlands . russia were more artful , sophisticated and thoughtful than the bewildered dutch all night - and should have won without needing extra time .
van basten , van der sar leave the stage dutch coach marco van basten praised the russian performance and said they deserved their victory .
he now leaves the national side to take on an appointment with ajax . it was also an international farewell for dutch veteran keeper edwin van der sar .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : it was edwin van der sar 's last match " that 's part of football , " van basten said .
" i feel very sorry for edwin van der sar because i really wanted to give him a nice final in the national team .
he is such a great goalkeeper and he deserves winning a tournament like this .
we tried and did n't succeed . " " we did n't start well and did n't play football like we did in the first three matches .
i do n't know why .
they were a little bit nervous perhaps . " dutch veteran ruud van nistelrooy took the battle beautifully into extra-time with a headed equalizer four minutes from the end of normal time .
russians clearly fresher but the russians were not to be denied their fully deserved win , which sets them up for a semi-final clash on thursday against italy or spain . the three quarter-finals played so far have all been won by teams who finished second in their first-round group , despite having less time to prepare for the quarters than the first- placed teams . " normally you are handicapped when the other side scores such a late goal , but we were dominant .
we were physically and tactically dominant , " hiddink said . although van basten had the luxury of resting most of his first-choice players for their last group game , it was the russians who looked the fresher .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : van nistelrooy gave the dutch the equalizer " we had some physical problems .
my players simply had no more strength .
that is a pity , but the russians deserved the victory , they were clearly the better side . "
two goals in extra-time russia were far superior in the first half - with their excellent movement and precise passing - and should have taken the lead . their dominance continued after the interval .
pavlyuchenko 's volley took them ahead in the 56th minute , on a centre from the left from sergei semak . # bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : torbinski scored his side 's second goal russia then missed good chances to put the dutch out of their misery , and paid the price when van nistelrooy made it 1-1 by heading in a wesley sneijder free-kick in the 86th minute . in second half injury time russian denis kolodin was shown a second yellow card after fouling sneijder , but referee lubos michel was told by his assistant that the ball had already crossed the line , and the referee then withdrew the booking allowing kolodin to stay on the field . a dutch revival seemed on the cards .
instead , van basten 's team looked exhausted and russia took advantage to create several good chances on the break . eight minutes from the end of extra-time , with penalties looming , the magnificent arshavin centered for torbinksy to tap in from close range . arshavin then rounded off a remarkable performance by making it 3-1 with a cheeky shot that went through van der sar 's legs . dpa news agency -lrb- ncy -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

both men have spent long periods of the past season on the substitutes ' bench , lehmann at england 's arsenal and recber at fenerbahce . the 38-year-old lehmann has risen to the occasion when it mattered , playing solidly in germany 's 1-0 win over austria and also in thursday 's 3-2 quarter-final success against portugal . " the bigger the pressure the better jens becomes .
the last games showed that , " said germany goalkeeping coach andreas koepke . " i did n't see jens as critically as others .
we have seen other goalkeepers make errors here .
jens was very strong against austria .
he played a very , very good match against portugal .
he is playing the way we expected him to do and is also a team leader . " lehmann has seemingly calmed down as the tournament progressed .
he met the german media in a very aggressive mood at the start of euro after criticism of his showings in tune-up games .
in contrast , he was very relaxed earlier this week .

he is now only in goal owing to volkan 's red-card suspension and put in a mixed performance in the quarter-finals against croatia , when he won his 117th cap . rustu looked like he might be the villain of the piece when his blunder allowed ivan klasnic give croatia the lead in the 119th minute , but turkey levelled through semih senturk .
rustu ended up as the hero in the penalty shoot-out when his save from mladen petric clinched the upset in vienna . " rustu is very experienced but not always good , " said germany defender arne friedrich of the 35-year-old . rustu has said he will retire from the national team after euro .

new blood in training currently , 30-year-old robert enke from hanover and bayer leverkusen 's rene adler , 23 , are in the frame to continue germany 's tradition of great goalkeepers . koepke readily admitted that the future was at stake and enke and adler were training hard in the euro 2008 camp in case lehmann gets injured .

" where people have to fear for their lives because they vote for the opposition then democracy is a farce , " the minister said . " i appeal to those in power in zimbabwe to stop using violence and intimidation as a political instrument and create conditions in which human rights are respected and economic progress is possible , " he added . germany 's development minister was more critical , accusing africa of reacting " too late and too indecisively " to events in zimbabwe .
heidemarie wieczorek-zeul said on monday it is time for the world to " answer zimbabwe 's cry for help " after opposition leader morgan tsvangirai pulled out of the country 's violence-wracked presidential runoff sunday .
she said in a statement monday that the southern african development community and the african union " have dealt too late and too indecisively with the escalating situation . "
mounting violence earlier sunday , tsvangirai pulled out of zimbabwe 's election run-off , saying violence had made a fair vote impossible , in a move that virtually hands victory to president robert mugabe . tsvangirai 's movement for democratic change -lrb- mdc -rrb- says at least 70 of its supporters have been killed in recent weeks and 25,000 forced from their homes in a state-sponsored campaign of violence .
one of its top leaders , tendai biti , has also been charged with treason and subversion .
the charges carry a possible death sentence . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : mugabe is accused of orchestrating violent attacks against opposition supporters tsvangirai made his announcement after hundreds of stick-wielding youths gathered at the venue of his party 's main pre-election rally , and following a meeting of his movement for democratic change to decide whether to withdraw from the election . up to 1,000 youths gathered at the rally grounds in the capital harare before moving on to the nearby headquarters of the ruling zanu-pf party , witnesses and afp journalists said . police officers and election observers had taken up positions nearby . tsvangirai beat mugabe in the march first round of the vote - and the ruling party lost its parliamentary majority for the first time since independence . but official results showed the mdc leader failed to achieve an outright majority of votes needed to become head of state without a run-off . eu calls vote a parody " the eu 's chief diplomat , javier solana , has expressed sympathy for the decision of zimbabwe 's opposition not to take part in the second round of the country 's presidential elections , calling the vote a " parody . " the " systematic campaign of violence , interference and intimidation by the zimbabwean authorities " made clear the reasoning behind the opposition move , solana said in a statement from brussels . " under these conditions , the elections would have been a parody of democracy that is unworthy of today 's africa , " he added . solana also praised the african union and the southern african development community -lrb- sadc -rrb- for " having attempted to bring zimbabwe to reason . " us , britain to raise concerns with un zimbabwe 's violent electoral crisis has sparked international condemnation with both london and washington saying they were prepared to raise their concerns in the united nations security council on monday .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : protests against mugabe outside the zimbabwean embassy in london british foreign secretary david miliband said zimbabwe would lack " legitimate " leadership if mugabe stayed in charge , and accused him of using violence to cling to power .
" a government which violates the constitution in zimbabwe can not be held as the legitimate representative of the zimbabwean people , " miliband said , referring to mugabe 's slowness to hold a run-off after the march 29 election .
miliband described the violence as " state-sponsored on a very large scale with one very clear motivation " - to keep mugabe in power . "
white house spokesman carlton carroll urged zimbabwe to halt violence following reports that mugabe loyalists had beaten , burned and killed opposition supporters .

" where people have to fear for their lives because they vote for the opposition then democracy is a farce , " the minister said . " i appeal to those in power in zimbabwe to stop using violence and intimidation as a political instrument and create conditions in which human rights are respected and economic progress is possible , " he added . germany 's development minister was more critical , accusing africa of reacting " too late and too indecisively " to events in zimbabwe .
heidemarie wieczorek-zeul said on monday it is time for the world to " answer zimbabwe 's cry for help " after opposition leader morgan tsvangirai pulled out of the country 's violence-wracked presidential runoff sunday .
she said in a statement monday that the southern african development community and the african union " have dealt too late and too indecisively with the escalating situation . "
mounting violence earlier sunday , tsvangirai pulled out of zimbabwe 's election run-off , saying violence had made a fair vote impossible , in a move that virtually hands victory to president robert mugabe . tsvangirai 's movement for democratic change -lrb- mdc -rrb- says at least 70 of its supporters have been killed in recent weeks and 25,000 forced from their homes in a state-sponsored campaign of violence .

" the " systematic campaign of violence , interference and intimidation by the zimbabwean authorities " made clear the reasoning behind the opposition move , solana said in a statement from brussels . " under these conditions , the elections would have been a parody of democracy that is unworthy of today 's africa , " he added . solana also praised the african union and the southern african development community -lrb- sadc -rrb- for " having attempted to bring zimbabwe to reason . " us , britain to raise concerns with un zimbabwe 's violent electoral crisis has sparked international condemnation with both london and washington saying they were prepared to raise their concerns in the united nations security council on monday .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : protests against mugabe outside the zimbabwean embassy in london british foreign secretary david miliband said zimbabwe would lack " legitimate " leadership if mugabe stayed in charge , and accused him of using violence to cling to power .

miliband described the violence as " state-sponsored on a very large scale with one very clear motivation " - to keep mugabe in power . "

" where people have to fear for their lives because they vote for the opposition then democracy is a farce , " the minister said . " i appeal to those in power in zimbabwe to stop using violence and intimidation as a political instrument and create conditions in which human rights are respected and economic progress is possible , " he added . germany 's development minister was more critical , accusing africa of reacting " too late and too indecisively " to events in zimbabwe .
heidemarie wieczorek-zeul said on monday it is time for the world to " answer zimbabwe 's cry for help " after opposition leader morgan tsvangirai pulled out of the country 's violence-wracked presidential runoff sunday .
she said in a statement monday that the southern african development community and the african union " have dealt too late and too indecisively with the escalating situation . "
mounting violence earlier sunday , tsvangirai pulled out of zimbabwe 's election run-off , saying violence had made a fair vote impossible , in a move that virtually hands victory to president robert mugabe . tsvangirai 's movement for democratic change -lrb- mdc -rrb- says at least 70 of its supporters have been killed in recent weeks and 25,000 forced from their homes in a state-sponsored campaign of violence .
one of its top leaders , tendai biti , has also been charged with treason and subversion .
the charges carry a possible death sentence . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : mugabe is accused of orchestrating violent attacks against opposition supporters tsvangirai made his announcement after hundreds of stick-wielding youths gathered at the venue of his party 's main pre-election rally , and following a meeting of his movement for democratic change to decide whether to withdraw from the election . up to 1,000 youths gathered at the rally grounds in the capital harare before moving on to the nearby headquarters of the ruling zanu-pf party , witnesses and afp journalists said . police officers and election observers had taken up positions nearby . tsvangirai beat mugabe in the march first round of the vote - and the ruling party lost its parliamentary majority for the first time since independence . but official results showed the mdc leader failed to achieve an outright majority of votes needed to become head of state without a run-off . eu calls vote a parody " the eu 's chief diplomat , javier solana , has expressed sympathy for the decision of zimbabwe 's opposition not to take part in the second round of the country 's presidential elections , calling the vote a " parody . " the " systematic campaign of violence , interference and intimidation by the zimbabwean authorities " made clear the reasoning behind the opposition move , solana said in a statement from brussels . " under these conditions , the elections would have been a parody of democracy that is unworthy of today 's africa , " he added . solana also praised the african union and the southern african development community -lrb- sadc -rrb- for " having attempted to bring zimbabwe to reason . " us , britain to raise concerns with un zimbabwe 's violent electoral crisis has sparked international condemnation with both london and washington saying they were prepared to raise their concerns in the united nations security council on monday .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : protests against mugabe outside the zimbabwean embassy in london british foreign secretary david miliband said zimbabwe would lack " legitimate " leadership if mugabe stayed in charge , and accused him of using violence to cling to power .
" a government which violates the constitution in zimbabwe can not be held as the legitimate representative of the zimbabwean people , " miliband said , referring to mugabe 's slowness to hold a run-off after the march 29 election .
miliband described the violence as " state-sponsored on a very large scale with one very clear motivation " - to keep mugabe in power . "
white house spokesman carlton carroll urged zimbabwe to halt violence following reports that mugabe loyalists had beaten , burned and killed opposition supporters .
" the government of zimbabwe and its thugs must stop the violence now , " carroll said in a statement .
" the mugabe regime reinforces its illegitimacy every day .
the senseless acts of violence against the opposition as well as election monitors must stop . " dw staff -lrb- sp -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

both men have spent long periods of the past season on the substitutes ' bench , lehmann at england 's arsenal and recber at fenerbahce . the 38-year-old lehmann has risen to the occasion when it mattered , playing solidly in germany 's 1-0 win over austria and also in thursday 's 3-2 quarter-final success against portugal . " the bigger the pressure the better jens becomes .
the last games showed that , " said germany goalkeeping coach andreas koepke . " i did n't see jens as critically as others .
we have seen other goalkeepers make errors here .
jens was very strong against austria .
he played a very , very good match against portugal .
he is playing the way we expected him to do and is also a team leader . " lehmann has seemingly calmed down as the tournament progressed .
he met the german media in a very aggressive mood at the start of euro after criticism of his showings in tune-up games .

he is now only in goal owing to volkan 's red-card suspension and put in a mixed performance in the quarter-finals against croatia , when he won his 117th cap . rustu looked like he might be the villain of the piece when his blunder allowed ivan klasnic give croatia the lead in the 119th minute , but turkey levelled through semih senturk .
rustu ended up as the hero in the penalty shoot-out when his save from mladen petric clinched the upset in vienna . " rustu is very experienced but not always good , " said germany defender arne friedrich of the 35-year-old . rustu has said he will retire from the national team after euro .

both men have spent long periods of the past season on the substitutes ' bench , lehmann at england 's arsenal and recber at fenerbahce . the 38-year-old lehmann has risen to the occasion when it mattered , playing solidly in germany 's 1-0 win over austria and also in thursday 's 3-2 quarter-final success against portugal . " the bigger the pressure the better jens becomes .
the last games showed that , " said germany goalkeeping coach andreas koepke . " i did n't see jens as critically as others .
we have seen other goalkeepers make errors here .
jens was very strong against austria .
he played a very , very good match against portugal .
he is playing the way we expected him to do and is also a team leader . " lehmann has seemingly calmed down as the tournament progressed .
he met the german media in a very aggressive mood at the start of euro after criticism of his showings in tune-up games .
in contrast , he was very relaxed earlier this week .

" where people have to fear for their lives because they vote for the opposition then democracy is a farce , " the minister said . " i appeal to those in power in zimbabwe to stop using violence and intimidation as a political instrument and create conditions in which human rights are respected and economic progress is possible , " he added . germany 's development minister was more critical , accusing africa of reacting " too late and too indecisively " to events in zimbabwe .
heidemarie wieczorek-zeul said on monday it is time for the world to " answer zimbabwe 's cry for help " after opposition leader morgan tsvangirai pulled out of the country 's violence-wracked presidential runoff sunday .
she said in a statement monday that the southern african development community and the african union " have dealt too late and too indecisively with the escalating situation . "
mounting violence earlier sunday , tsvangirai pulled out of zimbabwe 's election run-off , saying violence had made a fair vote impossible , in a move that virtually hands victory to president robert mugabe . tsvangirai 's movement for democratic change -lrb- mdc -rrb- says at least 70 of its supporters have been killed in recent weeks and 25,000 forced from their homes in a state-sponsored campaign of violence .
one of its top leaders , tendai biti , has also been charged with treason and subversion .
the charges carry a possible death sentence . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : mugabe is accused of orchestrating violent attacks against opposition supporters tsvangirai made his announcement after hundreds of stick-wielding youths gathered at the venue of his party 's main pre-election rally , and following a meeting of his movement for democratic change to decide whether to withdraw from the election . up to 1,000 youths gathered at the rally grounds in the capital harare before moving on to the nearby headquarters of the ruling zanu-pf party , witnesses and afp journalists said . police officers and election observers had taken up positions nearby . tsvangirai beat mugabe in the march first round of the vote - and the ruling party lost its parliamentary majority for the first time since independence . but official results showed the mdc leader failed to achieve an outright majority of votes needed to become head of state without a run-off . eu calls vote a parody " the eu 's chief diplomat , javier solana , has expressed sympathy for the decision of zimbabwe 's opposition not to take part in the second round of the country 's presidential elections , calling the vote a " parody . " the " systematic campaign of violence , interference and intimidation by the zimbabwean authorities " made clear the reasoning behind the opposition move , solana said in a statement from brussels . " under these conditions , the elections would have been a parody of democracy that is unworthy of today 's africa , " he added . solana also praised the african union and the southern african development community -lrb- sadc -rrb- for " having attempted to bring zimbabwe to reason . " us , britain to raise concerns with un zimbabwe 's violent electoral crisis has sparked international condemnation with both london and washington saying they were prepared to raise their concerns in the united nations security council on monday .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : protests against mugabe outside the zimbabwean embassy in london british foreign secretary david miliband said zimbabwe would lack " legitimate " leadership if mugabe stayed in charge , and accused him of using violence to cling to power .
" a government which violates the constitution in zimbabwe can not be held as the legitimate representative of the zimbabwean people , " miliband said , referring to mugabe 's slowness to hold a run-off after the march 29 election .
miliband described the violence as " state-sponsored on a very large scale with one very clear motivation " - to keep mugabe in power . "
white house spokesman carlton carroll urged zimbabwe to halt violence following reports that mugabe loyalists had beaten , burned and killed opposition supporters .
" the government of zimbabwe and its thugs must stop the violence now , " carroll said in a statement .
" the mugabe regime reinforces its illegitimacy every day .

" regarding that and regarding the end of the game after 90 minutes , going into extra-time , what they did was a tremendous , unbelievable achievement , " he said . " i think the team was superior technically , in the control and passing , but also tactically , and also the physical part superior to the dutch game .

van basten , van der sar leave the stage dutch coach marco van basten praised the russian performance and said they deserved their victory .
he now leaves the national side to take on an appointment with ajax . it was also an international farewell for dutch veteran keeper edwin van der sar .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : it was edwin van der sar 's last match " that 's part of football , " van basten said .
" i feel very sorry for edwin van der sar because i really wanted to give him a nice final in the national team .
he is such a great goalkeeper and he deserves winning a tournament like this .
we tried and did n't succeed . " " we did n't start well and did n't play football like we did in the first three matches .
i do n't know why .
they were a little bit nervous perhaps . " dutch veteran ruud van nistelrooy took the battle beautifully into extra-time with a headed equalizer four minutes from the end of normal time .
russians clearly fresher but the russians were not to be denied their fully deserved win , which sets them up for a semi-final clash on thursday against italy or spain . the three quarter-finals played so far have all been won by teams who finished second in their first-round group , despite having less time to prepare for the quarters than the first- placed teams . " normally you are handicapped when the other side scores such a late goal , but we were dominant .
we were physically and tactically dominant , " hiddink said . although van basten had the luxury of resting most of his first-choice players for their last group game , it was the russians who looked the fresher .

my players simply had no more strength .
that is a pity , but the russians deserved the victory , they were clearly the better side . "
two goals in extra-time russia were far superior in the first half - with their excellent movement and precise passing - and should have taken the lead . their dominance continued after the interval .
pavlyuchenko 's volley took them ahead in the 56th minute , on a centre from the left from sergei semak . # bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : torbinski scored his side 's second goal russia then missed good chances to put the dutch out of their misery , and paid the price when van nistelrooy made it 1-1 by heading in a wesley sneijder free-kick in the 86th minute . in second half injury time russian denis kolodin was shown a second yellow card after fouling sneijder , but referee lubos michel was told by his assistant that the ball had already crossed the line , and the referee then withdrew the booking allowing kolodin to stay on the field . a dutch revival seemed on the cards .
instead , van basten 's team looked exhausted and russia took advantage to create several good chances on the break . eight minutes from the end of extra-time , with penalties looming , the magnificent arshavin centered for torbinksy to tap in from close range . arshavin then rounded off a remarkable performance by making it 3-1 with a cheeky shot that went through van der sar 's legs . dpa news agency -lrb- ncy -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

pavlyuchenko 's volley took them ahead in the 56th minute , on a centre from the left from sergei semak . # bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : torbinski scored his side 's second goal russia then missed good chances to put the dutch out of their misery , and paid the price when van nistelrooy made it 1-1 by heading in a wesley sneijder free-kick in the 86th minute . in second half injury time russian denis kolodin was shown a second yellow card after fouling sneijder , but referee lubos michel was told by his assistant that the ball had already crossed the line , and the referee then withdrew the booking allowing kolodin to stay on the field . a dutch revival seemed on the cards .
instead , van basten 's team looked exhausted and russia took advantage to create several good chances on the break . eight minutes from the end of extra-time , with penalties looming , the magnificent arshavin centered for torbinksy to tap in from close range . arshavin then rounded off a remarkable performance by making it 3-1 with a cheeky shot that went through van der sar 's legs . dpa news agency -lrb- ncy -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

" where people have to fear for their lives because they vote for the opposition then democracy is a farce , " the minister said . " i appeal to those in power in zimbabwe to stop using violence and intimidation as a political instrument and create conditions in which human rights are respected and economic progress is possible , " he added . germany 's development minister was more critical , accusing africa of reacting " too late and too indecisively " to events in zimbabwe .
heidemarie wieczorek-zeul said on monday it is time for the world to " answer zimbabwe 's cry for help " after opposition leader morgan tsvangirai pulled out of the country 's violence-wracked presidential runoff sunday .
she said in a statement monday that the southern african development community and the african union " have dealt too late and too indecisively with the escalating situation . "
mounting violence earlier sunday , tsvangirai pulled out of zimbabwe 's election run-off , saying violence had made a fair vote impossible , in a move that virtually hands victory to president robert mugabe . tsvangirai 's movement for democratic change -lrb- mdc -rrb- says at least 70 of its supporters have been killed in recent weeks and 25,000 forced from their homes in a state-sponsored campaign of violence .
one of its top leaders , tendai biti , has also been charged with treason and subversion .
the charges carry a possible death sentence . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : mugabe is accused of orchestrating violent attacks against opposition supporters tsvangirai made his announcement after hundreds of stick-wielding youths gathered at the venue of his party 's main pre-election rally , and following a meeting of his movement for democratic change to decide whether to withdraw from the election . up to 1,000 youths gathered at the rally grounds in the capital harare before moving on to the nearby headquarters of the ruling zanu-pf party , witnesses and afp journalists said . police officers and election observers had taken up positions nearby . tsvangirai beat mugabe in the march first round of the vote - and the ruling party lost its parliamentary majority for the first time since independence . but official results showed the mdc leader failed to achieve an outright majority of votes needed to become head of state without a run-off . eu calls vote a parody " the eu 's chief diplomat , javier solana , has expressed sympathy for the decision of zimbabwe 's opposition not to take part in the second round of the country 's presidential elections , calling the vote a " parody . " the " systematic campaign of violence , interference and intimidation by the zimbabwean authorities " made clear the reasoning behind the opposition move , solana said in a statement from brussels . " under these conditions , the elections would have been a parody of democracy that is unworthy of today 's africa , " he added . solana also praised the african union and the southern african development community -lrb- sadc -rrb- for " having attempted to bring zimbabwe to reason . " us , britain to raise concerns with un zimbabwe 's violent electoral crisis has sparked international condemnation with both london and washington saying they were prepared to raise their concerns in the united nations security council on monday .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : protests against mugabe outside the zimbabwean embassy in london british foreign secretary david miliband said zimbabwe would lack " legitimate " leadership if mugabe stayed in charge , and accused him of using violence to cling to power .
" a government which violates the constitution in zimbabwe can not be held as the legitimate representative of the zimbabwean people , " miliband said , referring to mugabe 's slowness to hold a run-off after the march 29 election .
miliband described the violence as " state-sponsored on a very large scale with one very clear motivation " - to keep mugabe in power . "
white house spokesman carlton carroll urged zimbabwe to halt violence following reports that mugabe loyalists had beaten , burned and killed opposition supporters .
" the government of zimbabwe and its thugs must stop the violence now , " carroll said in a statement .
" the mugabe regime reinforces its illegitimacy every day .

" regarding that and regarding the end of the game after 90 minutes , going into extra-time , what they did was a tremendous , unbelievable achievement , " he said . " i think the team was superior technically , in the control and passing , but also tactically , and also the physical part superior to the dutch game .
we were better in our opponents in all components of the game , " he said . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : pavlyuchenko scored the opening goal many commentators questioned hiddink 's decision to take arshavin to the tournament despite the suspension , but have been silenced by superlative displays from the zenit youngster against sweden and now the netherlands . russia were more artful , sophisticated and thoughtful than the bewildered dutch all night - and should have won without needing extra time .
van basten , van der sar leave the stage dutch coach marco van basten praised the russian performance and said they deserved their victory .
he now leaves the national side to take on an appointment with ajax . it was also an international farewell for dutch veteran keeper edwin van der sar .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : it was edwin van der sar 's last match " that 's part of football , " van basten said .
" i feel very sorry for edwin van der sar because i really wanted to give him a nice final in the national team .
he is such a great goalkeeper and he deserves winning a tournament like this .
we tried and did n't succeed . " " we did n't start well and did n't play football like we did in the first three matches .
i do n't know why .
they were a little bit nervous perhaps . " dutch veteran ruud van nistelrooy took the battle beautifully into extra-time with a headed equalizer four minutes from the end of normal time .
russians clearly fresher but the russians were not to be denied their fully deserved win , which sets them up for a semi-final clash on thursday against italy or spain . the three quarter-finals played so far have all been won by teams who finished second in their first-round group , despite having less time to prepare for the quarters than the first- placed teams . " normally you are handicapped when the other side scores such a late goal , but we were dominant .
we were physically and tactically dominant , " hiddink said . although van basten had the luxury of resting most of his first-choice players for their last group game , it was the russians who looked the fresher .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : van nistelrooy gave the dutch the equalizer " we had some physical problems .
my players simply had no more strength .
that is a pity , but the russians deserved the victory , they were clearly the better side . "
two goals in extra-time russia were far superior in the first half - with their excellent movement and precise passing - and should have taken the lead . their dominance continued after the interval .
pavlyuchenko 's volley took them ahead in the 56th minute , on a centre from the left from sergei semak . # bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : torbinski scored his side 's second goal russia then missed good chances to put the dutch out of their misery , and paid the price when van nistelrooy made it 1-1 by heading in a wesley sneijder free-kick in the 86th minute . in second half injury time russian denis kolodin was shown a second yellow card after fouling sneijder , but referee lubos michel was told by his assistant that the ball had already crossed the line , and the referee then withdrew the booking allowing kolodin to stay on the field . a dutch revival seemed on the cards .
instead , van basten 's team looked exhausted and russia took advantage to create several good chances on the break . eight minutes from the end of extra-time , with penalties looming , the magnificent arshavin centered for torbinksy to tap in from close range . arshavin then rounded off a remarkable performance by making it 3-1 with a cheeky shot that went through van der sar 's legs . dpa news agency -lrb- ncy -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

" where people have to fear for their lives because they vote for the opposition then democracy is a farce , " the minister said . " i appeal to those in power in zimbabwe to stop using violence and intimidation as a political instrument and create conditions in which human rights are respected and economic progress is possible , " he added . germany 's development minister was more critical , accusing africa of reacting " too late and too indecisively " to events in zimbabwe .
heidemarie wieczorek-zeul said on monday it is time for the world to " answer zimbabwe 's cry for help " after opposition leader morgan tsvangirai pulled out of the country 's violence-wracked presidential runoff sunday .
she said in a statement monday that the southern african development community and the african union " have dealt too late and too indecisively with the escalating situation . "
mounting violence earlier sunday , tsvangirai pulled out of zimbabwe 's election run-off , saying violence had made a fair vote impossible , in a move that virtually hands victory to president robert mugabe . tsvangirai 's movement for democratic change -lrb- mdc -rrb- says at least 70 of its supporters have been killed in recent weeks and 25,000 forced from their homes in a state-sponsored campaign of violence .
one of its top leaders , tendai biti , has also been charged with treason and subversion .
the charges carry a possible death sentence . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : mugabe is accused of orchestrating violent attacks against opposition supporters tsvangirai made his announcement after hundreds of stick-wielding youths gathered at the venue of his party 's main pre-election rally , and following a meeting of his movement for democratic change to decide whether to withdraw from the election . up to 1,000 youths gathered at the rally grounds in the capital harare before moving on to the nearby headquarters of the ruling zanu-pf party , witnesses and afp journalists said . police officers and election observers had taken up positions nearby . tsvangirai beat mugabe in the march first round of the vote - and the ruling party lost its parliamentary majority for the first time since independence . but official results showed the mdc leader failed to achieve an outright majority of votes needed to become head of state without a run-off . eu calls vote a parody " the eu 's chief diplomat , javier solana , has expressed sympathy for the decision of zimbabwe 's opposition not to take part in the second round of the country 's presidential elections , calling the vote a " parody . " the " systematic campaign of violence , interference and intimidation by the zimbabwean authorities " made clear the reasoning behind the opposition move , solana said in a statement from brussels . " under these conditions , the elections would have been a parody of democracy that is unworthy of today 's africa , " he added . solana also praised the african union and the southern african development community -lrb- sadc -rrb- for " having attempted to bring zimbabwe to reason . " us , britain to raise concerns with un zimbabwe 's violent electoral crisis has sparked international condemnation with both london and washington saying they were prepared to raise their concerns in the united nations security council on monday .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : protests against mugabe outside the zimbabwean embassy in london british foreign secretary david miliband said zimbabwe would lack " legitimate " leadership if mugabe stayed in charge , and accused him of using violence to cling to power .
" a government which violates the constitution in zimbabwe can not be held as the legitimate representative of the zimbabwean people , " miliband said , referring to mugabe 's slowness to hold a run-off after the march 29 election .
miliband described the violence as " state-sponsored on a very large scale with one very clear motivation " - to keep mugabe in power . "
white house spokesman carlton carroll urged zimbabwe to halt violence following reports that mugabe loyalists had beaten , burned and killed opposition supporters .
" the government of zimbabwe and its thugs must stop the violence now , " carroll said in a statement .
" the mugabe regime reinforces its illegitimacy every day .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de travel -pipe- 22.06.2008 european groups work to promote ethical travel großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : some in the travel industry want to increase ethical standards in the tourism sector the " fair trade " label is appearing on many goods nowadays - from coffee and chocolate to apples and apparel .
but would a " fair trade " label influence people shopping for a vacation ? the " fair trade " seal of approval takes the guesswork out of finding groceries and clothing that meet high ethical standards .
despite the label 's popularity , the concept has yet to catch on in the tourism industry , as vacationers find it difficult to say which tour companies and hotels adhere to fair trade principles . still , some say the time is ripe for a wider analysis of fair trade in the tourism industry .
travelers worried about the ecological and sociological impact of their spending habits have fueled a trend toward responsible tourism . " people do not want to have a guilty conscience when they travel , " said rainer hartmann , a professor at bremen college .
he says there is a demand for fair trade travel , a trend that heinz fuchs of tourism watch , part of the bonn-based church development service , has also noticed . " transfair products increased by 30 percent in 2007 , " says fuchs .
" this idea is pretty widespread in other countries , but it 's just catching on here . " working group establishing criteria bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the group wants to concentrate on mainstream tourism indeed , " fair trade " labels are not entirely new in the travel industry .
south africa 's tourist organizations already use them and some european organizations are considering similar ideas . an international working group has been trying to lay down criteria for a seal here that would look at factors such as fair pay for workers . " there have to be set working hours , ” said fuchs .
" employees should have health and accident insurance , as well as unemployment insurance . " there 's also widespread agreement that tour operators and companies should not get the seal .
it should instead be awarded to products such as individual tours . the group has likewise agreed that the label should not focus on niche markets for do-gooders . " it should instead focus on mainstream tourism , " says fuchs . certification would raise consciousness , transparency bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : as with organic apples , a fair trade seal might make ethical selection easier hartmann said he sees the merit of such proposals .
" consciousness in this area has grown , just like the evolution of organic food products , which are now on sale at every discount store . " and just like organic apples , a seal of approval for fair trade travel would be useful , he adds .
not only would it have the bonus of providing a standard set of criteria , it would also add transparency .
" it would make it easier to convey that ' this trip is ok , " ' he said . still , not everyone is convinced a seal is the best idea . " certification is not cheap .
it costs several thousand euros , " said rolf pfeifer , chief executive officer of forum anders reisen , a group of travel operators dedicated to environmentally sound tourism . " a lot of hotels wo n't be able to afford it .
nor will a lot of small operators . " pfeifer 's company recently completed a report on corporate social responsibility -lrb- csr -rrb- in tourism .
the report is meant to serve as the basis for sustainability reports for other organizers to show how they comply . a recent decision by the forum requires all members to get csr certification by the end of 2010 .
the certification would cover many of the same values covered by any fair trade seal . dw staff -lrb- cat -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

but would a " fair trade " label influence people shopping for a vacation ? the " fair trade " seal of approval takes the guesswork out of finding groceries and clothing that meet high ethical standards .
despite the label 's popularity , the concept has yet to catch on in the tourism industry , as vacationers find it difficult to say which tour companies and hotels adhere to fair trade principles . still , some say the time is ripe for a wider analysis of fair trade in the tourism industry .

he says there is a demand for fair trade travel , a trend that heinz fuchs of tourism watch , part of the bonn-based church development service , has also noticed . " transfair products increased by 30 percent in 2007 , " says fuchs .

not only would it have the bonus of providing a standard set of criteria , it would also add transparency .
" it would make it easier to convey that ' this trip is ok , " ' he said . still , not everyone is convinced a seal is the best idea . " certification is not cheap .

but would a " fair trade " label influence people shopping for a vacation ? the " fair trade " seal of approval takes the guesswork out of finding groceries and clothing that meet high ethical standards .
despite the label 's popularity , the concept has yet to catch on in the tourism industry , as vacationers find it difficult to say which tour companies and hotels adhere to fair trade principles . still , some say the time is ripe for a wider analysis of fair trade in the tourism industry .
travelers worried about the ecological and sociological impact of their spending habits have fueled a trend toward responsible tourism . " people do not want to have a guilty conscience when they travel , " said rainer hartmann , a professor at bremen college .
he says there is a demand for fair trade travel , a trend that heinz fuchs of tourism watch , part of the bonn-based church development service , has also noticed . " transfair products increased by 30 percent in 2007 , " says fuchs .
" this idea is pretty widespread in other countries , but it 's just catching on here . " working group establishing criteria bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the group wants to concentrate on mainstream tourism indeed , " fair trade " labels are not entirely new in the travel industry .
south africa 's tourist organizations already use them and some european organizations are considering similar ideas . an international working group has been trying to lay down criteria for a seal here that would look at factors such as fair pay for workers . " there have to be set working hours , ” said fuchs .
" employees should have health and accident insurance , as well as unemployment insurance . " there 's also widespread agreement that tour operators and companies should not get the seal .
it should instead be awarded to products such as individual tours . the group has likewise agreed that the label should not focus on niche markets for do-gooders . " it should instead focus on mainstream tourism , " says fuchs . certification would raise consciousness , transparency bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : as with organic apples , a fair trade seal might make ethical selection easier hartmann said he sees the merit of such proposals .
" consciousness in this area has grown , just like the evolution of organic food products , which are now on sale at every discount store . " and just like organic apples , a seal of approval for fair trade travel would be useful , he adds .
not only would it have the bonus of providing a standard set of criteria , it would also add transparency .
" it would make it easier to convey that ' this trip is ok , " ' he said . still , not everyone is convinced a seal is the best idea . " certification is not cheap .
it costs several thousand euros , " said rolf pfeifer , chief executive officer of forum anders reisen , a group of travel operators dedicated to environmentally sound tourism . " a lot of hotels wo n't be able to afford it .

according to the sunday telegraph , the bishop of rochester , the rt rev michael nazir-ali will decline an invitation to the anglican communion summit .
bishop nazir-ali has helped organise the rival gafcon conference currently being held in jerusalem .
the lambeth conference , held every 10 years , takes place next month .
it is reported that two other english bishops will turn down invitations .
currently about 280 bishops are at the gafcon conference , many of whom are expected to boycott the lambeth gathering .
the organisers behind the jerusalem conference have called it a " pilgrimage back to the roots of our faith " .
gay bishop ordination the ever-widening split caused by the dispute over homosexuality is likely to overshadow the lambeth conference .
the dispute was ignited when the openly gay bishop gene robinson was ordained in new hampshire , in the us , in 2003 .
it is the invitation to lambeth of bishops who helped the ordination which has most recently angered some - although gene robinson himself has not been invited .
the bbc 's religious affairs correspondent robert pigott said the news of bishop nazir-ali 's boycott - among others - would be damaging to the archbishop of canterbury , dr rowan williams .
he told radio 4 's sunday programme : " it 's part of a drip , drip of bad news that has affected the lambeth conference . "
our correspondent said the boycott , not only by the bishop of rochester but many other traditionalists attending gafcon , was unprecedented in the lambeth conference 's 100 year history .
" this meeting is needed really to knit together this very diverse group of anglicans from all over the world and to , in a way , celebrate what they do have in common , which is an enormous amount .
" so to have this real dent in it is harmful , to put it mildly .
and then to have english bishops not coming along , and making it quite clear that they are not i think is going to undermine it further .
" it will show that this dispute has entered the church of england . "

according to the sunday telegraph , the bishop of rochester , the rt rev michael nazir-ali will decline an invitation to the anglican communion summit .
bishop nazir-ali has helped organise the rival gafcon conference currently being held in jerusalem .
the lambeth conference , held every 10 years , takes place next month .
it is reported that two other english bishops will turn down invitations .
currently about 280 bishops are at the gafcon conference , many of whom are expected to boycott the lambeth gathering .
the organisers behind the jerusalem conference have called it a " pilgrimage back to the roots of our faith " .
gay bishop ordination the ever-widening split caused by the dispute over homosexuality is likely to overshadow the lambeth conference .
the dispute was ignited when the openly gay bishop gene robinson was ordained in new hampshire , in the us , in 2003 .
it is the invitation to lambeth of bishops who helped the ordination which has most recently angered some - although gene robinson himself has not been invited .
the bbc 's religious affairs correspondent robert pigott said the news of bishop nazir-ali 's boycott - among others - would be damaging to the archbishop of canterbury , dr rowan williams .
he told radio 4 's sunday programme : " it 's part of a drip , drip of bad news that has affected the lambeth conference . "
our correspondent said the boycott , not only by the bishop of rochester but many other traditionalists attending gafcon , was unprecedented in the lambeth conference 's 100 year history .
" this meeting is needed really to knit together this very diverse group of anglicans from all over the world and to , in a way , celebrate what they do have in common , which is an enormous amount .

according to the sunday telegraph , the bishop of rochester , the rt rev michael nazir-ali will decline an invitation to the anglican communion summit .
bishop nazir-ali has helped organise the rival gafcon conference currently being held in jerusalem .
the lambeth conference , held every 10 years , takes place next month .
it is reported that two other english bishops will turn down invitations .
currently about 280 bishops are at the gafcon conference , many of whom are expected to boycott the lambeth gathering .
the organisers behind the jerusalem conference have called it a " pilgrimage back to the roots of our faith " .
gay bishop ordination the ever-widening split caused by the dispute over homosexuality is likely to overshadow the lambeth conference .
the dispute was ignited when the openly gay bishop gene robinson was ordained in new hampshire , in the us , in 2003 .
it is the invitation to lambeth of bishops who helped the ordination which has most recently angered some - although gene robinson himself has not been invited .
the bbc 's religious affairs correspondent robert pigott said the news of bishop nazir-ali 's boycott - among others - would be damaging to the archbishop of canterbury , dr rowan williams .
he told radio 4 's sunday programme : " it 's part of a drip , drip of bad news that has affected the lambeth conference . "
our correspondent said the boycott , not only by the bishop of rochester but many other traditionalists attending gafcon , was unprecedented in the lambeth conference 's 100 year history .
" this meeting is needed really to knit together this very diverse group of anglicans from all over the world and to , in a way , celebrate what they do have in common , which is an enormous amount .
" so to have this real dent in it is harmful , to put it mildly .
and then to have english bishops not coming along , and making it quite clear that they are not i think is going to undermine it further .
" it will show that this dispute has entered the church of england . "

the international atomic energy agency 's -lrb- iaea -rrb- four-person team will spend three days examining the al-kibar site in the desert in northern syria .
the site was bombed by israeli jets in september 2007 .
the ruins were bulldozed after the attack .
israel and the us have said the installation was a nuclear plant in the making - a charge denied by damascus .
speaking on his departure , the deputy chief of the iaea , olli heinonen - who is leading the team of inspectors - said they would meet their syrian counterparts on sunday evening .

syria has repeatedly denied it has any nuclear weapons programme , or any such agreement with north korea .
syrian officials have said the bombed site was an unused military facility under construction , but deny that it had anything to do with a nuclear programme .
iaea chief mohamed elbaradei has criticised both what he saw as a us delay in releasing information on the syrian site and israel 's bombing of the site before his agency could inspect it .
ahead of the visit , mr elbaradei called on syria to show " absolute transparency " and to give the inspectors access to all sites they wished to see .
in an interview with al-arabiya television , he said : " we have no evidence that syria has the human resources that would allow it to carry out a large nuclear programme .

war on want 's john hillary on tackling child labour he told the bbc : " we have health and safety regulations in all of the workplaces in this country so it 's a fairly understood idea .
" what we 're saying is that the british government should be looking down the supply chain , all the way to the factories in china , in bangladesh , in india , and they should be calling on our retailers to ensure that those workers have proper terms and conditions . "
consumers are increasingly demanding that companies produce goods in an ethical manner , turning the spotlight on worker wages and working conditions .
child labour activist bhuwan ribhu said it harmed children " practically every which way " .
" socially , morally , psychologically , physically , " he said , " we are essentially ruining all our future generation . "
under no circumstances would primark ever knowingly permit such activities primark statement " the information provided by the bbc enabled us to identify that illegal sub-contracting had been taking place and to take action accordingly , " primark explained .
according to primark , the garments affected accounted for 0.04 % of the retailers ' worldwide sourcing .
it added that " the sub-contracting involved home working and in some instances children were also found to be working at home " .
" we take this lapse in standards very seriously indeed , " said primark , which is owned by associated british foods .
" under no circumstances would primark ever knowingly permit such activities , whether directly through its suppliers or through third party sub-contractors . "
code of conduct under the terms of its code of practice for suppliers , primark prohibits the use of child labour in its manufacturing chain .
primark says it will terminate relations with suppliers guilty of certain " transgressions " and those unwilling to make the " necessary changes " to their employment practices when breaches of its code are uncovered .
primark has proved one of the uk high street 's unquestioned success stories in recent years , its mixture of low prices and accessible fashion proving a hit with varying age groups .
it currently has more than 170 stores and made a £ 200m profit last year on total sales of more than £ 1.6bn.

the bbc 's panorama programme , which carried out a six-month investigation , alerted primark to the problems .
john hillary of the charity war on want said the government " should be looking down the supply chain " .
' ruining generation ' he told the bbc : " we have health and safety regulations in all of the workplaces in this country so it 's a fairly understood idea .
" what we 're saying is that the british government should be looking down the supply chain , all the way to the factories in china , in bangladesh , in india , and they should be calling on our retailers to ensure that those workers have proper terms and conditions . "
consumers are increasingly demanding that companies produce goods in an ethical manner , turning the spotlight on worker wages and working conditions .
child labour activist bhuwan ribhu said it harmed children " practically every which way " .
" socially , morally , psychologically , physically , " he said , " we are essentially ruining all our future generation . "
" under no circumstances would primark ever knowingly permit such activities " primark statement " the information provided by the bbc enabled us to identify that illegal sub-contracting had been taking place and to take action accordingly , " primark explained .
according to primark , the garments affected accounted for 0.04 % of the retailers ' worldwide sourcing .
it added that " the sub-contracting involved home working and in some instances children were also found to be working at home " .
" we take this lapse in standards very seriously indeed , " said primark , which is owned by associated british foods .
" under no circumstances would primark ever knowingly permit such activities , whether directly through its suppliers or through third party sub-contractors . "
code of conduct under the terms of its code of practice for suppliers , primark prohibits the use of child labour in its manufacturing chain .
primark says it will terminate relations with suppliers guilty of certain " transgressions " and those unwilling to make the " necessary changes " to their employment practices when breaches of its code are uncovered .
primark has proved one of the uk high street 's unquestioned success stories in recent years , its mixture of low prices and accessible fashion proving a hit with varying age groups .
it currently has more than 170 stores and made a £ 200m profit last year on total sales of more than £ 1.6bn.
have your say " if the price is unbelievably cheap , the goods will not have been ethically made " alan davies send us your comments leading european and us retailers have come under growing pressure to ensure that workers in their supply chain - particularly in labour-intensive markets such as india and china - are not exploited .
companies such as nike have responded to consumer concerns about ethical standards in the retail industry by making public details of all their suppliers .
but charities and fairtrade groups have criticised other retailers for failing to follow suit and argued that many popular products continue to be sold in developed countries at a fraction of their true cost of production .
a panorama special on primark will be broadcast on bbc1 at 9pm on 23 june .

interview with alistair darling chancellor alistair darling says pay rises for people " from the boardroom to the shopfloor " need to be " consistent " with the 2 % inflation target .
he told bbc one 's andrew marr show the need to keep inflation under control " applies to each and every one of us " .
he said above-inflation pay increases would be " extremely damaging " .
mr darling said the uk economy was " far better equipped " than in the 1970s , 1980s and 1990s , but " despite that we are in for a tough time " .
the government 's preferred inflation measure , the consumer prices index rose , to 3.3 % in may , with the bank of england warning it may reach 4 % .
the wider retail prices index measure of inflation - the one used for many pay negotiations - is already at 4.3 % .
asked if people should accept their living standards were going to fall this year - as they get pay rises below the level of inflation - mr darling said that everyone " had a vested interest " in not allowing inflation to take hold .
he said : " we 've got to make sure that we keep inflation under control because if we do n't what will happen is that people may get a pay increase but every penny of it will be eaten up by rising prices in the shops .
" now none of us want to see that happen , it 's in no-one 's interest and that applies from the top to the bottom , public and private sector alike . "
the chancellor was speaking as bpix opinion poll for the mail on sunday suggested labour was trailing the conservative party by 49 % to 26 % -with the lib dems on 14 % .
the poll - which saw 2,385 people questioned online between 18 and 20 june - comes ahead of gordon brown 's first anniversary as prime minister , on friday .
asked about mr brown 's position , mr darling told the programme : " i have always taken the view that we can turn this round .
" we have had a difficult year , whether it 's the economy or other political issues as well , but i believe we are doing the right thing . "

the container ship , which rescued the crew - known as the scilly boys - from a life raft they had been clinging to , has arrived in gibraltar .
the four scillonians had been trying to beat the 100-year-old record for rowing from new york to bishop 's rock .

the crew spent hours clinging to a life raft before they were picked up by the oil tanker gulf grace .
the team thanked all those who had rescued them via their website and said : " we are sorry to friends and family that the anxiety caused was not outweighed by the successful completion of our record attempt .
" the desire to complete the crossing for the islands was the same desire that gave us the drive to survive in those conditions throughout the night .
" the messages of support were a constant reminder of why we needed to survive our ordeal , and make it back home to our families . "
the rowers , who called their challenge scilly boys row 4 home , were aiming to beat the record for a four-person crew of 55 days and 13 hours .
mr jenkins ' mother angie said they would hold a " terrific party " when the crew returned to scilly .

the container ship , which rescued the crew - known as the scilly boys - from a life raft they had been clinging to , has arrived in gibraltar .
the four scillonians had been trying to beat the 100-year-old record for rowing from new york to bishop 's rock .
their vessel overturned 13 days into the voyage in 40 ft -lrb- 12m -rrb- high seas .
a support team went out to meet the rowers in gibraltar and they are expected to fly back to britain on monday .
the desire to complete the crossing was the same desire that gave us the drive to survive the scilly boys tim garratt , 27 , chris jenkins , 43 , joby newton , 19 , and wayne davey , 30 , were 650 miles -lrb- 1046km -rrb- off the us coast when they hit trouble .
the crew spent hours clinging to a life raft before they were picked up by the oil tanker gulf grace .
the team thanked all those who had rescued them via their website and said : " we are sorry to friends and family that the anxiety caused was not outweighed by the successful completion of our record attempt .
" the desire to complete the crossing for the islands was the same desire that gave us the drive to survive in those conditions throughout the night .
" the messages of support were a constant reminder of why we needed to survive our ordeal , and make it back home to our families . "
the rowers , who called their challenge scilly boys row 4 home , were aiming to beat the record for a four-person crew of 55 days and 13 hours .
mr jenkins ' mother angie said they would hold a " terrific party " when the crew returned to scilly .
" i feel sorry for them after the work they 've put in but it will be lovely to see them again , " she said .
only six crossings have been made west to east over the past 100 years .
