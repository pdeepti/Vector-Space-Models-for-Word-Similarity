program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de science -pipe- 11.04.2008 germany eases stem cell restrictions großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : scientists will have more stem cell lines to choose from after months of political negotiations , german lawmakers agreed to allow broader embryonic stem cell use .
but they signaled their ambivalence by refusing to completely do away with restrictions . hundreds of stem-cell lines previously off-limits to german scientists will be made available under a law passed by a majority of germany 's lower house of parliament on friday , april 11 .
but the decision represents a compromise in a debate which has raged for months over the ethics of using embryonic stem cells for scientific research .
on friday , lawmakers debated various measures which ranged from a complete liberalization to a complete prohibition of stem-cell use before deciding on a compromise measure .
the final vote cut across party lines , with 346 german lawmakers in favor of the revision while 228 voted against it and six abstained .
researchers welcome new law bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the stem cell issue divided the german legislature german scientists had long complained that the restrictive laws put them at a disadvantage compared with their peers in other countries .
germany 's science minister , annette schavan , said reforming the law was key to fostering research in germany .
“ this is a good day for both protecting life and also for research in germany , “ schavan , of the christian democratic union , said after the vote friday . the german research foundation -lrb- dfg -rrb- , max-planck-institute , the helmholz association and the federation of german industries -lrb- bdi -rrb- also welcomed the vote . “ the changes give german researchers the chance to stay competitive internationally , ” said max planck institute president peter gruss . more options for scientists bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : stem cells are thought to offer disease-curing potential german scientists had pushed for germany to reconsider a 2002 law which imposed strict limits on the use of embryonic stem cells in medical research .
while the law banned all creation of stem cells in germany , it did allow cells produced from abroad to be imported , but only if they had been created before jan .
1 , 2002 .
scientists also had to show that the project had overwhelming significance and that no other research method could be used .
scientists had complained that tight laws prevented them from taking part in international projects using stem cell lines created after 2002 .
other european countries , such as britain and sweden , have less strict laws .
the new law allows for a more recent cut-off date of may 1 , 2007 for the import of stem-cell lines .
advocates of the change claim that it will increase the number of stem-cell lines available to german scientists from 40 to 500 .
echoes of nazi experiments ?
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : politicians voted their conscience embryonic stem cells are prized by scientists for their ability to develop into any type of cell .
this versatility has led scientists to trump stem cells as offering the potential to cure diseases such as diabetes , parkinson 's and heart maladies .
yet in germany , the use of embryonic stem cells makes many people uncomfortable on religious and ethical grounds .
stem cell research carries historic overtones of the nazis ' genetic experiments linked to the creation of a master race .
traumatized by grisly experiments on humans under the nazis and influenced by its christian churches , germany has agonized for a decade about the ethics of using the cells .
critics argue that a human life is sacrificed when an embryo is torn apart .
religious groups expressed unhappiness with the parliament 's decision .
" this is not a good day for the protection of life in germany , “ said munich archbishop reinhard marx . guenther beckstein , bavaria ’ s conservative premier , also said he thought the change would set a dangerous precedent . “ my worry is that it will now become easier to further undermine the protection of unborn life , ” beckstein said .
critics have pointed to new research advances in bolstering their claim that stem cells are unnecessary .
scientists recently discovered a way to re-program adult stem cells to make them pluripotent , or capable of acting like embryonic stem cells .
the search for a substitute bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : embryonic stem cells still ca n't be produced in germany but scientists counter they still need the embryonic cells to compare with these induced pluripotent cells .
in november 2007 , teams of us and japanese researchers said they had reprogrammed human skin cells to function like embryonic stem cells .
on the surface , this could mean that scientists would no longer have to rely on embryonic stem cells .
but " these new , reprogrammed cells still have to be compared with real embryonic stem cell lines to see if they function the same way , " said joerg hacker , vice president of the german research foundation .
shortly after the november announcement , the german government announced it would double its funding for stem-cell research from 5 million euros -lrb- $ 7.4 million -rrb- to just under 10 million euros , albeit only for adult stem cells . dw staff -lrb- th -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de elections -pipe- 11.04.2008 spain 's re-elected zapatero faces long list of challenges großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : spain 's prime minister jose luis rodriguez zapatero has a lot to do in his second term spanish prime minister jose luis rodriguez zapatero 's premiership was reconfirmed by parliament friday , april 11 .
he faces a second term of economic challenges and continuing concerns over regional separatism . the new legislature was , however , opening in a more conciliatory political atmosphere than the previous one , making it easier for spanish socialist leader zapatero to try to buttress up the economy and to seek support in the fight against the militant basque separatist group eta .
the 47-year-old was the first spanish prime minister elected in a popular vote to be reconfirmed with a simple majority in a second round of voting , after failing to win an absolute majority in the first round .
the socialists increased their number of seats by five to 169 in the 350-member parliament , but did not get an absolute majority in the elections a month ago .
zapatero had deliberately opted for a simple majority in the parliamentary vote in order to maintain his political independence from basque and catalan regionalists , whose votes could have allowed him to be elected in the first round , but who would have demanded a price for their support .
the government 's concessions to regions demanding more autonomy had earlier created divisions with the opposition conservatives , who accused zapatero of endangering the unity of spain .
growing calls for autonomy during the upcoming legislature , it is expected that the basques will attempt to stage a regional referendum on a self-government bordering on independence , which the socialists were planning to prevent by offering the region more autonomy instead .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : eta 's armed struggle has claimed lives on zapatero 's watch basque regional premier juan jose ibarretxe believes the referendum could help to end the violence associated with the basque separatist group eta , which has killed three people since negotiations between eta and madrid collapsed in 2006 .
the negotiation attempt sparked a barrage of criticism from the conservative people 's party -lrb- pp -rrb- , which slammed the government for " surrendering " to terrorists .
zapatero has resumed police crackdowns against eta and made it understood that he will not talk to the group again , a move which is expected to help to pacify the political atmosphere .
zapatero has also pledged to seek a cross-party consensus on other issues including a reform of regional financial autonomy rule , spain 's europe policy and judicial reform .
the previous legislature was marked by liberal social reforms , such as gay marriage and speedy divorce .
the issues divided the country and catholic clergymen lambasted the government at rallies in defense of the traditional family .
the government was not , however , expected to pursue other controversial reforms , such as a more liberal abortion law or the legalization of euthanasia , during the upcoming legislature .
reversing economic downturn bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : spain 's finances are another area of concern for the pm zapatero is more concerned with the state of spain 's economy , which is expected to be hit harder than most other western countries by the global economic problems , with growth plunging from 3.8 per cent in 2007 to possibly even less than 2 per cent this year .
the premier has pledged measures to soften the blow , such as an increase of public works to absorb workers from the long overheated , rapidly shrinking construction industry , which has accounted for nearly 20 per cent of spain 's gross domestic product -lrb- gdp -rrb- .
despite the general improvement in the political atmosphere , the socialists ' relations with other parties have evolved in such a way that zapatero will be able to pass laws with the support of smaller parties only on a case-by-case basis .
previously , he had been able to rely on the far-left izquierda unida -lrb- iu -rrb- and on the catalan republican party erc for the initial part of the legislature .
no major reshuffle bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : foreign minister moratinos is likely to remain in office zapatero was expected to make relatively few changes in the composition of his government , retaining his popular deputy maria teresa fernandez de la vega , as well as pedro solbes as economics minister , miguel angel moratinos as foreign minister and alfredo perez rubalcaba as interior minister .
zapatero , who appointed spain 's first half-female cabinet , was expected to give the defense portfolio to a woman , possibly to elena salgado , who held the health and then the public administration portfolio in the previous government .
the premier was due to announce the composition of the new government after being sworn in by king juan carlos on saturday . dw staff / dpa -lrb- nda -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

" russia will take unambiguous action toward ensuring its interests along its borders , " he said .
" these will not only be military steps , but also steps of a different character . "
moscow lobbied hard to head off georgia and ukraine 's ambition for membership at last month 's nato summit in bucharest , but alliance leaders intend to review their bid in december .
nato turned down georgia and ukraine 's applications for membership action plans - a stepping stone to membership - but , under pressure from washington , one of the strongest advocates of enlargement in the alliance , the alliance did say both would eventually become nato members .
russian foreign minister sergei lavrov said earlier this week that moscow will do everything it can to prevent the two countries , run by pro-western governments , from becoming nato members .
russia will do everything to prevent accession bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : putin and lavrov did n't like what they heard in bucharest " we will do all we can to prevent ukraine 's and georgia 's accession into nato and to avoid an inevitable serious exacerbation of our relations with both the alliance and our neighbors , " lavrov told reporters .
russia opposes the plan to grant membership on the grounds that such a move would pose a direct threat to its security and endanger the fragile balance of forces in europe .
it also sees nato 's willingness to enlarge eastward as the continuation of the western cold war containment policy and the spread of a foreign military bloc along its border .
president vladimir putin said in february that russia would consider directing its missiles at ukraine if the neighboring state ever hosted nato military installations .
russia 's fears have also been stoked by plans by the united states to install interceptor missiles and radar stations in poland and the czech republic as part of a wider missile defense shield designed to protect the us from attack by rogue states such as iran and north korea .
lavrov warned earlier this week that states hosting parts of a us missile defense shield also risked facing a military response if moscow 's security concerns were not met .
demands for presence at missile shield installations bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : russia wants to be involved in any missile plans the us has the russian foreign minister demanded that the russian military be allowed a " permanent presence " at the planned us missile interceptor base in poland and the radar site in the czech republic , threatening that russia would otherwise consider " measures of military-technical character . "
the threat put paid to the united states and its partners hopes of a shift in russia 's negative attitude after a big us push for compromise at last week 's nato summit and in one-on-one talks between president george w. bush and putin .
russia is also said to have been angered by bush 's pressuring of european members of nato to openly support ukraine and georgia 's nato bid despite being told by german chancellor angela merkel that the topic was " off the table " for the time being at the meeting in bucharest .
germany , france fear destabilization bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : sarkozy and merkel were angered by pressure from bush while bush was forced into agreeing on a delay by merkel and french president nicolas sarkozy , who fear a rash move to install the two former soviet states as nato members could destabilize an already volatile region on russia 's southern flank , his insistence was not lost on russian observers .
however , general baluyevsky said it was too early to talk about ukrainian or georgian entry into nato .
" the population of ukraine is unambiguously against entry to nato despite the so-called referendum in georgia where seventy percent of the population supported the idea , ” he said .

"
they were enraged that former nazis held powerful positions in society , incensed over legal reforms they deemed undemocratic and angry they did n't have more of a say in running their universities . " it was a revolutionary period that aimed to create a better world , " wolfgang bittner , a former lawyer and now writer in cologne , told dw-world.de. the 66-year-old said he was " politicized " during that time as a university student . " we students felt the leaden weight of antiquated , bourgeois german society - the complacency of it , " he said . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : rudi 's legend lives on one of the spearheads of the student movement that formed as a reaction to that sentiment was rudi dutschke - an eloquent and charismatic leader and head of the socialist students union . for thousands , dutschke became a beacon for change . he was shot in west berlin on april 11 , 1968 , by josef bachmann , a laborer and sometimes burglar with alleged right-wing sympathies .
dutschke barely survived the bullets to his brain , and suffered health problems for the rest of his life , eventually dying as a result of his injuries 11 years later . students at the time blamed conservative media for stoking hatred against dutschke .
they resented the bild tabloid 's smear campaign against him and the 68ers , as those of the movement were called , believing it played a role in convincing bachmann to attempt murder . brought in the new günter wallraff , 65 , a journalist and filmmaker known nationwide for his crusades against corporate injustice , said the 1968 movement brought about changes that many people now take for granted . " the double standards for men and women in society were exposed then , greater rights and freedom for women and children were created , more power to students for democratic representation , sexual liberalization - the 1968 generation prompted all of that , " he said . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : us singer joan baez during a 1967 vietnam war protest " new life was breathed into society at the time , " he said , pointing to dramatic shifts in literature , music and design as well . but many students wanted more and had set their sights beyond germany 's borders .
besides being anti-authoritarian , they were also largely anti-american .
they opposed the us war in vietnam and chanted the name of vietnamese communist leader ho chi minh as they battled baton-wielding police during protests on berlin streets . revolt against nazi past the year 1968 saw university campuses in several countries transformed into battlegrounds for social change .
in paris , students were joined by labor unions ; people in poland and czechoslovakia demonstrated against repressive governments . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : demonstrations also rocked paris in may 1968 germans , however , had their own particular demons to battle . the students , and other left-wing protestors , opposed an older generation that accepted kurt georg kiesinger , a former member of the nazi party , as chancellor . they rejected the notion of a state led by president heinrich luebke , who held the office from 1959 to 1969 .
he had worked with architect albert speer during the nazi regime and was suspected of having designed concentration camps during world war ii . " a generation of criminals was ruling society after the war and no one talked about what they had done .

germany is world-renowned for the lack of speed limits on stretches of its famed highway system : the autobahn .
most readers would like it to stay that way . the following comments reflect the views of dw-world.de readers .
not all reader comments have been published .
dw-world.de reserves the right to edit for length and appropriateness of content . speed limits will please the environmental movement by reducing emissions from all cars , but car lovers , including german chancellor angela merkel and the car industry in germany , will be upset by this decision .
also i will imagine that speed cameras on the autobahns in bremen will start appearing , and i can not see that being too popular with the drivers either . - stuart john pearson , australia there is no need to put a speed limit on the autobahn .
education is what is needed to keep a driver from over-driving his / her car .
that is what causes accidents , not speed . - alan m. reck , us germany 's highway safety statistics are better than that of the united states and we have a speed limit of 65 to 75 mph -lrb- 105 to 121 km -rrb- .
i think it is wrong to have a speed limit in the country , but when approaching cities , people need to slow down for obvious reasons .
in 2003 , i was in bavaria and there were enough slowdowns due to road repairs that a speed limit would have had no effect . - david worsham , us i applaud bremen 's move to implement speed limits . - horst reil , us i do n't approve of nationwide speed limits for germany .
the autobahn is an icon of germany , and car enthusiasts worldwide are in awe of it .
where else can a porsche owner test the limits of their vehicle on a highway ?
the autobahn is very safe and efforts must be made to keep only qualified drivers using it .
pollution can be combated with the switch to hydrogen cars . - brandenn torkelson , us compiled by dw staff -lrb- ot -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de society -pipe- 11.04.2008 ' 68 movement brought lasting changes to german society großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : 1968 student movement leader rudi dutschke forty years after the assassination attempt on the leader of the 1968 student movement , rudi dutschke , germany is looking back at a time when young people demanded societal change - and went on the streets to get it . rebellion rolled through the streets of germany in 1968 as students and other protestors set out to turn german society upside down through a strategy of " continual revolt . "
they were enraged that former nazis held powerful positions in society , incensed over legal reforms they deemed undemocratic and angry they did n't have more of a say in running their universities . " it was a revolutionary period that aimed to create a better world , " wolfgang bittner , a former lawyer and now writer in cologne , told dw-world.de. the 66-year-old said he was " politicized " during that time as a university student . " we students felt the leaden weight of antiquated , bourgeois german society - the complacency of it , " he said . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : rudi 's legend lives on one of the spearheads of the student movement that formed as a reaction to that sentiment was rudi dutschke - an eloquent and charismatic leader and head of the socialist students union . for thousands , dutschke became a beacon for change . he was shot in west berlin on april 11 , 1968 , by josef bachmann , a laborer and sometimes burglar with alleged right-wing sympathies .
dutschke barely survived the bullets to his brain , and suffered health problems for the rest of his life , eventually dying as a result of his injuries 11 years later . students at the time blamed conservative media for stoking hatred against dutschke .
they resented the bild tabloid 's smear campaign against him and the 68ers , as those of the movement were called , believing it played a role in convincing bachmann to attempt murder . brought in the new günter wallraff , 65 , a journalist and filmmaker known nationwide for his crusades against corporate injustice , said the 1968 movement brought about changes that many people now take for granted . " the double standards for men and women in society were exposed then , greater rights and freedom for women and children were created , more power to students for democratic representation , sexual liberalization - the 1968 generation prompted all of that , " he said . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : us singer joan baez during a 1967 vietnam war protest " new life was breathed into society at the time , " he said , pointing to dramatic shifts in literature , music and design as well . but many students wanted more and had set their sights beyond germany 's borders .
besides being anti-authoritarian , they were also largely anti-american .
they opposed the us war in vietnam and chanted the name of vietnamese communist leader ho chi minh as they battled baton-wielding police during protests on berlin streets . revolt against nazi past the year 1968 saw university campuses in several countries transformed into battlegrounds for social change .
in paris , students were joined by labor unions ; people in poland and czechoslovakia demonstrated against repressive governments . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : demonstrations also rocked paris in may 1968 germans , however , had their own particular demons to battle . the students , and other left-wing protestors , opposed an older generation that accepted kurt georg kiesinger , a former member of the nazi party , as chancellor . they rejected the notion of a state led by president heinrich luebke , who held the office from 1959 to 1969 .
he had worked with architect albert speer during the nazi regime and was suspected of having designed concentration camps during world war ii . " a generation of criminals was ruling society after the war and no one talked about what they had done .
discussing their crimes was not even a part of our school lessons , " said wallraff . bittner agreed : " we saw that something dramatic had to happen . " an earlier death bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : joschka fischer , later german foreign minister , beaten on the street in april 1968 the student uprisings at the universities had begun even before the assassination attempt on dutschke . nine months earlier , in june 1967 , student benno ohnesorg was shot in the back of the head and killed by a plainclothes policeman during demonstrations in berlin protesting a visit by the shah of iran . that shooting outraged tens of thousands of students and hardened opposition against the grand coalition government of conservative christian democrat-led parties and center-left social democrats . the protestors were deeply disappointed by what they saw as the social democrats ' betrayal of socialism .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de science -pipe- 11.04.2008 germany eases stem cell restrictions großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : scientists will have more stem cell lines to choose from after months of political negotiations , german lawmakers agreed to allow broader embryonic stem cell use .
but they signaled their ambivalence by refusing to completely do away with restrictions . hundreds of stem-cell lines previously off-limits to german scientists will be made available under a law passed by a majority of germany 's lower house of parliament on friday , april 11 .
but the decision represents a compromise in a debate which has raged for months over the ethics of using embryonic stem cells for scientific research .
on friday , lawmakers debated various measures which ranged from a complete liberalization to a complete prohibition of stem-cell use before deciding on a compromise measure .
the final vote cut across party lines , with 346 german lawmakers in favor of the revision while 228 voted against it and six abstained .
researchers welcome new law bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the stem cell issue divided the german legislature german scientists had long complained that the restrictive laws put them at a disadvantage compared with their peers in other countries .
germany 's science minister , annette schavan , said reforming the law was key to fostering research in germany .
“ this is a good day for both protecting life and also for research in germany , “ schavan , of the christian democratic union , said after the vote friday . the german research foundation -lrb- dfg -rrb- , max-planck-institute , the helmholz association and the federation of german industries -lrb- bdi -rrb- also welcomed the vote . “ the changes give german researchers the chance to stay competitive internationally , ” said max planck institute president peter gruss . more options for scientists bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : stem cells are thought to offer disease-curing potential german scientists had pushed for germany to reconsider a 2002 law which imposed strict limits on the use of embryonic stem cells in medical research .
while the law banned all creation of stem cells in germany , it did allow cells produced from abroad to be imported , but only if they had been created before jan .
1 , 2002 .
scientists also had to show that the project had overwhelming significance and that no other research method could be used .
scientists had complained that tight laws prevented them from taking part in international projects using stem cell lines created after 2002 .
other european countries , such as britain and sweden , have less strict laws .
the new law allows for a more recent cut-off date of may 1 , 2007 for the import of stem-cell lines .
advocates of the change claim that it will increase the number of stem-cell lines available to german scientists from 40 to 500 .
echoes of nazi experiments ?
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : politicians voted their conscience embryonic stem cells are prized by scientists for their ability to develop into any type of cell .

nudity among the aged in the pursuit of health and wellness is positively encouraged in some places .
however , theater stages in front of large , clothed audiences are usually not among them .
if the idea of a bunch of wrinklies in their well-worn birthday suits cavorting on stage in the name of entertainment is n't enough to disturb you and give you nightmares , then imagine said oldies frolicking around in the ashes of the world trade center while wearing mickey mouse masks .
or do n't , if you value your sanity .
but this is n't some bizarre sex fetish show catering for " appreciators of the mature " on the hamburg reeperbahn .
this is high culture , german style .
the 35 oaps in the all-together form just one part of the erfurt theater 's sell-out reinterpretation of verdi 's opera , " a masked ball . "
and for those thinking that some crazy young thing has perverted a classical masterpiece just to get some cheap publicity , it may come as some surprise that the opera is actually no stranger to controversy .
original scandal pales into insignificance bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : we 'll let your imagination come up with the rest giuseppe verdi wrote the piece about the 1792 assassination of swedish king gustavus iii , who was shot while attending a masked ball .
nineteenth-century censors demanded that verdi move the opera 's setting from europe to colonial america so as not to depict the assassination of a european monarch .
while there were no geriatric genitalia on show back then , it was deemed to be quite the scandal at the time .
austrian director johann kresnik may have added more than spattering of senior skin to the modern version but he adheres to the relocation ordered by the prudes of verdi 's time and stages his bizarre take on the opera in the united states just as they would have liked .
except the post 9/11 , disney-clad ageing nudes may have caused them to rethink their priorities somewhat .
" it 's a very beautiful , poetic scene , " guy montavon , the theatre 's general manager , explained to nervous reporters when timidly questioned about the exhibitionist pensioners .
" the concept is a little critical about america , the world of america with very rich people , very poor people , with war and the excesses of american society today , " he added to general bafflement .
politician 's censorship bid outstripped by public clamor bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the real ground zero without naked old people the show has already found its 21st-century version of verdi 's censors in the form of local politician who has called for a boycott of the production .
however , theater-goers have not heeded his call .

he faces a second term of economic challenges and continuing concerns over regional separatism . the new legislature was , however , opening in a more conciliatory political atmosphere than the previous one , making it easier for spanish socialist leader zapatero to try to buttress up the economy and to seek support in the fight against the militant basque separatist group eta .
the 47-year-old was the first spanish prime minister elected in a popular vote to be reconfirmed with a simple majority in a second round of voting , after failing to win an absolute majority in the first round .
the socialists increased their number of seats by five to 169 in the 350-member parliament , but did not get an absolute majority in the elections a month ago .
zapatero had deliberately opted for a simple majority in the parliamentary vote in order to maintain his political independence from basque and catalan regionalists , whose votes could have allowed him to be elected in the first round , but who would have demanded a price for their support .
the government 's concessions to regions demanding more autonomy had earlier created divisions with the opposition conservatives , who accused zapatero of endangering the unity of spain .
growing calls for autonomy during the upcoming legislature , it is expected that the basques will attempt to stage a regional referendum on a self-government bordering on independence , which the socialists were planning to prevent by offering the region more autonomy instead .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : eta 's armed struggle has claimed lives on zapatero 's watch basque regional premier juan jose ibarretxe believes the referendum could help to end the violence associated with the basque separatist group eta , which has killed three people since negotiations between eta and madrid collapsed in 2006 .
the negotiation attempt sparked a barrage of criticism from the conservative people 's party -lrb- pp -rrb- , which slammed the government for " surrendering " to terrorists .
zapatero has resumed police crackdowns against eta and made it understood that he will not talk to the group again , a move which is expected to help to pacify the political atmosphere .
zapatero has also pledged to seek a cross-party consensus on other issues including a reform of regional financial autonomy rule , spain 's europe policy and judicial reform .
the previous legislature was marked by liberal social reforms , such as gay marriage and speedy divorce .
the issues divided the country and catholic clergymen lambasted the government at rallies in defense of the traditional family .
the government was not , however , expected to pursue other controversial reforms , such as a more liberal abortion law or the legalization of euthanasia , during the upcoming legislature .

the premier has pledged measures to soften the blow , such as an increase of public works to absorb workers from the long overheated , rapidly shrinking construction industry , which has accounted for nearly 20 per cent of spain 's gross domestic product -lrb- gdp -rrb- .
despite the general improvement in the political atmosphere , the socialists ' relations with other parties have evolved in such a way that zapatero will be able to pass laws with the support of smaller parties only on a case-by-case basis .

he faces a second term of economic challenges and continuing concerns over regional separatism . the new legislature was , however , opening in a more conciliatory political atmosphere than the previous one , making it easier for spanish socialist leader zapatero to try to buttress up the economy and to seek support in the fight against the militant basque separatist group eta .
the 47-year-old was the first spanish prime minister elected in a popular vote to be reconfirmed with a simple majority in a second round of voting , after failing to win an absolute majority in the first round .
the socialists increased their number of seats by five to 169 in the 350-member parliament , but did not get an absolute majority in the elections a month ago .
zapatero had deliberately opted for a simple majority in the parliamentary vote in order to maintain his political independence from basque and catalan regionalists , whose votes could have allowed him to be elected in the first round , but who would have demanded a price for their support .
the government 's concessions to regions demanding more autonomy had earlier created divisions with the opposition conservatives , who accused zapatero of endangering the unity of spain .
growing calls for autonomy during the upcoming legislature , it is expected that the basques will attempt to stage a regional referendum on a self-government bordering on independence , which the socialists were planning to prevent by offering the region more autonomy instead .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : eta 's armed struggle has claimed lives on zapatero 's watch basque regional premier juan jose ibarretxe believes the referendum could help to end the violence associated with the basque separatist group eta , which has killed three people since negotiations between eta and madrid collapsed in 2006 .
the negotiation attempt sparked a barrage of criticism from the conservative people 's party -lrb- pp -rrb- , which slammed the government for " surrendering " to terrorists .
zapatero has resumed police crackdowns against eta and made it understood that he will not talk to the group again , a move which is expected to help to pacify the political atmosphere .
zapatero has also pledged to seek a cross-party consensus on other issues including a reform of regional financial autonomy rule , spain 's europe policy and judicial reform .
the previous legislature was marked by liberal social reforms , such as gay marriage and speedy divorce .
the issues divided the country and catholic clergymen lambasted the government at rallies in defense of the traditional family .
the government was not , however , expected to pursue other controversial reforms , such as a more liberal abortion law or the legalization of euthanasia , during the upcoming legislature .
reversing economic downturn bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : spain 's finances are another area of concern for the pm zapatero is more concerned with the state of spain 's economy , which is expected to be hit harder than most other western countries by the global economic problems , with growth plunging from 3.8 per cent in 2007 to possibly even less than 2 per cent this year .
the premier has pledged measures to soften the blow , such as an increase of public works to absorb workers from the long overheated , rapidly shrinking construction industry , which has accounted for nearly 20 per cent of spain 's gross domestic product -lrb- gdp -rrb- .
despite the general improvement in the political atmosphere , the socialists ' relations with other parties have evolved in such a way that zapatero will be able to pass laws with the support of smaller parties only on a case-by-case basis .
previously , he had been able to rely on the far-left izquierda unida -lrb- iu -rrb- and on the catalan republican party erc for the initial part of the legislature .
no major reshuffle bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : foreign minister moratinos is likely to remain in office zapatero was expected to make relatively few changes in the composition of his government , retaining his popular deputy maria teresa fernandez de la vega , as well as pedro solbes as economics minister , miguel angel moratinos as foreign minister and alfredo perez rubalcaba as interior minister .
zapatero , who appointed spain 's first half-female cabinet , was expected to give the defense portfolio to a woman , possibly to elena salgado , who held the health and then the public administration portfolio in the previous government .
the premier was due to announce the composition of the new government after being sworn in by king juan carlos on saturday . dw staff / dpa -lrb- nda -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

yet the winner could be a familiar face : former prime minister and media tycoon silvio berlusconi . berlusconi is so confident of his lead in the polls that he spent his recent campaign rallies acting as if he 's already won the weekend election .
but his main rival , former rome mayor walter veltroni , promised that the center-right politician will be in for a nasty surprise after votes are counted .
veltroni spent the last days of the campaign criss-crossing italy in a bus , attempting to shave away berlusconi 's lead , which the last polls held two weeks ago put at 6 percentage points .
both men made impassioned pleas to supporters in the final days of their campaigns .
berlusconi , a 71-year-old self-made billionaire , urged his supporters to help him win over undecided voters ahead of elections sunday , april 13 and monday , april 14 .
veltroni , 52 , told voters on friday that berlusconi was " no statesman " and promised an upset .
veltroni has also been hammering away at berlusconi 's economic record , accusing him of making poor economic decisions .
slowing economy an election issue bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : election fatigue is reportedly high among voters italy 's next prime minister will have to contend with the country 's sputtering economy .
italy faces not only a sharp economic slowdown , but also record-high inflation and low wages .
the international monetary fund expects italy 's economy , the euro zone 's third largest , to grow just 0.3 percent this year .
the two candidates offered similar economic platforms with both pledging tax cuts and reduced government spending .
alexander kockerbeck , a senior credit officer at moody 's investors service , said the targets set by the two main candidates would be difficult to achieve without a clear election mandate .
" if the outcome -lrb- of the vote -rrb- is unclear , the risk is a delay in carrying out necessary reforms , " kockerbeck told reuters news agency .
fed up with politicians bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : vetroni thinks he can pull off an upset italy 's political class is viewed by much of the population as corrupt , incompetent and gridlocked . voters have been appalled by the trash piled on the streets of naples and toxins in the country 's beloved buffalo mozzarella cheese .
" anything politicians touch , it 's the kiss of death , the opposite of king midas , " bocconi university professor carlo alberto carnevale-maffe told reuters .
berlusconi was head of the government between 2001 and 2006 .
he owns a media empire which includes three of italy 's seven national television networks .
implicated in a string of corruption probes , berlusconi has been criticized for running up a budget deficit equal to 4.4 percent of gross domestic product -lrb- gdp -rrb- during his second premiership .
since being forced out of power in 2006 , he has lobbed scorn from the sidelines as his political opponents have struggled to keep a fractious coalition together .
the government of prime minister romano prodi collapsed in january when a small centrist party withdrew its support .
worries of a tie bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : even mozarella has been tained by politics veltroni predicted a surprise win for his center-left party , saying voters were " way ahead of politics , newspapers and polls . "
" you 'll see that on april 13 we 'll have some surprises , " veltroni said .
even with the lead enjoyed by berlusconi 's pdl party , the senate race , where votes are determined by region , is expected to be tight .
some analysts have warned that if no party or coalition emerges with a clear-cut majority in the senate , italy could be in danger of having a " hung parliament " which would be unable to govern .
" the electoral campaign ends today with the ever more burdensome specter of a result that is not called for in politics : a tie , " the daily la stampa newspaper said in an editorial .
berlusconi wants clear mandate bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the naples trash scandal was a political lowpoint analysts have predicted a lower turnout than in 2006 , when nearly 84 per cent of eligible voters cast ballots in what turned out to be the closest election in modern italian history .
berlusconi tried to prevent a close race at his final campaign rallies , urging supporters to the polls .
" go and convert people , " berlusconi told supporters at one of his last election rallies outside rome 's coliseum .
" it 's important .
you have missionary work to do towards all the undecided voters .
you are the missionaries of truth and freedom , " berlusconi said , his voice hoarse from non-stop campaigning .
berlusconi also accused veltroni of a " campaign of lies " and his party of being communists in disguise .
veltroni , a movie buff and one-time journalist , was a communist in the 1970s , but eventually became a social democrat .

" russia will take unambiguous action toward ensuring its interests along its borders , " he said .
" these will not only be military steps , but also steps of a different character . "
moscow lobbied hard to head off georgia and ukraine 's ambition for membership at last month 's nato summit in bucharest , but alliance leaders intend to review their bid in december .
nato turned down georgia and ukraine 's applications for membership action plans - a stepping stone to membership - but , under pressure from washington , one of the strongest advocates of enlargement in the alliance , the alliance did say both would eventually become nato members .
russian foreign minister sergei lavrov said earlier this week that moscow will do everything it can to prevent the two countries , run by pro-western governments , from becoming nato members .
russia will do everything to prevent accession bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : putin and lavrov did n't like what they heard in bucharest " we will do all we can to prevent ukraine 's and georgia 's accession into nato and to avoid an inevitable serious exacerbation of our relations with both the alliance and our neighbors , " lavrov told reporters .
russia opposes the plan to grant membership on the grounds that such a move would pose a direct threat to its security and endanger the fragile balance of forces in europe .
it also sees nato 's willingness to enlarge eastward as the continuation of the western cold war containment policy and the spread of a foreign military bloc along its border .
president vladimir putin said in february that russia would consider directing its missiles at ukraine if the neighboring state ever hosted nato military installations .
russia 's fears have also been stoked by plans by the united states to install interceptor missiles and radar stations in poland and the czech republic as part of a wider missile defense shield designed to protect the us from attack by rogue states such as iran and north korea .
lavrov warned earlier this week that states hosting parts of a us missile defense shield also risked facing a military response if moscow 's security concerns were not met .
demands for presence at missile shield installations bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : russia wants to be involved in any missile plans the us has the russian foreign minister demanded that the russian military be allowed a " permanent presence " at the planned us missile interceptor base in poland and the radar site in the czech republic , threatening that russia would otherwise consider " measures of military-technical character . "
the threat put paid to the united states and its partners hopes of a shift in russia 's negative attitude after a big us push for compromise at last week 's nato summit and in one-on-one talks between president george w. bush and putin .
russia is also said to have been angered by bush 's pressuring of european members of nato to openly support ukraine and georgia 's nato bid despite being told by german chancellor angela merkel that the topic was " off the table " for the time being at the meeting in bucharest .
germany , france fear destabilization bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : sarkozy and merkel were angered by pressure from bush while bush was forced into agreeing on a delay by merkel and french president nicolas sarkozy , who fear a rash move to install the two former soviet states as nato members could destabilize an already volatile region on russia 's southern flank , his insistence was not lost on russian observers .
however , general baluyevsky said it was too early to talk about ukrainian or georgian entry into nato .

" russia will take unambiguous action toward ensuring its interests along its borders , " he said .
" these will not only be military steps , but also steps of a different character . "
moscow lobbied hard to head off georgia and ukraine 's ambition for membership at last month 's nato summit in bucharest , but alliance leaders intend to review their bid in december .
nato turned down georgia and ukraine 's applications for membership action plans - a stepping stone to membership - but , under pressure from washington , one of the strongest advocates of enlargement in the alliance , the alliance did say both would eventually become nato members .
russian foreign minister sergei lavrov said earlier this week that moscow will do everything it can to prevent the two countries , run by pro-western governments , from becoming nato members .
russia will do everything to prevent accession bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : putin and lavrov did n't like what they heard in bucharest " we will do all we can to prevent ukraine 's and georgia 's accession into nato and to avoid an inevitable serious exacerbation of our relations with both the alliance and our neighbors , " lavrov told reporters .
russia opposes the plan to grant membership on the grounds that such a move would pose a direct threat to its security and endanger the fragile balance of forces in europe .
it also sees nato 's willingness to enlarge eastward as the continuation of the western cold war containment policy and the spread of a foreign military bloc along its border .
president vladimir putin said in february that russia would consider directing its missiles at ukraine if the neighboring state ever hosted nato military installations .
russia 's fears have also been stoked by plans by the united states to install interceptor missiles and radar stations in poland and the czech republic as part of a wider missile defense shield designed to protect the us from attack by rogue states such as iran and north korea .
lavrov warned earlier this week that states hosting parts of a us missile defense shield also risked facing a military response if moscow 's security concerns were not met .
demands for presence at missile shield installations bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : russia wants to be involved in any missile plans the us has the russian foreign minister demanded that the russian military be allowed a " permanent presence " at the planned us missile interceptor base in poland and the radar site in the czech republic , threatening that russia would otherwise consider " measures of military-technical character . "
the threat put paid to the united states and its partners hopes of a shift in russia 's negative attitude after a big us push for compromise at last week 's nato summit and in one-on-one talks between president george w. bush and putin .
russia is also said to have been angered by bush 's pressuring of european members of nato to openly support ukraine and georgia 's nato bid despite being told by german chancellor angela merkel that the topic was " off the table " for the time being at the meeting in bucharest .

however , general baluyevsky said it was too early to talk about ukrainian or georgian entry into nato .

yet the winner could be a familiar face : former prime minister and media tycoon silvio berlusconi . berlusconi is so confident of his lead in the polls that he spent his recent campaign rallies acting as if he 's already won the weekend election .
but his main rival , former rome mayor walter veltroni , promised that the center-right politician will be in for a nasty surprise after votes are counted .
veltroni spent the last days of the campaign criss-crossing italy in a bus , attempting to shave away berlusconi 's lead , which the last polls held two weeks ago put at 6 percentage points .
both men made impassioned pleas to supporters in the final days of their campaigns .
berlusconi , a 71-year-old self-made billionaire , urged his supporters to help him win over undecided voters ahead of elections sunday , april 13 and monday , april 14 .
veltroni , 52 , told voters on friday that berlusconi was " no statesman " and promised an upset .
veltroni has also been hammering away at berlusconi 's economic record , accusing him of making poor economic decisions .
slowing economy an election issue bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : election fatigue is reportedly high among voters italy 's next prime minister will have to contend with the country 's sputtering economy .
italy faces not only a sharp economic slowdown , but also record-high inflation and low wages .
the international monetary fund expects italy 's economy , the euro zone 's third largest , to grow just 0.3 percent this year .
the two candidates offered similar economic platforms with both pledging tax cuts and reduced government spending .
alexander kockerbeck , a senior credit officer at moody 's investors service , said the targets set by the two main candidates would be difficult to achieve without a clear election mandate .
" if the outcome -lrb- of the vote -rrb- is unclear , the risk is a delay in carrying out necessary reforms , " kockerbeck told reuters news agency .
fed up with politicians bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : vetroni thinks he can pull off an upset italy 's political class is viewed by much of the population as corrupt , incompetent and gridlocked . voters have been appalled by the trash piled on the streets of naples and toxins in the country 's beloved buffalo mozzarella cheese .
" anything politicians touch , it 's the kiss of death , the opposite of king midas , " bocconi university professor carlo alberto carnevale-maffe told reuters .
berlusconi was head of the government between 2001 and 2006 .
he owns a media empire which includes three of italy 's seven national television networks .
implicated in a string of corruption probes , berlusconi has been criticized for running up a budget deficit equal to 4.4 percent of gross domestic product -lrb- gdp -rrb- during his second premiership .
since being forced out of power in 2006 , he has lobbed scorn from the sidelines as his political opponents have struggled to keep a fractious coalition together .
the government of prime minister romano prodi collapsed in january when a small centrist party withdrew its support .
worries of a tie bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : even mozarella has been tained by politics veltroni predicted a surprise win for his center-left party , saying voters were " way ahead of politics , newspapers and polls . "
" you 'll see that on april 13 we 'll have some surprises , " veltroni said .
even with the lead enjoyed by berlusconi 's pdl party , the senate race , where votes are determined by region , is expected to be tight .
some analysts have warned that if no party or coalition emerges with a clear-cut majority in the senate , italy could be in danger of having a " hung parliament " which would be unable to govern .
" the electoral campaign ends today with the ever more burdensome specter of a result that is not called for in politics : a tie , " the daily la stampa newspaper said in an editorial .
berlusconi wants clear mandate bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the naples trash scandal was a political lowpoint analysts have predicted a lower turnout than in 2006 , when nearly 84 per cent of eligible voters cast ballots in what turned out to be the closest election in modern italian history .
berlusconi tried to prevent a close race at his final campaign rallies , urging supporters to the polls .
" go and convert people , " berlusconi told supporters at one of his last election rallies outside rome 's coliseum .
" it 's important .
you have missionary work to do towards all the undecided voters .
you are the missionaries of truth and freedom , " berlusconi said , his voice hoarse from non-stop campaigning .
berlusconi also accused veltroni of a " campaign of lies " and his party of being communists in disguise .
veltroni , a movie buff and one-time journalist , was a communist in the 1970s , but eventually became a social democrat .

" russia will take unambiguous action toward ensuring its interests along its borders , " he said .
" these will not only be military steps , but also steps of a different character . "
moscow lobbied hard to head off georgia and ukraine 's ambition for membership at last month 's nato summit in bucharest , but alliance leaders intend to review their bid in december .
nato turned down georgia and ukraine 's applications for membership action plans - a stepping stone to membership - but , under pressure from washington , one of the strongest advocates of enlargement in the alliance , the alliance did say both would eventually become nato members .
russian foreign minister sergei lavrov said earlier this week that moscow will do everything it can to prevent the two countries , run by pro-western governments , from becoming nato members .
russia will do everything to prevent accession bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : putin and lavrov did n't like what they heard in bucharest " we will do all we can to prevent ukraine 's and georgia 's accession into nato and to avoid an inevitable serious exacerbation of our relations with both the alliance and our neighbors , " lavrov told reporters .
russia opposes the plan to grant membership on the grounds that such a move would pose a direct threat to its security and endanger the fragile balance of forces in europe .
it also sees nato 's willingness to enlarge eastward as the continuation of the western cold war containment policy and the spread of a foreign military bloc along its border .
president vladimir putin said in february that russia would consider directing its missiles at ukraine if the neighboring state ever hosted nato military installations .
russia 's fears have also been stoked by plans by the united states to install interceptor missiles and radar stations in poland and the czech republic as part of a wider missile defense shield designed to protect the us from attack by rogue states such as iran and north korea .
lavrov warned earlier this week that states hosting parts of a us missile defense shield also risked facing a military response if moscow 's security concerns were not met .
demands for presence at missile shield installations bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : russia wants to be involved in any missile plans the us has the russian foreign minister demanded that the russian military be allowed a " permanent presence " at the planned us missile interceptor base in poland and the radar site in the czech republic , threatening that russia would otherwise consider " measures of military-technical character . "
the threat put paid to the united states and its partners hopes of a shift in russia 's negative attitude after a big us push for compromise at last week 's nato summit and in one-on-one talks between president george w. bush and putin .
russia is also said to have been angered by bush 's pressuring of european members of nato to openly support ukraine and georgia 's nato bid despite being told by german chancellor angela merkel that the topic was " off the table " for the time being at the meeting in bucharest .
germany , france fear destabilization bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : sarkozy and merkel were angered by pressure from bush while bush was forced into agreeing on a delay by merkel and french president nicolas sarkozy , who fear a rash move to install the two former soviet states as nato members could destabilize an already volatile region on russia 's southern flank , his insistence was not lost on russian observers .
however , general baluyevsky said it was too early to talk about ukrainian or georgian entry into nato .
" the population of ukraine is unambiguously against entry to nato despite the so-called referendum in georgia where seventy percent of the population supported the idea , ” he said .

nudity among the aged in the pursuit of health and wellness is positively encouraged in some places .
however , theater stages in front of large , clothed audiences are usually not among them .
if the idea of a bunch of wrinklies in their well-worn birthday suits cavorting on stage in the name of entertainment is n't enough to disturb you and give you nightmares , then imagine said oldies frolicking around in the ashes of the world trade center while wearing mickey mouse masks .

this is high culture , german style .
the 35 oaps in the all-together form just one part of the erfurt theater 's sell-out reinterpretation of verdi 's opera , " a masked ball . "
and for those thinking that some crazy young thing has perverted a classical masterpiece just to get some cheap publicity , it may come as some surprise that the opera is actually no stranger to controversy .
original scandal pales into insignificance bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : we 'll let your imagination come up with the rest giuseppe verdi wrote the piece about the 1792 assassination of swedish king gustavus iii , who was shot while attending a masked ball .
nineteenth-century censors demanded that verdi move the opera 's setting from europe to colonial america so as not to depict the assassination of a european monarch .
while there were no geriatric genitalia on show back then , it was deemed to be quite the scandal at the time .
austrian director johann kresnik may have added more than spattering of senior skin to the modern version but he adheres to the relocation ordered by the prudes of verdi 's time and stages his bizarre take on the opera in the united states just as they would have liked .
except the post 9/11 , disney-clad ageing nudes may have caused them to rethink their priorities somewhat .
" it 's a very beautiful , poetic scene , " guy montavon , the theatre 's general manager , explained to nervous reporters when timidly questioned about the exhibitionist pensioners .
" the concept is a little critical about america , the world of america with very rich people , very poor people , with war and the excesses of american society today , " he added to general bafflement .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de nato -pipe- 11.04.2008 russia talks tough in response to nato 's eastward expansion großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : nato intends to give eventual membership to russian neighbors ukraine and georgia russia 's determination to protect its borders took a bellicose turn friday , april 11 , when a top army general vowed to take military action if nato expands east to include its former soviet neighbors georgia and ukraine . in a reported published by the interfax news agency , general yuri baluyevsky was quoted as saying that russia was considering the possibility of taking military and other steps along its borders if the two countries became part of the organization .
" russia will take unambiguous action toward ensuring its interests along its borders , " he said .
" these will not only be military steps , but also steps of a different character . "
moscow lobbied hard to head off georgia and ukraine 's ambition for membership at last month 's nato summit in bucharest , but alliance leaders intend to review their bid in december .
nato turned down georgia and ukraine 's applications for membership action plans - a stepping stone to membership - but , under pressure from washington , one of the strongest advocates of enlargement in the alliance , the alliance did say both would eventually become nato members .
russian foreign minister sergei lavrov said earlier this week that moscow will do everything it can to prevent the two countries , run by pro-western governments , from becoming nato members .
russia will do everything to prevent accession bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : putin and lavrov did n't like what they heard in bucharest " we will do all we can to prevent ukraine 's and georgia 's accession into nato and to avoid an inevitable serious exacerbation of our relations with both the alliance and our neighbors , " lavrov told reporters .
russia opposes the plan to grant membership on the grounds that such a move would pose a direct threat to its security and endanger the fragile balance of forces in europe .
it also sees nato 's willingness to enlarge eastward as the continuation of the western cold war containment policy and the spread of a foreign military bloc along its border .
president vladimir putin said in february that russia would consider directing its missiles at ukraine if the neighboring state ever hosted nato military installations .
russia 's fears have also been stoked by plans by the united states to install interceptor missiles and radar stations in poland and the czech republic as part of a wider missile defense shield designed to protect the us from attack by rogue states such as iran and north korea .
lavrov warned earlier this week that states hosting parts of a us missile defense shield also risked facing a military response if moscow 's security concerns were not met .
demands for presence at missile shield installations bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : russia wants to be involved in any missile plans the us has the russian foreign minister demanded that the russian military be allowed a " permanent presence " at the planned us missile interceptor base in poland and the radar site in the czech republic , threatening that russia would otherwise consider " measures of military-technical character . "
the threat put paid to the united states and its partners hopes of a shift in russia 's negative attitude after a big us push for compromise at last week 's nato summit and in one-on-one talks between president george w. bush and putin .
russia is also said to have been angered by bush 's pressuring of european members of nato to openly support ukraine and georgia 's nato bid despite being told by german chancellor angela merkel that the topic was " off the table " for the time being at the meeting in bucharest .
germany , france fear destabilization bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : sarkozy and merkel were angered by pressure from bush while bush was forced into agreeing on a delay by merkel and french president nicolas sarkozy , who fear a rash move to install the two former soviet states as nato members could destabilize an already volatile region on russia 's southern flank , his insistence was not lost on russian observers .
however , general baluyevsky said it was too early to talk about ukrainian or georgian entry into nato .
" the population of ukraine is unambiguously against entry to nato despite the so-called referendum in georgia where seventy percent of the population supported the idea , ” he said .

yet the winner could be a familiar face : former prime minister and media tycoon silvio berlusconi . berlusconi is so confident of his lead in the polls that he spent his recent campaign rallies acting as if he 's already won the weekend election .
but his main rival , former rome mayor walter veltroni , promised that the center-right politician will be in for a nasty surprise after votes are counted .
veltroni spent the last days of the campaign criss-crossing italy in a bus , attempting to shave away berlusconi 's lead , which the last polls held two weeks ago put at 6 percentage points .
both men made impassioned pleas to supporters in the final days of their campaigns .
berlusconi , a 71-year-old self-made billionaire , urged his supporters to help him win over undecided voters ahead of elections sunday , april 13 and monday , april 14 .
veltroni , 52 , told voters on friday that berlusconi was " no statesman " and promised an upset .
veltroni has also been hammering away at berlusconi 's economic record , accusing him of making poor economic decisions .
slowing economy an election issue bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : election fatigue is reportedly high among voters italy 's next prime minister will have to contend with the country 's sputtering economy .
italy faces not only a sharp economic slowdown , but also record-high inflation and low wages .
the international monetary fund expects italy 's economy , the euro zone 's third largest , to grow just 0.3 percent this year .
the two candidates offered similar economic platforms with both pledging tax cuts and reduced government spending .
alexander kockerbeck , a senior credit officer at moody 's investors service , said the targets set by the two main candidates would be difficult to achieve without a clear election mandate .
" if the outcome -lrb- of the vote -rrb- is unclear , the risk is a delay in carrying out necessary reforms , " kockerbeck told reuters news agency .

" anything politicians touch , it 's the kiss of death , the opposite of king midas , " bocconi university professor carlo alberto carnevale-maffe told reuters .
berlusconi was head of the government between 2001 and 2006 .
he owns a media empire which includes three of italy 's seven national television networks .
implicated in a string of corruption probes , berlusconi has been criticized for running up a budget deficit equal to 4.4 percent of gross domestic product -lrb- gdp -rrb- during his second premiership .
since being forced out of power in 2006 , he has lobbed scorn from the sidelines as his political opponents have struggled to keep a fractious coalition together .
the government of prime minister romano prodi collapsed in january when a small centrist party withdrew its support .
worries of a tie bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : even mozarella has been tained by politics veltroni predicted a surprise win for his center-left party , saying voters were " way ahead of politics , newspapers and polls . "
" you 'll see that on april 13 we 'll have some surprises , " veltroni said .
even with the lead enjoyed by berlusconi 's pdl party , the senate race , where votes are determined by region , is expected to be tight .
some analysts have warned that if no party or coalition emerges with a clear-cut majority in the senate , italy could be in danger of having a " hung parliament " which would be unable to govern .
" the electoral campaign ends today with the ever more burdensome specter of a result that is not called for in politics : a tie , " the daily la stampa newspaper said in an editorial .
berlusconi wants clear mandate bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the naples trash scandal was a political lowpoint analysts have predicted a lower turnout than in 2006 , when nearly 84 per cent of eligible voters cast ballots in what turned out to be the closest election in modern italian history .
berlusconi tried to prevent a close race at his final campaign rallies , urging supporters to the polls .
" go and convert people , " berlusconi told supporters at one of his last election rallies outside rome 's coliseum .
" it 's important .
you have missionary work to do towards all the undecided voters .
you are the missionaries of truth and freedom , " berlusconi said , his voice hoarse from non-stop campaigning .
berlusconi also accused veltroni of a " campaign of lies " and his party of being communists in disguise .
veltroni , a movie buff and one-time journalist , was a communist in the 1970s , but eventually became a social democrat .

worries of a tie bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : even mozarella has been tained by politics veltroni predicted a surprise win for his center-left party , saying voters were " way ahead of politics , newspapers and polls . "
" you 'll see that on april 13 we 'll have some surprises , " veltroni said .
even with the lead enjoyed by berlusconi 's pdl party , the senate race , where votes are determined by region , is expected to be tight .
some analysts have warned that if no party or coalition emerges with a clear-cut majority in the senate , italy could be in danger of having a " hung parliament " which would be unable to govern .
" the electoral campaign ends today with the ever more burdensome specter of a result that is not called for in politics : a tie , " the daily la stampa newspaper said in an editorial .
berlusconi wants clear mandate bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the naples trash scandal was a political lowpoint analysts have predicted a lower turnout than in 2006 , when nearly 84 per cent of eligible voters cast ballots in what turned out to be the closest election in modern italian history .

" go and convert people , " berlusconi told supporters at one of his last election rallies outside rome 's coliseum .
" it 's important .
you have missionary work to do towards all the undecided voters .
you are the missionaries of truth and freedom , " berlusconi said , his voice hoarse from non-stop campaigning .
berlusconi also accused veltroni of a " campaign of lies " and his party of being communists in disguise .
veltroni , a movie buff and one-time journalist , was a communist in the 1970s , but eventually became a social democrat .

" russia will take unambiguous action toward ensuring its interests along its borders , " he said .
" these will not only be military steps , but also steps of a different character . "
moscow lobbied hard to head off georgia and ukraine 's ambition for membership at last month 's nato summit in bucharest , but alliance leaders intend to review their bid in december .
nato turned down georgia and ukraine 's applications for membership action plans - a stepping stone to membership - but , under pressure from washington , one of the strongest advocates of enlargement in the alliance , the alliance did say both would eventually become nato members .
russian foreign minister sergei lavrov said earlier this week that moscow will do everything it can to prevent the two countries , run by pro-western governments , from becoming nato members .
russia will do everything to prevent accession bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : putin and lavrov did n't like what they heard in bucharest " we will do all we can to prevent ukraine 's and georgia 's accession into nato and to avoid an inevitable serious exacerbation of our relations with both the alliance and our neighbors , " lavrov told reporters .
russia opposes the plan to grant membership on the grounds that such a move would pose a direct threat to its security and endanger the fragile balance of forces in europe .
it also sees nato 's willingness to enlarge eastward as the continuation of the western cold war containment policy and the spread of a foreign military bloc along its border .
president vladimir putin said in february that russia would consider directing its missiles at ukraine if the neighboring state ever hosted nato military installations .
russia 's fears have also been stoked by plans by the united states to install interceptor missiles and radar stations in poland and the czech republic as part of a wider missile defense shield designed to protect the us from attack by rogue states such as iran and north korea .
lavrov warned earlier this week that states hosting parts of a us missile defense shield also risked facing a military response if moscow 's security concerns were not met .
demands for presence at missile shield installations bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : russia wants to be involved in any missile plans the us has the russian foreign minister demanded that the russian military be allowed a " permanent presence " at the planned us missile interceptor base in poland and the radar site in the czech republic , threatening that russia would otherwise consider " measures of military-technical character . "
the threat put paid to the united states and its partners hopes of a shift in russia 's negative attitude after a big us push for compromise at last week 's nato summit and in one-on-one talks between president george w. bush and putin .
russia is also said to have been angered by bush 's pressuring of european members of nato to openly support ukraine and georgia 's nato bid despite being told by german chancellor angela merkel that the topic was " off the table " for the time being at the meeting in bucharest .
germany , france fear destabilization bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : sarkozy and merkel were angered by pressure from bush while bush was forced into agreeing on a delay by merkel and french president nicolas sarkozy , who fear a rash move to install the two former soviet states as nato members could destabilize an already volatile region on russia 's southern flank , his insistence was not lost on russian observers .
however , general baluyevsky said it was too early to talk about ukrainian or georgian entry into nato .
" the population of ukraine is unambiguously against entry to nato despite the so-called referendum in georgia where seventy percent of the population supported the idea , ” he said .

president vladimir putin said in february that russia would consider directing its missiles at ukraine if the neighboring state ever hosted nato military installations .
russia 's fears have also been stoked by plans by the united states to install interceptor missiles and radar stations in poland and the czech republic as part of a wider missile defense shield designed to protect the us from attack by rogue states such as iran and north korea .
lavrov warned earlier this week that states hosting parts of a us missile defense shield also risked facing a military response if moscow 's security concerns were not met .

"
the threat put paid to the united states and its partners hopes of a shift in russia 's negative attitude after a big us push for compromise at last week 's nato summit and in one-on-one talks between president george w. bush and putin .
russia is also said to have been angered by bush 's pressuring of european members of nato to openly support ukraine and georgia 's nato bid despite being told by german chancellor angela merkel that the topic was " off the table " for the time being at the meeting in bucharest .

" russia will take unambiguous action toward ensuring its interests along its borders , " he said .
" these will not only be military steps , but also steps of a different character . "
moscow lobbied hard to head off georgia and ukraine 's ambition for membership at last month 's nato summit in bucharest , but alliance leaders intend to review their bid in december .
nato turned down georgia and ukraine 's applications for membership action plans - a stepping stone to membership - but , under pressure from washington , one of the strongest advocates of enlargement in the alliance , the alliance did say both would eventually become nato members .
russian foreign minister sergei lavrov said earlier this week that moscow will do everything it can to prevent the two countries , run by pro-western governments , from becoming nato members .
russia will do everything to prevent accession bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : putin and lavrov did n't like what they heard in bucharest " we will do all we can to prevent ukraine 's and georgia 's accession into nato and to avoid an inevitable serious exacerbation of our relations with both the alliance and our neighbors , " lavrov told reporters .
russia opposes the plan to grant membership on the grounds that such a move would pose a direct threat to its security and endanger the fragile balance of forces in europe .
it also sees nato 's willingness to enlarge eastward as the continuation of the western cold war containment policy and the spread of a foreign military bloc along its border .

while there were no geriatric genitalia on show back then , it was deemed to be quite the scandal at the time .
austrian director johann kresnik may have added more than spattering of senior skin to the modern version but he adheres to the relocation ordered by the prudes of verdi 's time and stages his bizarre take on the opera in the united states just as they would have liked .

" it 's a very beautiful , poetic scene , " guy montavon , the theatre 's general manager , explained to nervous reporters when timidly questioned about the exhibitionist pensioners .

he faces a second term of economic challenges and continuing concerns over regional separatism . the new legislature was , however , opening in a more conciliatory political atmosphere than the previous one , making it easier for spanish socialist leader zapatero to try to buttress up the economy and to seek support in the fight against the militant basque separatist group eta .
the 47-year-old was the first spanish prime minister elected in a popular vote to be reconfirmed with a simple majority in a second round of voting , after failing to win an absolute majority in the first round .
the socialists increased their number of seats by five to 169 in the 350-member parliament , but did not get an absolute majority in the elections a month ago .
zapatero had deliberately opted for a simple majority in the parliamentary vote in order to maintain his political independence from basque and catalan regionalists , whose votes could have allowed him to be elected in the first round , but who would have demanded a price for their support .
the government 's concessions to regions demanding more autonomy had earlier created divisions with the opposition conservatives , who accused zapatero of endangering the unity of spain .
growing calls for autonomy during the upcoming legislature , it is expected that the basques will attempt to stage a regional referendum on a self-government bordering on independence , which the socialists were planning to prevent by offering the region more autonomy instead .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : eta 's armed struggle has claimed lives on zapatero 's watch basque regional premier juan jose ibarretxe believes the referendum could help to end the violence associated with the basque separatist group eta , which has killed three people since negotiations between eta and madrid collapsed in 2006 .
the negotiation attempt sparked a barrage of criticism from the conservative people 's party -lrb- pp -rrb- , which slammed the government for " surrendering " to terrorists .
zapatero has resumed police crackdowns against eta and made it understood that he will not talk to the group again , a move which is expected to help to pacify the political atmosphere .
zapatero has also pledged to seek a cross-party consensus on other issues including a reform of regional financial autonomy rule , spain 's europe policy and judicial reform .
the previous legislature was marked by liberal social reforms , such as gay marriage and speedy divorce .
the issues divided the country and catholic clergymen lambasted the government at rallies in defense of the traditional family .
the government was not , however , expected to pursue other controversial reforms , such as a more liberal abortion law or the legalization of euthanasia , during the upcoming legislature .
reversing economic downturn bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : spain 's finances are another area of concern for the pm zapatero is more concerned with the state of spain 's economy , which is expected to be hit harder than most other western countries by the global economic problems , with growth plunging from 3.8 per cent in 2007 to possibly even less than 2 per cent this year .
the premier has pledged measures to soften the blow , such as an increase of public works to absorb workers from the long overheated , rapidly shrinking construction industry , which has accounted for nearly 20 per cent of spain 's gross domestic product -lrb- gdp -rrb- .
despite the general improvement in the political atmosphere , the socialists ' relations with other parties have evolved in such a way that zapatero will be able to pass laws with the support of smaller parties only on a case-by-case basis .
previously , he had been able to rely on the far-left izquierda unida -lrb- iu -rrb- and on the catalan republican party erc for the initial part of the legislature .

zapatero , who appointed spain 's first half-female cabinet , was expected to give the defense portfolio to a woman , possibly to elena salgado , who held the health and then the public administration portfolio in the previous government .

he faces a second term of economic challenges and continuing concerns over regional separatism . the new legislature was , however , opening in a more conciliatory political atmosphere than the previous one , making it easier for spanish socialist leader zapatero to try to buttress up the economy and to seek support in the fight against the militant basque separatist group eta .
the 47-year-old was the first spanish prime minister elected in a popular vote to be reconfirmed with a simple majority in a second round of voting , after failing to win an absolute majority in the first round .
the socialists increased their number of seats by five to 169 in the 350-member parliament , but did not get an absolute majority in the elections a month ago .
zapatero had deliberately opted for a simple majority in the parliamentary vote in order to maintain his political independence from basque and catalan regionalists , whose votes could have allowed him to be elected in the first round , but who would have demanded a price for their support .
the government 's concessions to regions demanding more autonomy had earlier created divisions with the opposition conservatives , who accused zapatero of endangering the unity of spain .
growing calls for autonomy during the upcoming legislature , it is expected that the basques will attempt to stage a regional referendum on a self-government bordering on independence , which the socialists were planning to prevent by offering the region more autonomy instead .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : eta 's armed struggle has claimed lives on zapatero 's watch basque regional premier juan jose ibarretxe believes the referendum could help to end the violence associated with the basque separatist group eta , which has killed three people since negotiations between eta and madrid collapsed in 2006 .
the negotiation attempt sparked a barrage of criticism from the conservative people 's party -lrb- pp -rrb- , which slammed the government for " surrendering " to terrorists .
zapatero has resumed police crackdowns against eta and made it understood that he will not talk to the group again , a move which is expected to help to pacify the political atmosphere .
zapatero has also pledged to seek a cross-party consensus on other issues including a reform of regional financial autonomy rule , spain 's europe policy and judicial reform .
the previous legislature was marked by liberal social reforms , such as gay marriage and speedy divorce .
the issues divided the country and catholic clergymen lambasted the government at rallies in defense of the traditional family .
the government was not , however , expected to pursue other controversial reforms , such as a more liberal abortion law or the legalization of euthanasia , during the upcoming legislature .
reversing economic downturn bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : spain 's finances are another area of concern for the pm zapatero is more concerned with the state of spain 's economy , which is expected to be hit harder than most other western countries by the global economic problems , with growth plunging from 3.8 per cent in 2007 to possibly even less than 2 per cent this year .
the premier has pledged measures to soften the blow , such as an increase of public works to absorb workers from the long overheated , rapidly shrinking construction industry , which has accounted for nearly 20 per cent of spain 's gross domestic product -lrb- gdp -rrb- .
despite the general improvement in the political atmosphere , the socialists ' relations with other parties have evolved in such a way that zapatero will be able to pass laws with the support of smaller parties only on a case-by-case basis .
previously , he had been able to rely on the far-left izquierda unida -lrb- iu -rrb- and on the catalan republican party erc for the initial part of the legislature .
no major reshuffle bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : foreign minister moratinos is likely to remain in office zapatero was expected to make relatively few changes in the composition of his government , retaining his popular deputy maria teresa fernandez de la vega , as well as pedro solbes as economics minister , miguel angel moratinos as foreign minister and alfredo perez rubalcaba as interior minister .
zapatero , who appointed spain 's first half-female cabinet , was expected to give the defense portfolio to a woman , possibly to elena salgado , who held the health and then the public administration portfolio in the previous government .

" russia will take unambiguous action toward ensuring its interests along its borders , " he said .
" these will not only be military steps , but also steps of a different character . "
moscow lobbied hard to head off georgia and ukraine 's ambition for membership at last month 's nato summit in bucharest , but alliance leaders intend to review their bid in december .
nato turned down georgia and ukraine 's applications for membership action plans - a stepping stone to membership - but , under pressure from washington , one of the strongest advocates of enlargement in the alliance , the alliance did say both would eventually become nato members .
russian foreign minister sergei lavrov said earlier this week that moscow will do everything it can to prevent the two countries , run by pro-western governments , from becoming nato members .
russia will do everything to prevent accession bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : putin and lavrov did n't like what they heard in bucharest " we will do all we can to prevent ukraine 's and georgia 's accession into nato and to avoid an inevitable serious exacerbation of our relations with both the alliance and our neighbors , " lavrov told reporters .
russia opposes the plan to grant membership on the grounds that such a move would pose a direct threat to its security and endanger the fragile balance of forces in europe .
it also sees nato 's willingness to enlarge eastward as the continuation of the western cold war containment policy and the spread of a foreign military bloc along its border .
president vladimir putin said in february that russia would consider directing its missiles at ukraine if the neighboring state ever hosted nato military installations .
russia 's fears have also been stoked by plans by the united states to install interceptor missiles and radar stations in poland and the czech republic as part of a wider missile defense shield designed to protect the us from attack by rogue states such as iran and north korea .
lavrov warned earlier this week that states hosting parts of a us missile defense shield also risked facing a military response if moscow 's security concerns were not met .
demands for presence at missile shield installations bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : russia wants to be involved in any missile plans the us has the russian foreign minister demanded that the russian military be allowed a " permanent presence " at the planned us missile interceptor base in poland and the radar site in the czech republic , threatening that russia would otherwise consider " measures of military-technical character . "
the threat put paid to the united states and its partners hopes of a shift in russia 's negative attitude after a big us push for compromise at last week 's nato summit and in one-on-one talks between president george w. bush and putin .
russia is also said to have been angered by bush 's pressuring of european members of nato to openly support ukraine and georgia 's nato bid despite being told by german chancellor angela merkel that the topic was " off the table " for the time being at the meeting in bucharest .
germany , france fear destabilization bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : sarkozy and merkel were angered by pressure from bush while bush was forced into agreeing on a delay by merkel and french president nicolas sarkozy , who fear a rash move to install the two former soviet states as nato members could destabilize an already volatile region on russia 's southern flank , his insistence was not lost on russian observers .
however , general baluyevsky said it was too early to talk about ukrainian or georgian entry into nato .
" the population of ukraine is unambiguously against entry to nato despite the so-called referendum in georgia where seventy percent of the population supported the idea , ” he said .

" russia will take unambiguous action toward ensuring its interests along its borders , " he said .
" these will not only be military steps , but also steps of a different character . "
moscow lobbied hard to head off georgia and ukraine 's ambition for membership at last month 's nato summit in bucharest , but alliance leaders intend to review their bid in december .
nato turned down georgia and ukraine 's applications for membership action plans - a stepping stone to membership - but , under pressure from washington , one of the strongest advocates of enlargement in the alliance , the alliance did say both would eventually become nato members .
russian foreign minister sergei lavrov said earlier this week that moscow will do everything it can to prevent the two countries , run by pro-western governments , from becoming nato members .
russia will do everything to prevent accession bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : putin and lavrov did n't like what they heard in bucharest " we will do all we can to prevent ukraine 's and georgia 's accession into nato and to avoid an inevitable serious exacerbation of our relations with both the alliance and our neighbors , " lavrov told reporters .
russia opposes the plan to grant membership on the grounds that such a move would pose a direct threat to its security and endanger the fragile balance of forces in europe .
it also sees nato 's willingness to enlarge eastward as the continuation of the western cold war containment policy and the spread of a foreign military bloc along its border .
president vladimir putin said in february that russia would consider directing its missiles at ukraine if the neighboring state ever hosted nato military installations .
russia 's fears have also been stoked by plans by the united states to install interceptor missiles and radar stations in poland and the czech republic as part of a wider missile defense shield designed to protect the us from attack by rogue states such as iran and north korea .
lavrov warned earlier this week that states hosting parts of a us missile defense shield also risked facing a military response if moscow 's security concerns were not met .
demands for presence at missile shield installations bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : russia wants to be involved in any missile plans the us has the russian foreign minister demanded that the russian military be allowed a " permanent presence " at the planned us missile interceptor base in poland and the radar site in the czech republic , threatening that russia would otherwise consider " measures of military-technical character . "
the threat put paid to the united states and its partners hopes of a shift in russia 's negative attitude after a big us push for compromise at last week 's nato summit and in one-on-one talks between president george w. bush and putin .
russia is also said to have been angered by bush 's pressuring of european members of nato to openly support ukraine and georgia 's nato bid despite being told by german chancellor angela merkel that the topic was " off the table " for the time being at the meeting in bucharest .
germany , france fear destabilization bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : sarkozy and merkel were angered by pressure from bush while bush was forced into agreeing on a delay by merkel and french president nicolas sarkozy , who fear a rash move to install the two former soviet states as nato members could destabilize an already volatile region on russia 's southern flank , his insistence was not lost on russian observers .
however , general baluyevsky said it was too early to talk about ukrainian or georgian entry into nato .

russian foreign minister sergei lavrov said earlier this week that moscow will do everything it can to prevent the two countries , run by pro-western governments , from becoming nato members .
russia will do everything to prevent accession bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : putin and lavrov did n't like what they heard in bucharest " we will do all we can to prevent ukraine 's and georgia 's accession into nato and to avoid an inevitable serious exacerbation of our relations with both the alliance and our neighbors , " lavrov told reporters .
russia opposes the plan to grant membership on the grounds that such a move would pose a direct threat to its security and endanger the fragile balance of forces in europe .
it also sees nato 's willingness to enlarge eastward as the continuation of the western cold war containment policy and the spread of a foreign military bloc along its border .
president vladimir putin said in february that russia would consider directing its missiles at ukraine if the neighboring state ever hosted nato military installations .
russia 's fears have also been stoked by plans by the united states to install interceptor missiles and radar stations in poland and the czech republic as part of a wider missile defense shield designed to protect the us from attack by rogue states such as iran and north korea .
lavrov warned earlier this week that states hosting parts of a us missile defense shield also risked facing a military response if moscow 's security concerns were not met .
demands for presence at missile shield installations bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : russia wants to be involved in any missile plans the us has the russian foreign minister demanded that the russian military be allowed a " permanent presence " at the planned us missile interceptor base in poland and the radar site in the czech republic , threatening that russia would otherwise consider " measures of military-technical character . "
the threat put paid to the united states and its partners hopes of a shift in russia 's negative attitude after a big us push for compromise at last week 's nato summit and in one-on-one talks between president george w. bush and putin .
russia is also said to have been angered by bush 's pressuring of european members of nato to openly support ukraine and georgia 's nato bid despite being told by german chancellor angela merkel that the topic was " off the table " for the time being at the meeting in bucharest .

however , general baluyevsky said it was too early to talk about ukrainian or georgian entry into nato .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de from the fringe -pipe- 11.04.2008 verdi gets post 9/11 update with plenty of senior skin großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : more than sixty senior citizens auditioned to get their kit off in the new verdi production giuseppe verdi was never one to shy away from the inclusion of controversial subject matter in his operas but even he may have balked at adding an ageing , naked twist to one of his works . in some sections of german society , naked senior citizens are not only welcomed but embraced - although not always literally .
nudity among the aged in the pursuit of health and wellness is positively encouraged in some places .
however , theater stages in front of large , clothed audiences are usually not among them .
if the idea of a bunch of wrinklies in their well-worn birthday suits cavorting on stage in the name of entertainment is n't enough to disturb you and give you nightmares , then imagine said oldies frolicking around in the ashes of the world trade center while wearing mickey mouse masks .
or do n't , if you value your sanity .
but this is n't some bizarre sex fetish show catering for " appreciators of the mature " on the hamburg reeperbahn .
this is high culture , german style .
the 35 oaps in the all-together form just one part of the erfurt theater 's sell-out reinterpretation of verdi 's opera , " a masked ball . "
and for those thinking that some crazy young thing has perverted a classical masterpiece just to get some cheap publicity , it may come as some surprise that the opera is actually no stranger to controversy .
original scandal pales into insignificance bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : we 'll let your imagination come up with the rest giuseppe verdi wrote the piece about the 1792 assassination of swedish king gustavus iii , who was shot while attending a masked ball .
nineteenth-century censors demanded that verdi move the opera 's setting from europe to colonial america so as not to depict the assassination of a european monarch .
while there were no geriatric genitalia on show back then , it was deemed to be quite the scandal at the time .
austrian director johann kresnik may have added more than spattering of senior skin to the modern version but he adheres to the relocation ordered by the prudes of verdi 's time and stages his bizarre take on the opera in the united states just as they would have liked .
except the post 9/11 , disney-clad ageing nudes may have caused them to rethink their priorities somewhat .
" it 's a very beautiful , poetic scene , " guy montavon , the theatre 's general manager , explained to nervous reporters when timidly questioned about the exhibitionist pensioners .
" the concept is a little critical about america , the world of america with very rich people , very poor people , with war and the excesses of american society today , " he added to general bafflement .
politician 's censorship bid outstripped by public clamor bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the real ground zero without naked old people the show has already found its 21st-century version of verdi 's censors in the form of local politician who has called for a boycott of the production .
however , theater-goers have not heeded his call .
montavon told reporters the saturday premiere and four other performances had already sold out .
he would not be drawn , however , on rumors that business cards for local therapists would be included in the show 's program . dw staff -lrb- nda -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

yet the winner could be a familiar face : former prime minister and media tycoon silvio berlusconi . berlusconi is so confident of his lead in the polls that he spent his recent campaign rallies acting as if he 's already won the weekend election .
but his main rival , former rome mayor walter veltroni , promised that the center-right politician will be in for a nasty surprise after votes are counted .
veltroni spent the last days of the campaign criss-crossing italy in a bus , attempting to shave away berlusconi 's lead , which the last polls held two weeks ago put at 6 percentage points .
both men made impassioned pleas to supporters in the final days of their campaigns .
berlusconi , a 71-year-old self-made billionaire , urged his supporters to help him win over undecided voters ahead of elections sunday , april 13 and monday , april 14 .
veltroni , 52 , told voters on friday that berlusconi was " no statesman " and promised an upset .
veltroni has also been hammering away at berlusconi 's economic record , accusing him of making poor economic decisions .
slowing economy an election issue bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : election fatigue is reportedly high among voters italy 's next prime minister will have to contend with the country 's sputtering economy .
italy faces not only a sharp economic slowdown , but also record-high inflation and low wages .
the international monetary fund expects italy 's economy , the euro zone 's third largest , to grow just 0.3 percent this year .
the two candidates offered similar economic platforms with both pledging tax cuts and reduced government spending .
alexander kockerbeck , a senior credit officer at moody 's investors service , said the targets set by the two main candidates would be difficult to achieve without a clear election mandate .
" if the outcome -lrb- of the vote -rrb- is unclear , the risk is a delay in carrying out necessary reforms , " kockerbeck told reuters news agency .
fed up with politicians bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : vetroni thinks he can pull off an upset italy 's political class is viewed by much of the population as corrupt , incompetent and gridlocked . voters have been appalled by the trash piled on the streets of naples and toxins in the country 's beloved buffalo mozzarella cheese .
" anything politicians touch , it 's the kiss of death , the opposite of king midas , " bocconi university professor carlo alberto carnevale-maffe told reuters .
berlusconi was head of the government between 2001 and 2006 .
he owns a media empire which includes three of italy 's seven national television networks .
implicated in a string of corruption probes , berlusconi has been criticized for running up a budget deficit equal to 4.4 percent of gross domestic product -lrb- gdp -rrb- during his second premiership .
since being forced out of power in 2006 , he has lobbed scorn from the sidelines as his political opponents have struggled to keep a fractious coalition together .
the government of prime minister romano prodi collapsed in january when a small centrist party withdrew its support .
worries of a tie bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : even mozarella has been tained by politics veltroni predicted a surprise win for his center-left party , saying voters were " way ahead of politics , newspapers and polls . "
" you 'll see that on april 13 we 'll have some surprises , " veltroni said .
even with the lead enjoyed by berlusconi 's pdl party , the senate race , where votes are determined by region , is expected to be tight .
some analysts have warned that if no party or coalition emerges with a clear-cut majority in the senate , italy could be in danger of having a " hung parliament " which would be unable to govern .
" the electoral campaign ends today with the ever more burdensome specter of a result that is not called for in politics : a tie , " the daily la stampa newspaper said in an editorial .
berlusconi wants clear mandate bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the naples trash scandal was a political lowpoint analysts have predicted a lower turnout than in 2006 , when nearly 84 per cent of eligible voters cast ballots in what turned out to be the closest election in modern italian history .
berlusconi tried to prevent a close race at his final campaign rallies , urging supporters to the polls .
" go and convert people , " berlusconi told supporters at one of his last election rallies outside rome 's coliseum .
" it 's important .
you have missionary work to do towards all the undecided voters .
you are the missionaries of truth and freedom , " berlusconi said , his voice hoarse from non-stop campaigning .
berlusconi also accused veltroni of a " campaign of lies " and his party of being communists in disguise .
veltroni , a movie buff and one-time journalist , was a communist in the 1970s , but eventually became a social democrat .
vetroni served as rome 's mayor for seven years until he resigned to run in the national elections . dw staff -lrb- th -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

" russia will take unambiguous action toward ensuring its interests along its borders , " he said .
" these will not only be military steps , but also steps of a different character . "
moscow lobbied hard to head off georgia and ukraine 's ambition for membership at last month 's nato summit in bucharest , but alliance leaders intend to review their bid in december .
nato turned down georgia and ukraine 's applications for membership action plans - a stepping stone to membership - but , under pressure from washington , one of the strongest advocates of enlargement in the alliance , the alliance did say both would eventually become nato members .
russian foreign minister sergei lavrov said earlier this week that moscow will do everything it can to prevent the two countries , run by pro-western governments , from becoming nato members .
russia will do everything to prevent accession bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : putin and lavrov did n't like what they heard in bucharest " we will do all we can to prevent ukraine 's and georgia 's accession into nato and to avoid an inevitable serious exacerbation of our relations with both the alliance and our neighbors , " lavrov told reporters .
russia opposes the plan to grant membership on the grounds that such a move would pose a direct threat to its security and endanger the fragile balance of forces in europe .
it also sees nato 's willingness to enlarge eastward as the continuation of the western cold war containment policy and the spread of a foreign military bloc along its border .
president vladimir putin said in february that russia would consider directing its missiles at ukraine if the neighboring state ever hosted nato military installations .
russia 's fears have also been stoked by plans by the united states to install interceptor missiles and radar stations in poland and the czech republic as part of a wider missile defense shield designed to protect the us from attack by rogue states such as iran and north korea .
lavrov warned earlier this week that states hosting parts of a us missile defense shield also risked facing a military response if moscow 's security concerns were not met .
demands for presence at missile shield installations bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : russia wants to be involved in any missile plans the us has the russian foreign minister demanded that the russian military be allowed a " permanent presence " at the planned us missile interceptor base in poland and the radar site in the czech republic , threatening that russia would otherwise consider " measures of military-technical character . "
the threat put paid to the united states and its partners hopes of a shift in russia 's negative attitude after a big us push for compromise at last week 's nato summit and in one-on-one talks between president george w. bush and putin .
russia is also said to have been angered by bush 's pressuring of european members of nato to openly support ukraine and georgia 's nato bid despite being told by german chancellor angela merkel that the topic was " off the table " for the time being at the meeting in bucharest .
germany , france fear destabilization bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : sarkozy and merkel were angered by pressure from bush while bush was forced into agreeing on a delay by merkel and french president nicolas sarkozy , who fear a rash move to install the two former soviet states as nato members could destabilize an already volatile region on russia 's southern flank , his insistence was not lost on russian observers .
however , general baluyevsky said it was too early to talk about ukrainian or georgian entry into nato .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de science -pipe- 11.04.2008 germany eases stem cell restrictions großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : scientists will have more stem cell lines to choose from after months of political negotiations , german lawmakers agreed to allow broader embryonic stem cell use .
but they signaled their ambivalence by refusing to completely do away with restrictions . hundreds of stem-cell lines previously off-limits to german scientists will be made available under a law passed by a majority of germany 's lower house of parliament on friday , april 11 .
but the decision represents a compromise in a debate which has raged for months over the ethics of using embryonic stem cells for scientific research .
on friday , lawmakers debated various measures which ranged from a complete liberalization to a complete prohibition of stem-cell use before deciding on a compromise measure .
the final vote cut across party lines , with 346 german lawmakers in favor of the revision while 228 voted against it and six abstained .
researchers welcome new law bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the stem cell issue divided the german legislature german scientists had long complained that the restrictive laws put them at a disadvantage compared with their peers in other countries .
germany 's science minister , annette schavan , said reforming the law was key to fostering research in germany .
“ this is a good day for both protecting life and also for research in germany , “ schavan , of the christian democratic union , said after the vote friday . the german research foundation -lrb- dfg -rrb- , max-planck-institute , the helmholz association and the federation of german industries -lrb- bdi -rrb- also welcomed the vote . “ the changes give german researchers the chance to stay competitive internationally , ” said max planck institute president peter gruss . more options for scientists bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : stem cells are thought to offer disease-curing potential german scientists had pushed for germany to reconsider a 2002 law which imposed strict limits on the use of embryonic stem cells in medical research .
while the law banned all creation of stem cells in germany , it did allow cells produced from abroad to be imported , but only if they had been created before jan .
1 , 2002 .
scientists also had to show that the project had overwhelming significance and that no other research method could be used .
scientists had complained that tight laws prevented them from taking part in international projects using stem cell lines created after 2002 .
other european countries , such as britain and sweden , have less strict laws .
the new law allows for a more recent cut-off date of may 1 , 2007 for the import of stem-cell lines .
advocates of the change claim that it will increase the number of stem-cell lines available to german scientists from 40 to 500 .
echoes of nazi experiments ?
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : politicians voted their conscience embryonic stem cells are prized by scientists for their ability to develop into any type of cell .
this versatility has led scientists to trump stem cells as offering the potential to cure diseases such as diabetes , parkinson 's and heart maladies .
yet in germany , the use of embryonic stem cells makes many people uncomfortable on religious and ethical grounds .
stem cell research carries historic overtones of the nazis ' genetic experiments linked to the creation of a master race .
traumatized by grisly experiments on humans under the nazis and influenced by its christian churches , germany has agonized for a decade about the ethics of using the cells .
critics argue that a human life is sacrificed when an embryo is torn apart .
religious groups expressed unhappiness with the parliament 's decision .
" this is not a good day for the protection of life in germany , “ said munich archbishop reinhard marx . guenther beckstein , bavaria ’ s conservative premier , also said he thought the change would set a dangerous precedent . “ my worry is that it will now become easier to further undermine the protection of unborn life , ” beckstein said .
critics have pointed to new research advances in bolstering their claim that stem cells are unnecessary .
scientists recently discovered a way to re-program adult stem cells to make them pluripotent , or capable of acting like embryonic stem cells .
the search for a substitute bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : embryonic stem cells still ca n't be produced in germany but scientists counter they still need the embryonic cells to compare with these induced pluripotent cells .
in november 2007 , teams of us and japanese researchers said they had reprogrammed human skin cells to function like embryonic stem cells .
on the surface , this could mean that scientists would no longer have to rely on embryonic stem cells .
but " these new , reprogrammed cells still have to be compared with real embryonic stem cell lines to see if they function the same way , " said joerg hacker , vice president of the german research foundation .
shortly after the november announcement , the german government announced it would double its funding for stem-cell research from 5 million euros -lrb- $ 7.4 million -rrb- to just under 10 million euros , albeit only for adult stem cells . dw staff -lrb- th -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

but they signaled their ambivalence by refusing to completely do away with restrictions . hundreds of stem-cell lines previously off-limits to german scientists will be made available under a law passed by a majority of germany 's lower house of parliament on friday , april 11 .
but the decision represents a compromise in a debate which has raged for months over the ethics of using embryonic stem cells for scientific research .
on friday , lawmakers debated various measures which ranged from a complete liberalization to a complete prohibition of stem-cell use before deciding on a compromise measure .
the final vote cut across party lines , with 346 german lawmakers in favor of the revision while 228 voted against it and six abstained .
researchers welcome new law bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the stem cell issue divided the german legislature german scientists had long complained that the restrictive laws put them at a disadvantage compared with their peers in other countries .
germany 's science minister , annette schavan , said reforming the law was key to fostering research in germany .
“ this is a good day for both protecting life and also for research in germany , “ schavan , of the christian democratic union , said after the vote friday . the german research foundation -lrb- dfg -rrb- , max-planck-institute , the helmholz association and the federation of german industries -lrb- bdi -rrb- also welcomed the vote . “ the changes give german researchers the chance to stay competitive internationally , ” said max planck institute president peter gruss . more options for scientists bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : stem cells are thought to offer disease-curing potential german scientists had pushed for germany to reconsider a 2002 law which imposed strict limits on the use of embryonic stem cells in medical research .
while the law banned all creation of stem cells in germany , it did allow cells produced from abroad to be imported , but only if they had been created before jan .
1 , 2002 .
scientists also had to show that the project had overwhelming significance and that no other research method could be used .
scientists had complained that tight laws prevented them from taking part in international projects using stem cell lines created after 2002 .
other european countries , such as britain and sweden , have less strict laws .
the new law allows for a more recent cut-off date of may 1 , 2007 for the import of stem-cell lines .
advocates of the change claim that it will increase the number of stem-cell lines available to german scientists from 40 to 500 .
echoes of nazi experiments ?
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : politicians voted their conscience embryonic stem cells are prized by scientists for their ability to develop into any type of cell .
this versatility has led scientists to trump stem cells as offering the potential to cure diseases such as diabetes , parkinson 's and heart maladies .
yet in germany , the use of embryonic stem cells makes many people uncomfortable on religious and ethical grounds .
stem cell research carries historic overtones of the nazis ' genetic experiments linked to the creation of a master race .
traumatized by grisly experiments on humans under the nazis and influenced by its christian churches , germany has agonized for a decade about the ethics of using the cells .
critics argue that a human life is sacrificed when an embryo is torn apart .
religious groups expressed unhappiness with the parliament 's decision .
" this is not a good day for the protection of life in germany , “ said munich archbishop reinhard marx . guenther beckstein , bavaria ’ s conservative premier , also said he thought the change would set a dangerous precedent . “ my worry is that it will now become easier to further undermine the protection of unborn life , ” beckstein said .
critics have pointed to new research advances in bolstering their claim that stem cells are unnecessary .
scientists recently discovered a way to re-program adult stem cells to make them pluripotent , or capable of acting like embryonic stem cells .
the search for a substitute bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : embryonic stem cells still ca n't be produced in germany but scientists counter they still need the embryonic cells to compare with these induced pluripotent cells .
in november 2007 , teams of us and japanese researchers said they had reprogrammed human skin cells to function like embryonic stem cells .
on the surface , this could mean that scientists would no longer have to rely on embryonic stem cells .
but " these new , reprogrammed cells still have to be compared with real embryonic stem cell lines to see if they function the same way , " said joerg hacker , vice president of the german research foundation .
shortly after the november announcement , the german government announced it would double its funding for stem-cell research from 5 million euros -lrb- $ 7.4 million -rrb- to just under 10 million euros , albeit only for adult stem cells . dw staff -lrb- th -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

"
they were enraged that former nazis held powerful positions in society , incensed over legal reforms they deemed undemocratic and angry they did n't have more of a say in running their universities . " it was a revolutionary period that aimed to create a better world , " wolfgang bittner , a former lawyer and now writer in cologne , told dw-world.de. the 66-year-old said he was " politicized " during that time as a university student . " we students felt the leaden weight of antiquated , bourgeois german society - the complacency of it , " he said . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : rudi 's legend lives on one of the spearheads of the student movement that formed as a reaction to that sentiment was rudi dutschke - an eloquent and charismatic leader and head of the socialist students union . for thousands , dutschke became a beacon for change . he was shot in west berlin on april 11 , 1968 , by josef bachmann , a laborer and sometimes burglar with alleged right-wing sympathies .
dutschke barely survived the bullets to his brain , and suffered health problems for the rest of his life , eventually dying as a result of his injuries 11 years later . students at the time blamed conservative media for stoking hatred against dutschke .
they resented the bild tabloid 's smear campaign against him and the 68ers , as those of the movement were called , believing it played a role in convincing bachmann to attempt murder . brought in the new günter wallraff , 65 , a journalist and filmmaker known nationwide for his crusades against corporate injustice , said the 1968 movement brought about changes that many people now take for granted . " the double standards for men and women in society were exposed then , greater rights and freedom for women and children were created , more power to students for democratic representation , sexual liberalization - the 1968 generation prompted all of that , " he said . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : us singer joan baez during a 1967 vietnam war protest " new life was breathed into society at the time , " he said , pointing to dramatic shifts in literature , music and design as well . but many students wanted more and had set their sights beyond germany 's borders .
besides being anti-authoritarian , they were also largely anti-american .
they opposed the us war in vietnam and chanted the name of vietnamese communist leader ho chi minh as they battled baton-wielding police during protests on berlin streets . revolt against nazi past the year 1968 saw university campuses in several countries transformed into battlegrounds for social change .
in paris , students were joined by labor unions ; people in poland and czechoslovakia demonstrated against repressive governments . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : demonstrations also rocked paris in may 1968 germans , however , had their own particular demons to battle . the students , and other left-wing protestors , opposed an older generation that accepted kurt georg kiesinger , a former member of the nazi party , as chancellor . they rejected the notion of a state led by president heinrich luebke , who held the office from 1959 to 1969 .
he had worked with architect albert speer during the nazi regime and was suspected of having designed concentration camps during world war ii . " a generation of criminals was ruling society after the war and no one talked about what they had done .
discussing their crimes was not even a part of our school lessons , " said wallraff . bittner agreed : " we saw that something dramatic had to happen . " an earlier death bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : joschka fischer , later german foreign minister , beaten on the street in april 1968 the student uprisings at the universities had begun even before the assassination attempt on dutschke . nine months earlier , in june 1967 , student benno ohnesorg was shot in the back of the head and killed by a plainclothes policeman during demonstrations in berlin protesting a visit by the shah of iran . that shooting outraged tens of thousands of students and hardened opposition against the grand coalition government of conservative christian democrat-led parties and center-left social democrats . the protestors were deeply disappointed by what they saw as the social democrats ' betrayal of socialism .
they also rejected the state of emergency law reforms of 1968 , which granted the cabinet the power to get laws passed , despite rejection by parliament , during a national crisis - a move the students considered non-democratic . disapproval by german public bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : women also took up jobs in factories in the 1950s the larger german society did not see the student rebels - including dutschke - and other protestors as romantic revolutionaries fighting for the greater good .

many germans were happy to simply have a job , a car and enough money for a european vacation . the tense atmosphere and violence that erupted following the assassination of ohnesorg and the attempted one on dutschke also gave rise to the political terrorism of the red army fraction -lrb- raf -rrb- in the late 1960s and early ' 70s , which prompted panic and distrust throughout germany . though most members of the 1968 movement rejected terrorism , the distinction between the splinter group raf and the original 68ers was unclear to many . a new 68 generation ? bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : a 1968 bombing in a frankfurt department store - the extreme side of protests the 1968 movement prompted shifts in many parts of society , and 40 years later , wallraff said a new movement could be on the horizon . " all the signs are there , " said wallraff .
" so many societal standards are being done away with , workers have to hide the fact they are in unions … changes will have to happen - just look at the growth of right-extremism in eastern germany . " the growing gap between rich and poor in germany , soaring inflation rates and decreasing health and pension benefits may likewise be contributing to a general feeling that the average citizen has been left behind despite strong economic growth . the emergence of the new left party and its growing popularity is yet another indication that the country may be poised on the brink of change .

" russia will take unambiguous action toward ensuring its interests along its borders , " he said .
" these will not only be military steps , but also steps of a different character . "
moscow lobbied hard to head off georgia and ukraine 's ambition for membership at last month 's nato summit in bucharest , but alliance leaders intend to review their bid in december .
nato turned down georgia and ukraine 's applications for membership action plans - a stepping stone to membership - but , under pressure from washington , one of the strongest advocates of enlargement in the alliance , the alliance did say both would eventually become nato members .
russian foreign minister sergei lavrov said earlier this week that moscow will do everything it can to prevent the two countries , run by pro-western governments , from becoming nato members .
russia will do everything to prevent accession bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : putin and lavrov did n't like what they heard in bucharest " we will do all we can to prevent ukraine 's and georgia 's accession into nato and to avoid an inevitable serious exacerbation of our relations with both the alliance and our neighbors , " lavrov told reporters .
russia opposes the plan to grant membership on the grounds that such a move would pose a direct threat to its security and endanger the fragile balance of forces in europe .
it also sees nato 's willingness to enlarge eastward as the continuation of the western cold war containment policy and the spread of a foreign military bloc along its border .
president vladimir putin said in february that russia would consider directing its missiles at ukraine if the neighboring state ever hosted nato military installations .
russia 's fears have also been stoked by plans by the united states to install interceptor missiles and radar stations in poland and the czech republic as part of a wider missile defense shield designed to protect the us from attack by rogue states such as iran and north korea .
lavrov warned earlier this week that states hosting parts of a us missile defense shield also risked facing a military response if moscow 's security concerns were not met .
demands for presence at missile shield installations bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : russia wants to be involved in any missile plans the us has the russian foreign minister demanded that the russian military be allowed a " permanent presence " at the planned us missile interceptor base in poland and the radar site in the czech republic , threatening that russia would otherwise consider " measures of military-technical character . "
the threat put paid to the united states and its partners hopes of a shift in russia 's negative attitude after a big us push for compromise at last week 's nato summit and in one-on-one talks between president george w. bush and putin .
russia is also said to have been angered by bush 's pressuring of european members of nato to openly support ukraine and georgia 's nato bid despite being told by german chancellor angela merkel that the topic was " off the table " for the time being at the meeting in bucharest .
germany , france fear destabilization bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : sarkozy and merkel were angered by pressure from bush while bush was forced into agreeing on a delay by merkel and french president nicolas sarkozy , who fear a rash move to install the two former soviet states as nato members could destabilize an already volatile region on russia 's southern flank , his insistence was not lost on russian observers .
however , general baluyevsky said it was too early to talk about ukrainian or georgian entry into nato .
" the population of ukraine is unambiguously against entry to nato despite the so-called referendum in georgia where seventy percent of the population supported the idea , ” he said .

he faces a second term of economic challenges and continuing concerns over regional separatism . the new legislature was , however , opening in a more conciliatory political atmosphere than the previous one , making it easier for spanish socialist leader zapatero to try to buttress up the economy and to seek support in the fight against the militant basque separatist group eta .
the 47-year-old was the first spanish prime minister elected in a popular vote to be reconfirmed with a simple majority in a second round of voting , after failing to win an absolute majority in the first round .
the socialists increased their number of seats by five to 169 in the 350-member parliament , but did not get an absolute majority in the elections a month ago .
zapatero had deliberately opted for a simple majority in the parliamentary vote in order to maintain his political independence from basque and catalan regionalists , whose votes could have allowed him to be elected in the first round , but who would have demanded a price for their support .
the government 's concessions to regions demanding more autonomy had earlier created divisions with the opposition conservatives , who accused zapatero of endangering the unity of spain .
growing calls for autonomy during the upcoming legislature , it is expected that the basques will attempt to stage a regional referendum on a self-government bordering on independence , which the socialists were planning to prevent by offering the region more autonomy instead .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : eta 's armed struggle has claimed lives on zapatero 's watch basque regional premier juan jose ibarretxe believes the referendum could help to end the violence associated with the basque separatist group eta , which has killed three people since negotiations between eta and madrid collapsed in 2006 .
the negotiation attempt sparked a barrage of criticism from the conservative people 's party -lrb- pp -rrb- , which slammed the government for " surrendering " to terrorists .
zapatero has resumed police crackdowns against eta and made it understood that he will not talk to the group again , a move which is expected to help to pacify the political atmosphere .
zapatero has also pledged to seek a cross-party consensus on other issues including a reform of regional financial autonomy rule , spain 's europe policy and judicial reform .
the previous legislature was marked by liberal social reforms , such as gay marriage and speedy divorce .
the issues divided the country and catholic clergymen lambasted the government at rallies in defense of the traditional family .
the government was not , however , expected to pursue other controversial reforms , such as a more liberal abortion law or the legalization of euthanasia , during the upcoming legislature .
reversing economic downturn bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : spain 's finances are another area of concern for the pm zapatero is more concerned with the state of spain 's economy , which is expected to be hit harder than most other western countries by the global economic problems , with growth plunging from 3.8 per cent in 2007 to possibly even less than 2 per cent this year .
the premier has pledged measures to soften the blow , such as an increase of public works to absorb workers from the long overheated , rapidly shrinking construction industry , which has accounted for nearly 20 per cent of spain 's gross domestic product -lrb- gdp -rrb- .
despite the general improvement in the political atmosphere , the socialists ' relations with other parties have evolved in such a way that zapatero will be able to pass laws with the support of smaller parties only on a case-by-case basis .
previously , he had been able to rely on the far-left izquierda unida -lrb- iu -rrb- and on the catalan republican party erc for the initial part of the legislature .
no major reshuffle bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : foreign minister moratinos is likely to remain in office zapatero was expected to make relatively few changes in the composition of his government , retaining his popular deputy maria teresa fernandez de la vega , as well as pedro solbes as economics minister , miguel angel moratinos as foreign minister and alfredo perez rubalcaba as interior minister .
zapatero , who appointed spain 's first half-female cabinet , was expected to give the defense portfolio to a woman , possibly to elena salgado , who held the health and then the public administration portfolio in the previous government .

yet the winner could be a familiar face : former prime minister and media tycoon silvio berlusconi . berlusconi is so confident of his lead in the polls that he spent his recent campaign rallies acting as if he 's already won the weekend election .
but his main rival , former rome mayor walter veltroni , promised that the center-right politician will be in for a nasty surprise after votes are counted .
veltroni spent the last days of the campaign criss-crossing italy in a bus , attempting to shave away berlusconi 's lead , which the last polls held two weeks ago put at 6 percentage points .
both men made impassioned pleas to supporters in the final days of their campaigns .
berlusconi , a 71-year-old self-made billionaire , urged his supporters to help him win over undecided voters ahead of elections sunday , april 13 and monday , april 14 .
veltroni , 52 , told voters on friday that berlusconi was " no statesman " and promised an upset .
veltroni has also been hammering away at berlusconi 's economic record , accusing him of making poor economic decisions .
slowing economy an election issue bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : election fatigue is reportedly high among voters italy 's next prime minister will have to contend with the country 's sputtering economy .
italy faces not only a sharp economic slowdown , but also record-high inflation and low wages .
the international monetary fund expects italy 's economy , the euro zone 's third largest , to grow just 0.3 percent this year .
the two candidates offered similar economic platforms with both pledging tax cuts and reduced government spending .
alexander kockerbeck , a senior credit officer at moody 's investors service , said the targets set by the two main candidates would be difficult to achieve without a clear election mandate .
" if the outcome -lrb- of the vote -rrb- is unclear , the risk is a delay in carrying out necessary reforms , " kockerbeck told reuters news agency .
fed up with politicians bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : vetroni thinks he can pull off an upset italy 's political class is viewed by much of the population as corrupt , incompetent and gridlocked . voters have been appalled by the trash piled on the streets of naples and toxins in the country 's beloved buffalo mozzarella cheese .
" anything politicians touch , it 's the kiss of death , the opposite of king midas , " bocconi university professor carlo alberto carnevale-maffe told reuters .
berlusconi was head of the government between 2001 and 2006 .
he owns a media empire which includes three of italy 's seven national television networks .

yet the winner could be a familiar face : former prime minister and media tycoon silvio berlusconi . berlusconi is so confident of his lead in the polls that he spent his recent campaign rallies acting as if he 's already won the weekend election .
but his main rival , former rome mayor walter veltroni , promised that the center-right politician will be in for a nasty surprise after votes are counted .
veltroni spent the last days of the campaign criss-crossing italy in a bus , attempting to shave away berlusconi 's lead , which the last polls held two weeks ago put at 6 percentage points .
both men made impassioned pleas to supporters in the final days of their campaigns .
berlusconi , a 71-year-old self-made billionaire , urged his supporters to help him win over undecided voters ahead of elections sunday , april 13 and monday , april 14 .
veltroni , 52 , told voters on friday that berlusconi was " no statesman " and promised an upset .
veltroni has also been hammering away at berlusconi 's economic record , accusing him of making poor economic decisions .
slowing economy an election issue bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : election fatigue is reportedly high among voters italy 's next prime minister will have to contend with the country 's sputtering economy .
italy faces not only a sharp economic slowdown , but also record-high inflation and low wages .
the international monetary fund expects italy 's economy , the euro zone 's third largest , to grow just 0.3 percent this year .
the two candidates offered similar economic platforms with both pledging tax cuts and reduced government spending .
alexander kockerbeck , a senior credit officer at moody 's investors service , said the targets set by the two main candidates would be difficult to achieve without a clear election mandate .
" if the outcome -lrb- of the vote -rrb- is unclear , the risk is a delay in carrying out necessary reforms , " kockerbeck told reuters news agency .
fed up with politicians bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : vetroni thinks he can pull off an upset italy 's political class is viewed by much of the population as corrupt , incompetent and gridlocked . voters have been appalled by the trash piled on the streets of naples and toxins in the country 's beloved buffalo mozzarella cheese .
" anything politicians touch , it 's the kiss of death , the opposite of king midas , " bocconi university professor carlo alberto carnevale-maffe told reuters .
berlusconi was head of the government between 2001 and 2006 .
he owns a media empire which includes three of italy 's seven national television networks .
implicated in a string of corruption probes , berlusconi has been criticized for running up a budget deficit equal to 4.4 percent of gross domestic product -lrb- gdp -rrb- during his second premiership .
since being forced out of power in 2006 , he has lobbed scorn from the sidelines as his political opponents have struggled to keep a fractious coalition together .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de elections -pipe- 11.04.2008 spain 's re-elected zapatero faces long list of challenges großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : spain 's prime minister jose luis rodriguez zapatero has a lot to do in his second term spanish prime minister jose luis rodriguez zapatero 's premiership was reconfirmed by parliament friday , april 11 .
he faces a second term of economic challenges and continuing concerns over regional separatism . the new legislature was , however , opening in a more conciliatory political atmosphere than the previous one , making it easier for spanish socialist leader zapatero to try to buttress up the economy and to seek support in the fight against the militant basque separatist group eta .
the 47-year-old was the first spanish prime minister elected in a popular vote to be reconfirmed with a simple majority in a second round of voting , after failing to win an absolute majority in the first round .
the socialists increased their number of seats by five to 169 in the 350-member parliament , but did not get an absolute majority in the elections a month ago .
zapatero had deliberately opted for a simple majority in the parliamentary vote in order to maintain his political independence from basque and catalan regionalists , whose votes could have allowed him to be elected in the first round , but who would have demanded a price for their support .
the government 's concessions to regions demanding more autonomy had earlier created divisions with the opposition conservatives , who accused zapatero of endangering the unity of spain .
growing calls for autonomy during the upcoming legislature , it is expected that the basques will attempt to stage a regional referendum on a self-government bordering on independence , which the socialists were planning to prevent by offering the region more autonomy instead .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : eta 's armed struggle has claimed lives on zapatero 's watch basque regional premier juan jose ibarretxe believes the referendum could help to end the violence associated with the basque separatist group eta , which has killed three people since negotiations between eta and madrid collapsed in 2006 .
the negotiation attempt sparked a barrage of criticism from the conservative people 's party -lrb- pp -rrb- , which slammed the government for " surrendering " to terrorists .
zapatero has resumed police crackdowns against eta and made it understood that he will not talk to the group again , a move which is expected to help to pacify the political atmosphere .
zapatero has also pledged to seek a cross-party consensus on other issues including a reform of regional financial autonomy rule , spain 's europe policy and judicial reform .
the previous legislature was marked by liberal social reforms , such as gay marriage and speedy divorce .
the issues divided the country and catholic clergymen lambasted the government at rallies in defense of the traditional family .
the government was not , however , expected to pursue other controversial reforms , such as a more liberal abortion law or the legalization of euthanasia , during the upcoming legislature .
reversing economic downturn bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : spain 's finances are another area of concern for the pm zapatero is more concerned with the state of spain 's economy , which is expected to be hit harder than most other western countries by the global economic problems , with growth plunging from 3.8 per cent in 2007 to possibly even less than 2 per cent this year .
the premier has pledged measures to soften the blow , such as an increase of public works to absorb workers from the long overheated , rapidly shrinking construction industry , which has accounted for nearly 20 per cent of spain 's gross domestic product -lrb- gdp -rrb- .
despite the general improvement in the political atmosphere , the socialists ' relations with other parties have evolved in such a way that zapatero will be able to pass laws with the support of smaller parties only on a case-by-case basis .
previously , he had been able to rely on the far-left izquierda unida -lrb- iu -rrb- and on the catalan republican party erc for the initial part of the legislature .
no major reshuffle bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : foreign minister moratinos is likely to remain in office zapatero was expected to make relatively few changes in the composition of his government , retaining his popular deputy maria teresa fernandez de la vega , as well as pedro solbes as economics minister , miguel angel moratinos as foreign minister and alfredo perez rubalcaba as interior minister .
zapatero , who appointed spain 's first half-female cabinet , was expected to give the defense portfolio to a woman , possibly to elena salgado , who held the health and then the public administration portfolio in the previous government .
the premier was due to announce the composition of the new government after being sworn in by king juan carlos on saturday . dw staff / dpa -lrb- nda -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de science -pipe- 11.04.2008 germany eases stem cell restrictions großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : scientists will have more stem cell lines to choose from after months of political negotiations , german lawmakers agreed to allow broader embryonic stem cell use .
but they signaled their ambivalence by refusing to completely do away with restrictions . hundreds of stem-cell lines previously off-limits to german scientists will be made available under a law passed by a majority of germany 's lower house of parliament on friday , april 11 .
but the decision represents a compromise in a debate which has raged for months over the ethics of using embryonic stem cells for scientific research .
on friday , lawmakers debated various measures which ranged from a complete liberalization to a complete prohibition of stem-cell use before deciding on a compromise measure .
the final vote cut across party lines , with 346 german lawmakers in favor of the revision while 228 voted against it and six abstained .
researchers welcome new law bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the stem cell issue divided the german legislature german scientists had long complained that the restrictive laws put them at a disadvantage compared with their peers in other countries .
germany 's science minister , annette schavan , said reforming the law was key to fostering research in germany .
“ this is a good day for both protecting life and also for research in germany , “ schavan , of the christian democratic union , said after the vote friday . the german research foundation -lrb- dfg -rrb- , max-planck-institute , the helmholz association and the federation of german industries -lrb- bdi -rrb- also welcomed the vote . “ the changes give german researchers the chance to stay competitive internationally , ” said max planck institute president peter gruss . more options for scientists bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : stem cells are thought to offer disease-curing potential german scientists had pushed for germany to reconsider a 2002 law which imposed strict limits on the use of embryonic stem cells in medical research .
while the law banned all creation of stem cells in germany , it did allow cells produced from abroad to be imported , but only if they had been created before jan .
1 , 2002 .
scientists also had to show that the project had overwhelming significance and that no other research method could be used .
scientists had complained that tight laws prevented them from taking part in international projects using stem cell lines created after 2002 .
other european countries , such as britain and sweden , have less strict laws .
the new law allows for a more recent cut-off date of may 1 , 2007 for the import of stem-cell lines .
advocates of the change claim that it will increase the number of stem-cell lines available to german scientists from 40 to 500 .
echoes of nazi experiments ?
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : politicians voted their conscience embryonic stem cells are prized by scientists for their ability to develop into any type of cell .
this versatility has led scientists to trump stem cells as offering the potential to cure diseases such as diabetes , parkinson 's and heart maladies .
yet in germany , the use of embryonic stem cells makes many people uncomfortable on religious and ethical grounds .
stem cell research carries historic overtones of the nazis ' genetic experiments linked to the creation of a master race .
traumatized by grisly experiments on humans under the nazis and influenced by its christian churches , germany has agonized for a decade about the ethics of using the cells .
critics argue that a human life is sacrificed when an embryo is torn apart .
religious groups expressed unhappiness with the parliament 's decision .
" this is not a good day for the protection of life in germany , “ said munich archbishop reinhard marx . guenther beckstein , bavaria ’ s conservative premier , also said he thought the change would set a dangerous precedent . “ my worry is that it will now become easier to further undermine the protection of unborn life , ” beckstein said .
critics have pointed to new research advances in bolstering their claim that stem cells are unnecessary .
scientists recently discovered a way to re-program adult stem cells to make them pluripotent , or capable of acting like embryonic stem cells .
the search for a substitute bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : embryonic stem cells still ca n't be produced in germany but scientists counter they still need the embryonic cells to compare with these induced pluripotent cells .
in november 2007 , teams of us and japanese researchers said they had reprogrammed human skin cells to function like embryonic stem cells .
on the surface , this could mean that scientists would no longer have to rely on embryonic stem cells .
but " these new , reprogrammed cells still have to be compared with real embryonic stem cell lines to see if they function the same way , " said joerg hacker , vice president of the german research foundation .
shortly after the november announcement , the german government announced it would double its funding for stem-cell research from 5 million euros -lrb- $ 7.4 million -rrb- to just under 10 million euros , albeit only for adult stem cells . dw staff -lrb- th -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de elections -pipe- 11.04.2008 spain 's re-elected zapatero faces long list of challenges großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : spain 's prime minister jose luis rodriguez zapatero has a lot to do in his second term spanish prime minister jose luis rodriguez zapatero 's premiership was reconfirmed by parliament friday , april 11 .
he faces a second term of economic challenges and continuing concerns over regional separatism . the new legislature was , however , opening in a more conciliatory political atmosphere than the previous one , making it easier for spanish socialist leader zapatero to try to buttress up the economy and to seek support in the fight against the militant basque separatist group eta .
the 47-year-old was the first spanish prime minister elected in a popular vote to be reconfirmed with a simple majority in a second round of voting , after failing to win an absolute majority in the first round .
the socialists increased their number of seats by five to 169 in the 350-member parliament , but did not get an absolute majority in the elections a month ago .
zapatero had deliberately opted for a simple majority in the parliamentary vote in order to maintain his political independence from basque and catalan regionalists , whose votes could have allowed him to be elected in the first round , but who would have demanded a price for their support .
the government 's concessions to regions demanding more autonomy had earlier created divisions with the opposition conservatives , who accused zapatero of endangering the unity of spain .
growing calls for autonomy during the upcoming legislature , it is expected that the basques will attempt to stage a regional referendum on a self-government bordering on independence , which the socialists were planning to prevent by offering the region more autonomy instead .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : eta 's armed struggle has claimed lives on zapatero 's watch basque regional premier juan jose ibarretxe believes the referendum could help to end the violence associated with the basque separatist group eta , which has killed three people since negotiations between eta and madrid collapsed in 2006 .
the negotiation attempt sparked a barrage of criticism from the conservative people 's party -lrb- pp -rrb- , which slammed the government for " surrendering " to terrorists .
zapatero has resumed police crackdowns against eta and made it understood that he will not talk to the group again , a move which is expected to help to pacify the political atmosphere .
zapatero has also pledged to seek a cross-party consensus on other issues including a reform of regional financial autonomy rule , spain 's europe policy and judicial reform .
the previous legislature was marked by liberal social reforms , such as gay marriage and speedy divorce .
the issues divided the country and catholic clergymen lambasted the government at rallies in defense of the traditional family .
the government was not , however , expected to pursue other controversial reforms , such as a more liberal abortion law or the legalization of euthanasia , during the upcoming legislature .
reversing economic downturn bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : spain 's finances are another area of concern for the pm zapatero is more concerned with the state of spain 's economy , which is expected to be hit harder than most other western countries by the global economic problems , with growth plunging from 3.8 per cent in 2007 to possibly even less than 2 per cent this year .
the premier has pledged measures to soften the blow , such as an increase of public works to absorb workers from the long overheated , rapidly shrinking construction industry , which has accounted for nearly 20 per cent of spain 's gross domestic product -lrb- gdp -rrb- .
despite the general improvement in the political atmosphere , the socialists ' relations with other parties have evolved in such a way that zapatero will be able to pass laws with the support of smaller parties only on a case-by-case basis .
previously , he had been able to rely on the far-left izquierda unida -lrb- iu -rrb- and on the catalan republican party erc for the initial part of the legislature .
no major reshuffle bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : foreign minister moratinos is likely to remain in office zapatero was expected to make relatively few changes in the composition of his government , retaining his popular deputy maria teresa fernandez de la vega , as well as pedro solbes as economics minister , miguel angel moratinos as foreign minister and alfredo perez rubalcaba as interior minister .
zapatero , who appointed spain 's first half-female cabinet , was expected to give the defense portfolio to a woman , possibly to elena salgado , who held the health and then the public administration portfolio in the previous government .

yet the winner could be a familiar face : former prime minister and media tycoon silvio berlusconi . berlusconi is so confident of his lead in the polls that he spent his recent campaign rallies acting as if he 's already won the weekend election .
but his main rival , former rome mayor walter veltroni , promised that the center-right politician will be in for a nasty surprise after votes are counted .
veltroni spent the last days of the campaign criss-crossing italy in a bus , attempting to shave away berlusconi 's lead , which the last polls held two weeks ago put at 6 percentage points .
both men made impassioned pleas to supporters in the final days of their campaigns .
berlusconi , a 71-year-old self-made billionaire , urged his supporters to help him win over undecided voters ahead of elections sunday , april 13 and monday , april 14 .
veltroni , 52 , told voters on friday that berlusconi was " no statesman " and promised an upset .
veltroni has also been hammering away at berlusconi 's economic record , accusing him of making poor economic decisions .
slowing economy an election issue bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : election fatigue is reportedly high among voters italy 's next prime minister will have to contend with the country 's sputtering economy .
italy faces not only a sharp economic slowdown , but also record-high inflation and low wages .
the international monetary fund expects italy 's economy , the euro zone 's third largest , to grow just 0.3 percent this year .
the two candidates offered similar economic platforms with both pledging tax cuts and reduced government spending .
alexander kockerbeck , a senior credit officer at moody 's investors service , said the targets set by the two main candidates would be difficult to achieve without a clear election mandate .
" if the outcome -lrb- of the vote -rrb- is unclear , the risk is a delay in carrying out necessary reforms , " kockerbeck told reuters news agency .
fed up with politicians bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : vetroni thinks he can pull off an upset italy 's political class is viewed by much of the population as corrupt , incompetent and gridlocked . voters have been appalled by the trash piled on the streets of naples and toxins in the country 's beloved buffalo mozzarella cheese .
" anything politicians touch , it 's the kiss of death , the opposite of king midas , " bocconi university professor carlo alberto carnevale-maffe told reuters .
berlusconi was head of the government between 2001 and 2006 .
he owns a media empire which includes three of italy 's seven national television networks .
implicated in a string of corruption probes , berlusconi has been criticized for running up a budget deficit equal to 4.4 percent of gross domestic product -lrb- gdp -rrb- during his second premiership .
since being forced out of power in 2006 , he has lobbed scorn from the sidelines as his political opponents have struggled to keep a fractious coalition together .
the government of prime minister romano prodi collapsed in january when a small centrist party withdrew its support .
worries of a tie bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : even mozarella has been tained by politics veltroni predicted a surprise win for his center-left party , saying voters were " way ahead of politics , newspapers and polls . "
" you 'll see that on april 13 we 'll have some surprises , " veltroni said .
even with the lead enjoyed by berlusconi 's pdl party , the senate race , where votes are determined by region , is expected to be tight .
some analysts have warned that if no party or coalition emerges with a clear-cut majority in the senate , italy could be in danger of having a " hung parliament " which would be unable to govern .
" the electoral campaign ends today with the ever more burdensome specter of a result that is not called for in politics : a tie , " the daily la stampa newspaper said in an editorial .
berlusconi wants clear mandate bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the naples trash scandal was a political lowpoint analysts have predicted a lower turnout than in 2006 , when nearly 84 per cent of eligible voters cast ballots in what turned out to be the closest election in modern italian history .
berlusconi tried to prevent a close race at his final campaign rallies , urging supporters to the polls .
" go and convert people , " berlusconi told supporters at one of his last election rallies outside rome 's coliseum .
" it 's important .
you have missionary work to do towards all the undecided voters .
you are the missionaries of truth and freedom , " berlusconi said , his voice hoarse from non-stop campaigning .
berlusconi also accused veltroni of a " campaign of lies " and his party of being communists in disguise .
veltroni , a movie buff and one-time journalist , was a communist in the 1970s , but eventually became a social democrat .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de elections -pipe- 11.04.2008 spain 's re-elected zapatero faces long list of challenges großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : spain 's prime minister jose luis rodriguez zapatero has a lot to do in his second term spanish prime minister jose luis rodriguez zapatero 's premiership was reconfirmed by parliament friday , april 11 .
he faces a second term of economic challenges and continuing concerns over regional separatism . the new legislature was , however , opening in a more conciliatory political atmosphere than the previous one , making it easier for spanish socialist leader zapatero to try to buttress up the economy and to seek support in the fight against the militant basque separatist group eta .
the 47-year-old was the first spanish prime minister elected in a popular vote to be reconfirmed with a simple majority in a second round of voting , after failing to win an absolute majority in the first round .
the socialists increased their number of seats by five to 169 in the 350-member parliament , but did not get an absolute majority in the elections a month ago .
zapatero had deliberately opted for a simple majority in the parliamentary vote in order to maintain his political independence from basque and catalan regionalists , whose votes could have allowed him to be elected in the first round , but who would have demanded a price for their support .
the government 's concessions to regions demanding more autonomy had earlier created divisions with the opposition conservatives , who accused zapatero of endangering the unity of spain .
growing calls for autonomy during the upcoming legislature , it is expected that the basques will attempt to stage a regional referendum on a self-government bordering on independence , which the socialists were planning to prevent by offering the region more autonomy instead .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : eta 's armed struggle has claimed lives on zapatero 's watch basque regional premier juan jose ibarretxe believes the referendum could help to end the violence associated with the basque separatist group eta , which has killed three people since negotiations between eta and madrid collapsed in 2006 .
the negotiation attempt sparked a barrage of criticism from the conservative people 's party -lrb- pp -rrb- , which slammed the government for " surrendering " to terrorists .
zapatero has resumed police crackdowns against eta and made it understood that he will not talk to the group again , a move which is expected to help to pacify the political atmosphere .
zapatero has also pledged to seek a cross-party consensus on other issues including a reform of regional financial autonomy rule , spain 's europe policy and judicial reform .
the previous legislature was marked by liberal social reforms , such as gay marriage and speedy divorce .
the issues divided the country and catholic clergymen lambasted the government at rallies in defense of the traditional family .
the government was not , however , expected to pursue other controversial reforms , such as a more liberal abortion law or the legalization of euthanasia , during the upcoming legislature .
reversing economic downturn bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : spain 's finances are another area of concern for the pm zapatero is more concerned with the state of spain 's economy , which is expected to be hit harder than most other western countries by the global economic problems , with growth plunging from 3.8 per cent in 2007 to possibly even less than 2 per cent this year .
the premier has pledged measures to soften the blow , such as an increase of public works to absorb workers from the long overheated , rapidly shrinking construction industry , which has accounted for nearly 20 per cent of spain 's gross domestic product -lrb- gdp -rrb- .
despite the general improvement in the political atmosphere , the socialists ' relations with other parties have evolved in such a way that zapatero will be able to pass laws with the support of smaller parties only on a case-by-case basis .
previously , he had been able to rely on the far-left izquierda unida -lrb- iu -rrb- and on the catalan republican party erc for the initial part of the legislature .
no major reshuffle bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : foreign minister moratinos is likely to remain in office zapatero was expected to make relatively few changes in the composition of his government , retaining his popular deputy maria teresa fernandez de la vega , as well as pedro solbes as economics minister , miguel angel moratinos as foreign minister and alfredo perez rubalcaba as interior minister .
zapatero , who appointed spain 's first half-female cabinet , was expected to give the defense portfolio to a woman , possibly to elena salgado , who held the health and then the public administration portfolio in the previous government .
the premier was due to announce the composition of the new government after being sworn in by king juan carlos on saturday . dw staff / dpa -lrb- nda -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

he faces a second term of economic challenges and continuing concerns over regional separatism . the new legislature was , however , opening in a more conciliatory political atmosphere than the previous one , making it easier for spanish socialist leader zapatero to try to buttress up the economy and to seek support in the fight against the militant basque separatist group eta .
the 47-year-old was the first spanish prime minister elected in a popular vote to be reconfirmed with a simple majority in a second round of voting , after failing to win an absolute majority in the first round .
the socialists increased their number of seats by five to 169 in the 350-member parliament , but did not get an absolute majority in the elections a month ago .
zapatero had deliberately opted for a simple majority in the parliamentary vote in order to maintain his political independence from basque and catalan regionalists , whose votes could have allowed him to be elected in the first round , but who would have demanded a price for their support .
the government 's concessions to regions demanding more autonomy had earlier created divisions with the opposition conservatives , who accused zapatero of endangering the unity of spain .
growing calls for autonomy during the upcoming legislature , it is expected that the basques will attempt to stage a regional referendum on a self-government bordering on independence , which the socialists were planning to prevent by offering the region more autonomy instead .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : eta 's armed struggle has claimed lives on zapatero 's watch basque regional premier juan jose ibarretxe believes the referendum could help to end the violence associated with the basque separatist group eta , which has killed three people since negotiations between eta and madrid collapsed in 2006 .
the negotiation attempt sparked a barrage of criticism from the conservative people 's party -lrb- pp -rrb- , which slammed the government for " surrendering " to terrorists .
zapatero has resumed police crackdowns against eta and made it understood that he will not talk to the group again , a move which is expected to help to pacify the political atmosphere .
zapatero has also pledged to seek a cross-party consensus on other issues including a reform of regional financial autonomy rule , spain 's europe policy and judicial reform .
the previous legislature was marked by liberal social reforms , such as gay marriage and speedy divorce .
the issues divided the country and catholic clergymen lambasted the government at rallies in defense of the traditional family .
the government was not , however , expected to pursue other controversial reforms , such as a more liberal abortion law or the legalization of euthanasia , during the upcoming legislature .
reversing economic downturn bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : spain 's finances are another area of concern for the pm zapatero is more concerned with the state of spain 's economy , which is expected to be hit harder than most other western countries by the global economic problems , with growth plunging from 3.8 per cent in 2007 to possibly even less than 2 per cent this year .
the premier has pledged measures to soften the blow , such as an increase of public works to absorb workers from the long overheated , rapidly shrinking construction industry , which has accounted for nearly 20 per cent of spain 's gross domestic product -lrb- gdp -rrb- .
despite the general improvement in the political atmosphere , the socialists ' relations with other parties have evolved in such a way that zapatero will be able to pass laws with the support of smaller parties only on a case-by-case basis .
previously , he had been able to rely on the far-left izquierda unida -lrb- iu -rrb- and on the catalan republican party erc for the initial part of the legislature .
no major reshuffle bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : foreign minister moratinos is likely to remain in office zapatero was expected to make relatively few changes in the composition of his government , retaining his popular deputy maria teresa fernandez de la vega , as well as pedro solbes as economics minister , miguel angel moratinos as foreign minister and alfredo perez rubalcaba as interior minister .
zapatero , who appointed spain 's first half-female cabinet , was expected to give the defense portfolio to a woman , possibly to elena salgado , who held the health and then the public administration portfolio in the previous government .
the premier was due to announce the composition of the new government after being sworn in by king juan carlos on saturday . dw staff / dpa -lrb- nda -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

nudity among the aged in the pursuit of health and wellness is positively encouraged in some places .
however , theater stages in front of large , clothed audiences are usually not among them .
if the idea of a bunch of wrinklies in their well-worn birthday suits cavorting on stage in the name of entertainment is n't enough to disturb you and give you nightmares , then imagine said oldies frolicking around in the ashes of the world trade center while wearing mickey mouse masks .
or do n't , if you value your sanity .
but this is n't some bizarre sex fetish show catering for " appreciators of the mature " on the hamburg reeperbahn .
this is high culture , german style .
the 35 oaps in the all-together form just one part of the erfurt theater 's sell-out reinterpretation of verdi 's opera , " a masked ball . "
and for those thinking that some crazy young thing has perverted a classical masterpiece just to get some cheap publicity , it may come as some surprise that the opera is actually no stranger to controversy .
original scandal pales into insignificance bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : we 'll let your imagination come up with the rest giuseppe verdi wrote the piece about the 1792 assassination of swedish king gustavus iii , who was shot while attending a masked ball .
nineteenth-century censors demanded that verdi move the opera 's setting from europe to colonial america so as not to depict the assassination of a european monarch .
while there were no geriatric genitalia on show back then , it was deemed to be quite the scandal at the time .
austrian director johann kresnik may have added more than spattering of senior skin to the modern version but he adheres to the relocation ordered by the prudes of verdi 's time and stages his bizarre take on the opera in the united states just as they would have liked .
except the post 9/11 , disney-clad ageing nudes may have caused them to rethink their priorities somewhat .
" it 's a very beautiful , poetic scene , " guy montavon , the theatre 's general manager , explained to nervous reporters when timidly questioned about the exhibitionist pensioners .
" the concept is a little critical about america , the world of america with very rich people , very poor people , with war and the excesses of american society today , " he added to general bafflement .
politician 's censorship bid outstripped by public clamor bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the real ground zero without naked old people the show has already found its 21st-century version of verdi 's censors in the form of local politician who has called for a boycott of the production .
however , theater-goers have not heeded his call .
montavon told reporters the saturday premiere and four other performances had already sold out .
he would not be drawn , however , on rumors that business cards for local therapists would be included in the show 's program . dw staff -lrb- nda -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de southern europe -pipe- 11.04.2008 italy 's berlusconi hoping for big election win großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : berlusconi wants another go as prime minister italians have 32 choices for prime minister when they vote in national parliamentary elections this weekend .
yet the winner could be a familiar face : former prime minister and media tycoon silvio berlusconi . berlusconi is so confident of his lead in the polls that he spent his recent campaign rallies acting as if he 's already won the weekend election .
but his main rival , former rome mayor walter veltroni , promised that the center-right politician will be in for a nasty surprise after votes are counted .
veltroni spent the last days of the campaign criss-crossing italy in a bus , attempting to shave away berlusconi 's lead , which the last polls held two weeks ago put at 6 percentage points .
both men made impassioned pleas to supporters in the final days of their campaigns .
berlusconi , a 71-year-old self-made billionaire , urged his supporters to help him win over undecided voters ahead of elections sunday , april 13 and monday , april 14 .
veltroni , 52 , told voters on friday that berlusconi was " no statesman " and promised an upset .
veltroni has also been hammering away at berlusconi 's economic record , accusing him of making poor economic decisions .
slowing economy an election issue bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : election fatigue is reportedly high among voters italy 's next prime minister will have to contend with the country 's sputtering economy .
italy faces not only a sharp economic slowdown , but also record-high inflation and low wages .
the international monetary fund expects italy 's economy , the euro zone 's third largest , to grow just 0.3 percent this year .
the two candidates offered similar economic platforms with both pledging tax cuts and reduced government spending .
alexander kockerbeck , a senior credit officer at moody 's investors service , said the targets set by the two main candidates would be difficult to achieve without a clear election mandate .
" if the outcome -lrb- of the vote -rrb- is unclear , the risk is a delay in carrying out necessary reforms , " kockerbeck told reuters news agency .
fed up with politicians bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : vetroni thinks he can pull off an upset italy 's political class is viewed by much of the population as corrupt , incompetent and gridlocked . voters have been appalled by the trash piled on the streets of naples and toxins in the country 's beloved buffalo mozzarella cheese .
" anything politicians touch , it 's the kiss of death , the opposite of king midas , " bocconi university professor carlo alberto carnevale-maffe told reuters .
berlusconi was head of the government between 2001 and 2006 .
he owns a media empire which includes three of italy 's seven national television networks .
implicated in a string of corruption probes , berlusconi has been criticized for running up a budget deficit equal to 4.4 percent of gross domestic product -lrb- gdp -rrb- during his second premiership .
since being forced out of power in 2006 , he has lobbed scorn from the sidelines as his political opponents have struggled to keep a fractious coalition together .
the government of prime minister romano prodi collapsed in january when a small centrist party withdrew its support .
worries of a tie bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : even mozarella has been tained by politics veltroni predicted a surprise win for his center-left party , saying voters were " way ahead of politics , newspapers and polls . "
" you 'll see that on april 13 we 'll have some surprises , " veltroni said .
even with the lead enjoyed by berlusconi 's pdl party , the senate race , where votes are determined by region , is expected to be tight .
some analysts have warned that if no party or coalition emerges with a clear-cut majority in the senate , italy could be in danger of having a " hung parliament " which would be unable to govern .
" the electoral campaign ends today with the ever more burdensome specter of a result that is not called for in politics : a tie , " the daily la stampa newspaper said in an editorial .
berlusconi wants clear mandate bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the naples trash scandal was a political lowpoint analysts have predicted a lower turnout than in 2006 , when nearly 84 per cent of eligible voters cast ballots in what turned out to be the closest election in modern italian history .
berlusconi tried to prevent a close race at his final campaign rallies , urging supporters to the polls .
" go and convert people , " berlusconi told supporters at one of his last election rallies outside rome 's coliseum .
" it 's important .
you have missionary work to do towards all the undecided voters .
you are the missionaries of truth and freedom , " berlusconi said , his voice hoarse from non-stop campaigning .
berlusconi also accused veltroni of a " campaign of lies " and his party of being communists in disguise .
veltroni , a movie buff and one-time journalist , was a communist in the 1970s , but eventually became a social democrat .

they 've demanded that ebay remove the items immediately . the offensive fan paraphernalia , available on ebay 's german and austria auction web sites , contains the phrase , " zick zack zigeunerpack , " one of several slurs chanted by far-right soccer fans . stemming from the nazi era , the slogan refers to the roma minority as " gypsy scum . " germany 's central council of sinti and roma said on thursday , april 10 , that it would pursue legal action against the manufacturers of the items . " even if this slur is partly aimed against supporters of certain soccer clubs it is a massive insult to roma and sinti , " said the council 's chairman , romani rose . in a statement , the council also appealed to internet search-engine google to block searches related to the slogan . roma were among the minority groups targeted by the nazis .
about half a million were killed during the holocaust . council spokesman arnold rossderf said the body wanted to make sure that " young people who are not necessarily informed about the past realize that it is wrong and insulting to use such expressions .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de elections -pipe- 11.04.2008 spain 's re-elected zapatero faces long list of challenges großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : spain 's prime minister jose luis rodriguez zapatero has a lot to do in his second term spanish prime minister jose luis rodriguez zapatero 's premiership was reconfirmed by parliament friday , april 11 .
he faces a second term of economic challenges and continuing concerns over regional separatism . the new legislature was , however , opening in a more conciliatory political atmosphere than the previous one , making it easier for spanish socialist leader zapatero to try to buttress up the economy and to seek support in the fight against the militant basque separatist group eta .
the 47-year-old was the first spanish prime minister elected in a popular vote to be reconfirmed with a simple majority in a second round of voting , after failing to win an absolute majority in the first round .
the socialists increased their number of seats by five to 169 in the 350-member parliament , but did not get an absolute majority in the elections a month ago .
zapatero had deliberately opted for a simple majority in the parliamentary vote in order to maintain his political independence from basque and catalan regionalists , whose votes could have allowed him to be elected in the first round , but who would have demanded a price for their support .
the government 's concessions to regions demanding more autonomy had earlier created divisions with the opposition conservatives , who accused zapatero of endangering the unity of spain .
growing calls for autonomy during the upcoming legislature , it is expected that the basques will attempt to stage a regional referendum on a self-government bordering on independence , which the socialists were planning to prevent by offering the region more autonomy instead .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : eta 's armed struggle has claimed lives on zapatero 's watch basque regional premier juan jose ibarretxe believes the referendum could help to end the violence associated with the basque separatist group eta , which has killed three people since negotiations between eta and madrid collapsed in 2006 .
the negotiation attempt sparked a barrage of criticism from the conservative people 's party -lrb- pp -rrb- , which slammed the government for " surrendering " to terrorists .
zapatero has resumed police crackdowns against eta and made it understood that he will not talk to the group again , a move which is expected to help to pacify the political atmosphere .
zapatero has also pledged to seek a cross-party consensus on other issues including a reform of regional financial autonomy rule , spain 's europe policy and judicial reform .
the previous legislature was marked by liberal social reforms , such as gay marriage and speedy divorce .
the issues divided the country and catholic clergymen lambasted the government at rallies in defense of the traditional family .
the government was not , however , expected to pursue other controversial reforms , such as a more liberal abortion law or the legalization of euthanasia , during the upcoming legislature .
reversing economic downturn bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : spain 's finances are another area of concern for the pm zapatero is more concerned with the state of spain 's economy , which is expected to be hit harder than most other western countries by the global economic problems , with growth plunging from 3.8 per cent in 2007 to possibly even less than 2 per cent this year .
the premier has pledged measures to soften the blow , such as an increase of public works to absorb workers from the long overheated , rapidly shrinking construction industry , which has accounted for nearly 20 per cent of spain 's gross domestic product -lrb- gdp -rrb- .
despite the general improvement in the political atmosphere , the socialists ' relations with other parties have evolved in such a way that zapatero will be able to pass laws with the support of smaller parties only on a case-by-case basis .
previously , he had been able to rely on the far-left izquierda unida -lrb- iu -rrb- and on the catalan republican party erc for the initial part of the legislature .
no major reshuffle bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : foreign minister moratinos is likely to remain in office zapatero was expected to make relatively few changes in the composition of his government , retaining his popular deputy maria teresa fernandez de la vega , as well as pedro solbes as economics minister , miguel angel moratinos as foreign minister and alfredo perez rubalcaba as interior minister .
zapatero , who appointed spain 's first half-female cabinet , was expected to give the defense portfolio to a woman , possibly to elena salgado , who held the health and then the public administration portfolio in the previous government .
the premier was due to announce the composition of the new government after being sworn in by king juan carlos on saturday . dw staff / dpa -lrb- nda -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?
dw-world.de spain 's zapatero favors low profile in foreign policy reelected in circumstances similar to in 2004 , zapatero will likely demure to the eu when it comes to international politics .
except in the bloc 's relations with latin america , where he can take a lead role .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de elections -pipe- 11.04.2008 spain 's re-elected zapatero faces long list of challenges großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : spain 's prime minister jose luis rodriguez zapatero has a lot to do in his second term spanish prime minister jose luis rodriguez zapatero 's premiership was reconfirmed by parliament friday , april 11 .
he faces a second term of economic challenges and continuing concerns over regional separatism . the new legislature was , however , opening in a more conciliatory political atmosphere than the previous one , making it easier for spanish socialist leader zapatero to try to buttress up the economy and to seek support in the fight against the militant basque separatist group eta .
the 47-year-old was the first spanish prime minister elected in a popular vote to be reconfirmed with a simple majority in a second round of voting , after failing to win an absolute majority in the first round .
the socialists increased their number of seats by five to 169 in the 350-member parliament , but did not get an absolute majority in the elections a month ago .
zapatero had deliberately opted for a simple majority in the parliamentary vote in order to maintain his political independence from basque and catalan regionalists , whose votes could have allowed him to be elected in the first round , but who would have demanded a price for their support .
the government 's concessions to regions demanding more autonomy had earlier created divisions with the opposition conservatives , who accused zapatero of endangering the unity of spain .
growing calls for autonomy during the upcoming legislature , it is expected that the basques will attempt to stage a regional referendum on a self-government bordering on independence , which the socialists were planning to prevent by offering the region more autonomy instead .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : eta 's armed struggle has claimed lives on zapatero 's watch basque regional premier juan jose ibarretxe believes the referendum could help to end the violence associated with the basque separatist group eta , which has killed three people since negotiations between eta and madrid collapsed in 2006 .
the negotiation attempt sparked a barrage of criticism from the conservative people 's party -lrb- pp -rrb- , which slammed the government for " surrendering " to terrorists .
zapatero has resumed police crackdowns against eta and made it understood that he will not talk to the group again , a move which is expected to help to pacify the political atmosphere .
zapatero has also pledged to seek a cross-party consensus on other issues including a reform of regional financial autonomy rule , spain 's europe policy and judicial reform .
the previous legislature was marked by liberal social reforms , such as gay marriage and speedy divorce .
the issues divided the country and catholic clergymen lambasted the government at rallies in defense of the traditional family .
the government was not , however , expected to pursue other controversial reforms , such as a more liberal abortion law or the legalization of euthanasia , during the upcoming legislature .
reversing economic downturn bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : spain 's finances are another area of concern for the pm zapatero is more concerned with the state of spain 's economy , which is expected to be hit harder than most other western countries by the global economic problems , with growth plunging from 3.8 per cent in 2007 to possibly even less than 2 per cent this year .
the premier has pledged measures to soften the blow , such as an increase of public works to absorb workers from the long overheated , rapidly shrinking construction industry , which has accounted for nearly 20 per cent of spain 's gross domestic product -lrb- gdp -rrb- .
despite the general improvement in the political atmosphere , the socialists ' relations with other parties have evolved in such a way that zapatero will be able to pass laws with the support of smaller parties only on a case-by-case basis .
previously , he had been able to rely on the far-left izquierda unida -lrb- iu -rrb- and on the catalan republican party erc for the initial part of the legislature .
no major reshuffle bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : foreign minister moratinos is likely to remain in office zapatero was expected to make relatively few changes in the composition of his government , retaining his popular deputy maria teresa fernandez de la vega , as well as pedro solbes as economics minister , miguel angel moratinos as foreign minister and alfredo perez rubalcaba as interior minister .
zapatero , who appointed spain 's first half-female cabinet , was expected to give the defense portfolio to a woman , possibly to elena salgado , who held the health and then the public administration portfolio in the previous government .
the premier was due to announce the composition of the new government after being sworn in by king juan carlos on saturday . dw staff / dpa -lrb- nda -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

the negotiation attempt sparked a barrage of criticism from the conservative people 's party -lrb- pp -rrb- , which slammed the government for " surrendering " to terrorists .
zapatero has resumed police crackdowns against eta and made it understood that he will not talk to the group again , a move which is expected to help to pacify the political atmosphere .
zapatero has also pledged to seek a cross-party consensus on other issues including a reform of regional financial autonomy rule , spain 's europe policy and judicial reform .
the previous legislature was marked by liberal social reforms , such as gay marriage and speedy divorce .
the issues divided the country and catholic clergymen lambasted the government at rallies in defense of the traditional family .
the government was not , however , expected to pursue other controversial reforms , such as a more liberal abortion law or the legalization of euthanasia , during the upcoming legislature .
reversing economic downturn bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : spain 's finances are another area of concern for the pm zapatero is more concerned with the state of spain 's economy , which is expected to be hit harder than most other western countries by the global economic problems , with growth plunging from 3.8 per cent in 2007 to possibly even less than 2 per cent this year .
the premier has pledged measures to soften the blow , such as an increase of public works to absorb workers from the long overheated , rapidly shrinking construction industry , which has accounted for nearly 20 per cent of spain 's gross domestic product -lrb- gdp -rrb- .
despite the general improvement in the political atmosphere , the socialists ' relations with other parties have evolved in such a way that zapatero will be able to pass laws with the support of smaller parties only on a case-by-case basis .
previously , he had been able to rely on the far-left izquierda unida -lrb- iu -rrb- and on the catalan republican party erc for the initial part of the legislature .
no major reshuffle bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : foreign minister moratinos is likely to remain in office zapatero was expected to make relatively few changes in the composition of his government , retaining his popular deputy maria teresa fernandez de la vega , as well as pedro solbes as economics minister , miguel angel moratinos as foreign minister and alfredo perez rubalcaba as interior minister .
zapatero , who appointed spain 's first half-female cabinet , was expected to give the defense portfolio to a woman , possibly to elena salgado , who held the health and then the public administration portfolio in the previous government .
the premier was due to announce the composition of the new government after being sworn in by king juan carlos on saturday . dw staff / dpa -lrb- nda -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

yet the winner could be a familiar face : former prime minister and media tycoon silvio berlusconi . berlusconi is so confident of his lead in the polls that he spent his recent campaign rallies acting as if he 's already won the weekend election .
but his main rival , former rome mayor walter veltroni , promised that the center-right politician will be in for a nasty surprise after votes are counted .
veltroni spent the last days of the campaign criss-crossing italy in a bus , attempting to shave away berlusconi 's lead , which the last polls held two weeks ago put at 6 percentage points .
both men made impassioned pleas to supporters in the final days of their campaigns .
berlusconi , a 71-year-old self-made billionaire , urged his supporters to help him win over undecided voters ahead of elections sunday , april 13 and monday , april 14 .
veltroni , 52 , told voters on friday that berlusconi was " no statesman " and promised an upset .
veltroni has also been hammering away at berlusconi 's economic record , accusing him of making poor economic decisions .
slowing economy an election issue bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : election fatigue is reportedly high among voters italy 's next prime minister will have to contend with the country 's sputtering economy .
italy faces not only a sharp economic slowdown , but also record-high inflation and low wages .
the international monetary fund expects italy 's economy , the euro zone 's third largest , to grow just 0.3 percent this year .
the two candidates offered similar economic platforms with both pledging tax cuts and reduced government spending .
alexander kockerbeck , a senior credit officer at moody 's investors service , said the targets set by the two main candidates would be difficult to achieve without a clear election mandate .
" if the outcome -lrb- of the vote -rrb- is unclear , the risk is a delay in carrying out necessary reforms , " kockerbeck told reuters news agency .
fed up with politicians bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : vetroni thinks he can pull off an upset italy 's political class is viewed by much of the population as corrupt , incompetent and gridlocked . voters have been appalled by the trash piled on the streets of naples and toxins in the country 's beloved buffalo mozzarella cheese .
" anything politicians touch , it 's the kiss of death , the opposite of king midas , " bocconi university professor carlo alberto carnevale-maffe told reuters .
berlusconi was head of the government between 2001 and 2006 .
he owns a media empire which includes three of italy 's seven national television networks .
implicated in a string of corruption probes , berlusconi has been criticized for running up a budget deficit equal to 4.4 percent of gross domestic product -lrb- gdp -rrb- during his second premiership .
since being forced out of power in 2006 , he has lobbed scorn from the sidelines as his political opponents have struggled to keep a fractious coalition together .
the government of prime minister romano prodi collapsed in january when a small centrist party withdrew its support .
worries of a tie bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : even mozarella has been tained by politics veltroni predicted a surprise win for his center-left party , saying voters were " way ahead of politics , newspapers and polls . "
" you 'll see that on april 13 we 'll have some surprises , " veltroni said .
even with the lead enjoyed by berlusconi 's pdl party , the senate race , where votes are determined by region , is expected to be tight .
some analysts have warned that if no party or coalition emerges with a clear-cut majority in the senate , italy could be in danger of having a " hung parliament " which would be unable to govern .
" the electoral campaign ends today with the ever more burdensome specter of a result that is not called for in politics : a tie , " the daily la stampa newspaper said in an editorial .
berlusconi wants clear mandate bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the naples trash scandal was a political lowpoint analysts have predicted a lower turnout than in 2006 , when nearly 84 per cent of eligible voters cast ballots in what turned out to be the closest election in modern italian history .
berlusconi tried to prevent a close race at his final campaign rallies , urging supporters to the polls .
" go and convert people , " berlusconi told supporters at one of his last election rallies outside rome 's coliseum .
" it 's important .
you have missionary work to do towards all the undecided voters .
you are the missionaries of truth and freedom , " berlusconi said , his voice hoarse from non-stop campaigning .
berlusconi also accused veltroni of a " campaign of lies " and his party of being communists in disguise .
veltroni , a movie buff and one-time journalist , was a communist in the 1970s , but eventually became a social democrat .
vetroni served as rome 's mayor for seven years until he resigned to run in the national elections . dw staff -lrb- th -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

but they signaled their ambivalence by refusing to completely do away with restrictions . hundreds of stem-cell lines previously off-limits to german scientists will be made available under a law passed by a majority of germany 's lower house of parliament on friday , april 11 .
but the decision represents a compromise in a debate which has raged for months over the ethics of using embryonic stem cells for scientific research .
on friday , lawmakers debated various measures which ranged from a complete liberalization to a complete prohibition of stem-cell use before deciding on a compromise measure .
the final vote cut across party lines , with 346 german lawmakers in favor of the revision while 228 voted against it and six abstained .

"
they were enraged that former nazis held powerful positions in society , incensed over legal reforms they deemed undemocratic and angry they did n't have more of a say in running their universities . " it was a revolutionary period that aimed to create a better world , " wolfgang bittner , a former lawyer and now writer in cologne , told dw-world.de. the 66-year-old said he was " politicized " during that time as a university student . " we students felt the leaden weight of antiquated , bourgeois german society - the complacency of it , " he said . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : rudi 's legend lives on one of the spearheads of the student movement that formed as a reaction to that sentiment was rudi dutschke - an eloquent and charismatic leader and head of the socialist students union . for thousands , dutschke became a beacon for change . he was shot in west berlin on april 11 , 1968 , by josef bachmann , a laborer and sometimes burglar with alleged right-wing sympathies .
dutschke barely survived the bullets to his brain , and suffered health problems for the rest of his life , eventually dying as a result of his injuries 11 years later . students at the time blamed conservative media for stoking hatred against dutschke .
they resented the bild tabloid 's smear campaign against him and the 68ers , as those of the movement were called , believing it played a role in convincing bachmann to attempt murder . brought in the new günter wallraff , 65 , a journalist and filmmaker known nationwide for his crusades against corporate injustice , said the 1968 movement brought about changes that many people now take for granted . " the double standards for men and women in society were exposed then , greater rights and freedom for women and children were created , more power to students for democratic representation , sexual liberalization - the 1968 generation prompted all of that , " he said . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : us singer joan baez during a 1967 vietnam war protest " new life was breathed into society at the time , " he said , pointing to dramatic shifts in literature , music and design as well . but many students wanted more and had set their sights beyond germany 's borders .

he had worked with architect albert speer during the nazi regime and was suspected of having designed concentration camps during world war ii . " a generation of criminals was ruling society after the war and no one talked about what they had done .

"
they were enraged that former nazis held powerful positions in society , incensed over legal reforms they deemed undemocratic and angry they did n't have more of a say in running their universities . " it was a revolutionary period that aimed to create a better world , " wolfgang bittner , a former lawyer and now writer in cologne , told dw-world.de. the 66-year-old said he was " politicized " during that time as a university student . " we students felt the leaden weight of antiquated , bourgeois german society - the complacency of it , " he said . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : rudi 's legend lives on one of the spearheads of the student movement that formed as a reaction to that sentiment was rudi dutschke - an eloquent and charismatic leader and head of the socialist students union . for thousands , dutschke became a beacon for change . he was shot in west berlin on april 11 , 1968 , by josef bachmann , a laborer and sometimes burglar with alleged right-wing sympathies .
dutschke barely survived the bullets to his brain , and suffered health problems for the rest of his life , eventually dying as a result of his injuries 11 years later . students at the time blamed conservative media for stoking hatred against dutschke .
they resented the bild tabloid 's smear campaign against him and the 68ers , as those of the movement were called , believing it played a role in convincing bachmann to attempt murder . brought in the new günter wallraff , 65 , a journalist and filmmaker known nationwide for his crusades against corporate injustice , said the 1968 movement brought about changes that many people now take for granted . " the double standards for men and women in society were exposed then , greater rights and freedom for women and children were created , more power to students for democratic representation , sexual liberalization - the 1968 generation prompted all of that , " he said . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : us singer joan baez during a 1967 vietnam war protest " new life was breathed into society at the time , " he said , pointing to dramatic shifts in literature , music and design as well . but many students wanted more and had set their sights beyond germany 's borders .
besides being anti-authoritarian , they were also largely anti-american .
they opposed the us war in vietnam and chanted the name of vietnamese communist leader ho chi minh as they battled baton-wielding police during protests on berlin streets . revolt against nazi past the year 1968 saw university campuses in several countries transformed into battlegrounds for social change .
in paris , students were joined by labor unions ; people in poland and czechoslovakia demonstrated against repressive governments . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : demonstrations also rocked paris in may 1968 germans , however , had their own particular demons to battle . the students , and other left-wing protestors , opposed an older generation that accepted kurt georg kiesinger , a former member of the nazi party , as chancellor . they rejected the notion of a state led by president heinrich luebke , who held the office from 1959 to 1969 .
he had worked with architect albert speer during the nazi regime and was suspected of having designed concentration camps during world war ii . " a generation of criminals was ruling society after the war and no one talked about what they had done .
discussing their crimes was not even a part of our school lessons , " said wallraff . bittner agreed : " we saw that something dramatic had to happen . " an earlier death bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : joschka fischer , later german foreign minister , beaten on the street in april 1968 the student uprisings at the universities had begun even before the assassination attempt on dutschke . nine months earlier , in june 1967 , student benno ohnesorg was shot in the back of the head and killed by a plainclothes policeman during demonstrations in berlin protesting a visit by the shah of iran . that shooting outraged tens of thousands of students and hardened opposition against the grand coalition government of conservative christian democrat-led parties and center-left social democrats . the protestors were deeply disappointed by what they saw as the social democrats ' betrayal of socialism .
they also rejected the state of emergency law reforms of 1968 , which granted the cabinet the power to get laws passed , despite rejection by parliament , during a national crisis - a move the students considered non-democratic . disapproval by german public bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : women also took up jobs in factories in the 1950s the larger german society did not see the student rebels - including dutschke - and other protestors as romantic revolutionaries fighting for the greater good .
they were first considered a nuisance by many and , later , a danger . during the 1950s , germany had experienced the wirtschaftswunder , an economic boom that allowed it to bounce back from world war ii .
many germans were happy to simply have a job , a car and enough money for a european vacation . the tense atmosphere and violence that erupted following the assassination of ohnesorg and the attempted one on dutschke also gave rise to the political terrorism of the red army fraction -lrb- raf -rrb- in the late 1960s and early ' 70s , which prompted panic and distrust throughout germany . though most members of the 1968 movement rejected terrorism , the distinction between the splinter group raf and the original 68ers was unclear to many . a new 68 generation ? bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : a 1968 bombing in a frankfurt department store - the extreme side of protests the 1968 movement prompted shifts in many parts of society , and 40 years later , wallraff said a new movement could be on the horizon . " all the signs are there , " said wallraff .
" so many societal standards are being done away with , workers have to hide the fact they are in unions … changes will have to happen - just look at the growth of right-extremism in eastern germany . " the growing gap between rich and poor in germany , soaring inflation rates and decreasing health and pension benefits may likewise be contributing to a general feeling that the average citizen has been left behind despite strong economic growth . the emergence of the new left party and its growing popularity is yet another indication that the country may be poised on the brink of change . " a new social movement in germany - one that has learned from the mistakes of the past and is non-dogmatic and non-partisan - is long overdue , " wallraff said . louisa schaefer send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de from the fringe -pipe- 11.04.2008 verdi gets post 9/11 update with plenty of senior skin großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : more than sixty senior citizens auditioned to get their kit off in the new verdi production giuseppe verdi was never one to shy away from the inclusion of controversial subject matter in his operas but even he may have balked at adding an ageing , naked twist to one of his works . in some sections of german society , naked senior citizens are not only welcomed but embraced - although not always literally .
nudity among the aged in the pursuit of health and wellness is positively encouraged in some places .
however , theater stages in front of large , clothed audiences are usually not among them .
if the idea of a bunch of wrinklies in their well-worn birthday suits cavorting on stage in the name of entertainment is n't enough to disturb you and give you nightmares , then imagine said oldies frolicking around in the ashes of the world trade center while wearing mickey mouse masks .
or do n't , if you value your sanity .
but this is n't some bizarre sex fetish show catering for " appreciators of the mature " on the hamburg reeperbahn .
this is high culture , german style .
the 35 oaps in the all-together form just one part of the erfurt theater 's sell-out reinterpretation of verdi 's opera , " a masked ball . "
and for those thinking that some crazy young thing has perverted a classical masterpiece just to get some cheap publicity , it may come as some surprise that the opera is actually no stranger to controversy .
original scandal pales into insignificance bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : we 'll let your imagination come up with the rest giuseppe verdi wrote the piece about the 1792 assassination of swedish king gustavus iii , who was shot while attending a masked ball .
nineteenth-century censors demanded that verdi move the opera 's setting from europe to colonial america so as not to depict the assassination of a european monarch .
while there were no geriatric genitalia on show back then , it was deemed to be quite the scandal at the time .
austrian director johann kresnik may have added more than spattering of senior skin to the modern version but he adheres to the relocation ordered by the prudes of verdi 's time and stages his bizarre take on the opera in the united states just as they would have liked .
except the post 9/11 , disney-clad ageing nudes may have caused them to rethink their priorities somewhat .
" it 's a very beautiful , poetic scene , " guy montavon , the theatre 's general manager , explained to nervous reporters when timidly questioned about the exhibitionist pensioners .
" the concept is a little critical about america , the world of america with very rich people , very poor people , with war and the excesses of american society today , " he added to general bafflement .
politician 's censorship bid outstripped by public clamor bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the real ground zero without naked old people the show has already found its 21st-century version of verdi 's censors in the form of local politician who has called for a boycott of the production .
however , theater-goers have not heeded his call .
montavon told reporters the saturday premiere and four other performances had already sold out .
he would not be drawn , however , on rumors that business cards for local therapists would be included in the show 's program . dw staff -lrb- nda -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de science -pipe- 11.04.2008 germany eases stem cell restrictions großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : scientists will have more stem cell lines to choose from after months of political negotiations , german lawmakers agreed to allow broader embryonic stem cell use .
but they signaled their ambivalence by refusing to completely do away with restrictions . hundreds of stem-cell lines previously off-limits to german scientists will be made available under a law passed by a majority of germany 's lower house of parliament on friday , april 11 .
but the decision represents a compromise in a debate which has raged for months over the ethics of using embryonic stem cells for scientific research .
on friday , lawmakers debated various measures which ranged from a complete liberalization to a complete prohibition of stem-cell use before deciding on a compromise measure .
the final vote cut across party lines , with 346 german lawmakers in favor of the revision while 228 voted against it and six abstained .
researchers welcome new law bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the stem cell issue divided the german legislature german scientists had long complained that the restrictive laws put them at a disadvantage compared with their peers in other countries .
germany 's science minister , annette schavan , said reforming the law was key to fostering research in germany .
“ this is a good day for both protecting life and also for research in germany , “ schavan , of the christian democratic union , said after the vote friday . the german research foundation -lrb- dfg -rrb- , max-planck-institute , the helmholz association and the federation of german industries -lrb- bdi -rrb- also welcomed the vote . “ the changes give german researchers the chance to stay competitive internationally , ” said max planck institute president peter gruss . more options for scientists bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : stem cells are thought to offer disease-curing potential german scientists had pushed for germany to reconsider a 2002 law which imposed strict limits on the use of embryonic stem cells in medical research .
while the law banned all creation of stem cells in germany , it did allow cells produced from abroad to be imported , but only if they had been created before jan .
1 , 2002 .
scientists also had to show that the project had overwhelming significance and that no other research method could be used .
scientists had complained that tight laws prevented them from taking part in international projects using stem cell lines created after 2002 .
other european countries , such as britain and sweden , have less strict laws .
the new law allows for a more recent cut-off date of may 1 , 2007 for the import of stem-cell lines .
advocates of the change claim that it will increase the number of stem-cell lines available to german scientists from 40 to 500 .
echoes of nazi experiments ?
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : politicians voted their conscience embryonic stem cells are prized by scientists for their ability to develop into any type of cell .
this versatility has led scientists to trump stem cells as offering the potential to cure diseases such as diabetes , parkinson 's and heart maladies .
yet in germany , the use of embryonic stem cells makes many people uncomfortable on religious and ethical grounds .
stem cell research carries historic overtones of the nazis ' genetic experiments linked to the creation of a master race .
traumatized by grisly experiments on humans under the nazis and influenced by its christian churches , germany has agonized for a decade about the ethics of using the cells .
critics argue that a human life is sacrificed when an embryo is torn apart .
religious groups expressed unhappiness with the parliament 's decision .
" this is not a good day for the protection of life in germany , “ said munich archbishop reinhard marx . guenther beckstein , bavaria ’ s conservative premier , also said he thought the change would set a dangerous precedent . “ my worry is that it will now become easier to further undermine the protection of unborn life , ” beckstein said .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de elections -pipe- 11.04.2008 spain 's re-elected zapatero faces long list of challenges großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : spain 's prime minister jose luis rodriguez zapatero has a lot to do in his second term spanish prime minister jose luis rodriguez zapatero 's premiership was reconfirmed by parliament friday , april 11 .
he faces a second term of economic challenges and continuing concerns over regional separatism . the new legislature was , however , opening in a more conciliatory political atmosphere than the previous one , making it easier for spanish socialist leader zapatero to try to buttress up the economy and to seek support in the fight against the militant basque separatist group eta .
the 47-year-old was the first spanish prime minister elected in a popular vote to be reconfirmed with a simple majority in a second round of voting , after failing to win an absolute majority in the first round .
the socialists increased their number of seats by five to 169 in the 350-member parliament , but did not get an absolute majority in the elections a month ago .
zapatero had deliberately opted for a simple majority in the parliamentary vote in order to maintain his political independence from basque and catalan regionalists , whose votes could have allowed him to be elected in the first round , but who would have demanded a price for their support .
the government 's concessions to regions demanding more autonomy had earlier created divisions with the opposition conservatives , who accused zapatero of endangering the unity of spain .
growing calls for autonomy during the upcoming legislature , it is expected that the basques will attempt to stage a regional referendum on a self-government bordering on independence , which the socialists were planning to prevent by offering the region more autonomy instead .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : eta 's armed struggle has claimed lives on zapatero 's watch basque regional premier juan jose ibarretxe believes the referendum could help to end the violence associated with the basque separatist group eta , which has killed three people since negotiations between eta and madrid collapsed in 2006 .
the negotiation attempt sparked a barrage of criticism from the conservative people 's party -lrb- pp -rrb- , which slammed the government for " surrendering " to terrorists .
zapatero has resumed police crackdowns against eta and made it understood that he will not talk to the group again , a move which is expected to help to pacify the political atmosphere .
zapatero has also pledged to seek a cross-party consensus on other issues including a reform of regional financial autonomy rule , spain 's europe policy and judicial reform .
the previous legislature was marked by liberal social reforms , such as gay marriage and speedy divorce .
the issues divided the country and catholic clergymen lambasted the government at rallies in defense of the traditional family .
the government was not , however , expected to pursue other controversial reforms , such as a more liberal abortion law or the legalization of euthanasia , during the upcoming legislature .
reversing economic downturn bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : spain 's finances are another area of concern for the pm zapatero is more concerned with the state of spain 's economy , which is expected to be hit harder than most other western countries by the global economic problems , with growth plunging from 3.8 per cent in 2007 to possibly even less than 2 per cent this year .
the premier has pledged measures to soften the blow , such as an increase of public works to absorb workers from the long overheated , rapidly shrinking construction industry , which has accounted for nearly 20 per cent of spain 's gross domestic product -lrb- gdp -rrb- .
despite the general improvement in the political atmosphere , the socialists ' relations with other parties have evolved in such a way that zapatero will be able to pass laws with the support of smaller parties only on a case-by-case basis .
previously , he had been able to rely on the far-left izquierda unida -lrb- iu -rrb- and on the catalan republican party erc for the initial part of the legislature .
no major reshuffle bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : foreign minister moratinos is likely to remain in office zapatero was expected to make relatively few changes in the composition of his government , retaining his popular deputy maria teresa fernandez de la vega , as well as pedro solbes as economics minister , miguel angel moratinos as foreign minister and alfredo perez rubalcaba as interior minister .
zapatero , who appointed spain 's first half-female cabinet , was expected to give the defense portfolio to a woman , possibly to elena salgado , who held the health and then the public administration portfolio in the previous government .
the premier was due to announce the composition of the new government after being sworn in by king juan carlos on saturday . dw staff / dpa -lrb- nda -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de nato -pipe- 11.04.2008 russia talks tough in response to nato 's eastward expansion großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : nato intends to give eventual membership to russian neighbors ukraine and georgia russia 's determination to protect its borders took a bellicose turn friday , april 11 , when a top army general vowed to take military action if nato expands east to include its former soviet neighbors georgia and ukraine . in a reported published by the interfax news agency , general yuri baluyevsky was quoted as saying that russia was considering the possibility of taking military and other steps along its borders if the two countries became part of the organization .
" russia will take unambiguous action toward ensuring its interests along its borders , " he said .
" these will not only be military steps , but also steps of a different character . "
moscow lobbied hard to head off georgia and ukraine 's ambition for membership at last month 's nato summit in bucharest , but alliance leaders intend to review their bid in december .
nato turned down georgia and ukraine 's applications for membership action plans - a stepping stone to membership - but , under pressure from washington , one of the strongest advocates of enlargement in the alliance , the alliance did say both would eventually become nato members .
russian foreign minister sergei lavrov said earlier this week that moscow will do everything it can to prevent the two countries , run by pro-western governments , from becoming nato members .
russia will do everything to prevent accession bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : putin and lavrov did n't like what they heard in bucharest " we will do all we can to prevent ukraine 's and georgia 's accession into nato and to avoid an inevitable serious exacerbation of our relations with both the alliance and our neighbors , " lavrov told reporters .
russia opposes the plan to grant membership on the grounds that such a move would pose a direct threat to its security and endanger the fragile balance of forces in europe .
it also sees nato 's willingness to enlarge eastward as the continuation of the western cold war containment policy and the spread of a foreign military bloc along its border .
president vladimir putin said in february that russia would consider directing its missiles at ukraine if the neighboring state ever hosted nato military installations .
russia 's fears have also been stoked by plans by the united states to install interceptor missiles and radar stations in poland and the czech republic as part of a wider missile defense shield designed to protect the us from attack by rogue states such as iran and north korea .
lavrov warned earlier this week that states hosting parts of a us missile defense shield also risked facing a military response if moscow 's security concerns were not met .
demands for presence at missile shield installations bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : russia wants to be involved in any missile plans the us has the russian foreign minister demanded that the russian military be allowed a " permanent presence " at the planned us missile interceptor base in poland and the radar site in the czech republic , threatening that russia would otherwise consider " measures of military-technical character . "
the threat put paid to the united states and its partners hopes of a shift in russia 's negative attitude after a big us push for compromise at last week 's nato summit and in one-on-one talks between president george w. bush and putin .
russia is also said to have been angered by bush 's pressuring of european members of nato to openly support ukraine and georgia 's nato bid despite being told by german chancellor angela merkel that the topic was " off the table " for the time being at the meeting in bucharest .
germany , france fear destabilization bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : sarkozy and merkel were angered by pressure from bush while bush was forced into agreeing on a delay by merkel and french president nicolas sarkozy , who fear a rash move to install the two former soviet states as nato members could destabilize an already volatile region on russia 's southern flank , his insistence was not lost on russian observers .
however , general baluyevsky said it was too early to talk about ukrainian or georgian entry into nato .
" the population of ukraine is unambiguously against entry to nato despite the so-called referendum in georgia where seventy percent of the population supported the idea , ” he said .

" russia will take unambiguous action toward ensuring its interests along its borders , " he said .
" these will not only be military steps , but also steps of a different character . "
moscow lobbied hard to head off georgia and ukraine 's ambition for membership at last month 's nato summit in bucharest , but alliance leaders intend to review their bid in december .
nato turned down georgia and ukraine 's applications for membership action plans - a stepping stone to membership - but , under pressure from washington , one of the strongest advocates of enlargement in the alliance , the alliance did say both would eventually become nato members .
russian foreign minister sergei lavrov said earlier this week that moscow will do everything it can to prevent the two countries , run by pro-western governments , from becoming nato members .
russia will do everything to prevent accession bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : putin and lavrov did n't like what they heard in bucharest " we will do all we can to prevent ukraine 's and georgia 's accession into nato and to avoid an inevitable serious exacerbation of our relations with both the alliance and our neighbors , " lavrov told reporters .
russia opposes the plan to grant membership on the grounds that such a move would pose a direct threat to its security and endanger the fragile balance of forces in europe .
it also sees nato 's willingness to enlarge eastward as the continuation of the western cold war containment policy and the spread of a foreign military bloc along its border .
president vladimir putin said in february that russia would consider directing its missiles at ukraine if the neighboring state ever hosted nato military installations .
russia 's fears have also been stoked by plans by the united states to install interceptor missiles and radar stations in poland and the czech republic as part of a wider missile defense shield designed to protect the us from attack by rogue states such as iran and north korea .
lavrov warned earlier this week that states hosting parts of a us missile defense shield also risked facing a military response if moscow 's security concerns were not met .
demands for presence at missile shield installations bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : russia wants to be involved in any missile plans the us has the russian foreign minister demanded that the russian military be allowed a " permanent presence " at the planned us missile interceptor base in poland and the radar site in the czech republic , threatening that russia would otherwise consider " measures of military-technical character . "
the threat put paid to the united states and its partners hopes of a shift in russia 's negative attitude after a big us push for compromise at last week 's nato summit and in one-on-one talks between president george w. bush and putin .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de elections -pipe- 11.04.2008 spain 's re-elected zapatero faces long list of challenges großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : spain 's prime minister jose luis rodriguez zapatero has a lot to do in his second term spanish prime minister jose luis rodriguez zapatero 's premiership was reconfirmed by parliament friday , april 11 .
he faces a second term of economic challenges and continuing concerns over regional separatism . the new legislature was , however , opening in a more conciliatory political atmosphere than the previous one , making it easier for spanish socialist leader zapatero to try to buttress up the economy and to seek support in the fight against the militant basque separatist group eta .
the 47-year-old was the first spanish prime minister elected in a popular vote to be reconfirmed with a simple majority in a second round of voting , after failing to win an absolute majority in the first round .
the socialists increased their number of seats by five to 169 in the 350-member parliament , but did not get an absolute majority in the elections a month ago .
zapatero had deliberately opted for a simple majority in the parliamentary vote in order to maintain his political independence from basque and catalan regionalists , whose votes could have allowed him to be elected in the first round , but who would have demanded a price for their support .
the government 's concessions to regions demanding more autonomy had earlier created divisions with the opposition conservatives , who accused zapatero of endangering the unity of spain .
growing calls for autonomy during the upcoming legislature , it is expected that the basques will attempt to stage a regional referendum on a self-government bordering on independence , which the socialists were planning to prevent by offering the region more autonomy instead .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : eta 's armed struggle has claimed lives on zapatero 's watch basque regional premier juan jose ibarretxe believes the referendum could help to end the violence associated with the basque separatist group eta , which has killed three people since negotiations between eta and madrid collapsed in 2006 .
the negotiation attempt sparked a barrage of criticism from the conservative people 's party -lrb- pp -rrb- , which slammed the government for " surrendering " to terrorists .
zapatero has resumed police crackdowns against eta and made it understood that he will not talk to the group again , a move which is expected to help to pacify the political atmosphere .
zapatero has also pledged to seek a cross-party consensus on other issues including a reform of regional financial autonomy rule , spain 's europe policy and judicial reform .
the previous legislature was marked by liberal social reforms , such as gay marriage and speedy divorce .
the issues divided the country and catholic clergymen lambasted the government at rallies in defense of the traditional family .
the government was not , however , expected to pursue other controversial reforms , such as a more liberal abortion law or the legalization of euthanasia , during the upcoming legislature .
reversing economic downturn bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : spain 's finances are another area of concern for the pm zapatero is more concerned with the state of spain 's economy , which is expected to be hit harder than most other western countries by the global economic problems , with growth plunging from 3.8 per cent in 2007 to possibly even less than 2 per cent this year .
the premier has pledged measures to soften the blow , such as an increase of public works to absorb workers from the long overheated , rapidly shrinking construction industry , which has accounted for nearly 20 per cent of spain 's gross domestic product -lrb- gdp -rrb- .
despite the general improvement in the political atmosphere , the socialists ' relations with other parties have evolved in such a way that zapatero will be able to pass laws with the support of smaller parties only on a case-by-case basis .
previously , he had been able to rely on the far-left izquierda unida -lrb- iu -rrb- and on the catalan republican party erc for the initial part of the legislature .
no major reshuffle bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : foreign minister moratinos is likely to remain in office zapatero was expected to make relatively few changes in the composition of his government , retaining his popular deputy maria teresa fernandez de la vega , as well as pedro solbes as economics minister , miguel angel moratinos as foreign minister and alfredo perez rubalcaba as interior minister .
zapatero , who appointed spain 's first half-female cabinet , was expected to give the defense portfolio to a woman , possibly to elena salgado , who held the health and then the public administration portfolio in the previous government .
the premier was due to announce the composition of the new government after being sworn in by king juan carlos on saturday . dw staff / dpa -lrb- nda -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

he faces a second term of economic challenges and continuing concerns over regional separatism . the new legislature was , however , opening in a more conciliatory political atmosphere than the previous one , making it easier for spanish socialist leader zapatero to try to buttress up the economy and to seek support in the fight against the militant basque separatist group eta .
the 47-year-old was the first spanish prime minister elected in a popular vote to be reconfirmed with a simple majority in a second round of voting , after failing to win an absolute majority in the first round .
the socialists increased their number of seats by five to 169 in the 350-member parliament , but did not get an absolute majority in the elections a month ago .
zapatero had deliberately opted for a simple majority in the parliamentary vote in order to maintain his political independence from basque and catalan regionalists , whose votes could have allowed him to be elected in the first round , but who would have demanded a price for their support .
the government 's concessions to regions demanding more autonomy had earlier created divisions with the opposition conservatives , who accused zapatero of endangering the unity of spain .
growing calls for autonomy during the upcoming legislature , it is expected that the basques will attempt to stage a regional referendum on a self-government bordering on independence , which the socialists were planning to prevent by offering the region more autonomy instead .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : eta 's armed struggle has claimed lives on zapatero 's watch basque regional premier juan jose ibarretxe believes the referendum could help to end the violence associated with the basque separatist group eta , which has killed three people since negotiations between eta and madrid collapsed in 2006 .
the negotiation attempt sparked a barrage of criticism from the conservative people 's party -lrb- pp -rrb- , which slammed the government for " surrendering " to terrorists .
zapatero has resumed police crackdowns against eta and made it understood that he will not talk to the group again , a move which is expected to help to pacify the political atmosphere .
zapatero has also pledged to seek a cross-party consensus on other issues including a reform of regional financial autonomy rule , spain 's europe policy and judicial reform .
the previous legislature was marked by liberal social reforms , such as gay marriage and speedy divorce .
the issues divided the country and catholic clergymen lambasted the government at rallies in defense of the traditional family .
the government was not , however , expected to pursue other controversial reforms , such as a more liberal abortion law or the legalization of euthanasia , during the upcoming legislature .
reversing economic downturn bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : spain 's finances are another area of concern for the pm zapatero is more concerned with the state of spain 's economy , which is expected to be hit harder than most other western countries by the global economic problems , with growth plunging from 3.8 per cent in 2007 to possibly even less than 2 per cent this year .
the premier has pledged measures to soften the blow , such as an increase of public works to absorb workers from the long overheated , rapidly shrinking construction industry , which has accounted for nearly 20 per cent of spain 's gross domestic product -lrb- gdp -rrb- .
despite the general improvement in the political atmosphere , the socialists ' relations with other parties have evolved in such a way that zapatero will be able to pass laws with the support of smaller parties only on a case-by-case basis .
previously , he had been able to rely on the far-left izquierda unida -lrb- iu -rrb- and on the catalan republican party erc for the initial part of the legislature .
no major reshuffle bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : foreign minister moratinos is likely to remain in office zapatero was expected to make relatively few changes in the composition of his government , retaining his popular deputy maria teresa fernandez de la vega , as well as pedro solbes as economics minister , miguel angel moratinos as foreign minister and alfredo perez rubalcaba as interior minister .
zapatero , who appointed spain 's first half-female cabinet , was expected to give the defense portfolio to a woman , possibly to elena salgado , who held the health and then the public administration portfolio in the previous government .

he faces a second term of economic challenges and continuing concerns over regional separatism . the new legislature was , however , opening in a more conciliatory political atmosphere than the previous one , making it easier for spanish socialist leader zapatero to try to buttress up the economy and to seek support in the fight against the militant basque separatist group eta .
the 47-year-old was the first spanish prime minister elected in a popular vote to be reconfirmed with a simple majority in a second round of voting , after failing to win an absolute majority in the first round .
the socialists increased their number of seats by five to 169 in the 350-member parliament , but did not get an absolute majority in the elections a month ago .
zapatero had deliberately opted for a simple majority in the parliamentary vote in order to maintain his political independence from basque and catalan regionalists , whose votes could have allowed him to be elected in the first round , but who would have demanded a price for their support .
the government 's concessions to regions demanding more autonomy had earlier created divisions with the opposition conservatives , who accused zapatero of endangering the unity of spain .
growing calls for autonomy during the upcoming legislature , it is expected that the basques will attempt to stage a regional referendum on a self-government bordering on independence , which the socialists were planning to prevent by offering the region more autonomy instead .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : eta 's armed struggle has claimed lives on zapatero 's watch basque regional premier juan jose ibarretxe believes the referendum could help to end the violence associated with the basque separatist group eta , which has killed three people since negotiations between eta and madrid collapsed in 2006 .
the negotiation attempt sparked a barrage of criticism from the conservative people 's party -lrb- pp -rrb- , which slammed the government for " surrendering " to terrorists .
zapatero has resumed police crackdowns against eta and made it understood that he will not talk to the group again , a move which is expected to help to pacify the political atmosphere .
zapatero has also pledged to seek a cross-party consensus on other issues including a reform of regional financial autonomy rule , spain 's europe policy and judicial reform .
the previous legislature was marked by liberal social reforms , such as gay marriage and speedy divorce .
the issues divided the country and catholic clergymen lambasted the government at rallies in defense of the traditional family .
the government was not , however , expected to pursue other controversial reforms , such as a more liberal abortion law or the legalization of euthanasia , during the upcoming legislature .
reversing economic downturn bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : spain 's finances are another area of concern for the pm zapatero is more concerned with the state of spain 's economy , which is expected to be hit harder than most other western countries by the global economic problems , with growth plunging from 3.8 per cent in 2007 to possibly even less than 2 per cent this year .
the premier has pledged measures to soften the blow , such as an increase of public works to absorb workers from the long overheated , rapidly shrinking construction industry , which has accounted for nearly 20 per cent of spain 's gross domestic product -lrb- gdp -rrb- .
despite the general improvement in the political atmosphere , the socialists ' relations with other parties have evolved in such a way that zapatero will be able to pass laws with the support of smaller parties only on a case-by-case basis .
previously , he had been able to rely on the far-left izquierda unida -lrb- iu -rrb- and on the catalan republican party erc for the initial part of the legislature .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de science -pipe- 11.04.2008 germany eases stem cell restrictions großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : scientists will have more stem cell lines to choose from after months of political negotiations , german lawmakers agreed to allow broader embryonic stem cell use .
but they signaled their ambivalence by refusing to completely do away with restrictions . hundreds of stem-cell lines previously off-limits to german scientists will be made available under a law passed by a majority of germany 's lower house of parliament on friday , april 11 .
but the decision represents a compromise in a debate which has raged for months over the ethics of using embryonic stem cells for scientific research .
on friday , lawmakers debated various measures which ranged from a complete liberalization to a complete prohibition of stem-cell use before deciding on a compromise measure .
the final vote cut across party lines , with 346 german lawmakers in favor of the revision while 228 voted against it and six abstained .
researchers welcome new law bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the stem cell issue divided the german legislature german scientists had long complained that the restrictive laws put them at a disadvantage compared with their peers in other countries .
germany 's science minister , annette schavan , said reforming the law was key to fostering research in germany .
“ this is a good day for both protecting life and also for research in germany , “ schavan , of the christian democratic union , said after the vote friday . the german research foundation -lrb- dfg -rrb- , max-planck-institute , the helmholz association and the federation of german industries -lrb- bdi -rrb- also welcomed the vote . “ the changes give german researchers the chance to stay competitive internationally , ” said max planck institute president peter gruss . more options for scientists bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : stem cells are thought to offer disease-curing potential german scientists had pushed for germany to reconsider a 2002 law which imposed strict limits on the use of embryonic stem cells in medical research .
while the law banned all creation of stem cells in germany , it did allow cells produced from abroad to be imported , but only if they had been created before jan .
1 , 2002 .
scientists also had to show that the project had overwhelming significance and that no other research method could be used .
scientists had complained that tight laws prevented them from taking part in international projects using stem cell lines created after 2002 .
other european countries , such as britain and sweden , have less strict laws .
the new law allows for a more recent cut-off date of may 1 , 2007 for the import of stem-cell lines .
advocates of the change claim that it will increase the number of stem-cell lines available to german scientists from 40 to 500 .
echoes of nazi experiments ?
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : politicians voted their conscience embryonic stem cells are prized by scientists for their ability to develop into any type of cell .
this versatility has led scientists to trump stem cells as offering the potential to cure diseases such as diabetes , parkinson 's and heart maladies .
yet in germany , the use of embryonic stem cells makes many people uncomfortable on religious and ethical grounds .
stem cell research carries historic overtones of the nazis ' genetic experiments linked to the creation of a master race .
traumatized by grisly experiments on humans under the nazis and influenced by its christian churches , germany has agonized for a decade about the ethics of using the cells .
critics argue that a human life is sacrificed when an embryo is torn apart .
religious groups expressed unhappiness with the parliament 's decision .
" this is not a good day for the protection of life in germany , “ said munich archbishop reinhard marx . guenther beckstein , bavaria ’ s conservative premier , also said he thought the change would set a dangerous precedent . “ my worry is that it will now become easier to further undermine the protection of unborn life , ” beckstein said .
critics have pointed to new research advances in bolstering their claim that stem cells are unnecessary .
scientists recently discovered a way to re-program adult stem cells to make them pluripotent , or capable of acting like embryonic stem cells .
the search for a substitute bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : embryonic stem cells still ca n't be produced in germany but scientists counter they still need the embryonic cells to compare with these induced pluripotent cells .
in november 2007 , teams of us and japanese researchers said they had reprogrammed human skin cells to function like embryonic stem cells .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de science -pipe- 11.04.2008 germany eases stem cell restrictions großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : scientists will have more stem cell lines to choose from after months of political negotiations , german lawmakers agreed to allow broader embryonic stem cell use .
but they signaled their ambivalence by refusing to completely do away with restrictions . hundreds of stem-cell lines previously off-limits to german scientists will be made available under a law passed by a majority of germany 's lower house of parliament on friday , april 11 .
but the decision represents a compromise in a debate which has raged for months over the ethics of using embryonic stem cells for scientific research .
on friday , lawmakers debated various measures which ranged from a complete liberalization to a complete prohibition of stem-cell use before deciding on a compromise measure .
the final vote cut across party lines , with 346 german lawmakers in favor of the revision while 228 voted against it and six abstained .
researchers welcome new law bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the stem cell issue divided the german legislature german scientists had long complained that the restrictive laws put them at a disadvantage compared with their peers in other countries .
germany 's science minister , annette schavan , said reforming the law was key to fostering research in germany .
“ this is a good day for both protecting life and also for research in germany , “ schavan , of the christian democratic union , said after the vote friday . the german research foundation -lrb- dfg -rrb- , max-planck-institute , the helmholz association and the federation of german industries -lrb- bdi -rrb- also welcomed the vote . “ the changes give german researchers the chance to stay competitive internationally , ” said max planck institute president peter gruss . more options for scientists bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : stem cells are thought to offer disease-curing potential german scientists had pushed for germany to reconsider a 2002 law which imposed strict limits on the use of embryonic stem cells in medical research .
while the law banned all creation of stem cells in germany , it did allow cells produced from abroad to be imported , but only if they had been created before jan .
1 , 2002 .
scientists also had to show that the project had overwhelming significance and that no other research method could be used .
scientists had complained that tight laws prevented them from taking part in international projects using stem cell lines created after 2002 .
other european countries , such as britain and sweden , have less strict laws .
the new law allows for a more recent cut-off date of may 1 , 2007 for the import of stem-cell lines .
advocates of the change claim that it will increase the number of stem-cell lines available to german scientists from 40 to 500 .
echoes of nazi experiments ?
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : politicians voted their conscience embryonic stem cells are prized by scientists for their ability to develop into any type of cell .
this versatility has led scientists to trump stem cells as offering the potential to cure diseases such as diabetes , parkinson 's and heart maladies .

but they signaled their ambivalence by refusing to completely do away with restrictions . hundreds of stem-cell lines previously off-limits to german scientists will be made available under a law passed by a majority of germany 's lower house of parliament on friday , april 11 .
but the decision represents a compromise in a debate which has raged for months over the ethics of using embryonic stem cells for scientific research .
on friday , lawmakers debated various measures which ranged from a complete liberalization to a complete prohibition of stem-cell use before deciding on a compromise measure .
the final vote cut across party lines , with 346 german lawmakers in favor of the revision while 228 voted against it and six abstained .
researchers welcome new law bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the stem cell issue divided the german legislature german scientists had long complained that the restrictive laws put them at a disadvantage compared with their peers in other countries .
germany 's science minister , annette schavan , said reforming the law was key to fostering research in germany .
“ this is a good day for both protecting life and also for research in germany , “ schavan , of the christian democratic union , said after the vote friday . the german research foundation -lrb- dfg -rrb- , max-planck-institute , the helmholz association and the federation of german industries -lrb- bdi -rrb- also welcomed the vote . “ the changes give german researchers the chance to stay competitive internationally , ” said max planck institute president peter gruss . more options for scientists bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : stem cells are thought to offer disease-curing potential german scientists had pushed for germany to reconsider a 2002 law which imposed strict limits on the use of embryonic stem cells in medical research .
while the law banned all creation of stem cells in germany , it did allow cells produced from abroad to be imported , but only if they had been created before jan .
1 , 2002 .
scientists also had to show that the project had overwhelming significance and that no other research method could be used .
scientists had complained that tight laws prevented them from taking part in international projects using stem cell lines created after 2002 .
other european countries , such as britain and sweden , have less strict laws .
the new law allows for a more recent cut-off date of may 1 , 2007 for the import of stem-cell lines .
advocates of the change claim that it will increase the number of stem-cell lines available to german scientists from 40 to 500 .

bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : politicians voted their conscience embryonic stem cells are prized by scientists for their ability to develop into any type of cell .

"
they were enraged that former nazis held powerful positions in society , incensed over legal reforms they deemed undemocratic and angry they did n't have more of a say in running their universities . " it was a revolutionary period that aimed to create a better world , " wolfgang bittner , a former lawyer and now writer in cologne , told dw-world.de. the 66-year-old said he was " politicized " during that time as a university student . " we students felt the leaden weight of antiquated , bourgeois german society - the complacency of it , " he said . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : rudi 's legend lives on one of the spearheads of the student movement that formed as a reaction to that sentiment was rudi dutschke - an eloquent and charismatic leader and head of the socialist students union . for thousands , dutschke became a beacon for change . he was shot in west berlin on april 11 , 1968 , by josef bachmann , a laborer and sometimes burglar with alleged right-wing sympathies .
dutschke barely survived the bullets to his brain , and suffered health problems for the rest of his life , eventually dying as a result of his injuries 11 years later . students at the time blamed conservative media for stoking hatred against dutschke .
they resented the bild tabloid 's smear campaign against him and the 68ers , as those of the movement were called , believing it played a role in convincing bachmann to attempt murder . brought in the new günter wallraff , 65 , a journalist and filmmaker known nationwide for his crusades against corporate injustice , said the 1968 movement brought about changes that many people now take for granted . " the double standards for men and women in society were exposed then , greater rights and freedom for women and children were created , more power to students for democratic representation , sexual liberalization - the 1968 generation prompted all of that , " he said . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : us singer joan baez during a 1967 vietnam war protest " new life was breathed into society at the time , " he said , pointing to dramatic shifts in literature , music and design as well . but many students wanted more and had set their sights beyond germany 's borders .
besides being anti-authoritarian , they were also largely anti-american .
they opposed the us war in vietnam and chanted the name of vietnamese communist leader ho chi minh as they battled baton-wielding police during protests on berlin streets . revolt against nazi past the year 1968 saw university campuses in several countries transformed into battlegrounds for social change .
in paris , students were joined by labor unions ; people in poland and czechoslovakia demonstrated against repressive governments . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : demonstrations also rocked paris in may 1968 germans , however , had their own particular demons to battle . the students , and other left-wing protestors , opposed an older generation that accepted kurt georg kiesinger , a former member of the nazi party , as chancellor . they rejected the notion of a state led by president heinrich luebke , who held the office from 1959 to 1969 .
he had worked with architect albert speer during the nazi regime and was suspected of having designed concentration camps during world war ii . " a generation of criminals was ruling society after the war and no one talked about what they had done .
discussing their crimes was not even a part of our school lessons , " said wallraff . bittner agreed : " we saw that something dramatic had to happen . " an earlier death bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : joschka fischer , later german foreign minister , beaten on the street in april 1968 the student uprisings at the universities had begun even before the assassination attempt on dutschke . nine months earlier , in june 1967 , student benno ohnesorg was shot in the back of the head and killed by a plainclothes policeman during demonstrations in berlin protesting a visit by the shah of iran . that shooting outraged tens of thousands of students and hardened opposition against the grand coalition government of conservative christian democrat-led parties and center-left social democrats . the protestors were deeply disappointed by what they saw as the social democrats ' betrayal of socialism .
they also rejected the state of emergency law reforms of 1968 , which granted the cabinet the power to get laws passed , despite rejection by parliament , during a national crisis - a move the students considered non-democratic . disapproval by german public bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : women also took up jobs in factories in the 1950s the larger german society did not see the student rebels - including dutschke - and other protestors as romantic revolutionaries fighting for the greater good .
they were first considered a nuisance by many and , later , a danger . during the 1950s , germany had experienced the wirtschaftswunder , an economic boom that allowed it to bounce back from world war ii .
many germans were happy to simply have a job , a car and enough money for a european vacation . the tense atmosphere and violence that erupted following the assassination of ohnesorg and the attempted one on dutschke also gave rise to the political terrorism of the red army fraction -lrb- raf -rrb- in the late 1960s and early ' 70s , which prompted panic and distrust throughout germany . though most members of the 1968 movement rejected terrorism , the distinction between the splinter group raf and the original 68ers was unclear to many . a new 68 generation ? bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : a 1968 bombing in a frankfurt department store - the extreme side of protests the 1968 movement prompted shifts in many parts of society , and 40 years later , wallraff said a new movement could be on the horizon . " all the signs are there , " said wallraff .
" so many societal standards are being done away with , workers have to hide the fact they are in unions … changes will have to happen - just look at the growth of right-extremism in eastern germany . " the growing gap between rich and poor in germany , soaring inflation rates and decreasing health and pension benefits may likewise be contributing to a general feeling that the average citizen has been left behind despite strong economic growth . the emergence of the new left party and its growing popularity is yet another indication that the country may be poised on the brink of change . " a new social movement in germany - one that has learned from the mistakes of the past and is non-dogmatic and non-partisan - is long overdue , " wallraff said . louisa schaefer send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

but they signaled their ambivalence by refusing to completely do away with restrictions . hundreds of stem-cell lines previously off-limits to german scientists will be made available under a law passed by a majority of germany 's lower house of parliament on friday , april 11 .
but the decision represents a compromise in a debate which has raged for months over the ethics of using embryonic stem cells for scientific research .
on friday , lawmakers debated various measures which ranged from a complete liberalization to a complete prohibition of stem-cell use before deciding on a compromise measure .
the final vote cut across party lines , with 346 german lawmakers in favor of the revision while 228 voted against it and six abstained .
researchers welcome new law bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the stem cell issue divided the german legislature german scientists had long complained that the restrictive laws put them at a disadvantage compared with their peers in other countries .
germany 's science minister , annette schavan , said reforming the law was key to fostering research in germany .
“ this is a good day for both protecting life and also for research in germany , “ schavan , of the christian democratic union , said after the vote friday . the german research foundation -lrb- dfg -rrb- , max-planck-institute , the helmholz association and the federation of german industries -lrb- bdi -rrb- also welcomed the vote . “ the changes give german researchers the chance to stay competitive internationally , ” said max planck institute president peter gruss . more options for scientists bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : stem cells are thought to offer disease-curing potential german scientists had pushed for germany to reconsider a 2002 law which imposed strict limits on the use of embryonic stem cells in medical research .

scientists also had to show that the project had overwhelming significance and that no other research method could be used .
scientists had complained that tight laws prevented them from taking part in international projects using stem cell lines created after 2002 .
other european countries , such as britain and sweden , have less strict laws .
the new law allows for a more recent cut-off date of may 1 , 2007 for the import of stem-cell lines .
advocates of the change claim that it will increase the number of stem-cell lines available to german scientists from 40 to 500 .

this versatility has led scientists to trump stem cells as offering the potential to cure diseases such as diabetes , parkinson 's and heart maladies .
yet in germany , the use of embryonic stem cells makes many people uncomfortable on religious and ethical grounds .
stem cell research carries historic overtones of the nazis ' genetic experiments linked to the creation of a master race .
traumatized by grisly experiments on humans under the nazis and influenced by its christian churches , germany has agonized for a decade about the ethics of using the cells .
critics argue that a human life is sacrificed when an embryo is torn apart .
religious groups expressed unhappiness with the parliament 's decision .
" this is not a good day for the protection of life in germany , “ said munich archbishop reinhard marx . guenther beckstein , bavaria ’ s conservative premier , also said he thought the change would set a dangerous precedent . “ my worry is that it will now become easier to further undermine the protection of unborn life , ” beckstein said .

on the surface , this could mean that scientists would no longer have to rely on embryonic stem cells .
but " these new , reprogrammed cells still have to be compared with real embryonic stem cell lines to see if they function the same way , " said joerg hacker , vice president of the german research foundation .

"
they were enraged that former nazis held powerful positions in society , incensed over legal reforms they deemed undemocratic and angry they did n't have more of a say in running their universities . " it was a revolutionary period that aimed to create a better world , " wolfgang bittner , a former lawyer and now writer in cologne , told dw-world.de. the 66-year-old said he was " politicized " during that time as a university student . " we students felt the leaden weight of antiquated , bourgeois german society - the complacency of it , " he said . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : rudi 's legend lives on one of the spearheads of the student movement that formed as a reaction to that sentiment was rudi dutschke - an eloquent and charismatic leader and head of the socialist students union . for thousands , dutschke became a beacon for change . he was shot in west berlin on april 11 , 1968 , by josef bachmann , a laborer and sometimes burglar with alleged right-wing sympathies .
dutschke barely survived the bullets to his brain , and suffered health problems for the rest of his life , eventually dying as a result of his injuries 11 years later . students at the time blamed conservative media for stoking hatred against dutschke .
they resented the bild tabloid 's smear campaign against him and the 68ers , as those of the movement were called , believing it played a role in convincing bachmann to attempt murder . brought in the new günter wallraff , 65 , a journalist and filmmaker known nationwide for his crusades against corporate injustice , said the 1968 movement brought about changes that many people now take for granted . " the double standards for men and women in society were exposed then , greater rights and freedom for women and children were created , more power to students for democratic representation , sexual liberalization - the 1968 generation prompted all of that , " he said . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : us singer joan baez during a 1967 vietnam war protest " new life was breathed into society at the time , " he said , pointing to dramatic shifts in literature , music and design as well . but many students wanted more and had set their sights beyond germany 's borders .
besides being anti-authoritarian , they were also largely anti-american .
they opposed the us war in vietnam and chanted the name of vietnamese communist leader ho chi minh as they battled baton-wielding police during protests on berlin streets . revolt against nazi past the year 1968 saw university campuses in several countries transformed into battlegrounds for social change .
in paris , students were joined by labor unions ; people in poland and czechoslovakia demonstrated against repressive governments . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : demonstrations also rocked paris in may 1968 germans , however , had their own particular demons to battle . the students , and other left-wing protestors , opposed an older generation that accepted kurt georg kiesinger , a former member of the nazi party , as chancellor . they rejected the notion of a state led by president heinrich luebke , who held the office from 1959 to 1969 .
he had worked with architect albert speer during the nazi regime and was suspected of having designed concentration camps during world war ii . " a generation of criminals was ruling society after the war and no one talked about what they had done .
discussing their crimes was not even a part of our school lessons , " said wallraff . bittner agreed : " we saw that something dramatic had to happen . " an earlier death bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : joschka fischer , later german foreign minister , beaten on the street in april 1968 the student uprisings at the universities had begun even before the assassination attempt on dutschke . nine months earlier , in june 1967 , student benno ohnesorg was shot in the back of the head and killed by a plainclothes policeman during demonstrations in berlin protesting a visit by the shah of iran . that shooting outraged tens of thousands of students and hardened opposition against the grand coalition government of conservative christian democrat-led parties and center-left social democrats . the protestors were deeply disappointed by what they saw as the social democrats ' betrayal of socialism .
they also rejected the state of emergency law reforms of 1968 , which granted the cabinet the power to get laws passed , despite rejection by parliament , during a national crisis - a move the students considered non-democratic . disapproval by german public bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : women also took up jobs in factories in the 1950s the larger german society did not see the student rebels - including dutschke - and other protestors as romantic revolutionaries fighting for the greater good .
they were first considered a nuisance by many and , later , a danger . during the 1950s , germany had experienced the wirtschaftswunder , an economic boom that allowed it to bounce back from world war ii .
many germans were happy to simply have a job , a car and enough money for a european vacation . the tense atmosphere and violence that erupted following the assassination of ohnesorg and the attempted one on dutschke also gave rise to the political terrorism of the red army fraction -lrb- raf -rrb- in the late 1960s and early ' 70s , which prompted panic and distrust throughout germany . though most members of the 1968 movement rejected terrorism , the distinction between the splinter group raf and the original 68ers was unclear to many . a new 68 generation ? bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : a 1968 bombing in a frankfurt department store - the extreme side of protests the 1968 movement prompted shifts in many parts of society , and 40 years later , wallraff said a new movement could be on the horizon . " all the signs are there , " said wallraff .
" so many societal standards are being done away with , workers have to hide the fact they are in unions … changes will have to happen - just look at the growth of right-extremism in eastern germany . " the growing gap between rich and poor in germany , soaring inflation rates and decreasing health and pension benefits may likewise be contributing to a general feeling that the average citizen has been left behind despite strong economic growth . the emergence of the new left party and its growing popularity is yet another indication that the country may be poised on the brink of change . " a new social movement in germany - one that has learned from the mistakes of the past and is non-dogmatic and non-partisan - is long overdue , " wallraff said . louisa schaefer send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de nato -pipe- 11.04.2008 russia talks tough in response to nato 's eastward expansion großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : nato intends to give eventual membership to russian neighbors ukraine and georgia russia 's determination to protect its borders took a bellicose turn friday , april 11 , when a top army general vowed to take military action if nato expands east to include its former soviet neighbors georgia and ukraine . in a reported published by the interfax news agency , general yuri baluyevsky was quoted as saying that russia was considering the possibility of taking military and other steps along its borders if the two countries became part of the organization .
" russia will take unambiguous action toward ensuring its interests along its borders , " he said .
" these will not only be military steps , but also steps of a different character . "
moscow lobbied hard to head off georgia and ukraine 's ambition for membership at last month 's nato summit in bucharest , but alliance leaders intend to review their bid in december .
nato turned down georgia and ukraine 's applications for membership action plans - a stepping stone to membership - but , under pressure from washington , one of the strongest advocates of enlargement in the alliance , the alliance did say both would eventually become nato members .
russian foreign minister sergei lavrov said earlier this week that moscow will do everything it can to prevent the two countries , run by pro-western governments , from becoming nato members .
russia will do everything to prevent accession bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : putin and lavrov did n't like what they heard in bucharest " we will do all we can to prevent ukraine 's and georgia 's accession into nato and to avoid an inevitable serious exacerbation of our relations with both the alliance and our neighbors , " lavrov told reporters .
russia opposes the plan to grant membership on the grounds that such a move would pose a direct threat to its security and endanger the fragile balance of forces in europe .

" russia will take unambiguous action toward ensuring its interests along its borders , " he said .
" these will not only be military steps , but also steps of a different character . "
moscow lobbied hard to head off georgia and ukraine 's ambition for membership at last month 's nato summit in bucharest , but alliance leaders intend to review their bid in december .
nato turned down georgia and ukraine 's applications for membership action plans - a stepping stone to membership - but , under pressure from washington , one of the strongest advocates of enlargement in the alliance , the alliance did say both would eventually become nato members .
russian foreign minister sergei lavrov said earlier this week that moscow will do everything it can to prevent the two countries , run by pro-western governments , from becoming nato members .
russia will do everything to prevent accession bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : putin and lavrov did n't like what they heard in bucharest " we will do all we can to prevent ukraine 's and georgia 's accession into nato and to avoid an inevitable serious exacerbation of our relations with both the alliance and our neighbors , " lavrov told reporters .
russia opposes the plan to grant membership on the grounds that such a move would pose a direct threat to its security and endanger the fragile balance of forces in europe .
it also sees nato 's willingness to enlarge eastward as the continuation of the western cold war containment policy and the spread of a foreign military bloc along its border .
president vladimir putin said in february that russia would consider directing its missiles at ukraine if the neighboring state ever hosted nato military installations .
russia 's fears have also been stoked by plans by the united states to install interceptor missiles and radar stations in poland and the czech republic as part of a wider missile defense shield designed to protect the us from attack by rogue states such as iran and north korea .
lavrov warned earlier this week that states hosting parts of a us missile defense shield also risked facing a military response if moscow 's security concerns were not met .
demands for presence at missile shield installations bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : russia wants to be involved in any missile plans the us has the russian foreign minister demanded that the russian military be allowed a " permanent presence " at the planned us missile interceptor base in poland and the radar site in the czech republic , threatening that russia would otherwise consider " measures of military-technical character . "
the threat put paid to the united states and its partners hopes of a shift in russia 's negative attitude after a big us push for compromise at last week 's nato summit and in one-on-one talks between president george w. bush and putin .
russia is also said to have been angered by bush 's pressuring of european members of nato to openly support ukraine and georgia 's nato bid despite being told by german chancellor angela merkel that the topic was " off the table " for the time being at the meeting in bucharest .
germany , france fear destabilization bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : sarkozy and merkel were angered by pressure from bush while bush was forced into agreeing on a delay by merkel and french president nicolas sarkozy , who fear a rash move to install the two former soviet states as nato members could destabilize an already volatile region on russia 's southern flank , his insistence was not lost on russian observers .
however , general baluyevsky said it was too early to talk about ukrainian or georgian entry into nato .
" the population of ukraine is unambiguously against entry to nato despite the so-called referendum in georgia where seventy percent of the population supported the idea , ” he said .

but his main rival , former rome mayor walter veltroni , promised that the center-right politician will be in for a nasty surprise after votes are counted .
veltroni spent the last days of the campaign criss-crossing italy in a bus , attempting to shave away berlusconi 's lead , which the last polls held two weeks ago put at 6 percentage points .
both men made impassioned pleas to supporters in the final days of their campaigns .
berlusconi , a 71-year-old self-made billionaire , urged his supporters to help him win over undecided voters ahead of elections sunday , april 13 and monday , april 14 .
veltroni , 52 , told voters on friday that berlusconi was " no statesman " and promised an upset .

but his main rival , former rome mayor walter veltroni , promised that the center-right politician will be in for a nasty surprise after votes are counted .
veltroni spent the last days of the campaign criss-crossing italy in a bus , attempting to shave away berlusconi 's lead , which the last polls held two weeks ago put at 6 percentage points .
both men made impassioned pleas to supporters in the final days of their campaigns .
berlusconi , a 71-year-old self-made billionaire , urged his supporters to help him win over undecided voters ahead of elections sunday , april 13 and monday , april 14 .
veltroni , 52 , told voters on friday that berlusconi was " no statesman " and promised an upset .

implicated in a string of corruption probes , berlusconi has been criticized for running up a budget deficit equal to 4.4 percent of gross domestic product -lrb- gdp -rrb- during his second premiership .

he faces a second term of economic challenges and continuing concerns over regional separatism . the new legislature was , however , opening in a more conciliatory political atmosphere than the previous one , making it easier for spanish socialist leader zapatero to try to buttress up the economy and to seek support in the fight against the militant basque separatist group eta .
the 47-year-old was the first spanish prime minister elected in a popular vote to be reconfirmed with a simple majority in a second round of voting , after failing to win an absolute majority in the first round .
the socialists increased their number of seats by five to 169 in the 350-member parliament , but did not get an absolute majority in the elections a month ago .
zapatero had deliberately opted for a simple majority in the parliamentary vote in order to maintain his political independence from basque and catalan regionalists , whose votes could have allowed him to be elected in the first round , but who would have demanded a price for their support .
the government 's concessions to regions demanding more autonomy had earlier created divisions with the opposition conservatives , who accused zapatero of endangering the unity of spain .
growing calls for autonomy during the upcoming legislature , it is expected that the basques will attempt to stage a regional referendum on a self-government bordering on independence , which the socialists were planning to prevent by offering the region more autonomy instead .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : eta 's armed struggle has claimed lives on zapatero 's watch basque regional premier juan jose ibarretxe believes the referendum could help to end the violence associated with the basque separatist group eta , which has killed three people since negotiations between eta and madrid collapsed in 2006 .
the negotiation attempt sparked a barrage of criticism from the conservative people 's party -lrb- pp -rrb- , which slammed the government for " surrendering " to terrorists .
zapatero has resumed police crackdowns against eta and made it understood that he will not talk to the group again , a move which is expected to help to pacify the political atmosphere .
zapatero has also pledged to seek a cross-party consensus on other issues including a reform of regional financial autonomy rule , spain 's europe policy and judicial reform .
the previous legislature was marked by liberal social reforms , such as gay marriage and speedy divorce .
the issues divided the country and catholic clergymen lambasted the government at rallies in defense of the traditional family .
the government was not , however , expected to pursue other controversial reforms , such as a more liberal abortion law or the legalization of euthanasia , during the upcoming legislature .

the premier has pledged measures to soften the blow , such as an increase of public works to absorb workers from the long overheated , rapidly shrinking construction industry , which has accounted for nearly 20 per cent of spain 's gross domestic product -lrb- gdp -rrb- .
despite the general improvement in the political atmosphere , the socialists ' relations with other parties have evolved in such a way that zapatero will be able to pass laws with the support of smaller parties only on a case-by-case basis .
previously , he had been able to rely on the far-left izquierda unida -lrb- iu -rrb- and on the catalan republican party erc for the initial part of the legislature .

he faces a second term of economic challenges and continuing concerns over regional separatism . the new legislature was , however , opening in a more conciliatory political atmosphere than the previous one , making it easier for spanish socialist leader zapatero to try to buttress up the economy and to seek support in the fight against the militant basque separatist group eta .
the 47-year-old was the first spanish prime minister elected in a popular vote to be reconfirmed with a simple majority in a second round of voting , after failing to win an absolute majority in the first round .
the socialists increased their number of seats by five to 169 in the 350-member parliament , but did not get an absolute majority in the elections a month ago .
zapatero had deliberately opted for a simple majority in the parliamentary vote in order to maintain his political independence from basque and catalan regionalists , whose votes could have allowed him to be elected in the first round , but who would have demanded a price for their support .
the government 's concessions to regions demanding more autonomy had earlier created divisions with the opposition conservatives , who accused zapatero of endangering the unity of spain .
growing calls for autonomy during the upcoming legislature , it is expected that the basques will attempt to stage a regional referendum on a self-government bordering on independence , which the socialists were planning to prevent by offering the region more autonomy instead .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : eta 's armed struggle has claimed lives on zapatero 's watch basque regional premier juan jose ibarretxe believes the referendum could help to end the violence associated with the basque separatist group eta , which has killed three people since negotiations between eta and madrid collapsed in 2006 .
the negotiation attempt sparked a barrage of criticism from the conservative people 's party -lrb- pp -rrb- , which slammed the government for " surrendering " to terrorists .
zapatero has resumed police crackdowns against eta and made it understood that he will not talk to the group again , a move which is expected to help to pacify the political atmosphere .
zapatero has also pledged to seek a cross-party consensus on other issues including a reform of regional financial autonomy rule , spain 's europe policy and judicial reform .
the previous legislature was marked by liberal social reforms , such as gay marriage and speedy divorce .
the issues divided the country and catholic clergymen lambasted the government at rallies in defense of the traditional family .
the government was not , however , expected to pursue other controversial reforms , such as a more liberal abortion law or the legalization of euthanasia , during the upcoming legislature .

the premier has pledged measures to soften the blow , such as an increase of public works to absorb workers from the long overheated , rapidly shrinking construction industry , which has accounted for nearly 20 per cent of spain 's gross domestic product -lrb- gdp -rrb- .
despite the general improvement in the political atmosphere , the socialists ' relations with other parties have evolved in such a way that zapatero will be able to pass laws with the support of smaller parties only on a case-by-case basis .
previously , he had been able to rely on the far-left izquierda unida -lrb- iu -rrb- and on the catalan republican party erc for the initial part of the legislature .

nudity among the aged in the pursuit of health and wellness is positively encouraged in some places .
however , theater stages in front of large , clothed audiences are usually not among them .
if the idea of a bunch of wrinklies in their well-worn birthday suits cavorting on stage in the name of entertainment is n't enough to disturb you and give you nightmares , then imagine said oldies frolicking around in the ashes of the world trade center while wearing mickey mouse masks .
or do n't , if you value your sanity .
but this is n't some bizarre sex fetish show catering for " appreciators of the mature " on the hamburg reeperbahn .
this is high culture , german style .
the 35 oaps in the all-together form just one part of the erfurt theater 's sell-out reinterpretation of verdi 's opera , " a masked ball . "
and for those thinking that some crazy young thing has perverted a classical masterpiece just to get some cheap publicity , it may come as some surprise that the opera is actually no stranger to controversy .
original scandal pales into insignificance bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : we 'll let your imagination come up with the rest giuseppe verdi wrote the piece about the 1792 assassination of swedish king gustavus iii , who was shot while attending a masked ball .
nineteenth-century censors demanded that verdi move the opera 's setting from europe to colonial america so as not to depict the assassination of a european monarch .
while there were no geriatric genitalia on show back then , it was deemed to be quite the scandal at the time .
austrian director johann kresnik may have added more than spattering of senior skin to the modern version but he adheres to the relocation ordered by the prudes of verdi 's time and stages his bizarre take on the opera in the united states just as they would have liked .
except the post 9/11 , disney-clad ageing nudes may have caused them to rethink their priorities somewhat .
" it 's a very beautiful , poetic scene , " guy montavon , the theatre 's general manager , explained to nervous reporters when timidly questioned about the exhibitionist pensioners .
" the concept is a little critical about america , the world of america with very rich people , very poor people , with war and the excesses of american society today , " he added to general bafflement .
politician 's censorship bid outstripped by public clamor bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the real ground zero without naked old people the show has already found its 21st-century version of verdi 's censors in the form of local politician who has called for a boycott of the production .
however , theater-goers have not heeded his call .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de from the fringe -pipe- 11.04.2008 verdi gets post 9/11 update with plenty of senior skin großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : more than sixty senior citizens auditioned to get their kit off in the new verdi production giuseppe verdi was never one to shy away from the inclusion of controversial subject matter in his operas but even he may have balked at adding an ageing , naked twist to one of his works . in some sections of german society , naked senior citizens are not only welcomed but embraced - although not always literally .
nudity among the aged in the pursuit of health and wellness is positively encouraged in some places .
however , theater stages in front of large , clothed audiences are usually not among them .
if the idea of a bunch of wrinklies in their well-worn birthday suits cavorting on stage in the name of entertainment is n't enough to disturb you and give you nightmares , then imagine said oldies frolicking around in the ashes of the world trade center while wearing mickey mouse masks .
or do n't , if you value your sanity .
but this is n't some bizarre sex fetish show catering for " appreciators of the mature " on the hamburg reeperbahn .
this is high culture , german style .
the 35 oaps in the all-together form just one part of the erfurt theater 's sell-out reinterpretation of verdi 's opera , " a masked ball . "
and for those thinking that some crazy young thing has perverted a classical masterpiece just to get some cheap publicity , it may come as some surprise that the opera is actually no stranger to controversy .
original scandal pales into insignificance bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : we 'll let your imagination come up with the rest giuseppe verdi wrote the piece about the 1792 assassination of swedish king gustavus iii , who was shot while attending a masked ball .
nineteenth-century censors demanded that verdi move the opera 's setting from europe to colonial america so as not to depict the assassination of a european monarch .
while there were no geriatric genitalia on show back then , it was deemed to be quite the scandal at the time .
austrian director johann kresnik may have added more than spattering of senior skin to the modern version but he adheres to the relocation ordered by the prudes of verdi 's time and stages his bizarre take on the opera in the united states just as they would have liked .
except the post 9/11 , disney-clad ageing nudes may have caused them to rethink their priorities somewhat .
" it 's a very beautiful , poetic scene , " guy montavon , the theatre 's general manager , explained to nervous reporters when timidly questioned about the exhibitionist pensioners .
" the concept is a little critical about america , the world of america with very rich people , very poor people , with war and the excesses of american society today , " he added to general bafflement .
politician 's censorship bid outstripped by public clamor bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the real ground zero without naked old people the show has already found its 21st-century version of verdi 's censors in the form of local politician who has called for a boycott of the production .
however , theater-goers have not heeded his call .
montavon told reporters the saturday premiere and four other performances had already sold out .
he would not be drawn , however , on rumors that business cards for local therapists would be included in the show 's program . dw staff -lrb- nda -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

germany is world-renowned for the lack of speed limits on stretches of its famed highway system : the autobahn .
most readers would like it to stay that way . the following comments reflect the views of dw-world.de readers .
not all reader comments have been published .
dw-world.de reserves the right to edit for length and appropriateness of content . speed limits will please the environmental movement by reducing emissions from all cars , but car lovers , including german chancellor angela merkel and the car industry in germany , will be upset by this decision .

but they signaled their ambivalence by refusing to completely do away with restrictions . hundreds of stem-cell lines previously off-limits to german scientists will be made available under a law passed by a majority of germany 's lower house of parliament on friday , april 11 .
but the decision represents a compromise in a debate which has raged for months over the ethics of using embryonic stem cells for scientific research .
on friday , lawmakers debated various measures which ranged from a complete liberalization to a complete prohibition of stem-cell use before deciding on a compromise measure .

scientists had complained that tight laws prevented them from taking part in international projects using stem cell lines created after 2002 .
other european countries , such as britain and sweden , have less strict laws .
the new law allows for a more recent cut-off date of may 1 , 2007 for the import of stem-cell lines .

they 've demanded that ebay remove the items immediately . the offensive fan paraphernalia , available on ebay 's german and austria auction web sites , contains the phrase , " zick zack zigeunerpack , " one of several slurs chanted by far-right soccer fans . stemming from the nazi era , the slogan refers to the roma minority as " gypsy scum . " germany 's central council of sinti and roma said on thursday , april 10 , that it would pursue legal action against the manufacturers of the items . " even if this slur is partly aimed against supporters of certain soccer clubs it is a massive insult to roma and sinti , " said the council 's chairman , romani rose . in a statement , the council also appealed to internet search-engine google to block searches related to the slogan . roma were among the minority groups targeted by the nazis .
about half a million were killed during the holocaust . council spokesman arnold rossderf said the body wanted to make sure that " young people who are not necessarily informed about the past realize that it is wrong and insulting to use such expressions .

they 've demanded that ebay remove the items immediately . the offensive fan paraphernalia , available on ebay 's german and austria auction web sites , contains the phrase , " zick zack zigeunerpack , " one of several slurs chanted by far-right soccer fans . stemming from the nazi era , the slogan refers to the roma minority as " gypsy scum . " germany 's central council of sinti and roma said on thursday , april 10 , that it would pursue legal action against the manufacturers of the items . " even if this slur is partly aimed against supporters of certain soccer clubs it is a massive insult to roma and sinti , " said the council 's chairman , romani rose . in a statement , the council also appealed to internet search-engine google to block searches related to the slogan . roma were among the minority groups targeted by the nazis .
about half a million were killed during the holocaust . council spokesman arnold rossderf said the body wanted to make sure that " young people who are not necessarily informed about the past realize that it is wrong and insulting to use such expressions .

mr ban urged the un security council to make a swift decision on the future of the forces , which have been monitoring a buffer zone in the region since 2000 .
the un has already withdrawn most of its peacekeepers after eritrea cut off fuel and food to the un mission .
eritrea accuses the un of allowing ethiopia to occupy eritrean territory .
tens of thousands of people died in the two countries ' 1998-2000 border war .
there had been 1,700 un troops monitoring the buffer zone , but now only 164 remain at the base in eritrea .
speaking to the bbc , eritrean ambassador araya desta dismissed mr ban 's report , saying it was for the un security council to resolve the remaining dispute over the ethiopian occupation of eritrean territory around the town of badme .
he also accused the un of politicising its decision to withdraw most of its troops from the buffer zone .
he said eritrea was not planning to attack ethiopia , but added that his country was prepared to fend off any invasions into eritrean territory .
" if the ethiopians invade us , we 'll be forced to defend ourselves , " mr desta told reuters news agency .
dangerous precedent the bbc 's un correspondent , laura trevelyan , says a complete withdrawal of un troops could undermine future deployments elsewhere .
in the report released on wednesday , mr ban outlines options for the future of the mission .
he says one option is that the mission could return to its full strength , liaison offices in the ethiopian and eritrean capitals could be established , or a small observer mission could be deployed in the border area .
our correspondent says diplomats are concerned about the precedent which could be set by the un 's complete withdrawal - fearing it will show that governments can bully un peacekeepers and win , which in turn could deter countries from offering up their troops to serve as peacekeepers .

mr ban urged the un security council to make a swift decision on the future of the forces , which have been monitoring a buffer zone in the region since 2000 .
the un has already withdrawn most of its peacekeepers after eritrea cut off fuel and food to the un mission .
eritrea accuses the un of allowing ethiopia to occupy eritrean territory .
tens of thousands of people died in the two countries ' 1998-2000 border war .
there had been 1,700 un troops monitoring the buffer zone , but now only 164 remain at the base in eritrea .
speaking to the bbc , eritrean ambassador araya desta dismissed mr ban 's report , saying it was for the un security council to resolve the remaining dispute over the ethiopian occupation of eritrean territory around the town of badme .
he also accused the un of politicising its decision to withdraw most of its troops from the buffer zone .
he said eritrea was not planning to attack ethiopia , but added that his country was prepared to fend off any invasions into eritrean territory .
" if the ethiopians invade us , we 'll be forced to defend ourselves , " mr desta told reuters news agency .
dangerous precedent the bbc 's un correspondent , laura trevelyan , says a complete withdrawal of un troops could undermine future deployments elsewhere .
in the report released on wednesday , mr ban outlines options for the future of the mission .
he says one option is that the mission could return to its full strength , liaison offices in the ethiopian and eritrean capitals could be established , or a small observer mission could be deployed in the border area .

the price of the staple crop has risen by as much as 70 % during the last year , according to the un food and agriculture organisation -lrb- fao -rrb- , with increases accelerating in recent weeks .
shortages have begun to hit some importing countries .
factors contributing to the price rise include : poor harvests resulting from extreme weather a rise in demand in some rice-importing countries , where populations and incomes are growing the expectation of further price increases - resulting in hoarding low stockpiles and a long term lack of agricultural investment bbc news rice day a bbc news focus on the impact of steep rises in the price of rice , staple food of 3bn people coverage on radio , tv and online from bangladesh , india , philippines , west africa and california special report : food price crisis the spike is also part of a general surge in food costs worldwide , so the option of switching to cheaper foods is often not available .
producers including india , china and vietnam have restricted exports as they try to protect their stocks and limit inflation .
importers such as bangladesh , the philippines , and afghanistan have been hit hard .
prices are expected to remain volatile , though output is likely to grow later this year as farmers in thailand and vietnam plant additional crops .
see graph showing rice production and consumption india india is the second largest rice grower in the world behind china .
with rice the staple food for 65 % of the country 's one billion plus people , much is consumed domestically .
but prices have been soaring - a shopkeeper in delhi told the bbc that the cost of one variety had increased from 12 rupees -lrb- 29 us cents -rrb- per kilogram to 16 rupees -lrb- 39 cents -rrb- in the last two months .
india rice crisis ?
rice prices in the capital rose by 20 % last year .
the government has announced a total ban on exports of non-basmati rice , in a bit to curb rising food prices , which have helped push inflation to a 13-month high .
the price for basmati rice , meanwhile , has been raised to $ 1,200 per tonne to discourage exports .
officials say as yet there is no crisis - india has more than enough reserves to feed its population .
they also say india will honour its commitments to export rice to neighbouring bangladesh .
but the international rice research institute says that the sustainability of rice farming in india and beyond is threatened by overuse of fertilisers and soil health .
stocks have come down over the last three years as agricultural growth has failed to match the rest of the economy .
and because of the low purchasing power of india 's poor , even a small increase in prices can cause a sharp fall in real incomes .
bangladesh spiralling rice prices have left the people of bangladesh facing their worst food shortages since the major famine of 1974 .
over the last year , prices have nearly doubled to about 35 taka -lrb- 50 cents -rrb- , while there has been no corresponding increase in wages .
hundreds of poor families are now surviving on one meal a day , and spending 70-80 % of their budget on food .
the problem is most acute in urban areas where aid agencies say they are very concerned about infant malnourishment .
local factors have contributed to the price rise .
bangladesh has been hit by severe flooding twice in the last year and a devastating cyclone in november .
the government is giving rice away to 2.6 million people and supplying some families at discounted prices .
it has had to import four million tonnes of rice from india over the last six months - more than double the usual amount .
but the government 's critics say it has made matters worse with an anti-corruption drive that has led to the closure of many unofficial rice supply outlets closed down .
philippines once self-sufficient in rice , the philippines is listed by the us department of agriculture as the world 's top importer of milled rice for 2007 , ahead of nigeria , indonesia and bangladesh .
over the past 20 years or so , the country lost nearly half of its irrigated land to rapid urban development .
rice prices hit philippines poor domestic demand has risen as the population has grown , pushing up prices .
with rice stocks low , the government has been negotiating with neighbouring countries to secure imports , signing a deal with vietnam and working for another one with thailand .
fears of public unrest have been growing .
communist guerrillas recently burnt a rice trader 's vehicles in the central island of panay .
president gloria arroyo has asked authorities to crack down on hoarders .
officials have said they could be charged with economic sabotage - a crime that carries a life sentence .
there have also been efforts to reduce consumption .
some of the country 's fast-food chains are offering half portions of rice at the government 's request .
the government has also asked the public to save leftover rice .
troops have been called in to protect deliveries of rice to poor areas , while farmers have reportedly begun guarding their crops .
some government critics say it has not done enough , and members of the influential may first labour movement have been holding small-scale demonstrations in various parts of the country .
but others say the ms arroyo has overreacted , creating unnecessary panic .
thailand thailand has long been the world 's largest exporter of rice , well ahead of vietnam and the us .
it has not yet placed any restrictions on exports , and has denied reports that it is considering taking this step .
however , some rice millers and traders who deal on forward contracts have been suffering , after being caught out by price fluctuations .
exporters have even complained that they would prefer to have stable prices than high prices .
some millers have hoarded rice in an attempt to earn higher profits later on , pushing prices higher still as they restrict supply .
the government has released some of its 2.1 million tonnes of stockpiled rice in an attempt to contain inflation .
it has also said it will enforce a rule that exporters set aside at least 500 tonnes of rice to prevent shortages .
rice prices increased by more than 50 % last year and have doubled since the beginning of 2008 .
while in some countries rice consumption has risen with prosperity , thais have been eating a greater variety of foods and less rice as they have become wealthier .
china chinese consumers have been have been eating less rice as their income has risen , according to the fao .
instead , they have been switching to meat and dairy products .
china has large rice reserves , though pressures on farming are growing but the government , highly conscious of social or political tensions caused by food inflation , has moved to protect consumers by restricting exports .
chinese prime minister wen jiabao said this week that china has an " abundant " supply of rice to feed its population of more than 1.3 billion .
china had stockpiled about 40-50 million tonnes of rice , he said .
though china is not one of the top rice exporters , export restrictions can have a big impact on importers including north korea , which buys rice from china at very low prices as it tries to cope with frequent food shortages .
though short term supplies are secured , there are concerns that urbanisation and industrial development are putting pressure on farming .
japan rice is thought to have been produced for more than 2,500 years in japan , where it was once seen as so important that it was worshipped as a god .
instead of importing rice , japan heavily subsidises its rice farmers , paying them as much as four times the market price and restricting imports .
this policy is defended by a farming community with considerable political weight , and many japanese agree home-grown rice tastes best .
food security is seen as politically important and the country keeps a large stockpile of rice - even though it is probably wealthy enough to buy on the international market even if prices continue to rise .
its scientists are already looking for varieties that will be resistant to higher temperatures caused by climate change .
japan trades relatively small quantities and has little impact on the international market .

over the last year , prices have nearly doubled to about 35 taka -lrb- 50 cents -rrb- , while there has been no corresponding increase in wages .
hundreds of poor families are now surviving on one meal a day , and spending 70-80 % of their budget on food .
the problem is most acute in urban areas where aid agencies say they are very concerned about infant malnourishment .
local factors have contributed to the price rise .
bangladesh has been hit by severe flooding twice in the last year and a devastating cyclone in november .
the government is giving rice away to 2.6 million people and supplying some families at discounted prices .
it has had to import four million tonnes of rice from india over the last six months - more than double the usual amount .
but the government 's critics say it has made matters worse with an anti-corruption drive that has led to the closure of many unofficial rice supply outlets closed down .
philippines once self-sufficient in rice , the philippines is listed by the us department of agriculture as the world 's top importer of milled rice for 2007 , ahead of nigeria , indonesia and bangladesh .
over the past 20 years or so , the country lost nearly half of its irrigated land to rapid urban development .
rice prices hit philippines poor domestic demand has risen as the population has grown , pushing up prices .
with rice stocks low , the government has been negotiating with neighbouring countries to secure imports , signing a deal with vietnam and working for another one with thailand .
fears of public unrest have been growing .
communist guerrillas recently burnt a rice trader 's vehicles in the central island of panay .
president gloria arroyo has asked authorities to crack down on hoarders .
officials have said they could be charged with economic sabotage - a crime that carries a life sentence .
there have also been efforts to reduce consumption .
some of the country 's fast-food chains are offering half portions of rice at the government 's request .
the government has also asked the public to save leftover rice .
troops have been called in to protect deliveries of rice to poor areas , while farmers have reportedly begun guarding their crops .
some government critics say it has not done enough , and members of the influential may first labour movement have been holding small-scale demonstrations in various parts of the country .
but others say the ms arroyo has overreacted , creating unnecessary panic .
thailand thailand has long been the world 's largest exporter of rice , well ahead of vietnam and the us .
it has not yet placed any restrictions on exports , and has denied reports that it is considering taking this step .
however , some rice millers and traders who deal on forward contracts have been suffering , after being caught out by price fluctuations .
exporters have even complained that they would prefer to have stable prices than high prices .
some millers have hoarded rice in an attempt to earn higher profits later on , pushing prices higher still as they restrict supply .
the government has released some of its 2.1 million tonnes of stockpiled rice in an attempt to contain inflation .
it has also said it will enforce a rule that exporters set aside at least 500 tonnes of rice to prevent shortages .
rice prices increased by more than 50 % last year and have doubled since the beginning of 2008 .
while in some countries rice consumption has risen with prosperity , thais have been eating a greater variety of foods and less rice as they have become wealthier .
china chinese consumers have been have been eating less rice as their income has risen , according to the fao .
instead , they have been switching to meat and dairy products .
china has large rice reserves , though pressures on farming are growing but the government , highly conscious of social or political tensions caused by food inflation , has moved to protect consumers by restricting exports .
chinese prime minister wen jiabao said this week that china has an " abundant " supply of rice to feed its population of more than 1.3 billion .
china had stockpiled about 40-50 million tonnes of rice , he said .
though china is not one of the top rice exporters , export restrictions can have a big impact on importers including north korea , which buys rice from china at very low prices as it tries to cope with frequent food shortages .
though short term supplies are secured , there are concerns that urbanisation and industrial development are putting pressure on farming .
japan rice is thought to have been produced for more than 2,500 years in japan , where it was once seen as so important that it was worshipped as a god .
instead of importing rice , japan heavily subsidises its rice farmers , paying them as much as four times the market price and restricting imports .
this policy is defended by a farming community with considerable political weight , and many japanese agree home-grown rice tastes best .
food security is seen as politically important and the country keeps a large stockpile of rice - even though it is probably wealthy enough to buy on the international market even if prices continue to rise .
its scientists are already looking for varieties that will be resistant to higher temperatures caused by climate change .
japan trades relatively small quantities and has little impact on the international market .

the price of the staple crop has risen by as much as 70 % during the last year , according to the un food and agriculture organisation -lrb- fao -rrb- , with increases accelerating in recent weeks .
shortages have begun to hit some importing countries .
factors contributing to the price rise include : poor harvests resulting from extreme weather a rise in demand in some rice-importing countries , where populations and incomes are growing the expectation of further price increases - resulting in hoarding low stockpiles and a long term lack of agricultural investment bbc news rice day a bbc news focus on the impact of steep rises in the price of rice , staple food of 3bn people coverage on radio , tv and online from bangladesh , india , philippines , west africa and california special report : food price crisis the spike is also part of a general surge in food costs worldwide , so the option of switching to cheaper foods is often not available .
producers including india , china and vietnam have restricted exports as they try to protect their stocks and limit inflation .
importers such as bangladesh , the philippines , and afghanistan have been hit hard .
prices are expected to remain volatile , though output is likely to grow later this year as farmers in thailand and vietnam plant additional crops .
see graph showing rice production and consumption india india is the second largest rice grower in the world behind china .
with rice the staple food for 65 % of the country 's one billion plus people , much is consumed domestically .
but prices have been soaring - a shopkeeper in delhi told the bbc that the cost of one variety had increased from 12 rupees -lrb- 29 us cents -rrb- per kilogram to 16 rupees -lrb- 39 cents -rrb- in the last two months .
india rice crisis ?
rice prices in the capital rose by 20 % last year .
the government has announced a total ban on exports of non-basmati rice , in a bit to curb rising food prices , which have helped push inflation to a 13-month high .
the price for basmati rice , meanwhile , has been raised to $ 1,200 per tonne to discourage exports .
officials say as yet there is no crisis - india has more than enough reserves to feed its population .
they also say india will honour its commitments to export rice to neighbouring bangladesh .
but the international rice research institute says that the sustainability of rice farming in india and beyond is threatened by overuse of fertilisers and soil health .
stocks have come down over the last three years as agricultural growth has failed to match the rest of the economy .
and because of the low purchasing power of india 's poor , even a small increase in prices can cause a sharp fall in real incomes .

the club told fans they could guarantee themselves an fa cup final ticket by buying a season ticket for next term .
since then sales have gone through the roof , with an extra 2,000 fans buying tickets for 2008-09 , adding to the 8,000 existing season ticket holders .
a spokesman said the club had probably already gone through the 10,000 barrier of season tickets sold .
the bluebirds , who in 1927 became the only non-english club to have lifted the cup , hope to return the trophy to wales when they face portsmouth at wembley on 17 may .
more than 33,000 city fans saw the 1-0 semi-final victory over barnsley , but only 25,000 tickets will be made available to the bluebirds for the final .

the club told fans they could guarantee themselves an fa cup final ticket by buying a season ticket for next term .
since then sales have gone through the roof , with an extra 2,000 fans buying tickets for 2008-09 , adding to the 8,000 existing season ticket holders .
a spokesman said the club had probably already gone through the 10,000 barrier of season tickets sold .
the bluebirds , who in 1927 became the only non-english club to have lifted the cup , hope to return the trophy to wales when they face portsmouth at wembley on 17 may .
more than 33,000 city fans saw the 1-0 semi-final victory over barnsley , but only 25,000 tickets will be made available to the bluebirds for the final .

cardiff supporters will be housed in the west side of wembley - the opposite to where they sat for the semi-final - to ease their arrival .
" we 've probably gone through an extra 2,000 season ticket sales alone since the semi-final , " said the club spokesman on thursday .

the club 's ninian park ground has a capacity of 18,000 , but under football ticketing regulations can sell a maximum of only 16,200 seats to season ticket holders .
it already has 8,000 existing season ticket holders , who are almost all busy renewing their seats for next season , leaving approximately 8,200 available to other fans .

the club has looked to allay any fears about diehard fans missing out on the trip to wembley and following the announcement of ticket allocation details will announce full details of its ticketing policy on monday .

the cameroonian president , paul biya , has been in power for 26 years , but members of parliament voted on thursday to scrap presidential term limits and enable him to run for the presidency again in 2011 and stay in power until 2018 -lrb- or beyond -rrb- when he will be 85 .
once before parliament , the bill to remove presidential term limits was always likely to be approved - the governing party has an overwhelming majority in parliament .
the main opposition party , the social democratic front , sdf , has just 15 of the 180 and decided to boycott the debate . "
the whole issue is a complete fraud .
we do not want to legitimise it by taking part " sdf 's joseph banadzem when asked whether it would not be better to take part and put forward a case against amending the constitution , the leader of the sdf parliamentarians , joseph banadzem , told the bbc : " the whole issue is a complete fraud .
we do not want to legitimise it by taking part . "
mr banadzem predicts more disorder and violence in cameroon .
" the amendment is paving the way for very difficult times in cameroon .
" instead of working in the efforts of the general public , the regime is only concerned about one individual - president paul biya - and the effort to prolong his stay in office , " he said adding that most cameroonians oppose the change to the constitution .
bribery there is at least one lonely voice of disapproval amongst the governing cameroon people 's democratic movement -lrb- cpdm -rrb- .
paul abine ayah , an outspoken cpdm mp , slammed the bill predicting it would set the country back 200 years .
he said money was being paid to party members to encourage them to approve the bill .
the effort to extend president biya 's time in office is widely unpopular amongst cameroonians many of whom feel the politicians are not doing enough to tackle the widespread poverty .
in february , some 100 demonstrators were killed by the military and police during rioting .
although they were protesting against the high cost of living , their action was also fuelled by the speculation that presidential term limits were to be removed .
in his end of year state address , mr biya said having presidential term limits was unconstitutional and added that there were popular calls for him to stay in power .
it is no longer mere speculation - but the violent response from the security forces is likely to dissuade many cameroonians from mounting any further protests .
african precedents president biya , who came to power in 1982 , revised the constitution 12 years ago , extending the presidential term of office from five to seven years .
one of his achievements has been to oversee relative stability in a country comprising more than 200 tribes .
however past elections in cameroon have been marred by allegations of fraud and vote rigging and it would be fair to say that cameroonians have become increasingly disillusioned with the political process .
but the 75-year-old is by no means the first african president to tweak the constitution in order to stay in power .
in uganda , president yoweri museveni , moved past the 20 years in office landmark after parliament scrapped the two-term limit on the presidency in 2005 .
the move was controversial , especially after mps queued up to receive around $ 3,000 in what was regarded as an attempt to bribe them to approve the move .
after term limits were removed in chad , president idriss deby , a former army chief who seized power before winning two elections , said the change was not meant to benefit him personally .
in malawi and in zambia , former leaders bakili muluzi and frederick chiluba respectively tried and failed to change their constitutions to get a third term in office .
nigeria 's former president , olusegun obasanjo , also tried it but law makers stood firm and rejected the plan .
while all eyes are currently focused on mr mugabe and zimbabwe , cameroon receives far less attention - despite a very poor human rights record and a reputation for being one of the most corrupt countries on the continent .
observers point out that an increasingly entrenched elite which seems out of touch with the population is a recipe for instability .

the cameroonian president , paul biya , has been in power for 26 years , but members of parliament voted on thursday to scrap presidential term limits and enable him to run for the presidency again in 2011 and stay in power until 2018 -lrb- or beyond -rrb- when he will be 85 .
once before parliament , the bill to remove presidential term limits was always likely to be approved - the governing party has an overwhelming majority in parliament .
the main opposition party , the social democratic front , sdf , has just 15 of the 180 and decided to boycott the debate .
the whole issue is a complete fraud .
we do not want to legitimise it by taking part sdf 's joseph banadzem when asked whether it would not be better to take part and put forward a case against amending the constitution , the leader of the sdf parliamentarians , joseph banadzem , told the bbc : " the whole issue is a complete fraud .
we do not want to legitimise it by taking part . "
mr banadzem predicts more disorder and violence in cameroon .
" the amendment is paving the way for very difficult times in cameroon .
" instead of working in the efforts of the general public , the regime is only concerned about one individual - president paul biya - and the effort to prolong his stay in office , " he said adding that most cameroonians oppose the change to the constitution .
bribery there is at least one lonely voice of disapproval amongst the governing cameroon people 's democratic movement -lrb- cpdm -rrb- .
there have been deadly protests against the third-term issue paul abine ayah , an outspoken cpdm mp , slammed the bill predicting it would set the country back 200 years .
he said money was being paid to party members to encourage them to approve the bill .
the effort to extend president biya 's time in office is widely unpopular amongst cameroonians many of whom feel the politicians are not doing enough to tackle the widespread poverty .
in february , some 100 demonstrators were killed by the military and police during rioting .
although they were protesting against the high cost of living , their action was also fuelled by the speculation that presidential term limits were to be removed .
in his end of year state address , mr biya said having presidential term limits was unconstitutional and added that there were popular calls for him to stay in power .
it is no longer mere speculation - but the violent response from the security forces is likely to dissuade many cameroonians from mounting any further protests .
african precedents president biya , who came to power in 1982 , revised the constitution 12 years ago , extending the presidential term of office from five to seven years .
mr museveni successfully changed the constitution to allow him to run again one of his achievements has been to oversee relative stability in a country comprising more than 200 tribes .
however past elections in cameroon have been marred by allegations of fraud and vote rigging and it would be fair to say that cameroonians have become increasingly disillusioned with the political process .
but the 75-year-old is by no means the first african president to tweak the constitution in order to stay in power .
in uganda , president yoweri museveni , moved past the 20 years in office landmark after parliament scrapped the two-term limit on the presidency in 2005 .
the move was controversial , especially after mps queued up to receive around $ 3,000 in what was regarded as an attempt to bribe them to approve the move .
after term limits were removed in chad , president idriss deby , a former army chief who seized power before winning two elections , said the change was not meant to benefit him personally .
in malawi and in zambia , former leaders bakili muluzi and frederick chiluba respectively tried and failed to change their constitutions to get a third term in office .
nigeria 's former president , olusegun obasanjo , also tried it but law makers stood firm and rejected the plan .
while all eyes are currently focused on mr mugabe and zimbabwe , cameroon receives far less attention - despite a very poor human rights record and a reputation for being one of the most corrupt countries on the continent .
observers point out that an increasingly entrenched elite which seems out of touch with the population is a recipe for instability .

leatherheads marks zellweger and clooney 's first film together if its director and star was disappointed by its performance , however , he certainly did not show it during his promotional visit to london this week .
co-star renee zellweger was no less ebullient , declaring herself to be a " huge fan " of her on-screen leading man .
was it difficult , though , to be directed by a fellow actor ?
not at all , the 38-year-old told bbc news .
" when he was behind the camera he was my boss , and when he was in front of it he was my co-star .
it was seamless , " she said .
" he must have been really tired , but my only experience was it felt normal .
i was working with a talented person in both respects . "
clooney was quick to return the compliment .
" it 's fun to work with people you really like , and renee has been a good friend of mine for years , " he said .
" she also has an incredible ability to walk into a period piece and just be impeccable . "
' old-fashioned ' having just been directed by ed harris in new western appaloosa , zellweger has had more than one experience of seeing a co-star behind the camera .
so do actors make good directors ?
" in my experience , yes , " said the cold mountain oscar-winner .
the film is a romantic comedy set during the roaring twenties " they know how to communicate what it is you need to hear as an actor , in order to translate what it is they 're looking for . "
what clooney was after , she said , was a screwball comedy in the tradition of such vintage classics as the philadelphia story and his girl friday .
" he wanted to do an old-fashioned film where the storytelling was simple and witty and stylistically very different from what it is today .
" and i 'm glad , because it was a lot of fun to play around with . "
that said , the bridget jones 's diary star did find the script 's quickfire patter initially hard to master .
" you could not drop those lines , " she admitted .
" when you do , you let the air out of the balloon and all the tension between the characters is lost .
" it 's about giving as good as you get and hitting the ball back . "
arbitration set in middle america in the early days of professional american football , leatherheads tells of a struggling team facing imminent collapse .
hiring a popular college player enables dodge connolly -lrb- clooney -rrb- to stave off disaster and raise his squad 's profile .
it tells of a american football team struggling to make ends meet but it also brings him into contact with lexie littleton -lrb- zellweger -rrb- , a feisty reporter out to expose his latest recruit as a fraud .
clooney said he extensively rewrote much of duncan brantley and rick reilly 's original script and that he had zellweger in mind for the main female role .
his attempts to have a writing credit on the film , however , were dashed when the writers guild of america 's arbitration panel ruled against him .
the 46-year-old has since downgraded his membership , forfeiting his right to vote and attend meetings .
ask to clarify his position , however , he denied he bears any lasting enmity towards the union .
" it 's not an issue for me , " he told the bbc news website .
" it 's just one of those things where you go , ' if that 's the way you feel about it , perhaps i should lodge some form of protest . "
leatherheads is out in the uk on 11 april .

and inevitably they want a cut .
" it starts with them glueing over your keyhole , " explains cecile lambert , a young member of an association , addiopizzo , that aims to free the city 's shopkeepers from the tyranny of extortion payments .
" that 's a clear signal that they are looking for the pizzo . "
the pizzo - or protection money - is paid monthly and the sum is even negotiable .
if you are unable , or unwilling , to interpret the cosa nostra 's symbolic language then they are usually more than happy to make it clearer .
" you might find your shop window smashed , or even your car set on fire , " she explains .
but at last the old ways are being challenged .
cosa nostra is the name of the sicilian mafia - one of several mafias operating in southern italy .
italian government figures suggest that 70 % of all sicilian businesses - from the scruffiest tobacconist on the street corner to a multinational exporter - pay some money into the mafia 's racket .
it has taken years for politicians and business leaders even to openly acknowledge that what locals call " the system " even exists .
secret society one of former prime minister silvio berlusconi 's fiercest critics , marco travaglio , suggests that the mafia has always been the elephant in the room of italian politics .
" these issues are hidden up in the attic , like slightly mad relatives - they are never mentioned , " he says .
palermo 's traditional tolerance of mafia intimidation may be ending " it was thought that whoever talks about fighting the mafia ... scares a certain segment of the electorate , and that it smacks of extremism .
there is this misunderstood moderation , which is actually appeasement .
in reality , if you do n't talk about the mafia , it is because you want mafia votes . "
but the success of grassroots movements like addiopizzo has changed that .
it is led by a generation whose adolescence was punctured by the multiple murders of anti-mafia judges , journalists and entrepreneurs .
the cosa nostra has also suffered a series of wounding blows , including the arrest of several high-profile bosses who had spent years on the run - bernardo provenzano and salvatore lo piccolo .
centre-left candidate walter veltroni has now spoken of being part of " a political force which will destroy the criminality that saps energy from this land " and mr berlusconi has said his party is " incompatible " with the mafia , pointing to the series of arrests during his time in office .
angelino alfano , a 37-year-old mp within mr berlusconi 's people of freedom alliance says the sea-change on the streets of palermo , with companies refusing to pay into the racket , represents " the end of an era of fear . "
" too many firms still pay the pizzo , but there has been a massive rebellion .
a lot of companies have decided to trust the state and believe the state will protect them . "
the work of the city 's committed young people has been matched by powerful industrial associations , like confindustria , which has thrown its weight behind the campaign , announcing six months ago that any of its members found to be paying the pizzo would be thrown out .
" the pizzo in sicily became a sort of social custom , it was accepted , " says the president of confindustria , ivan lo bello .
" now there is a sort of social shame attached , the perception has changed . "
olive oil and cloth caps in a side-street of old palermo , where dark alleys open on to piazzas planted with palm trees , 29-year-old fabio messina helps run the first anti-mafia emporium .
a young sicilian couple sell mafia-free merchandise its walls are painted orange and its shelves are stacked with sicily 's famous nero d 'avola wine , olive oil and organic pasta .
all the products come either from land confiscated from the mafia , or have been made by producers , artisans or importers who have refused to pay up .
" this used to be the type of cap often worn by mafiosi , they 'd wear it straight , like this , " mr messina says of the brightly coloured caps near the entrance , pulling one over his unruly hair .
" but the company is called la coppola storta -lrb- jaunty cap -rrb- because we wear it differently , at an angle .
it 's about reclaiming and re-interpreting a symbol , giving it a positive meaning . "
addiopizzo is a resolutely apolitical organisation set up in 2004 which offers practical , psychological and legal support to shopkeepers and local businesses who decide to say no .
so far , more than 250 businesses have signed up and the numbers continue to grow .
they also take their message about the importance of playing by state rules directly into classrooms , receiving some funding from the education ministry for these projects .
" customers like the fact that , in this shop , they can actually make a statement each time they buy a product , " mr messina says .
' dear extortionist ' one of the first to refuse to pay protection money in palermo was libero , the late husband of 79-year-old pina grassi .
restaurant boss fabio conticello refused to be bullied by the mafia her son manages an offshoot of a family-run textiles firm whose spectacular success throughout the 1980s and 1990s had the mafiosi circling like flies .
of the gradually escalating threats she received , one stands out in her memory : " once , they stole our dog , " she remembers .
" he was dumped later at the gates of our factory - skin and bone , almost starved to death . "
refusing to accept the idea that the company he had created would enrich people who refused to work , libero grassi wrote an open letter to the giornale di sicilia , the local newspaper .
published on the front page in august 1991 , it was addressed to an anonymous " dear extortionist " .
it caused a sensation but , barely three weeks later , libero was dead .
" he was going to open the factory again after the summer break , " mrs grassi recounts .
" he left the house at 0730 in the morning .
they knew he was coming .
they shot him five times from a car . "
now , saying no to the racket is far less risky , thanks to what mrs grassi calls the " collective conscience " of the young people of addiopizzo .
yet it remains an act of defiance .
" it 's been a very long road to get here , " says fabio conticello , the owner of the foccaceria san francesco .
people are busy tucking into traditional palermo street food and his establishment 's speciality - la milza , or sliced lung and intestines , cooked in lard , topped with salty cheese and served in a bap .
it might not sound too tempting but the mafia were soon licking their lips .
" a man came to the restaurant and said , ' well , you know why i 'm here ' .
he wanted some protection money .
i thought about it briefly and then we said no .
" the man was shocked , nobody says ' no ' .
he even started trying to negotiate a price with us .
we just repeated : ' no , we 're not paying ' . "
his family had noted down the number of his scooter and , with the help of the palermo police , they managed to unravel the whole of the cosa nostra 's local network and the rest of his gang .
as we turn to leave the old part of the city , andrea cottone , of addiopizzo , reminds us of a quotation from one of sicily 's most famous writers : " everything must change so that things can stay the same " .
his organisation might have proven the writer giuseppe tomasi di lampedusa wrong .

and inevitably they want a cut .
" it starts with them glueing over your keyhole , " explains cecile lambert , a young member of an association , addiopizzo , that aims to free the city 's shopkeepers from the tyranny of extortion payments .
" that 's a clear signal that they are looking for the pizzo . "
the pizzo - or protection money - is paid monthly and the sum is even negotiable .
if you are unable , or unwilling , to interpret the cosa nostra 's symbolic language then they are usually more than happy to make it clearer .
" you might find your shop window smashed , or even your car set on fire , " she explains .
but at last the old ways are being challenged .
cosa nostra is the name of the sicilian mafia - one of several mafias operating in southern italy .
italian government figures suggest that 70 % of all sicilian businesses - from the scruffiest tobacconist on the street corner to a multinational exporter - pay some money into the mafia 's racket .
it has taken years for politicians and business leaders even to openly acknowledge that what locals call " the system " even exists .
secret society one of former prime minister silvio berlusconi 's fiercest critics , marco travaglio , suggests that the mafia has always been the elephant in the room of italian politics .
" these issues are hidden up in the attic , like slightly mad relatives - they are never mentioned , " he says .
palermo 's traditional tolerance of mafia intimidation may be ending " it was thought that whoever talks about fighting the mafia ... scares a certain segment of the electorate , and that it smacks of extremism .
there is this misunderstood moderation , which is actually appeasement .
in reality , if you do n't talk about the mafia , it is because you want mafia votes . "
but the success of grassroots movements like addiopizzo has changed that .
it is led by a generation whose adolescence was punctured by the multiple murders of anti-mafia judges , journalists and entrepreneurs .
the cosa nostra has also suffered a series of wounding blows , including the arrest of several high-profile bosses who had spent years on the run - bernardo provenzano and salvatore lo piccolo .
centre-left candidate walter veltroni has now spoken of being part of " a political force which will destroy the criminality that saps energy from this land " and mr berlusconi has said his party is " incompatible " with the mafia , pointing to the series of arrests during his time in office .
angelino alfano , a 37-year-old mp within mr berlusconi 's people of freedom alliance says the sea-change on the streets of palermo , with companies refusing to pay into the racket , represents " the end of an era of fear . "
" too many firms still pay the pizzo , but there has been a massive rebellion .
a lot of companies have decided to trust the state and believe the state will protect them . "
the work of the city 's committed young people has been matched by powerful industrial associations , like confindustria , which has thrown its weight behind the campaign , announcing six months ago that any of its members found to be paying the pizzo would be thrown out .
" the pizzo in sicily became a sort of social custom , it was accepted , " says the president of confindustria , ivan lo bello .
" now there is a sort of social shame attached , the perception has changed . "
olive oil and cloth caps in a side-street of old palermo , where dark alleys open on to piazzas planted with palm trees , 29-year-old fabio messina helps run the first anti-mafia emporium .
a young sicilian couple sell mafia-free merchandise its walls are painted orange and its shelves are stacked with sicily 's famous nero d 'avola wine , olive oil and organic pasta .
all the products come either from land confiscated from the mafia , or have been made by producers , artisans or importers who have refused to pay up .
" this used to be the type of cap often worn by mafiosi , they 'd wear it straight , like this , " mr messina says of the brightly coloured caps near the entrance , pulling one over his unruly hair .
" but the company is called la coppola storta -lrb- jaunty cap -rrb- because we wear it differently , at an angle .
it 's about reclaiming and re-interpreting a symbol , giving it a positive meaning . "
addiopizzo is a resolutely apolitical organisation set up in 2004 which offers practical , psychological and legal support to shopkeepers and local businesses who decide to say no .
so far , more than 250 businesses have signed up and the numbers continue to grow .
they also take their message about the importance of playing by state rules directly into classrooms , receiving some funding from the education ministry for these projects .
" customers like the fact that , in this shop , they can actually make a statement each time they buy a product , " mr messina says .

10 ways the bbc is not responsible for the content of external internet sites .
there are many different ways to look at art , both literally and figuratively speaking .
this site is from getty images - one of the best known image banks in the world - and they have presented for our cultural pleasure , 10 ways .
this is a simply awe-inspiring website , filled to the brim with stunning images and ways to explore them through 10 separate , uniquely structured virtual paths .
it is a site you will get lost in as you wander through the immense collection - and do not let the opening graphics fool you - this is one highly sophisticated piece of web design .
click the opening image to enter the sub menus , split into categories such as light , information , memory , space , time and emotion .
clicking a sub menu takes you to a page displaying the two exhibits in that section .
each exhibit can be launched into a new window and then you are free to interact with the contents and discover what is inside .
i can not tell you which exhibit to visit first as they are all amazing .
from the never ending journey of images in information , to the engrossing interactions that allow you to measure your emotions pictorially in emotion .
all brilliantly presented and beautifully created .
well done getty , a real winner this one .
make magazine the bbc is not responsible for the content of external internet sites .
if you prefer more of a hands-on approach why not check out this website ?
it is from a magazine called make , which aims to bring the do-it-yourself mindset to all the technology in your life - yes it is a little geeky , but hey , it is chic to be geek !
the magazine itself is in an online format , videos and podcasts , projects and of course the obligatory community with a relatively quiet forum which is none-the-less an interesting read .
all sections are well worth exploring , but i want to drag your attention to the videos and podcasts .
here you will find a quirky selection of weekend projects you can do at home - such as making your own pda notebook out of some quite unexpected materials .
click the video link at the top to launch the video section .
you can now browse the videos using the navigation panel on the left .
i really like the learn to laser graffiti video - which teaches you to tag buildings in a totally non-destructive way .
not sure i will ever do it - but the guys who present it are fun .
the it room the bbc is not responsible for the content of external internet sites .
home grown mini-series are becoming more and more the rage at the moment and you will find a fine example here .
this site is kind of off-the-wall and might not appeal to everyone .
but if you have a quirky sense of humour and do not mind laughing at yourself , you should have plenty of fun exploring these pages .
the site 's creators basically make mini episodes , which are part comedy , part drama and many of them based on stories submitted by real visitors to the site .
there is a selection of popular episodes displayed on the opening page .
just click the link below the thumbnail to launch the player .
you can vote on the episodes and comment on them too if you fancy .
or why not use the tab at the top to write a story of your own on which future episodes might be based ?
screaming bee the bbc is not responsible for the content of external internet sites .
ever heard your voice on a recording , like an answerphone message , and thought : " i do n't sound like that , do i ? "
people rarely like the way their voice sounds when they hear it played back - well with our next piece of free software you can do something about that .
point your browser to screaming bee and download the free version of morphvox , which is the junior edition .
no registration needed and the set-up is very simple .
the software will step you through an optimisation process on installation , and then you can start playing around with the sounds .
you will need a microphone installed , for obvious reasons , and the free version comes with three basic voice types : male , female and little people .
if you want more options you can download additional voice packs but you will need the pro edition which is not free after the trial period .
this software is simply a bit of fun - though it can be used in conjunction with any voice communication programme you use - such as ventrilo or teamspeak - which are popular with the online gaming community .

10 ways the bbc is not responsible for the content of external internet sites .
there are many different ways to look at art , both literally and figuratively speaking .
this site is from getty images - one of the best known image banks in the world - and they have presented for our cultural pleasure , 10 ways .
this is a simply awe-inspiring website , filled to the brim with stunning images and ways to explore them through 10 separate , uniquely structured virtual paths .
it is a site you will get lost in as you wander through the immense collection - and do not let the opening graphics fool you - this is one highly sophisticated piece of web design .
click the opening image to enter the sub menus , split into categories such as light , information , memory , space , time and emotion .
clicking a sub menu takes you to a page displaying the two exhibits in that section .
each exhibit can be launched into a new window and then you are free to interact with the contents and discover what is inside .
i can not tell you which exhibit to visit first as they are all amazing .
from the never ending journey of images in information , to the engrossing interactions that allow you to measure your emotions pictorially in emotion .
all brilliantly presented and beautifully created .
well done getty , a real winner this one .
make magazine the bbc is not responsible for the content of external internet sites .
if you prefer more of a hands-on approach why not check out this website ?
it is from a magazine called make , which aims to bring the do-it-yourself mindset to all the technology in your life - yes it is a little geeky , but hey , it is chic to be geek !
the magazine itself is in an online format , videos and podcasts , projects and of course the obligatory community with a relatively quiet forum which is none-the-less an interesting read .
all sections are well worth exploring , but i want to drag your attention to the videos and podcasts .
here you will find a quirky selection of weekend projects you can do at home - such as making your own pda notebook out of some quite unexpected materials .
click the video link at the top to launch the video section .
you can now browse the videos using the navigation panel on the left .
i really like the learn to laser graffiti video - which teaches you to tag buildings in a totally non-destructive way .
not sure i will ever do it - but the guys who present it are fun .
the it room the bbc is not responsible for the content of external internet sites .
home grown mini-series are becoming more and more the rage at the moment and you will find a fine example here .
this site is kind of off-the-wall and might not appeal to everyone .
but if you have a quirky sense of humour and do not mind laughing at yourself , you should have plenty of fun exploring these pages .
the site 's creators basically make mini episodes , which are part comedy , part drama and many of them based on stories submitted by real visitors to the site .
there is a selection of popular episodes displayed on the opening page .
just click the link below the thumbnail to launch the player .
you can vote on the episodes and comment on them too if you fancy .

ever heard your voice on a recording , like an answerphone message , and thought : " i do n't sound like that , do i ? "
people rarely like the way their voice sounds when they hear it played back - well with our next piece of free software you can do something about that .
point your browser to screaming bee and download the free version of morphvox , which is the junior edition .
no registration needed and the set-up is very simple .
the software will step you through an optimisation process on installation , and then you can start playing around with the sounds .
you will need a microphone installed , for obvious reasons , and the free version comes with three basic voice types : male , female and little people .
if you want more options you can download additional voice packs but you will need the pro edition which is not free after the trial period .
this software is simply a bit of fun - though it can be used in conjunction with any voice communication programme you use - such as ventrilo or teamspeak - which are popular with the online gaming community .

page last updated at 09:09 gmt , friday , 11 april 2008 10:09 uk e-mail this to a friend printable version webscape by kate russell click webscape-r kate russell gives us her latest selection of the best sites on the world wide web .
10 ways the bbc is not responsible for the content of external internet sites .
there are many different ways to look at art , both literally and figuratively speaking .
this site is from getty images - one of the best known image banks in the world - and they have presented for our cultural pleasure , 10 ways .
this is a simply awe-inspiring website , filled to the brim with stunning images and ways to explore them through 10 separate , uniquely structured virtual paths .
it is a site you will get lost in as you wander through the immense collection - and do not let the opening graphics fool you - this is one highly sophisticated piece of web design .
click the opening image to enter the sub menus , split into categories such as light , information , memory , space , time and emotion .
clicking a sub menu takes you to a page displaying the two exhibits in that section .
each exhibit can be launched into a new window and then you are free to interact with the contents and discover what is inside .
i can not tell you which exhibit to visit first as they are all amazing .
from the never ending journey of images in information , to the engrossing interactions that allow you to measure your emotions pictorially in emotion .
all brilliantly presented and beautifully created .
well done getty , a real winner this one .
make magazine the bbc is not responsible for the content of external internet sites .
if you prefer more of a hands-on approach why not check out this website ?
it is from a magazine called make , which aims to bring the do-it-yourself mindset to all the technology in your life - yes it is a little geeky , but hey , it is chic to be geek !
the magazine itself is in an online format , videos and podcasts , projects and of course the obligatory community with a relatively quiet forum which is none-the-less an interesting read .
all sections are well worth exploring , but i want to drag your attention to the videos and podcasts .
here you will find a quirky selection of weekend projects you can do at home - such as making your own pda notebook out of some quite unexpected materials .
click the video link at the top to launch the video section .
you can now browse the videos using the navigation panel on the left .
i really like the learn to laser graffiti video - which teaches you to tag buildings in a totally non-destructive way .
not sure i will ever do it - but the guys who present it are fun .
the it room the bbc is not responsible for the content of external internet sites .
home grown mini-series are becoming more and more the rage at the moment and you will find a fine example here .
this site is kind of off-the-wall and might not appeal to everyone .
but if you have a quirky sense of humour and do not mind laughing at yourself , you should have plenty of fun exploring these pages .
the site 's creators basically make mini episodes , which are part comedy , part drama and many of them based on stories submitted by real visitors to the site .
there is a selection of popular episodes displayed on the opening page .
just click the link below the thumbnail to launch the player .
you can vote on the episodes and comment on them too if you fancy .

the british medical journal study also showed they were more likely to stop breastfeeding sooner .
the institute of child health team said doctors should not assume ethnic minority women did not smoke or drink .
a maternal health expert said it was " sad " that unhealthy habits became normal among immigrant groups .
the research looked at women taking part in the millennium cohort study who had babies between september 2000 and january 2002 .
in 2001-02 , 7.6 % of the population was from an ethnic minority group - up 44 % during the previous decade .
women from ethnic minority groups are known to be less likely to smoke or consume alcohol than the general population , but the researchers looked at how living in a westernised society affected their habits .

she said higher incomes , exposure to advertising , integration into western societies and higher smoking and drinking rates amongst immigrant males could all affect the numbers of ethnic minority women who smoke and drank .

sunk in the 1950s close to the shores of the pentland firth , it plunges 65.4m below the surface and has an average diameter of 4.6m.
local legend tells of a worker putting an urn containing his mother-in-law 's ashes into the shaft .
a car was also allegedly rolled in .
what is known is that radioactive waste was disposed there from 1959 to 1977 , when an explosion ended the practice .
work is well under way on the lengthy process of safely sealing the shaft before removing the hazardous rubbish .
the shaft isolation project -lrb- sip -rrb- team has been working on a solution for a unique problem . "
this sort of grouting - because of the very fine cracks and use of very fine cement around a nuclear shaft - is unique " john whitfield shaft isolation project what looks like a concrete bunker has been built over the top of the shaft , but the most challenging operation has been creating a barrier around its entire length to stop water seeping inside through minute fissures in the surrounding rock .
technology usually used to protect road tunnels in scandinavia has been applied to the project .
engineers have sunk about 200 boreholes to a depth of 80m , before injecting a fine grout at high pressure into the holes .
john whitfield , project engineer on the sip , said the technique could be used in the construction of a nuclear waste repository in finland .
swedish tunnel builders have also been watching the operation with interest .
mr whitfield said : " we are in the final stages of the construction and we are getting into testing the isolation barrier .
" we are trying to drastically reduce the amount of water getting through the cracks in rock around the shaft so that when the waste is taken out the amount of water that flows in will be much , much smaller .
" it will leave us with the sort of amount of water we can treat so we do n't have to spend a lot of money on water treatment . "
he added : " grouting generally is used throughout the civil engineering industry , but this sort of grouting - because of the very fine cracks and use of very fine cement around a nuclear shaft - is unique . "
the sip team is gearing up to test the barrier , but it will be 25 years before the clean-up operation will see the shaft finally give up its secrets .

workers at dounreay walk around what were the nuclear site 's most active areas with familiarity .
but cautious of potential radioactive contamination , precautions are taken whenever entering and leaving the reactor sites .
overalls , hard hats , protective glasses and footwear must be donned .
to go inside the famous sphere , or golf ball , of the dounreay fast reactor -lrb- dfr -rrb- , the change of clothes is made at an area called the barrier .
leaving involves a routine of stepping into radioactivity detection booths , hand washing and removing protective clothing .
a metal plaque on the way through to the 41m -lrb- 134ft -rrb- diameter structure looks out of place amid the high technology being used in the clean-up of the site .
but the acknowledgement of the motherwell bridge & engineering company is a reminder of the site 's roots in the rush to harness nuclear power in the 1950s .
the major lesson we 've probably learned , if we build fast reactors again in this country , is to put a tap at the bottom of the reactor to drain the sodium billy husband senior project manager another relic of 50 years ago is the massive goliath crane .
one of the first polar cranes in the world , it can rotate within the confines of the sphere .
again , it would look more at home in a clyde shipyard .
the dfr provided the uk testbed to develop fuel technology for the national fast reactor programme .
the sphere was constructed as a secondary level of containment in the event that dangerous gases were released in an accident .
operations ceased in 1977 and a gleaming and intricate network of pipes are involved in cleaning the reactor , which is enclosed in a concrete vault .
according to staff , a rumble can occasionally be felt from below as a result of the cleaning and decontamination processes .
on one edge of the sphere is the former escape route in event of an accident , while on another , a humble cabin has walls covered with complicated schematics of the plant .
an adjoining office block houses the dfr control room .
it is a blast from the past - a suite of retro dials and knobs in yellow and black .
the large rectangular building of the prototype fast reactor -lrb- pfr -rrb- could be branded boring when compared to the nearby dfr .
inside , however , is a cavernous hall housing its reactor , most of which sits below ground .
removing hundreds of tonnes of sodium which once flowed in its circuits proved to be one of the toughest challenges for the decommissioning project .
the special camera for going inside the prototype fast reactor enlarge image a 1ft-long pump and 9 " -long camera were specially designed and manufactured to suck out the last five tonnes that remained in the bottom of the reactor vessel .
it was developed at t3uk , a facility at janetstown on the outskirts of thurso .
billy husband , senior project manager at pfr , spoke proudly of the inventions .
he said : " the pump and camera had to go down 18m into the vessel to suck the sodium out .
" the sodium was at 200c , but the camera was only good at 60c so we had to cool it down with nitrogen gas .
" it took a very complex design to do that and we have applied for a patent for the technology we have basically invented . "
mr husband added : " it was a very complex path to put it down into the reactor because of the innards of the reactor itself .
" the major lesson we 've probably learned , if we build fast reactors again in this country , is to put a tap at the bottom of the reactor to drain the sodium out because that would have made life so much simpler for us . "
